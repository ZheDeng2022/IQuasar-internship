  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are at high risk of developmental delay or disabilities and they do benefit&#xD;
      from early intervention programs. Many programs aiming at improving preterm infants'&#xD;
      developmental outcome have been proposed with mixed results. In low to middle-income&#xD;
      countries, clinically relevant and effective low cost interventions empowering parents have&#xD;
      yet to be established.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Education and intervention programs targeting parents of premature infants are lacking in low&#xD;
      to middle income countries (LMIC) and in Arabic countries in particular. The main concept of&#xD;
      this proposal is to develop a program in Arabic for parents of premature infants with the aim&#xD;
      to increase their knowledge about short and long term problems of prematurity, increase their&#xD;
      involvement in the care during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and&#xD;
      promote responsive and sensitive parenting in the NICU and after discharge. This is to&#xD;
      empower parents and have them become active contributors to enhancing their infant's&#xD;
      development through play activities and tracking of developmental milestones.&#xD;

    <description>The developmental outcome of preterm children will be assessed using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire at 9 months of corrected age.&#xD;
The ASQ-3 covers 5 area of child development : Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Problem Solving, Personal-Social, Communication.&#xD;
Scores for each area should range between minimum 0 and maximum 60. Higher scores indicate that the child is developing properly.</description>

    <description>Behavioral state will be assessed by a cerified trained developmental specialist using a 7-point score that include: (i) Quiet/deep sleep, (ii) Active sleep, (iii) Awake State, (iv) drowsy, (v) quiet alert, (vi) active alert, (vii) crying</description>

    <measure>Parental stress</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Arabic parenting stress index short form questionnaire will be used. The PSI-SF is a self-administered questionnaire and consists of 36 items divided into three subscales of 12 items each: parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction and difficult child.&#xD;
For each subscales scores ranges should be between 12 and 60. For the total stress score , the minimum score is 36 and the maximum is 180. Higher scores mean more depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>A questionnaire derived from the UNICEF MICS 6 questionnaire will be used. MICS or &quot;MULTIPLE INDICATOR CLUSTER SURVEY&quot; is a tool used to assess the activities of parents with their infants.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Maternal Parenting Self-Efficacy questionnaire is a standardized valid and reliable instrument to assess parent's perceptions of their ability to care for their infants.&#xD;
PMP-SE is composed of 20 items divided into four subscales: care taking procedures, evoking behaviours, reading behaviours or signalling, and situational beliefs.&#xD;
Those items are formulated as statements using a five-point Likert scale. Scoring ranges from 20 to 80 where a higher score indicates a higher self-efficacy.</description>
