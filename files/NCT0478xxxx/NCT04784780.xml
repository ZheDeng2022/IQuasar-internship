    <textblock>
      In this double-blind comparative study, AJG533 (elobixibat) 10 mg or AJG533 placebo was&#xD;
      orally administered once daily before meals for 12 weeks in patients with chronic&#xD;
      constipation, and the primary endpoint was the change from Week 2 of the observation period&#xD;
      in the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM) at Week 12 of the treatment&#xD;
      period. The primary endpoint was the change in the number of complete spontaneous bowel&#xD;
      movements (CSBM) from Week 2 of the observation period.&#xD;
