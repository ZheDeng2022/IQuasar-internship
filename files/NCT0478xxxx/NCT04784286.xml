  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial that will randomize bariatric patients undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to receive either&#xD;
      in-person or telemedicine post-operative follow-up within 30 days after surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Our current bariatric practice: Bariatric surgery patients are expected to follow up with the&#xD;
      bariatric surgery midlevel providers as well as with dietitians within 30-days after their&#xD;
      bariatric procedure. The bariatric surgery midlevel providers are staffed and supported by&#xD;
      our bariatric surgeons in case if they have questions or concerns. Patients do not get billed&#xD;
      for post-operative visits within 90-days of global surgery period; the same global surgery&#xD;
      rules apply to both in-person and telemedicine visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are required to follow-up after surgery as part of the Metabolic and Bariatric&#xD;
      Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult (â‰¥ 18 year-old) participants in the study will undergo primary Roux-en Y gastric bypass&#xD;
      or sleeve gastrectomy and will randomized to telemedicine or in-person visit before their&#xD;
      surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who encounter unexpected intra-operative or post-operative complication or&#xD;
      unexpected hospital course may not be offered telemedicine visits but will be included in our&#xD;
      analysis. The performing surgeon will determine if a patient is illegible for telemedicine&#xD;
      visit if unexpected course was encountered. However, analysis will be analysis to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be contacted via telephone and will be surveyed about their&#xD;
      post-operative care visits within 7-14 days after that visit, which is typically performed&#xD;
      within 30-days after surgery. The survey will be developed in coordination with the Mayo&#xD;
      Clinic Research Survey Center and will focus on the following aspects: baseline familiarity&#xD;
      with technology, patients' satisfaction with the post-operative care they received, patients'&#xD;
      preference of in-person vs telemedicine visits, patients' estimation of additional costs for&#xD;
      their care outside of the direct medical costs, along with an open question that will ask&#xD;
      patients to provide comments and feedback about their overall experience with their follow-up&#xD;
      appointment.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The randomized assignments (2 arms) will be generated by an analyst/statistician using a Mayo Clinic statistical application. The research assistant/coordinator will issue the next in a series of sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes containing the group assignment. The envelope will have information regarding the treatment assignment and will be entered into a database by the study coordinator.</masking_description>

    <description>This will be addressed by asking the following question in the survey:&#xD;
How likely or unlikely would you be to accept an invitation to meet with your bariatric provider via video call from your home when you do not need new labs/imaging, your physician can review outside labs/imaging, and no physical exam/procedure is needed?</description>

    <description>The Center for Connected Care will arrange for 30-day post-op telemedicine visits via a secured video application. When there is a telemedicine visit, the Center of Connected Care will connect the patient and then page the midlevel provider and dietitian after the electronic rooming process is complete &amp; the patient is ready.&#xD;
A survey about post-operative care visits within 7-14 days after that visit. The survey will focus on the following aspects: baseline familiarity with technology, patients' satisfaction with the post-op care they received, patients' preference of in-person vs telemedicine visits, patients' estimation of additional costs for care outside of the direct medical costs, along with an open question asking for comments &amp; feedback about their overall experience with their follow-up appointment.</description>
