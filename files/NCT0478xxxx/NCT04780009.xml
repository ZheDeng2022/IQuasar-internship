  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) are the most common primary&#xD;
      malignant brain tumors. Survival of patients with these brain tumors is directly related to&#xD;
      the extent of resection. Consequently, a great deal of effort has been directed at developing&#xD;
      techniques and technologies that allow more extensive, safe resections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test a loupe-based wearable device in the clinical setting and compare its&#xD;
      accuracy with a large operative microscope to identify tumor tissues. Postoperative&#xD;
      histopathological analysis on tumor tissues will be used as gold standards for comparison.&#xD;
      The outcome from this study will be a low-cost, miniaturized, easy-to-operate, loupe-based&#xD;
      fluorescence imaging device for intraoperative guidance of brain tumor resection with the&#xD;
      same level of accuracy as the large microscope.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study to compare the measurement accuracies of a&#xD;
      wearable loupe-based device and the large microscope against the gold standards of&#xD;
      postoperative histopathological analysis on tumor tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the induction of anesthesia, patients will receive 5 mg/kg of intravenous sodium&#xD;
      5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) or fluorescein. Surgery will be performed under the guidance of&#xD;
      the operative fluorescence microscope (PENTERO with fluorescence kit + YELLOW 560, Carl&#xD;
      Zeiss) or (PENTERO 900 + BLUE 400, Carl Zeiss). The operating room light will be dimmed for&#xD;
      optimum reproduction of the fluorescent light. Tumor removal will be continued until no&#xD;
      fluorescent area is visualized. To evaluate the accuracy of the device in the identification&#xD;
      of tumor tissue, six samples will be biopsied from the tumor resection margin for each&#xD;
      patientÍ¾ three in the fluorescent area and three in the non-fluorescent area for the&#xD;
      assessment of positive and negative predictive values of the devices, respectively. These&#xD;
      biopsied tissues will be taken to the clinical pathology laboratory for the standard&#xD;
      histological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the accuracy of the two imaging systems in identifying tumor tissues, the tumor&#xD;
      resection area will be visually observed by the surgeon and video recorded using the new&#xD;
      loupe-based device at two time points (at least): immediately before and immediately after&#xD;
      tumor removal. Additional fluorescence images may be taken during surgery as long as the&#xD;
      surgical workflow is not impacted. Moreover, the four fresh biopsies (2 in the fluorescent&#xD;
      area and 2 in the non-fluorescent area) taken from the tumor margin based on the operative&#xD;
      microscope diagnosis will also be examined intraoperatively by the loupe-based device to&#xD;
      determine whether they are fluorescent or non-fluorescent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To discriminate between clear tumor tissue and the peritumoral areas, the postoperative&#xD;
      histological analysis of the biopsied samples taken from the tumor margins will be classified&#xD;
      on the basis of the current 2016 WHO classification. The neuropathologist will be blinded to&#xD;
      the fluorescence characteristics of the biopsied samples.&#xD;
