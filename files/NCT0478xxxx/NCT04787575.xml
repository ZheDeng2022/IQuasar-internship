    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicentre, randomized, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of treatment with oxygen-ozone therapy plus oral antibiotic therapy, in comparison with oral&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy alone, in the proportion of patients with resolution/improvement of signs&#xD;
      and symptoms of infection of the wound (e.g. ulcer, eschar, sore) in the target lesion after&#xD;
      14 days of treatment, in patients with infections secondary to implant of orthopaedic&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, multicentre, randomized, parallel group study. The study plan&#xD;
      will include a screening visit (Visit 1, Day -7/-3) in which patients will be screened on the&#xD;
      basis of inclusion/exclusion criteria and clinically evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 3-7 days of run-in (Visit 2, Baseline visit, Day 0), patient still eligible&#xD;
      will be randomised to one of the two following treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oxygen-ozone therapy SIOOT plus antibiotic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Antibiotic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will receive oral antibiotic therapy, which will be prescribed at&#xD;
      discretion of the Investigator, based on the results of the colture of the swab collected in&#xD;
      the target lesion at the screening visit (and later, if needed) and the associated&#xD;
      antibiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be performed after 7 days (Visit 3, Day 7), 14 days (Visit 4, Day 14),&#xD;
      28 days (Visit 5, Day 28) and 42 days (Visit 6, End of study, Day 42) from the start of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A visit window of ± 2 days for the date of Visits 3-5 and of ± 3 days for the date of Visits&#xD;
      6 will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients prematurely discontinued from the study will perform an 'Early termination visit',&#xD;
      in which procedures schedule for Visit 6 (End of study, Day 42) will be performed. In case of&#xD;
      premature study discontinuation, the Investigator will duly record the reason for premature&#xD;
      withdrawal in the appropriate section of the case report form (eCRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6, or the 'Early termination Visit' will represent the conclusion of patient's&#xD;
      participation in the investigation.&#xD;
