      DESIGN This pilot study utilizes a mixed-methods approach to develop a novel docu- drama&#xD;
      communication strategy, design WhatsApp intervention, evaluate the feasibility of a larger&#xD;
      pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the two communication strategies and assess&#xD;
      acceptability of the communication strategies aimed to increase blood donation among&#xD;
      first-time blood donors within the catchment areas of the Southern Zonal Blood Centre (SZBC)&#xD;
      in Ghana. In sequence, this pilot study and larger RCT are grounded in the PRECEDE-PROCEED&#xD;
      implementation science framework. The pilot study has four components: 1) a qualitative&#xD;
      component will be used to design a docu-drama, 2) key informant interviews to guide&#xD;
      intervention development, 3) a simultaneous randomized pilot trial will evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of the larger trial design of communication interventions using WhatsApp compared&#xD;
      to control, and 4) a final mixed- methods (quantitative survey and focus groups) assessment&#xD;
      of participant views of acceptability, effectiveness, feasibility and cultural&#xD;
      appropriateness of the two proposed communication interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The three objectives of this pilot study are the careful design of a novel docu-&#xD;
      drama communication intervention and WhatsApp intervention, evaluation of the feasibility of&#xD;
      a larger RCT of communication strategies, and assessment of participant views of the two&#xD;
      proposed communication interventions and control among first time blood donors within the&#xD;
      catchment areas of the SZBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE The total sample size for all 3 components of the pilot study is n = 182. The&#xD;
      planning of the docu-drama will involve participants who will take part in a drama design&#xD;
      workshop discussion (n=20). In addition, we will recruit n=10 first- time donors to test-run&#xD;
      and provide feedback on the docu-drama. Key informant interviews (n=24) will guide&#xD;
      intervention development. The pilot RCT will enroll n=128 first-time blood donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION The study population for the development of the docu-drama will include blood&#xD;
      donors, non-blood donors (persons 18 years and above who have never donated blood before),&#xD;
      drama professionals such as actors, and communication professionals. Key informant interviews&#xD;
      for the WhatsApp intervention are drawn from community leaders, blood donation staff, blood&#xD;
      donors and non-blood donors. The study population for the pilot RCT and acceptability&#xD;
      assessment will be only first-time voluntary non-remunerated blood donors (VNRBD) and&#xD;
      family/replacement blood donors (FRD) from the SZBC catchment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGIMEN Docu-drama pilot test run: Participants assigned to this group will meet once during&#xD;
      the intervention. Participants will be asked to watch, in the group setting, a two-episode&#xD;
      drama, each lasting 15 minutes. The docu-drama on blood donation will address their concerns&#xD;
      for donating blood again and address common donor fears. Participants will also receive&#xD;
      standard NBSG communications for first-time donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WhatsApp: Participants assigned to the WhatsApp group will receive weekly messages developed&#xD;
      by communication specialists aimed to motivate blood donation, be encouraged to discuss their&#xD;
      blood donation experiences, and share their own motivations for donating blood in a&#xD;
      moderated, closed group over a six-month duration. The moderator will provide guidelines on&#xD;
      acceptable use of WhatsApp in the group, including images they can or cannot share.&#xD;
      Participants will also receive standard NBSG communications for first-time donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: Participants in this group will receive the standard NBSG communications for&#xD;
      first-time donors: 1) a thank you phone call and 2) and a reminder phone call two-weeks prior&#xD;
      to the second blood donation eligibility. The second blood donation eligibility is four&#xD;
      months after the first donation.&#xD;
