    <textblock>
      Tineapedis is an important health problem. Providing foot care in tinea pedis treatment&#xD;
      contributes positively to the treatment. In addition, alternative treatments can also be&#xD;
      used. In this study, the randomization study group will be divided into three. Medical&#xD;
      treatment and foot care training will be applied to the first group, medical treatment and&#xD;
      propolis to the second group, medical treatment and plassebo to the control group. Foot care&#xD;
      training will be given by nurse coaching. Times of all three groups and their response to&#xD;
      treatment will be evaluated.&#xD;
