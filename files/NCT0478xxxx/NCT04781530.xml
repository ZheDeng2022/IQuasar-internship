  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Community-acquired acute respiratory tract infections (CA-ARTI) are among the&#xD;
      most frequent infectious diseases worldwide. Uncomplicated ARTI is the most frequent cause of&#xD;
      inappropriate antibiotic use, and there is a need of more judicious antibiotic prescribing to&#xD;
      prevent exposure to drug-related adverse events and selection of antibiotic resistance. There&#xD;
      is a need to assess the impact of rapid syndromic diagnostic testing in patients with CA-ARTI&#xD;
      presenting to Emergency Rooms on clinical decision making related to hospitalisation and&#xD;
      prescription of antibiotics. At the same time it must be determined whether the decisions&#xD;
      guided by the rapid syndromic diagnostic testing results do not compromise patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial objective: To assess the impact of rapid diagnostic testing in patients with ARTI at&#xD;
      the emergency department, on (1) hospital admission rates, (2) antimicrobial prescriptions&#xD;
      (days of treatment) and (3) non-inferiority in terms of clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include health care utilisation, time away from school or routine&#xD;
      childcare arrangements and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an ancillary study, changing patterns in microbiological colonisation of the oropharynx&#xD;
      following different management strategies will be assessed in a subset of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Individually randomised controlled trial, randomisation 1:1 to either a rapid&#xD;
      test group (intervention described below) or a control group, with management according to&#xD;
      standard of care at the local facility. Follow-up until discharge from hospital and&#xD;
      thereafter by telephone follow-up and self (or proxy)-completion questionnaires until 30 days&#xD;
      after randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Children of any age consulting in selected participating sites with&#xD;
      CA-ARTI, in which there is initial uncertainty about treatment and management decisions,&#xD;
      after provision of informed consent by parent(s) or legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention: The diagnostic intervention is rapid syndromic testing on a&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swab with BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2.1 plus (RP2.1plus) (licensed&#xD;
      for routine use at all trial sites), results expected within four hours from sample&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hierarchical nested analysis design of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days alive out of hospital (superiority endpoint), within 14 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days on Therapy (DOT) with antibiotics (superiority endpoint), within 14 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse outcome (non-inferiority safety endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For initially non-admitted patients: any admission or death within 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For initially hospitalized patients: any readmission, ICU admission &gt;= 24 hours&#xD;
                after hospitalization or death, all within 30 days&#xD;

                  saturation (&lt;92% in room air)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Signs of reduced general state: poor feeding, vomiting or lethargy/drowsiness&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Less than 14 days since the last episode of respiratory tract infection;&#xD;

          5. Any clinically significant abnormality identified at the time of screening that in the&#xD;
             judgment of the Investigator would preclude safe completion of the study or constrain&#xD;
             endpoints assessment such as major systemic diseases or patients with short life&#xD;
             expectancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Inability to obtain informed consent;&#xD;
