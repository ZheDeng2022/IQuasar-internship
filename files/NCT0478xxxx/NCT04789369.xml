  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankle sprain is frequently experienced by individuals participating in different sports&#xD;
      activities. Ankle sprains have been shown to result in a decrease in level of physical&#xD;
      activity and persistence of some symptoms for a long time. In this case, it is predicted that&#xD;
      ankle sprains may affect the quality of life as well as functionality. Also, ankle sprain&#xD;
      history may result in increased fear of movement, which may delay return to sports. This&#xD;
      study aimed to examine the relationship between foot and ankle functionality, fear of&#xD;
      movement and quality of life of elite athletes with a history of ankle sprain.&#xD;

    <measure>Foot and Ankle Ability Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure will be used to determine the ankle functionality. This scale was developed to determine lower extremity functional level. It evaluates the level of difficulty of the person in activities in daily life in 21 items with a 5-point Likert-type scale, which means &quot;4 = not difficult at all&quot; and &quot;0 = I cannot do it&quot;. At the same time, it can be reported within the scope of the scale that the specified activity cannot be implemented. High score means better functions.</description>

    <measure>Short Form-12</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Short-Form 12 is a valid and reliable scale for determining the level of quality of life. This scale consists of 12 items and can be scored as 8 subscales which are physical function, restricted roles due to physical problems, pain, general health, energy / vitality, social functions, mental health and mental health with restricted roles due to emotional problems. All items are evaluated with a 5-point Likert-type scale, and higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The FABQ measures athletes' fear of pain and consequent avoidance of physical activity or sports because of their increased fear. The questionnaire contains 16 items between 0 and 6 while 0 indicates completely disagree and 6 indicates completely agree. The maximum score is 96 and higher scores indicates increased level of fear avoidance beliefs.</description>
