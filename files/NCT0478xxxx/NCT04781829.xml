  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct an open-label step-wedge pilot clinical trial to&#xD;
      compare an antibiotic strategy based on routine use of a novel rapid diagnostic test to usual&#xD;
      care in critically ill adults with severe community acquired pneumonia (SCAP). We hypothesize&#xD;
      that when results from a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) are used to guide antibiotic therapy,&#xD;
      broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure will be reduced in critically ill patients with SCAP&#xD;
      without an increase in adverse events.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adults aged 18 years and older with known or suspected community-acquired pneumonia&#xD;
             who are admitted to the MICU Service&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Meets one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Have or plan to obtain a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Have or plan to obtain a quantitative endotracheal aspirate sample&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Have already produced a high-quality sputum sample if not intubated&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Primary MICU attending and fellow willing to base antibiotic therapy on results of RDT&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with confirmed extrapulmonary infection requiring antibiotics outside the&#xD;
             usual treatment for SCAP, with the exception of suspected uncomplicated urinary tract&#xD;
             infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Neutropenic fever, defined as absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/mm3 and absence of&#xD;
             infiltrate on available chest imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Chronic airway infection, defined as cystic fibrosis, lung transplant, or non-CF&#xD;
             bronchiectasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient/surrogate refusal&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Inability to perform BAL, NBBAL, quantitative ETA, or produce a high-quality sputum&#xD;
             sample prior to 48 hours from hospital admission&#xD;
