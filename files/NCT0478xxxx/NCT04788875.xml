  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the attempt to gain quick and complete access to the abdominal regions with the least&#xD;
      damage to the nerves and the vascular structures, surgeons use the median laparotomy more&#xD;
      frequently. However, postoperative complications such as incisional hernia continue to be the&#xD;
      known leading complications after median laparotomy. The reported cases to range from 2 to&#xD;
      20%. Higher cases have also been reported with up to 35% in the absence and aortic patients.&#xD;
      Recent statistics have showed that small tissue bites prevent incisional hernia can occur in&#xD;
      the aponeurosis. This technique is more effective than the commonly used process, which&#xD;
      involves large edges of mass closure. In this study investigators aim to compare small bites&#xD;
      sutures in closure of laparotomy incision and standardized large bites sutures, and its&#xD;
      affect in reducing the incidence of incisional hernia postoperative along with the surgical&#xD;
      site infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators hypothesize that the small bites technique will result in a significant&#xD;
      reduction of the incidence of incisional hernia and optimize the surgical site infection in&#xD;
      major surgeries which may lead to a reduced morbidity and a better quality of life for&#xD;
      patients and a significant reduction of costs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Incisional hernia carries with life-threatening conditions such as the incarceration of bowel&#xD;
      strangulation. However, incisional hernia remains the most common complication after median&#xD;
      laparotomy, with reported incidences varying between 2-20%. Even higher incidences up to&#xD;
      30-35% have been reported in obese and aortic aneurysm patients. Incisional hernia also&#xD;
      causes life impairment and discomfort. Median laparotomy and the incisional hernia have been&#xD;
      under investigation for quite some time, and information about patients' risk factors and&#xD;
      suture materials has been identified. However, the risk factors associated with suture&#xD;
      techniques are not yet thoroughly investigated. Many clinical tests and analyses have&#xD;
      concluded that a mass closure technique involving a simple running suture is the most&#xD;
      effective way to prevent incisional hernia and close a midline incision. The method is also&#xD;
      easy and fast to perform compared to other layered methods involving interrupted sutures. Use&#xD;
      of natural materials that are thin resorbable materials decreases the occurrence of the&#xD;
      incisional hernial and lower the intensity of preoperative pain and wound infections compared&#xD;
      to the use of suture materials that are non-resorbable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators aim to compare the small bites technique with a standardised&#xD;
      large bites technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;

        -  Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Quality of life, recovery, return to usual activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Surgical site infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Time for closure.&#xD;

      Data Collection methods, instruments used, and measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will include all patients who will had laparotomy through a midline incision&#xD;
      according to our inclusion criteria, they will be randomised using computer generated numbers&#xD;
      by using (Random.org), to either closure by small bites technique using PDS 2.0 or&#xD;
      standardised large bites technique. The surgery will be done by either a consultant or a&#xD;
      specialist following standard steps. A data sheet of each patient regarding their&#xD;
      demographic, operation data, and postoperative recovery (pain, early mobilizing, wound&#xD;
      healing, surgical site infection, retain to usual activity), then all patients will be&#xD;
      followed for 6 month and 1 year postoperative by US, the endpoint is discovering of&#xD;
      incisional hernia or not for 1 year follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SPSS will be used for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Summary statistic will be obtained as frequency, and percentage for qualitative data,&#xD;
           and means, medians and standard deviations from continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chi square test will be used to examine the significant difference of hernia rate&#xD;
           between the two study group.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our study does not have any physical, psychological, social, legal, economic risk.&#xD;
