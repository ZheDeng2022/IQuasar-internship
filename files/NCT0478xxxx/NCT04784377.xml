  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is the third most common musculoskeletal problem after lumbar and neck diseases&#xD;
      in clinical practice, and the most common cause of shoulder pain is subacromial impingement&#xD;
      syndrome (SIS). The main goal of treatment is to reduce pain and to solve the mechanical&#xD;
      problem that causes functional impairment. Low-level laser treatment is an increasingly used&#xD;
      treatment modality in the treatment of SIS as in many musculoskeletal diseases , as it&#xD;
      promotes cell proliferation and tissue regeneration by its anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      photobiostimulation properties. Also, High-intensity laser therapy (HILT) is a treatment&#xD;
      method that is gaining popularity in the recent years. These ultra short impulses effect a&#xD;
      deep action in the biological tissue (3-4 cm), with a homogeneous distribution of the light&#xD;
      source in the irradiated soft tissue, but without excessive thermal enhancements. It reduces&#xD;
      pain and edema with photomechanic effects in deep tissues. As far as we know, there are no&#xD;
      studies comparing these two treatment modalities in SIS yet. This study was planned to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of HILT and LLLT in treatment of patients with subacromial impingement&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;

    <time_frame>change from base line at three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS). The patient will be asked to mark the severity of pain on a 100-mm line with &quot;no pain&quot; on one end and &quot;most unbearable pain&quot; on the other end</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>shoulder range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Flexion, abduction, and external rotation will be measured by using goniometer in a supine position and the active movements will be recorded. The goniometer will be centered at the acromion for abduction, greater tubercle for flexion, and olecranon for external rotation at 90Â° shoulder and elbow flexion</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>pain pressure threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure Pain Threshold will be determined with an analogue algometer at the most painful point of the subacromial area. This point will be determined by a previous examination based on the point that the patient determined as 'his or her point of maximum pain'.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>this scale will be used to assess functional status of the shoulder. The SPADI includes shoulder questions and consists of two subscales: pain and disability. Pain subscale consists of 5 items, and disability subscale consists of 8 items, and the total score is 0-100</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assesses sleep quality and disorder and consists of seven subcomponents (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, drug use, and daytime functions) and 19 items. Each component is evaluated on a score of 0-3 and is evaluated with a total sleep score ranging from 0 to 21, and high scores represent low sleep quality. A PSQI total score &lt; 5 points is considered &quot;good&quot; sleep quality and &gt; 5 points is &quot;bad&quot; sleep quality.</description>
