  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: REAL INTELLIGENCE™ CORI™ (CORI Robotics) is a computer-assisted orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgical navigation and burring system. CORI Robotics is designed to help surgeons in&#xD;
      planning and executing certain types of knee surgery involving bone preparation. These types&#xD;
      of surgery are called 'unicondylar knee arthroplasty' (UKA) and 'total knee arthroplasty'&#xD;
      (TKA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being carried out to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the CORI&#xD;
      Robotics. The data collected will be used to meet the post-market clinical follow-up&#xD;
      requirement in Europe and to support claims and publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the use of CORI Robotics in UKA and TKA&#xD;
      procedures in achieving post-operative leg alignment to check that the results of the&#xD;
      operation are similar to what the surgeon originally planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research participants / locations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      140 research participants will be recruited from up to 6 sites in 4 countries globally (UK,&#xD;
      US, Germany and India). There will be 70 patients having UKA surgery and 70 patients having&#xD;
      TKA surgery.&#xD;

    <description>The Functional Knee Score is derived from assessments of walking and standing, standard activities, advanced activities, and discretionary activities in UKA subjects. The 2011 Knee Society Score consists of 4 separate sub-scales: (1) An &quot;Objective&quot; Knee Score (seven items: 100 points), (2) A Patient Satisfaction Score (five items: 40 points), (3) A Patient Expectation Score (three items: 15 points), and (4) A Functional Activity Score (19 items: 100 points). A higher number is a better outcome.</description>

Responses to 12 questions are recorded with a five point Likert response format: &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;almost never&quot;, &quot;seldom&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot; and &quot;mostly&quot;. The item scores are summed and linearly transformed in a 0 to 100 scale and then reversed with a high value reflecting the ability of the subject to forget about the replaced knee joint during the activities of daily living. A score of 100 is the best possible outcome.</description>

    <measure>Five-level EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D-5L) VAS &amp; index scores - UKA</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-op, 6 week, 6 month and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the subject's health state in UKA subjects. The EQ-5D-5L is composed of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS).&#xD;
The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Responses are coded as single-digit numbers expressing the severity level selected in each dimension. For instance, 'slight problems' (e.g. 'I have slight problems in walking about') is always coded as '2'. The digits for the five dimensions are combined in a 5-digit code. The EQ- 5D-5L index value is derived by using the vendor supplied calculator to convert each 5-digit EQ-5D-5L profile.&#xD;
The EQ VAS corresponds to a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale raging from 'the best health you can imagine' to 'the worst health you can imagine'.&#xD;
A higher number is a better outcome.</description>
