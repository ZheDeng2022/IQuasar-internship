    <description>To determine if access to an online comprehensive platform for prenatal education and childbirth courses decreases pregnancy anxiety as measured by the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Scale (PrAS) in nulliparous women with high risk pregnancies compared to usual prenatal care. The primary study endpoint will be a 15% reduction in PrAS score from 64 to 55 with a SD of 15.22.</description>
