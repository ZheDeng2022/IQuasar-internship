  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of the study is to garner empirical support for intervention components&#xD;
      that can reduce acculturative stress in Latinx immigrants. Informed by our review of the&#xD;
      literature and our prior research, we hypothesize that we can target the following mechanisms&#xD;
      in a modularized group intervention format, as detailed below. These are preliminary areas&#xD;
      targeted by the intervention, but may be updated based on feedback from the Community&#xD;
      Advisory Board, Community Consultation Studio, and Duke Health key informants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As health disparities widen for Latinx immigrants, there is an urgent unmet public health&#xD;
      need to develop an evidence-based interventions reducing stress experienced by this&#xD;
      population that can be easily scalable across diverse clinical settings and geographically&#xD;
      distinct immigrant communities. Thus, the purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test&#xD;
      a novel group acculturative stress intervention for Latinx immigrants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study activities Aim 1: Co-develop an acculturation stress intervention for adult Latinx&#xD;
      immigrants to decrease stress, increase resilience, and prevent declines in mental and&#xD;
      physical health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine the preliminary clinical impact, feasibility, and acceptability of a group&#xD;
      acculturative stress in Latinx immigrants and collect information to inform subsequent&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2a: Conduct pilot testing of the group intervention in Latinx immigrant participants&#xD;
      (N=24-30)to evaluate its preliminary clinical impact from baseline to post-assessment on&#xD;
      stress, resilience, and health outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety, self-rated health).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2b: Characterize the inner and outer context, facilitators, barriers, intent to adopt,&#xD;
      and resources across the Duke University Health System through multiple stakeholder&#xD;
      interviews with providers and administrators (n=8-10).&#xD;
