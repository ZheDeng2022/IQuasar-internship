        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sign the consent form, willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related&#xD;
             procedures;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 18 years to 80 years, male or female;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes mellitus(type 1 or 2);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study eye must followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Retinal thickening secondary to diabetes mellitus (DME) involving the center of&#xD;
                  the fovea; Decrease in vision determined to be primarily the result of DME and&#xD;
                  not to other causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. BCVA score in the study eye of 73 to 24 using the ETDRS protocol at an initial&#xD;
                  testing distance of 4 meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The central subfield thickness ≥300μm in the center subfield as assessed on OCT&#xD;
                  by the reading center;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If both eyes meet the inclusion criterion, one eye with poor BCVA is selected as the&#xD;
             study eye; the researchers judged that the fellow eye should not be treated with other&#xD;
             anti-VEGF drugs recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The macular edema caused by others instead of diabetes mellitus;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Structural damage to the center of the macula in the study eye that is likely to&#xD;
             preclude improvement in BCVA following the resolution of macular edema including&#xD;
             atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, subretinal fibrosis or scar, significant&#xD;
             macular ischemia or organized hard exudates;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current iris neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment or&#xD;
             epiretinal membrane involving the macula in the study eye;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only one functional eye even if that eye is otherwise eligible for the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of periocular or intraocular inflammation or infection including infectious&#xD;
             blepharitis, keratitis, scleritis, conjunctivitis, endophthalmitis or uveitis at&#xD;
             screening assessment in either eye;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with anti-angiogenic drugs in either eye or system (ranibizumab,&#xD;
             aflibercept, conbercept, etc) within 3 months of the Day 0;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events within 6 months of screening&#xD;
             visit: myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, ventricular arrhythmias, New&#xD;
             York heart association grade II + heart failure, stroke, etc.;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled clinical disease (such as severe psychiatric, neurological,&#xD;
             cardiovascular, respiratory disease or other systemic diseases) and tumors;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who participated in clinical trials for 3 months or 5 half-lives of the&#xD;
             investigational product (the longer the time) before the baseline period;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who considered unsuitable for enrollment by investigator.&#xD;
