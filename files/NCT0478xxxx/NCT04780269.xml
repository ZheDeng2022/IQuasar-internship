  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction of labor is one of the most common interventions in obstetrics. In the past decade,&#xD;
      the rates of labor induction at term have doubled from approximately 9% to 23% in the United&#xD;
      States and from 10% to 20.4% in China. The majority of women undergoing labor induction&#xD;
      requires cervical ripening for the unfavorable cervixes. As globally, it is still required to&#xD;
      explore an optimal induction method. Foley catheter was among the oldest mechanical&#xD;
      approaches, while prostaglandin E2 vaginal suppository (PGE2) one of the most popular&#xD;
      pharmacological agents for cervical ripening. There were studies reporting similar cesarean&#xD;
      section rates between these two methods. However, there are no randomized control trials&#xD;
      (RCTs) with adequate power to compare their frequencies of severe perinatal complications.&#xD;
      The investigators aim to compare the effectiveness and safety of Foley catheter versus PGE2&#xD;
      for induction of labor among term pregnant women with an unfavourable cervix.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a single center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      (1:1 treatment ratio) in Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center. Women with a term&#xD;
      pregnancy, an indication for induction of labor, and a live singleton fetus at cephalic&#xD;
      presentation, intact membranes, an unfavorable cervix, no prior cesarean section or&#xD;
      contraindication to vaginal delivery, are eligible to participate. After informed consent,&#xD;
      they will be randomized to undergo induction of labor by Foley catheter or PGE2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary outcomes will be (I) a composite of severe perinatal complications and (II)&#xD;
      vaginal delivery. Before the formal recruitment of this RCT, a pilot study with a sample size&#xD;
      of 200 pregnant women will be performed.&#xD;
