  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the development of a physiologic endpoint using a novel&#xD;
      technology that would provide an objective, easy to use and more sensitive assessment of VIPN&#xD;
      in children and adolescents. The ability to more easily detect and monitor VIPN, even before&#xD;
      it is clinically evident, would facilitate optimizing the dosing of vincristine for maximal&#xD;
      disease response while minimizing the risk of lifelong functional deficits affecting quality&#xD;
      of life. This approach would also enable the development of specific therapies to minimize or&#xD;
      eliminate the occurrence of VIPN in children and adolescents. This is a single site study&#xD;
      that aims to develop a novel device to evaluate and characterize vincristine-induced&#xD;
      neuropathic pain. The investigators will enroll patients with ALL following the Delayed&#xD;
      Intensification (DI) phase of treatment. At each study visit, the investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      the nPRD as well as the TNS-PV. The nPRD will inform the neuropathy index which will be used&#xD;
      to compare to the TNS-PV. We anticipate a correlation between the two.&#xD;
