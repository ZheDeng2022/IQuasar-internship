      Background: Joint haemorrhage represents the most common type of bleeding episode in persons&#xD;
      with hemophilia (PwH). In the absence of an adequate prophylaxis with Factor VIII (for&#xD;
      hemophilia A) or FIX (for hemophilia B) concentrates up to 85% of patients with severe&#xD;
      hemophilia develop a clinically overt joint disease. Screening of early signs of arthropathy&#xD;
      is needed. Synovitis is widely considered as one of the parameters to be taken into account&#xD;
      for the diagnosis and the surveillance of joint impairment in PwH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To assess if an intensive factor VIII replacement treatment is able at reverting&#xD;
      synovitis in PwH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The present study is a randomized, open-label, cross-over study. Among patients&#xD;
      referred to enrolling Haemophilia Centres, consecutive patients with severe (FVIII &lt; 1%) or&#xD;
      severe-moderate (FVIII &lt; 2%) haemophilia A without inhibitors will be enrolled. The present&#xD;
      study will be organized in 2 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 (US screening): All patients will undergo an ultrasound examination of elbows,&#xD;
           ankles and knees to define joint status and to identify presence/absence of synovitis&#xD;
           according to the HEAD-US system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 (Intervention): Patients with US evidence of synovitis will be randomly assigned&#xD;
           at undergoing a PK assessment with my-PK-fit to start a prophylaxis with AdynoviÂ®&#xD;
           targeting a 12% FVIII through level (PROPEL-like arm) or to continue ongoing standard&#xD;
           treatment (control arm). US examination of the six joints will be repeated monthly for&#xD;
           six months and in case of onset of symptoms that might suggest an acute bleeding&#xD;
           episode. After six months the two treatment arm will be switched in the frame of a&#xD;
           cross-over approach and all PwH will be followed for other 6 months The primary outcome&#xD;
           will be represented by changes in synovial status during the intensive factor VIII&#xD;
           replacement treatment vs standard treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Joint haemorrhage represents the most common type of bleeding episode in persons with&#xD;
      hemophilia (PwH) and recurrent hemarthrosis triggers chronic arthropathy, which is the most&#xD;
      frequent chronic complication in hemophilia patients. In the absence of an adequate&#xD;
      prophylaxis (age at start, regimen, duration, adherence) with Factor VIII (for hemophilia A)&#xD;
      or FIX (for hemophilia B) concentrates, up to 85% of patients with severe hemophilia develop&#xD;
      a clinically overt joint disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, some recent data suggest that, despite adequate prophylaxis a not&#xD;
      negligible percentage of PwH develop arthropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, an adequate screening of early signs of arthropathy is needed. On this hand, synovitis&#xD;
      is widely considered as one of the parameters to be taken into account for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      the surveillance of joint impairment in PwH. Synovitis represents a key feature, potentially&#xD;
      related to under-treatment due to insufficient therapy regimens or to a limited compliance to&#xD;
      treatment, to pharmacokinetics variability or to demanding daily/sport activities.&#xD;
      Accordingly, there is a general agreement on the indication to consider the presence of&#xD;
      synovitis as a marker of disease activity in PwH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among patients referred to enrolling Haemophilia Centres (to be defined), consecutive&#xD;
      patients with severe (FVIII &lt; 1%) or severe-moderate (FVIII &lt; 2%) haemophilia A without&#xD;
      inhibitors will be enrolled according to the above reported inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      For each subject, a trained staff will record demographic data including age, race,&#xD;
      ethnicity, body mass index (BMI, kg/m2). Information from medical records will also include&#xD;
      the number of bleeding episodes and the amount of factor concentrate used during the previous&#xD;
      12 months for regular prophylaxis and for breakthrough bleeding episodes treatment. The&#xD;
      present study will be organized in 2 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (US screening): All patients will undergo an ultrasound examination of elbows, ankles&#xD;
      and knees to define joint status and to define presence/absence of synovitis according to the&#xD;
      HEAD-US system. Synovitis screening protocol will include examination of the olecranon recess&#xD;
      (elbow), suprapatellar recess (knee) and anterior recess of the tibiotalar joint (ankle). For&#xD;
      a detailed scanning protocol see Figure 1. Synovitis will be scored as absent/minimal (score&#xD;
      0); mild/moderate (score 1) and severe (score 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (Intervention): Patients with US evidence of synovitis will be randomly assigned at&#xD;
      undergoing a PK assessment with my-PK-fit to start a prophylaxis with Adynovi targeting a 12%&#xD;
      FVIII through level (PROPEL-like arm) or to continue ongoing standard treatment (control&#xD;
      arm). US examination of the six joints will be repeated monthly for six months and in case of&#xD;
      onset of symptoms that might suggest an acute bleeding episode. For both treatment arms&#xD;
      changes in synovitis status, the number of bleeding episodes, number of infusions and FVIII&#xD;
      consumption will be recorded. In case of confirmed hemarthrosis an intensive treatment will&#xD;
      be started with the ongoing treatment according to current guidelines . During the intensive&#xD;
      treatment period, the US assessment of the affected joint will be repeated every 7 days. The&#xD;
      intensive replacement treatment will be stopped when US will demonstrate complete resolution&#xD;
      of intra-articular bleeding. The time to pain disappearance, the time to US evidence of&#xD;
      bleeding resolution and the number and doses infused will be recorded for each treatment arm.&#xD;
      Any change in prophylaxis schedule will be recorded in both treatment arms during the overall&#xD;
      study period, and will not represent an exclusion criterion from the study.&#xD;
