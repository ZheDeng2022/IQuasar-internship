  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the adhesion performance and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      ZTlido (lidocaine topical system) 1.8% during swimming, showering, and under normal&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase 1, open-label, three-period crossover study, 24 healthy, adult male and female&#xD;
      subjects are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment sequences. During each treatment period, subjects&#xD;
      have one lidocaine topical system applied to their back for 12 hours with a 4-day washout&#xD;
      between treatments. In each treatment period, the subject will either swim (Treatment A),&#xD;
      shower (Treatment B), or refrain from these activities (Treatment C) while wearing the&#xD;
      topical system. Blood samples for lidocaine PK will be collected pre-dose until 24 hours.&#xD;
      Adhesion will be monitored throughout the wear time and skin irritation will be assessed the&#xD;
      topical system is removed.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean cumulative adhesion score</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Adhesion to skin assessed by FDA 0-4 scoring system. The scoring for adhesion of patches is indicated as follows: 0 = ≥ 90% Adhered (essentially no lift off the skin), 1 = ≥ 75% to &lt; 90% Adhered (some edges only lifting off the skin), 2 = ≥ 50% to &lt; 75% Adhered (less than half of the patch lifting off the skin), &gt; 0% to &lt; 50% Adhered but not detached (more than half of the patch lifting off the skin without falling off), and 4 = 0% adhered (patched completely detached). The cumulative adhesion score is calculated as the sum of scores at each assessment time point (3, 4.5, 7, 8.5, and 12 hours).</description>

    <description>Product tolerability is assessed by Dermal Response Score. The application site is evaluated 30 minutes and 2 hours after product removal (12.5 and 14 hours post-dose, respectively). Response score from 0 to 7; 0= No evidence of irritation, 1= Minimal erythema, barely perceptible, 2= Definite erythema, readily visible; minimal edema or minimal papular response, 3= Erythema and papules, 4= Definite edema, 5= Erythema, edema and papules, 6= Vesicular eruption, 7= Strong reaction spreading beyond test (i.e., application) site.</description>
