    <textblock>
      Perioperative pain relief during endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is generally&#xD;
      treated with opioids either morphine sulfate or fentanyl. This study will compare the&#xD;
      traditional method of intravenous fentanyl to the bilateral infraorbital nerve block in adult&#xD;
      patients scheduled for pituitary surgery by the transsphenoidal approach.&#xD;

      1. Infraorbital nerve- The infraorbital nerve exits from the infraorbital foramen. It is a&#xD;
           branch of the maxillary nerve, the second division of the trigeminal nerve, the fifth&#xD;
           cranial nerve. The infraorbital nerve is a pure sensory nerve innervates the lateral&#xD;
           aspect of the nose, upper lip, upper incisor, canines, premolars, and the first molar of&#xD;
           the ipsilateral side. (1-6) The NYSORA website mentions that 'transsphenoidal&#xD;
           hypophysectomy' is one of the indications of infraorbital nerve block. (2) There are two&#xD;
           approaches to block this nerve, the intraoral and extraoral approaches. Regardless to&#xD;
           the approach, the infraorbital foramen must be palpated throughout the procedure to&#xD;
           avoid the serious complication of eyeball penetration. (2,4,6) This study, we use the&#xD;
           extraoral approach with a 27-gauge needle advance perpendicularly toward the foramen.&#xD;
           When the bony resistance is appreciated, slowly injects 2 ml of local anesthetics. After&#xD;
           the injection, gently massage over the puncture site to prevent the hematoma formation.&#xD;
           (2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pituitary adenomas- Pituitary adenomas are the tumors of the pituitary gland. The tumors&#xD;
           can be classified by the size and/ or by the functional status of hormone production.&#xD;
           Dimension &lt; 1 cm is microadenoma and dimension ≥ 1 cm is called macroadenoma. (7)&#xD;
           Treatment options for pituitary tumors are surgery, radiation, and medications. The&#xD;
           single or combination of treatment depends on types of tumor, its size, how fast the&#xD;
           tumor grows, patient's age, and patient's general condition. (8) The two main surgical&#xD;
           techniques for removing pituitary tumors are endoscopic trans-nasal transsphenoidal&#xD;
           (ETSS) approach and transcranial or craniotomy approach. The transsphenoidal approach&#xD;
           has many advantages such as less brain tissue damage than those in craniotomy approach.&#xD;
           There is no visible scar because a small incision will be done over the nasal septum and&#xD;
           through the sphenoid sinus. The bony posterior wall of sphenoid sinus is drilled with&#xD;
           small surgical chisels to reach the pituitary gland. (9) Choice of anesthesia for ETSS&#xD;
           approach is general anesthesia with cuffed endotracheal intubation strap over the left&#xD;
           corner of patient's mouth. Balanced anesthetic technique is maintained throughout the&#xD;
           surgical procedure. Specific goals for ETSS pituitary surgery are optimized hormonal&#xD;
           function, facilitate surgical exposure, surveillance and promptly treatment for massive&#xD;
           bleeding from accidentally penetration to the cavernous sinus. General goals for&#xD;
           neurosurgery are maintain the hemodynamic stability and rapid emergence. (10) Promoting&#xD;
           selective nerve block instead of systemic opioid analgesics, we anticipate to see a&#xD;
           rapid wear off from general anesthesia and rapid awakening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Characteristics of pain in pituitary adenomas - A cross-sectional study of 278 patients&#xD;
           with pituitary adenomas was shown that i) the prevalence of somatic pain (called 'bodily&#xD;
           pain' in the study) was high and independent to the tumor type, ii) the patients&#xD;
           diagnosed of Cushing's disease were more susceptible to pain than the patients diagnosed&#xD;
           of other pituitary diseases, iii) a high incidence of headache which is independent to&#xD;
           the tumor type, and iv) pain significantly correlated to depression and quality of life&#xD;
           (QoL).(11,12) Pituitary tumor headache was reported unilaterally, at the site of orbital&#xD;
           and retro-orbital, and throbbing in quality. Its severity was moderate to strong. (12)&#xD;
           According to International Headache Society (IHS), pituitary tumor caused chronic and&#xD;
           episodic migraine, 46% and 30%, respectively. (13,14) These findings demonstrate the&#xD;
           importance of adequate pain relieve during pituitary surgery while rapid awakening after&#xD;
           general anesthesia is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dexmedetomidine addition to bupivacaine - Addition of dexmedetomidine to bupivacaine in&#xD;
           greater palatine nerve block and supra-zygomatic maxillary nerve block was resulted&#xD;
           prolong the analgesic duration, decrease postoperative analgesic requirement, and no&#xD;
           additional side effects such as hemodynamic disturbance and sedation. (15,16) The&#xD;
           reported dosage was 0.5-1 µg/kg of dexmedetomidine. A systematic review of nine RCTs&#xD;
           revealed many positive effects of dexmedetomidine in facilitating neuraxial and&#xD;
           peripheral nerve block. (16) Dexmedetomidine-related adverse effects were transient&#xD;
           bradycardia in brachial plexus block but did not observe in intrathecal administration.&#xD;
           Respiratory depression was not seen. A high dosage of dexmedetomidine (15 µg)&#xD;
           administered intrathecally caused higher sedation level during surgery. (17) The result&#xD;
           from this study will add more evidence of the use of perineural dexmedetomidine in&#xD;
           clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Study hypothesis: We hypothesize that the bilateral infraorbital nerve&#xD;
      block with dexmedetomidine added to bupivacaine reduce fentanyl used during endoscopic&#xD;
      transsphenoidal pituitary surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective randomized double blinded control (patients and assessors will be&#xD;
      blinded) Participants: Adult patients, age ≥ 18 years old, diagnosis of pituitary tumor,&#xD;
      scheduled for endoscopic transsphenoidal approach to remove tumor under general anesthesia&#xD;
      with endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria will be 1) the patient is known case of allergy to dexmedetomidine, 2)&#xD;
      the patient allergy to bupivacaine, 3) the patient does not sign a consent form to&#xD;
      participate to the study, 4) the operation is changed due to cavernous sinus perforation, 5)&#xD;
      the navigator and Mayfield is used to identify the tumor There are no pre-specified&#xD;
      withdrawal criteria. The expected duration of subject participation is 3 days including the&#xD;
      surgical day, which is day-1. At the time of pre-surgical evaluation and informed consent,&#xD;
      participants will be informed that their participation in this research is voluntary and they&#xD;
      may discontinue participation without consequence at any time. The data obtained prior to the&#xD;
      subject's decision of withdrawal will be retained and analyzed in consistent with the study&#xD;
      purpose. Unless the participants indicate that they want to remove their data from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration: Before commencement of the study, the research proposal must be&#xD;
      approved by the Ethical Committee (EC) of Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University (CMU).&#xD;
      The protocol will be registered to the Research Operation System (ROS) and the website&#xD;
      www.clinicaltrial.gov. Participants of this study should be fully level of conscious, E4V5M6.&#xD;
      The research team will explain the procedure and risks to the participants one day prior to&#xD;
      the surgery. If the participants decide to be enrolled, the consent form will be asked to&#xD;
      sign.&#xD;
