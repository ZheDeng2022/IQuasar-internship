  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to improve a mathematical model (FAE) of human bone healing using the&#xD;
      example of the distal spoke fracture. Computer-aided strength analyzes of data from hr-pqCTs&#xD;
      should provide information about the fracture strength and quality of the newly formed bone&#xD;
      at defined times. Laboratory parameters from sober blood analyzes, bone remodeling markers,&#xD;
      competitive x-rays, the course of pain, range of motion, grip strength and other easily&#xD;
      accessible parameters should be evaluated with the above-mentioned analyzes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      So far, empirical values have mainly been used to assess fracture healing. The clinical&#xD;
      parameter used is freedom from pain over the fracture, and native radiology the callus&#xD;
      formation. In the case of anatomically reduced fractures, however, this can hardly be&#xD;
      observed. In the case of a distal radius fracture, it is assumed that the total time to&#xD;
      complete healing and resilience is one year. However, this has not been proven&#xD;
      biomechanically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography offers the possibility of&#xD;
      precisely describing the healing process in the high-resolution range using the trabecular&#xD;
      structure, bone density, bone volume and tissue composition. The finite element analysis can&#xD;
      then be used to calculate the load-bearing capacity of the bone and to create failure models.&#xD;
      The distal radius fracture is one of the most common fractures in humans, especially in&#xD;
      osteoporosis. Due to its frequency and easily accessible fracture localization, it is an&#xD;
      ideal model for investigating fracture healing. The additional examination of blood and urine&#xD;
      for bone loss markers can provide further information on the healing process in conjunction&#xD;
      with the image data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a prospective cohort study. The collected data are compared on the one hand with&#xD;
      preliminary examinations of the injured side in the sense of creating a model and on the&#xD;
      other hand with the healthy, non-fractured side in order to compare the strength of the&#xD;
      fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing the X-ray and HR-pQCTs leads to radiation exposure which, however, can be&#xD;
      classified as low. (X-ray: 0.02 mSv / image; HR-pQCT: between 0.003 - 0.006 mSv / stack&#xD;
      image). The DXA examination on the distal radius, femur / hip + lumbar spine requires 0.405&#xD;
      mSv. With 18 x-rays and 24 HR-pQCTs and 1 DXA per patient, there is a radiation exposure of&#xD;
      0.837 - 0.909 mSv over the course of the academic year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will also be taken and urine samples will be collected. Together with the clinical&#xD;
      examination and filling in the questionnaire, each examination should take approx. 45&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;

    <description>In addition to determining the bone density, a quantitative bone structure analysis with measurement of the number of thickness and distribution of the trabeculae can also be carried out. In addition, the finite element analysis (FEA) allows strength models of the examined bone to be created from the data of the hr-pqCTs. In this way, the osseous consolidation of the fracture can not only be observed, but also tested for resilience with the help of mathematical models.</description>
