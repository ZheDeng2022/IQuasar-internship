  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that Sirolimus, (Rapamycin (R)) which is currently used in organ&#xD;
      transplantation and works by blocking the activity of T effector cells but preserving T&#xD;
      regulatory cells, as well as by inducing autophagy (protein degradation), will be effective&#xD;
      in IBM to slow or stabilize disease progression, helping to maintain patient function and&#xD;
      independence. This phase III trial will confirm pilot data showing statistically significant&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in IBM Functional Rating Scale (IBM-FRS) from Baseline to Week 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 84</time_frame>
    <description>The IBM-FRS is a concise and quick (~10 minute), clinician-administered ordinal rating scale used to determine participants' assessment of their capability and independence. It includes 10 measures (swallowing, handwriting, cutting food and handling utensils, fine motor tasks, dressing, hygiene, turning in bed and adjusting covers, changing position from sitting to standing, walking, and climbing stairs), graded on a Likert scale from 0 (being unable to perform) to 4 (normal). The sum of the 10 items gives a value between 0 and 40, with a higher score representing less functional limitation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) from Baseline to Week 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 84</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The 6MWT is a sub-maximal exercise test used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance in patients with cardiopulmonary disease. It is now a commonly used and validated test to estimate the functional walking capacity in patients with a range of chronic diseases including IBM.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Modified Timed Up and Go (mTUG) from Baseline to Week 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 84</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go (mTUG) was initially developed as a tool to determine falls risk, mobility, balance and walking ability in an elderly population. It has since been adopted as an outcome measure in a broader clinical setting including myositis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) from Baseline to Week 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 84</time_frame>
    <description>Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) is a relatively simple method of assessing a patient's strength in a muscle or group of muscles. There is however a degree of subjectivity when assigning a score. MMT will be used to assess change in strength throughout the study period. This method is routinely performed in a clinical setting and has been shown to be reliable. This tool assesses muscle strength using a 0 - 10 point scale.</description>

    <intervention_name>Sirolimus</intervention_name>
    <description>Sirolimus is a currently licensed drug primarily used for immunosuppression post-kidney transplantation to prevent organ rejection. Sirolimus was initially considered as a treatment in IBM for its immunosuppressive action and beneficial effects in an experimental myositis mouse model.(11) Transfer of effector T cells from affected to healthy animals resulted in myositis, but the presence of Treg cells were protective against development of myositis. As Sirolimus, which acts to deplete effector T cells but preserving the Treg cells, was effective in this mouse model of myositis, it was therefore postulated that it may also be effective in IBM, not only for its effects on effector T cells and Treg cells, but also for its additional effects on protein degradation.</description>
