      The FIRST project compares the dose of robotic gait training (RGT) with usual care gait&#xD;
      training for patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) undergoing rehabilitation at Baylor Scott&#xD;
      &amp; White Institute for Rehabilitation (BSWIR).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) due to trauma is estimated to affect 288,000 - 500,000 Americans,&#xD;
      with about 17,700 new cases annually. Recovery of walking is a primary rehabilitation goal&#xD;
      for patients and encouraged by therapists due to its relationship to quality of life, impact&#xD;
      on health, psychological profile, and social participation after SCI. Recent technological&#xD;
      advances with exoskeleton devices specifically for gait training may yield better walking&#xD;
      recovery outcomes compared with usual care intervention approaches, such as body-weight&#xD;
      support treadmill training (BWSTT) and overground gait training with braces, yet limited&#xD;
      evidence exists for those with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Use a Community-Based Participatory Research approach to develop an robotic gait&#xD;
      training (RGT) program that meets the unique needs of people after incomplete SCI during&#xD;
      inpatient rehabilitation. This will be achieved by establishing and engaging an Advisory&#xD;
      Board of key stakeholders to review evidence-based literature, advise the research team on&#xD;
      the unique aspects and goals of inpatient rehabilitation for people with SCI, review the RGT,&#xD;
      and make recommendations for amendments to the RGT program based on our interim and final&#xD;
      outcomes of the study over the funding period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Prospectively examine the efficacy of RGT compared to usual care gait training during&#xD;
      inpatient rehabilitation in people with incomplete SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Compare the intensity of RGT and usual care gait training during inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;

    <measure>Heart Rate (HR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following every treatment until discharge, an average of 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Polar heart rate monitor (Polar® Unite) will provide data on the day, duration, and intensity (average and maximum) of gait training sessions for both RGT and UC. Participants will be provided a Polar heart rate monitor to wear during each gait training session for the entire length of the study, and gait training session data will be collected weekly. These monitors record beat to beat heart rates and store up to 16 sessions of heart rate data. Each week study staff will upload participants' heart rate data using Polar's FlowLink technology via the Polarpersonaltrainer.com website.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following every treatment session until discharge, an average of 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Borg RPE is a 15-point scale with verbal descriptors to standardize perceived exertion across tasks and individuals. Participants will be asked to provide a self-reported intensity level on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale during RGT and UC gait training sessions. A self-report of 12 to 14 on the RPE indicates moderate intensity. The Borg RPE scale has been shown to be a valid measure of exercise intensity with weighted mean validity coefficient of 0.62 for HR.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Steps</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following every treatment session until discharge, an average of 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Ekso device records several data points for each session including number of steps, &quot;Up&quot; time (the amount of time spent standing in the device), &quot;Walk&quot; time (the amount of time spent walking in the device), and device assistance scores. While all of these data values will be recorded to describe each RGT session and tracked to monitor progression of the RGT intervention, the number of steps per session will be utilized as an indicator of RGT session intensity.42,91 We will consult our Consumer Advocates for recommendations on incorporating device scores such as &quot;Up&quot; time and &quot;Walk&quot; time as additional measures of intensity.&#xD;
Number of steps for the UC group will be collected via pedometer during each gait training session. The number of steps captured on the device will be recorded on the case report form after each gait training session. The watch will be reset before each use.</description>
