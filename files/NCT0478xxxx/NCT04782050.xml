  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early screening and monitoring of chronic liver diseases in hepatology practice has become&#xD;
      crucial. To achieve this goal, hepatology clinics need simple and available tools at the&#xD;
      point-of-care to perform disease severity assessment. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the performance of a new non-invasive ultrasound-based system for the assessment of&#xD;
      liver fibrosis and steatosis severity, via ultrasound biomarkers such as tissue stiffness&#xD;
      (correlated to fibrosis severity) and ultrasound tissue attenuation (correlated to steatosis&#xD;
      extent).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll adult patients with known chronic liver disease, and referred to a&#xD;
      hepatology outpatient visit for liver fibrosis assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performances will be assessed from correlation coefficients between biomarkers estimated by&#xD;
      the medical device subject of the research and reference measurements obtained non-invasively&#xD;
      from other commercially available equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeatability and reproducibility of biomarkers estimations by the medical device subject of&#xD;
      the research will be assessed from intraclass correlation coefficients.&#xD;
