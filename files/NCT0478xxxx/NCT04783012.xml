    <textblock>
      Management of postoperative urinary retention often requires the use of indwelling catheters.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if patient removal of catheters at home is non-inferior&#xD;
      to standard office removal.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Voiding trials are a routine part of Urogynecologic surgery. Management of postoperative&#xD;
      urinary retention often requires the use of indwelling catheters. However, patients often&#xD;
      view the need for catheters as the worst part of their surgical experience, and follow-up&#xD;
      voiding trials in the office utilize excess healthcare resources. Many Urology practices&#xD;
      allow patient removal of catheters after procedures, though this has not been formally&#xD;
      studied. The purpose of this study is to see if patient removal of catheters at home is&#xD;
      non-inferior to standard office removal.&#xD;
