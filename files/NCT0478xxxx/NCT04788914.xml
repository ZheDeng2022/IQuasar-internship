  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at a higher risk of developing&#xD;
      atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease (PAD). Retention of uremic toxins such as indoxyl&#xD;
      sulfate (IS), p-cresyl sulfate (PCS) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) during CKD is&#xD;
      detrimental to endothelial and vascular function and can predispose to the development and&#xD;
      progression of PAD. Many of the uremic toxins originate from gut microbial metabolism.&#xD;
      Removal of these uremic toxins by carbonaceous oral adsorbent is beneficial, slowing down the&#xD;
      deterioration of renal function and delaying the need for dialysis in CKD patients. However,&#xD;
      if carbonaceous oral adsorbent could also improve vascular function and clinical outcomes in&#xD;
      CKD patients with established PAD, remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposal, the investigators aim to determine the therapeutic impact of a carbonaceous&#xD;
      oral adsorbent made of activated bamboo charcoal (ABC) with/without probiotics on the&#xD;
      endothelial/vascular function, CV outcome and mortality in CKD patients with PAD. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators hypothesize that circulating long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)&#xD;
      expression profiles and metabolome may serve as a sensitive and reliable biomarker to predict&#xD;
      the adverse CV outcomes and death in CKD patients with established PAD. In addition, it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that circulating lncRNAs and linked to adverse CV outcomes in CKD patients with&#xD;
      PAD are associated with dysbiosis of gut microbiota. The investigators also hypothesize that&#xD;
      the administration of ABC could normalize the dysbiosis of gut microbiota, dysregulated&#xD;
      circulating lncRNAs and metabolome that are linked to adverse CV/limb outcomes in CKD&#xD;
      patients with PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, randomized, open-labeled, blinded end-point trial for 6 months,&#xD;
      followed by integrated assessment of endothelial/vascular function, changes in conventional&#xD;
      athero- and inflammation-relevant biomarkers, circulating long noncoding RNAs, metabolome,&#xD;
      and gut microbiota at baseline, ends of the 3rd and 6th month, as well as clinical CV, renal&#xD;
      and limb outcomes up to 3 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-labeled, blinded end-point (so called PROBE) trial&#xD;
      for 6 months. All patients presented to the clinics of participating sites with advanced CKD&#xD;
      with eGFR 15 &lt; eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and symptomatic PAD will be screened for eligibility.&#xD;
      The other healthy adults will be enrolled as control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      the current study. After the participants provides the written informed consents, detailed&#xD;
      demographic data including genders, ages, body weights, body heights, smoking status (never,&#xD;
      past, or active), the baseline creatinine (the nadir value in the past three months) and its&#xD;
      corresponding eGFR and CKD stages, degrees of albuminuria (Urine albumin creatinine ratio,&#xD;
      UACR), NYHA functional class, presence of atrial fibrillation, prior cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD, including myocardial infarct, peripheral arterial occlusive diseases), presence of&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (DM), or hypertension. Detailed medication list will also be obtained, with&#xD;
      the focus on angiotensin receptor blocker or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,&#xD;
      statins, and beta-blockers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of kidney injury will be non-mutual-exclusively categorized as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypertensive kidney disease, participants who received any kind of anti-hypertensive&#xD;
           drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diabetic kidney disease, patients who received any kind of anti-diabetics drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Glomerulonephritis, patients who have proteinuria more than 0.5mg/dL and kidney biopsy&#xD;
           approved Glomerulonephritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible 120 participants (group I) with eGFR 15 &lt; eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and symptomatic&#xD;
      PAD will be randomized into ABC-treatment (A) or no-treatment (B)participants with a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio. The other 60 eligible controls (eGFR &gt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and no PAD, group II) will be&#xD;
      also randomized into ABC-treatment (A) or no-treatment (B) with a 1:1 ratio. The participants&#xD;
      will receive CharXenPlus 4g (with ABC 2g) thrice daily for 6 months in subgroups IA and IIA,&#xD;
      while the participants in subgroups IB and IIB will not receive any ABC. The subgroups IA and&#xD;
      IB will be further randomly subdivided into IAa, IAb, IBa, and IBb subsubgroups. All the&#xD;
      participants will receive probiotics APL-MIX2 (CharXprob) 0.8 g once a day in the last 3&#xD;
      months except those in subsubgroups IAb and IBb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being processed, urine, stool, and plasma samples will be stored in -80°C for further&#xD;
      examinations. The names and chart numbers participants will be masked to provide adequate&#xD;
      privacy. The coding book connecting codes and individual participants will be filed&#xD;
      separately in order to protect participants' privacy. participants will be asked if&#xD;
      investigators can keep the encrypted samples refrigerated for 10 years for further&#xD;
      investigations.&#xD;
