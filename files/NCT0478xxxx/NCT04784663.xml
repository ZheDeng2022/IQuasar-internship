  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk for suicide increases by nearly 50% in the first year that service members&#xD;
      transition from the military to civilian life underscoring the need for effective strategies&#xD;
      to facilitate help seeking among Veterans vulnerable to self-directed violence. Yet despite a&#xD;
      great need for treatment, more than half of returning Veterans at risk for suicide do not&#xD;
      initiate mental health services. VA has embarked on the regular use of communication&#xD;
      campaigns as part of a public health approach designed to reach the larger Veteran population&#xD;
      with messages promoting help seeking. However, what types of messages effectively change&#xD;
      beliefs and behaviors for at-risk Veterans resistant to seek treatment is unclear. The main&#xD;
      objective of this study is to develop and test the use of public messaging to increase&#xD;
      treatment seeking among Veterans at risk for suicide and resistant to seek mental health care&#xD;
      following separation from military service. This represents the first study to systematically&#xD;
      develop public messaging strategies for populations at risk for suicide.&#xD;

      The main objective of this study is to develop and test the use of public messaging to&#xD;
      increase treatment seeking among Veterans at risk for suicide and resistant to seek mental&#xD;
      health care following separation from military service. A four-year mixed methods study that&#xD;
      uses a sequential embedded design will be used to collect data from nationwide samples of&#xD;
      Veterans at risk for suicide not in mental health treatment who separated from the DoD in the&#xD;
      past year. Informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior, individual interviews will first be&#xD;
      conducted to guide the design of effective public messages that will be subsequently tested&#xD;
      in a two-arm RCT to determine exposure effects among targeted audience vs. control group.&#xD;
      Messages will be disseminated to study participants during the trial by a smartphone app.&#xD;
      Research staff will collect assessments by telephone at baseline, 1- and 3-months&#xD;
      post-randomization. Potential participants (for all study aims) will be identified using data&#xD;
      available from the VA/DOD Identity Repository (VADIR) and recruited by invitational mailing&#xD;
      and follow-up telephone calls. If the intervention is found effective, the investigators will&#xD;
      work with the VA operational partner to include messages in future outreach approaches to&#xD;
      prevent Veteran suicide and use findings to improve current communication performance&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
