  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of cutaneous melanoma (MM) is increasing worldwide. The best therapeutical&#xD;
      solution for MM is early diagnosis and efforts over the last 50 years have been directed&#xD;
      towards early and precise diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dermoscopy has improved diagnostic accuracy compared to the naked eye, but is limited by an&#xD;
      associated higher number of unnecessary excisions. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a&#xD;
      novel technique enabling in vivo examination of the skin at cellular-level resolution, with&#xD;
      excellent diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hypothesis is that the systematic application of RCM in the triage and management&#xD;
      of patients suspicious for skin cancer, may improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the number&#xD;
      of unnecessary biopsy. Reducing the burden of unnecessary surgery excisions should benefit&#xD;
      the health system, both in saving surgical and pathology procedural associated costs and&#xD;
      reducing the overwhelming waiting lists for excisions and consequent risk for delayed&#xD;
      diagnoses.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A two-arm prospective, multi-center study of the triage of patients with equivocal skin lesions suspicious for melanoma, compared with the standard of care (i.e. clinical and dermoscopic examination). A 1:1 randomization into the interventional or control arms occurred at the time of enrolment. Arm 1 (interventional) included lesions that were evaluated with RCM with management decisions taken according with overall information (2 possible outcomes: excision or digital monitoring. Arm 2 (control) included lesions that were not evaluated with RCM, with management decisions taken according to clinical and dermoscopy evaluations only (2 possible outcomes: excision or follow-up).</intervention_model_description>
