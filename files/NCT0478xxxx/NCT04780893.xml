  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common complaint among patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and&#xD;
      has been associated with several further health consequences. Medications are known to be&#xD;
      effective, and currently serve as the primary treatment for insomnia but their use is limited&#xD;
      due to the risk of adverse events. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-1) has also been shown&#xD;
      to be effective and safer in the treatment of insomnia but presents its own limitations such&#xD;
      as the time, cost, and training required. The relationship between vestibular stimulation and&#xD;
      sleep continues to be explored, however its usefulness in the treatment of insomnia is still&#xD;
      unknown. Vestibular stimulation itself has been shown to be safe across multiple populations.&#xD;
      If vestibular stimulation is shown to be effective in the treatment of insomnia, it could&#xD;
      serve as a safer alternative to medications. It could also require less cost, time, and&#xD;
      training than CBT-1, providing a treatment option that is not only safe and effective, but&#xD;
      broadly available to the general population. This trial therefore seeks to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of non-invasive electrical vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS) as a method of&#xD;
      treating insomnia in participants with a diagnosis of PTSD, as compared to a sham control.&#xD;

    <description>The device utilizes a technology called vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS). The device will be placed on the head in a manner analogous to headphones and will deliver a small electrical current to the skin behind the ears, over the mastoid processes. Participants will be advised to use the device at home for 1 hour per day.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data will be transferred in an encrypted PDF format. Trial staff will be given direction on how to share the trial data and given access to one specific section of a controlled cloud service which is controlled via role based access. Once they have authenticated with the service and the service verifies that they have the correct role to access the system they will be directed to a single webpage within the application where they will be able to upload the encrypted PDF. This PDF is generated on the fly and is therefore not stored in another location that could become compromised. Generating the PDF on the fly means that the source data is extracted from the database, processed and delivered in the context of a single request. These data will be transferred for each subject when they complete participation in the study.</ipd_description>
