             and must have had a negative pregnancy test at Screening and at each admission to the&#xD;
             clinical research center.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female subject of childbearing potential, with a fertile male sexual partner, must&#xD;
             have used adequate contraception from Screening until 90 days after the Follow-up&#xD;
             Visit. Adequate contraception is identified as using hormonal contraceptives or an&#xD;
             intrauterine device combined with at least one of the following forms of&#xD;
             contraception: a diaphragm or cervical cap, or a condom.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Male subject must have used adequate contraception and must not have donated sperm&#xD;
             from first admission to the clinical research center until 90 days after the Follow-up&#xD;
             Visit. Adequate contraception for the male subject and his female partner is defined&#xD;
             as using hormonal contraceptives or an intrauterine device combined with at least one&#xD;
             of the following forms of contraception: a diaphragm or cervical cap, or a condom.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject must have been healthy, as determined by the Principal Investigator, based on&#xD;
             medical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG and laboratory evaluations&#xD;
             (hematology, blood chemistry, coagulation and urinalysis tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. All values for the subject's clinical laboratory tests of blood and urine should not&#xD;
             have been clinically significant, as judged by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Intake of any investigational drug in another study within 30 days (or 5 half-lives,&#xD;
             whichever was greater) prior to the intake of the IP in this study or had received the&#xD;
             last dose of IP more than 30 days prior (or 5 half-lives, whichever was greater) but&#xD;
             who were on extended follow-up, or planned intake of an investigational drug (other&#xD;
             than for this study) during the course of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. With ongoing symptoms that had indicated acute diseases within 28 days prior to IP&#xD;
             administration; acute disease referred to any new onset of symptoms/signs or diagnosis&#xD;
             of disease, whether infectious, inflammatory, traumatic, etc., in origin (regardless&#xD;
             of whether or not the subject was hospitalized).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. With any medical history that might have affected IP distribution, metabolism and&#xD;
             excretion (e.g., hepatic or renal disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Positive screen on hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), hepatitis C virus (HCV)&#xD;
             antibodies or anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and type 2 antibodies. If&#xD;
             a potential subject was considered by the Investigator to have false positive result&#xD;
             (e.g., HIV antibodies) at Screening, a repeat test should have been done as soon as&#xD;
             possible and if the retest was negative, the subject could have been considered&#xD;
             eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Had clinically significant hypersensitivity or severe allergic reactions (either&#xD;
             spontaneous or following IP administration), also including known or suspected&#xD;
             clinically relevant drug hypersensitivity to any components of the IP or comparable&#xD;
             drugs, including Latex.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Subject who had immune deficiency or medication with immunosuppressive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Treatment with any medication, prescribed or over-the-counter (OTC) products including&#xD;
             herbal remedies, within 14 days prior to Day 1 or longer if the medication had a long&#xD;
             half-life, unless agreed as not clinically significant by the Investigator and&#xD;
             Sponsor. Exceptions: hormonal contraceptives, acetaminophen ≤ 3 g/day, vitamins at&#xD;
             daily recommended doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Had donated whole blood products (e.g., plasma, platelets) within 60 days, or&#xD;
             transfused within 20 days before Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of alcohol or drug abuse or drug addiction (including cannabis products)&#xD;
             within the last 12 months before Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject was willing to comply with the alcohol restrictions. The subject should have&#xD;
             refrained from drinking any alcohol within 72 hours prior to Day -1 and should not&#xD;
             have consumed more than 3 - 4 units of alcohol per day, to a maximum of 14 units of&#xD;
             alcohol per week (1 unit of 10 mL of pure alcohol is equal to 12 ounces [360 mL] of&#xD;
             beer, 5 ounces [150 mL] of wine or 1.5 ounces [45 mL] of 80-proof distilled spirits)&#xD;
             throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Heavy smoker (&gt; 5 cigarettes/day) or the subject could not stop smoking during the&#xD;
             study period while inpatient at the clinical research center.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Positive tests for drugs of abuse or alcohol at Screening or Day -1 (admission to the&#xD;
             clinical research center).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Family member or employee of the Investigator or clinical research center staff or&#xD;
             study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
