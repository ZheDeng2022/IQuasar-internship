      The study aimed to investigate the effect of applying cognitively challenging exergames using&#xD;
      fully immersive virtual reality in patients with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

      It has been reported that dual-task training involving both cognitive and physical functions&#xD;
      helps improve walking speed during dual-task performance without increasing the fall risk in&#xD;
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Compared with conventional physical therapy, there&#xD;
      are studies that dual-task training significantly improved walking speed and stride in PD&#xD;
      patients. In addition, a systematic review study has been reported that it helps to improve&#xD;
      balance and cognitive function when dual-task training is performed for patients with&#xD;
      neurological diseases including Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality is expected to promote functional recovery in patients with neurological&#xD;
      disorders in terms of providing an enriched environment, goal-directed tasks and repetition,&#xD;
      and inducing interest and motivation. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      applying cognitively challenging exergames using fully immersive virtual reality in patients&#xD;
      with PD.&#xD;
