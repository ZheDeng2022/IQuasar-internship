  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial involving mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated children in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Indonesia.&#xD;
      Subjects were divided into two groups: intervention vs control group. Primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will be measure pre, during, and post treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As of today, there is no sedation and ventilator weaning protocol in our PICU. Decision for&#xD;
      sedation and ventilator weaning were based on attending physicians clinical judgement, which&#xD;
      greatly varies among individual. Previous study on the use of these protocols showed a&#xD;
      favorable outcome. We aim to assess the safety and effectiveness of this protocol in our&#xD;
      PICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were recruited consecutively and randomized into intervention and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention group: sedation and ventilator weaning protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: no protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FLACC score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COMFORT score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ventilator days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self extubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reintubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PICU Length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of asynchrony&#xD;
