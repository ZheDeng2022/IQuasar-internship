    <textblock>
      PARP inhibitors are most effective in homologous recombinant (HR) deficient tumors. There are&#xD;
      clear indications that besides BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutated EOC, there is an additional group of&#xD;
      EOC having deficiencies in HR (i.e. BRCAness) that might benefit from treatment with PARP&#xD;
      inhibitors. Assessment of HR in high grade EOC might therefore serve as a better predictive&#xD;
      biomarker and allow the identification of a larger group of patients that could benefit most&#xD;
      from platinum based chemotherapy and maintenance treatment with a PARP inhibitor. We recently&#xD;
      developed a robust ex vivo functional assay (RAD51 assay;) to test HR in viable tumor tissue.&#xD;
      In the proposed study, we will evaluate whether the RAD51 assay predicts sensitivity to&#xD;
      therapy with olaparib, in patients with recurrent EOC. With the RAD51 assay we aim to&#xD;
      identify a larger number of patients who will benefit from treatment with the PARP inhibitor&#xD;
      olaparib than patients with a germline or somatic BRCA mutation only. Furthermore, we aim to&#xD;
      identify molecular markers (including genomic markers) that are associated with the outcome&#xD;
      of the RAD51 assay. Finally, we will explore whether these molecular markers can be measured&#xD;
      in liquid biopsies by analysing ctDNA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) often presents at an advanced stage, and harbours an&#xD;
      unfavourable prognosis. Standard of care includes complete or optimal debulking surgery and&#xD;
      chemotherapy, however, most patients experience recurrent disease. Recurrences are often&#xD;
      treated with additional chemotherapy, and for selected patients, treatment with PARP&#xD;
      inhibitors may be an option. Patients with platinum sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian&#xD;
      cancer (EOC) and a germ-line or somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, who are in response to&#xD;
      platinum based chemotherapy are currently eligible for maintenance treatment with the Poly&#xD;
      (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib after chemotherapy. Germline (11-15%) or&#xD;
      somatically acquired (6-7%) BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations lead to deficiency in homologous&#xD;
      recombination (HR) and subsequent less effective DNA repair. PARP inhibitors are most&#xD;
      effective in HR deficient tumors. There are clear indications that besides BRCA1 or BRCA2&#xD;
      mutated EOC, there is an additional group of EOC (~15-30%) having deficiencies in HR (i.e.&#xD;
      BRCAness) that might benefit from treatment with PARP inhibitors (Mukhopadhyay, Cancer Res&#xD;
      2012; Konstantinopolos, Cancer Discovery 2015; Telli, Clin Cancer Res 2016). Assessment of HR&#xD;
      in high grade EOC might therefore serve as a better predictive biomarker and allow the&#xD;
      identification of a larger group of patients that could benefit most from platinum based&#xD;
      chemotherapy and maintenance treatment with a PARP inhibitor. We recently developed a robust&#xD;
      ex vivo functional assay (RAD51 assay;) to test HR in viable tumor tissue (Naipal, Clin.&#xD;
      Cancer Res., 2014). It is still unknown however, whether the outcome of the RAD51 assay&#xD;
      reliably predicts the sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy or PARP inhibitors. In the&#xD;
      proposed study, we will therefore evaluate whether the RAD51 assay predicts sensitivity to&#xD;
      therapy with olaparib, in patients with recurrent EOC. With the RAD51 assay we aim to&#xD;
      identify a larger number of patients who will benefit from treatment with the PARP inhibitor&#xD;
      olaparib than patients with a germline or somatic BRCA mutation only. Furthermore, we aim to&#xD;
      identify molecular markers (including genomic markers) that are associated with the outcome&#xD;
      of the RAD51 assay. Finally, we will explore whether these molecular markers can be measured&#xD;
      in liquid biopsies by analysing ctDNA.&#xD;
