  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a mental pathology that concerns 1% of the French population, characterized&#xD;
      by heterogeneity of symptoms. One of them, apathy is defined as a multidimensional&#xD;
      psychopathological state manifested by a decrease in motivation. This deficit is most common&#xD;
      in schizophrenia and impacts the functional outcome of patients. To date, no treatment has&#xD;
      shown a significant effect on this symptom. In other pathologies with a motivational deficit,&#xD;
      the technique of Mental Contrasting and Implementation Intention (CM-II) showed interesting&#xD;
      effects in improving motivation, reducing the effort related to the action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to propose the CM-II technique to individuals with schizophrenia to&#xD;
      improve apathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expected that the CM-II technique will allow an improvement of apathy which&#xD;
      will have beneficial effects on other psychological factors (e.g., depressive symptoms). In&#xD;
      addition, the implementation of the CM-II will provide help to global management.&#xD;

    <description>LARS (Sockeel et al. 2006, translated and validated in French by Yazbek et al. 2014) is a questionnaire semi-structured based on a multidimensional approach to apathy. It is composed of 33 grouped items in nine dimensions: activities of daily living, interests, taking initiative, interest in novelty, voluntary efforts, the intensity of emotions, worry, social life, and self-critical capability. Each item can be rated at 1 (no) or -1 (yes), a score of 0 is possible. if the answer is not classifiable. The total score on this scale ranges from -36 to +36 and allows for different classes: non-apathetic (score -36 to -22); tendency to apathy (-21 to -17); moderate apathy (-16 to -10); and severe apathy (-9 to +36).</description>

    <description>The Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale is a scale hetero-evaluation of positive and negative symptomatology and general psychopathology in schizophrenia, consisting of 30 items, sides 1 to 7. The higher the score, the more severe the symptomatology. This scale provides scores on three syndromic dimensions: positive (7 items), negative (7 items) and positive (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items) from a categorical and dimensional perspective.</description>
