  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will find out if a new growth hormone stimulation test is safe and works&#xD;
      as well as other tests to diagnose growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in children. The&#xD;
      stimulation test will use a new growth hormone stimulating substance called macimorelin. By&#xD;
      now, only adults in the USA can get this new stimulation test. The results of this study are&#xD;
      expected to help children and teenagers with suspected GHD to get the macimorelin stimulation&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The macimorelin test will be compared to a clonidine and an arginine test. Both are known&#xD;
      standard stimulation tests. Altogether two macimorelin tests are planned to be performed in&#xD;
      the study, to show how repeatable macimorelin tests results are (under a set of similar&#xD;
      conditions).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each study participant (patient) will have 5 to 6 visits in total with the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for about 1 to 4 months, dependent on how close the visits are done. At&#xD;
      the visits 2, 3, 4 and 5, the patient will get a stimulation test done and blood samples will&#xD;
      be taken. At those 4 visits, the patient will have either to drink a macimorelin drink, take&#xD;
      some clonidine tablets or get an arginine infusion. In total, the patient will get 2&#xD;
      macimorelin, 1 clonidine and 1 arginine test done. The level of growth hormone (GH) will be&#xD;
      measured 4 times during the clonidine and during the arginine test and 5 times during the&#xD;
      macimorelin test. After the test, questions on the test tolerability will be captured from&#xD;
      patients and parents. After the arginine test, a urine dipstick test is to be done by the&#xD;
      patient at home.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open label, single-dose trial to determine the diagnostic efficacy and safety of macimorelin in pediatric subjects aged 2 to less than 18 years of age in whom, based on auxological and clinical criteria, growth hormone stimulation test (GHST) is indicated due to suspected growth hormone deficiency. Four GHSTs will be conducted during the trial: the macimorelin GHST will be performed twice, and arginine and clonidine standard GHSTs will be performed once each. The macimorelin GHST will be administered at the beginning of the trial and after serial performance of the two different standard GHSTs. The macimorelin GHSTs will be performed twice to show repeatability of the macimorelin GHST. All subjects will be randomized 1:1 to the order of the arginine and clonidine GHSTs, and in a crossover manner all subjects will receive both these GHSTs.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>This study is open label. Masking is performed with regard to the GHST results (i.e. growth hormone (GH) values).&#xD;
GH values from all GHSTs will be assessed centrally by a central lab: GH values following the two standard GHSTs at V3 and V4 will not be disclosed to the trial site prior to the end of V5 (i.e., the second macimorelin GHST). To avoid bias in the final diagnostic assessments by the investigators, macimorelin pharmacodynamic (PD) data will remain blinded to the trial sites, clinical research associates (CRAs), and trial management at contract research organization (CRO) and Sponsor until trial closure.&#xD;
An Independent Adjudication Committee (IAC) is established to perform ongoing blinded adjudication of subjects' growth hormone deficiency status. The IAC will adjudicate in a consistent manner by use of pre-defined definitions and guidelines.</masking_description>
