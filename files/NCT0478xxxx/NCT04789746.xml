  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Barriers to keeping and maintaining fitness as a young person with a disability exist across&#xD;
      many domains of access to community locations such as fitness centers, so looking outside of&#xD;
      these establishments may be necessary to advance fitness. This study is aimed at piloting a&#xD;
      program that would address some of these barriers by hosting a modified after school running&#xD;
      program with an underserved population in an accessible way. There is a second option to&#xD;
      participate outside of school.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention being piloted is a 6-8 week running program modified from a running curriculum designed for school-aged children. The children will use a RaceRunner device to facilitate their participation, but this device is not explicitly evaluated in this study. Depending on transportation, they may be given access to the device in their home or school between sessions after it has been fit for them. If given access, guardians will be instructed on care and usage.</description>
