      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drinking alcohol can lead to swelling and injury in the liver. Long-term heavy drinking may&#xD;
      lead to liver disease. Researchers want to study the relationship between a drug called&#xD;
      alirocumab, alcohol use, and liver functioning/swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effects of alirocumab in people who drink alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 21 to 65 who regularly consume 20 or more drinks per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under protocol 14-AA-0181.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get alirocumab or a placebo as an injection under the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood and urine samples. They will have physical exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have FibroScans . It measures liver and spleen stiffness. Participants will&#xD;
      lie on a table. They will expose the lower right and left side of their chest. The machine&#xD;
      will send a small vibration to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the liver. The MRI scanner is&#xD;
      shaped like a cylinder. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the&#xD;
      scanner. A device called a coil will be placed over their liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a Doppler scan and ultrasound. These tests measure blood flow in the&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an electrocardiogram. It measures heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out surveys about how they are feeling, their alcohol consumption, and&#xD;
      other behaviors. They will complete cognitive tasks on a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will meet with a clinician. They will discuss the participant s assessment&#xD;
      results, patterns of drinking, and possibly stopping or cutting down on drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 8 weeks. Participants will have 9 study visits.&#xD;

      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase I, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Study of Safety, Tolerability, and&#xD;
      Bioeffects of alirocumab in Non-treatment Seeking Heavy Drinkers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PCSK9 inhibitor alirocumab has been recently shown to attenuate alcohol-induced hepatic&#xD;
      triglyceride accumulation, hepatocellular injury and hepatic inflammation in a rat model of&#xD;
      chronic alcohol exposure. Given the unmet clinical need for novel treatment options for&#xD;
      alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), we are proposing to conduct a safety and tolerability&#xD;
      study of alirocumab in this new target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that alirocumab will be well tolerated and safe in this new target population&#xD;
      and alirocumab will attenuate alcohol-induced liver damage and inflammatory biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      alirocumab in subjects who are heavy drinkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary/Exploratory Objectives: Secondary/exploratory objectives are to assess various&#xD;
      biomarkers related to alcohol-induced liver damage and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoint in the study is to assess the incidence and severity&#xD;
      of treatment-emergent adverse events in non-treatment seeking heavy drinkers treated with&#xD;
      alirocumab or placebo. [Time Frame: baseline to week 8]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary/exploratory Endpoints: The secondary endpoint is to explore effects of alirocumab&#xD;
      on various biomarkers using change from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population will consist of 30 male and female, non-treatment seeking heavy drinkers&#xD;
      above the age of 21-65 from the United States of America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alirocumab 150mg s.c. or placebo every 2 weeks x 4 doses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
