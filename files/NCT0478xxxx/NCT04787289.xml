  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pragmatic, two armed, study comparing 2 standard doses of an anti-cancer drug called&#xD;
      bevacizumab, given in combination with Chemotherapy. The study will be offered to ovarian&#xD;
      cancer patients whose disease is platinum chemotherapy resistant . Higher doses of&#xD;
      anti-cancer based drugs are not always better than lower doses and can cause more side&#xD;
      effects without improvement of cancer. These patients will be randomly assigned either 7.5&#xD;
      mg/kg or 15mg/kg of bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy . Comparing these two doses will&#xD;
      determine if the lower dose-level is non-inferior, and could lead to practice changes.&#xD;

      Study team proposes to compare 2 standard doses of an anti-cancer drug called bevacizumab,&#xD;
      7.5mg/kg per dose vs. 15mg/kg per dose, given in combination with chemotherapy in patients&#xD;
      with ovarian cancer that progressed on platinum chemotherapy. Higher doses in cases of&#xD;
      antibody-based drugs like bevacizumab are not always better than lower doses, and in fact can&#xD;
      cause more side effects without improving survival or shrinkage of cancer. Both 7.5 and&#xD;
      15mg/kg doses of bevacizumab every 3 weeks are used as standard protocol in BC Cancer for&#xD;
      ovarian cancer patients, but only 15mg/kg doses are allowed for patients with ovarian cancer&#xD;
      that progressed on platinum chemotherapy. This study is a pragmatic two-arm blinded study in&#xD;
      which 70 patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and eligible for bevacizumab +&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be randomly assigned either to lower or higher standard dose of bevacizumab&#xD;
      , combined with chemotherapy. Treating clinicians will decide how long the treatment will&#xD;
      continue per standard of care. Duration of cancer control on CT scans, side effect profiles,&#xD;
      and quality of life related to the two arms will be compared. If demonstrated, this finding&#xD;
      will be practice-changing, with comparable efficacy and quality of life, potentially improved&#xD;
      safety profile, as well as reduced provincial drug costs.&#xD;

             received at least one prior regimen of chemotherapy including platinum. All patients&#xD;
             may have received other therapies including immunotherapy, hormone therapy, or PARP&#xD;
             inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have never received an anti-angiogenesis inhibitor including&#xD;

             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation: prior external beam radiation is permitted provided a minimum of 28 days (4&#xD;
             weeks) have elapsed between the last dose of radiation and date of treatment&#xD;
             initiation. Exceptions may be made for low-dose, non-myelosuppressive radiotherapy&#xD;
             after consultation with sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery: Previous surgery is permitted provided that a minimum of 28 days (4 weeks)&#xD;
             have elapsed between any major surgery and date of randomization/registration, and&#xD;
             that wound healing has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have agreed to use a highly effective&#xD;
             contraceptive method during the study and for up to 5 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             chemotherapy/bevacizumab. A woman is considered to be of &quot;childbearing potential&quot; if&#xD;
             she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months. In addition to&#xD;
             routine contraceptive methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual&#xD;
             celibacy and surgical sterility defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients who cannot give informed consent (i.e. mentally incompetent patients, or those&#xD;
        physically incapacitated such as comatose patients) are not to be recruited into the study.&#xD;
        Patients competent but physically unable to sign the consent form may have the document&#xD;
        signed by their Legally Acceptable Representative (LAR) or legal guardian. Each patient&#xD;
        will be provided with a full explanation of the study before consent is requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this&#xD;
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there&#xD;
             must be reasonable geographical limits. Investigators must assure themselves the&#xD;
             patients registered on this trial will be available for complete documentation of the&#xD;
             treatment, response assessment, adverse events, and follow-up.&#xD;
