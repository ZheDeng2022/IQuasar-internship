  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-range goal is to reduce suffering and establish alternative options for older adults&#xD;
      experiencing pain. This is a randomized controlled study examining the effect of music on&#xD;
      pain management in older adults.&#xD;

      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the efficacy of the music with suggestion intervention for chronic lower back&#xD;
           pain in aging adults, with the indication that music with suggestion will significantly&#xD;
           decrease subjective measures of pain compared to controls of music without suggestion or&#xD;
           an informational recording about chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the efficacy of the music with suggestion intervention for sleep in aging&#xD;
           adults, with the indication that music with suggestion will significantly improve&#xD;
           subjective measures of sleep compared to controls of music without suggestion or an&#xD;
           informational recording about chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the efficacy of the music with suggestion intervention for mood in aging&#xD;
           adults, with the indication that music with suggestion will significantly improve&#xD;
           subjective measures of mood compared to controls of music without suggestion or an&#xD;
           informational recording about chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 66 participants who wish to utilize mind-body interventions as treatment for&#xD;
      chronic lower back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual's eligibility will be determined using an Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
      Screening Checklist containing the criteria listed above. If an individual appears to be&#xD;
      eligible, he/she will be educated about the study purpose, procedures, and requirements. If&#xD;
      the individual is interested in participating, they will sign a consent form, which may be&#xD;
      signed through mail, through electronic platforms such as DocuSign, or in-person. The&#xD;
      participant will be scheduled for their first formal education session and informed consent&#xD;
      will take place during this session. This education session will take place through a video&#xD;
      conference platform. All three groups will meet with a research staff member approximately&#xD;
      five times (once during the education session and approximately once per week each following&#xD;
      week) throughout the duration of the study. These sessions will take place through a video&#xD;
      conference platform.&#xD;

    <measure>Pain Intensity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective measures of pain intensity, which will be determined using a Pain Intensity Scale. This measure will be completed daily where participants will be asked to rate the intensity of their pain on a scale from 0 (No Pain) to 10 (Very Intense Pain). Higher scores will indicate greater pain intensity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Suffering Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To measure pain suffering. Participants will be asked to rate their level of suffering from pain on a 0 (No Suffering) to 10 (Extreme Suffering) scale. Higher scores will indicate greater pain suffering.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To measure sleep disturbance. This scale measures self-report 1) sleep quality, 2) sleep depth, and 3) restoration associated with sleep. This scale includes 8 items measured on a 5-point scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Emotional Distress-Depression-Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To measure depression. This measure assesses self-reported experiences of negative mood, decreased positive affect and decreased engagement over the past 7 days on a 1 (never) to 5 (always) scale. This scale includes 8 items with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Emotional Distress-Anxiety- Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To measure anxiety. This measure assesses self-reported fear, worry, dread, hyperarousal, and somatic symptoms related to arousal over the past 7 days on a 1 (never) to 5 (always) scale. This scale includes 8 items with higher scores indicating greater anxiety symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relaxation Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To measure relaxation. Participants will be asked to rate their level of relaxation on a scale from 0 (Not Relaxed at All) to 10 (Very Relaxed). Higher scores will indicate greater relaxation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-report of medication use</measure>
