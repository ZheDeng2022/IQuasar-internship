    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of patient performed tissue&#xD;
      expansions in two-stage alloplastic breast reconstruction with tissue expanders. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that a motivated patient who learns and demonstrates proper&#xD;
      technique can safely perform tissue expansions at home, with no increase in complications or&#xD;
      problems with reconstruction. 30 participants will be recruited for this study, 10 into a&#xD;
      Home Expansion Group, and 20 into a Control Group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two-stage tissue expander-to-implant reconstruction is the most common technique for breast&#xD;
      reconstruction in the United States. Tissue expanders are used to increase the soft tissue&#xD;
      envelope after mastectomy to provide adequate and healthy coverage of prosthetic breast&#xD;
      implants. The current clinical standard of care entails an initial surgery for the placement&#xD;
      of tissue expander device either in front or behind of the pectoralis muscle following a&#xD;
      mastectomy. After an interval of a few weeks to allow surgical wound healing, the patient&#xD;
      will make serial office visits (usually weekly) where the plastic surgeon or other clinical&#xD;
      staff will inject the device with a bolus of saline. A probe is used to find the magnetic&#xD;
      port embedded in the expander, which is then accessed with a sterile butterfly needle&#xD;
      connected to a large syringe filled with saline. The serial injections continue until the&#xD;
      tissue expander(s) have reached the desired size. The patient then undergoes a second surgery&#xD;
      about 4-6 weeks after the last injection, to exchange the tissue expander with a breast&#xD;
      implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tissue expansion process can be inconvenient for the patient, due to the time and cost&#xD;
      associated with travel and coordination of frequent office visits. The office visits for&#xD;
      tissue expander injections ultimately result with multiple additional encounters with a&#xD;
      healthcare facility, which may be of concern to patients, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The saline tissue expander with internal filling port is still the clinical gold standard&#xD;
      device for alloplastic breast reconstruction. But the safety, time benefits and healthcare&#xD;
      utilization and cost savings of home inflation - as shown in studies using external filling&#xD;
      port tissue expanders and carbon dioxide-filled tissue expanders - suggests that patient&#xD;
      performed tissue expansions may also be feasible with conventional saline tissue expanders.&#xD;
      This would obviate multiple outpatient visits usually required for saline injections.&#xD;
      Eliminating the need for saline injection clinic visits would benefit both the clinician and&#xD;
      patient/families by reducing financial and time burdens, and limit potential exposures to&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten women age 18 or above who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria below will be&#xD;
      recruited and enrolled in the study. Study participants will be recruited from the principal&#xD;
      investigator's clinic. Surgical technique and timing for initiation of expansion and implant&#xD;
      exchange will be performed according to the principal investigator's usual protocol with&#xD;
      saline tissue expanders. At the first expansion clinic visit, the saline injection will be&#xD;
      performed by clinic staff, as per usual protocol. Clinic staff will provide teaching on the&#xD;
      saline injection technique during this visit. At the second and third clinic visit, the&#xD;
      participant will perform the saline injection under supervision by clinic staff in the right&#xD;
      breast, the left breast will be expanded by the clinic staff. Starting the fourth expansion,&#xD;
      participants will perform expansion in right breast prior to their clinic visit and left&#xD;
      breast will be expanded by clinic staff. Thus participants will still be seen in person on a&#xD;
      regular basis as per usual clinical protocol. If after the second and third visit the&#xD;
      participant is unable to demonstrate ability and comfort to perform expansions on her own&#xD;
      after the third clinic visit, she will be excluded from the study. Participants will be&#xD;
      provided instructional materials and all supplies necessary to perform expansions at home.&#xD;
      After the tissue expanders have been fully expanded, the participant will proceed to undergo&#xD;
      the principal investigator's usual protocol of exchange to breast implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any time the participant has problem with home expansion or no longer wants to be part&#xD;
      of the study, she can leave the study and receive all expansions in the clinic per usual&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1. Evaluate overall treatment success in undergoing alloplastic breast reconstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2. Evaluate profile and rate of complications in patients performing tissue expansions&#xD;
           at home&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3. Compare treatment success and complication profile/rate of right (patient performed&#xD;
           tissue expansion) and left (clinic performed tissue expansion) breast&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4. Compare treatment success and complication profile/rate of patients who perform some&#xD;
           tissue expansions at home vs patients who have all tissue expansions performed by&#xD;
           clinical staff&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5. Evaluate patient's satisfaction in experience of learning and performing expansions&#xD;
           at home&#xD;
