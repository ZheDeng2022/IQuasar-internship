  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      50 million patients undergo surgery each year in the United States. Postoperative mortality&#xD;
      is considered the third leading cause of death worldwide. Hypotension during surgery have&#xD;
      been linked to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Episodes of hypotension&#xD;
      during surgery are associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury, stroke, cardiac&#xD;
      events and death. Treating or preventing hypotension during general anesthesia and major&#xD;
      surgery was found to improve outcomes. At this time, it is unclear what is the best&#xD;
      vasopressor to maintain blood pressure during surgery under general anesthesia. With this&#xD;
      pilot pragmatic trial, the investigators will explore the impact of norepinephrine (NE) or&#xD;
      phenylephrine (PE) on post-operative events in patients undergoing major surgery with general&#xD;
      anesthesia and needing vasopressors infusion to maintain their systemic arterial pressure.&#xD;

      Postoperative mortality is considered the third leading cause of death worldwide. Hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability and specifically hypotension during surgery have been linked to increased&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and mortality. Episodes of hypotension during surgery are associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of acute kidney injury, stroke, cardiac events and death. Treating or&#xD;
      preventing hypotension during general anesthesia and major surgery was found to improve&#xD;
      outcomes. At this time, it is unclear what is the best vasopressor to maintain blood pressure&#xD;
      during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotension during anesthesia and surgery is commonly treated with vasopressors such as&#xD;
      phenylephrine (PE), a synthetic pure vasoconstrictor, or norepinephrine (NE), which has both&#xD;
      inotropic and vasoconstrictor activity. NE increases cardiac output and increases&#xD;
      cardio-vascular coupling due to alpha-agonist effects compared to PE, a purely&#xD;
      vasoconstrictive agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that norepinephrine will be superior to phenylephrine. The&#xD;
      effect size is expected to be modest, therefore requiring a large sample size, and will vary&#xD;
      between subgroups determined by patients' individual characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot trial (VEGA-1) will allow to 1) test the feasibility of the study using a&#xD;
      cross-over cluster randomized controlled trial and 2) estimate the effect size of the use of&#xD;
      NE or PE on post-operative outcome in the overall population but also investigate the&#xD;
      Heterogeneity in Treatment Effect (HTE) of the drugs among subgroups or clusters of patients&#xD;
      for designing a larger trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: pragmatic, cluster-randomized, open-labeled, multiple-crossover trial across hospital&#xD;
      from University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and University of California, Los Angeles&#xD;
      (UCLA). Centers will be assigned to use either PE or NE for the first-line intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of vasopressor in the OR. Data will be collected in routine clinical care and&#xD;
      automatically extracted from the electronic health record (EHR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Separation between study groups in the first line vasopressor administration (% of cases&#xD;
      with appropriate vasopressor with respect to group attribution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major adverse cardiovascular and renal events (combined endpoint of death, myocardial&#xD;
           infarction, stroke, acute decompensated heart failure and acute kidney injury).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute kidney injury defined by the KDIGO definition 20&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe acute kidney injury (stage 2 or 3 of the KDIGO definition)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major adverse kidney events (combined endpoint of death and/or dialysis and/or non&#xD;
           recovery from acute kidney injury at hospital discharge).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical complication requiring a new surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rehospitalization within 30 days&#xD;
