    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the potential of a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
      monitor CardioQvark (Moscow, Russia) with photoplethysmography function use to evaluate&#xD;
      parameters systolic function of the left ventricle. Also according to the photoplethysmogram&#xD;
      (PPG), using a special algorithm, the levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure are&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The single-lead electrocardiogram monitor CardioQvark (it is registered with the Federal&#xD;
      Service for Health Supervision on February 15, 2019. RZN (Roszdravnadzor) No. 2019/8124)&#xD;
      looks like an iPhone cover and records electrocardiogram (I standard lead) and&#xD;
      photoplethysmogram (pulse wave) simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized, observational study. The investigators&#xD;
      are planning to include in the study 400 patients with different pathologies of the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system (coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, heart&#xD;
      failure) according to the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of medical history; physical examination (including inspection, palpation and&#xD;
      auscultation, as well as determination of breathing rate, pulse rate, height, and weight)&#xD;
      will be performed for the entire group of patients. Electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram&#xD;
      registration and assessment of the blood pressure using a CardioQvark monitor will be&#xD;
      performed on all study participants at rest (the patient will sit quietly for 10-15 minutes&#xD;
      before the examination). The reference blood pressure will be measured using a cuff-based&#xD;
      blood pressure device (&quot;Microlife BP AG1-10&quot;) that is worn on the upper arm according to the&#xD;
      World Health Organization recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo an echocardiography (&quot;Dimension/Vivid 7 PRO General Electric&#xD;
      Medical System&quot;), the examination will be performed by an experienced doctor (the doctor will&#xD;
      not have data on the parameters of the pulse wave and electrocardiogram). The extended&#xD;
      protocol echocardiography will be performed according to the recommendations of European&#xD;
      Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) and American Society of Echocardiography (ASE).&#xD;
      All examinations will be performed consistently within one day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All electrocardiograms and photoplethysmograms records will be sent to the CardioQVARK server&#xD;
      and processed by the algorithm using signal processing based on the wavelet transformation.&#xD;
      Then engineers of &quot;CardioQvark&quot; (Limited Liability Company) will calculate the pulse wave&#xD;
      parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B1 is the beginning of the wave&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B0 is the point of maximum increase of the anterior front&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SEP is the peak of the ejected pulse wave&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DER3 is the first positive peak of the third derivative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SEPMAX is the point of the first inflection of pulse wave&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SRP is the peak of the reflected systolic wave&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DP is the peak of the diastolic wave&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End is the end of the wave&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  perfusion index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  augmentation index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram will be performed using a continuous wavelet&#xD;
      transform, the principles of which are based on the Fourier transform:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TpTe - time from peak to end of the T-wave&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAT - time from the beginning of the QRS to the R-peak&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QTc - corrected QT interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QT / TQ - the ratio of QT length to TQ length (from the end of T to the beginning of the&#xD;
           QRS of the next complex).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QRS_E - the total energy of the QRS wave based on the wavelet transform&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T_E - T-wave total energy based on wavelet transform&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TP_E- energy of the main tooth of the T-wave based on the wavelet transform&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BETA, BETA_S - T-wave asymmetry coefficients (simple and smooth versions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BAD_T - flag of T-wave quality (whether expressed in the current lead&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QRS_D1_ons - energy of the leading edge of the R-wave (based on the &quot;first derivative&quot;&#xD;
           wavelet transform)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QRS_D1_offs - energy of the trailing edge of the R-wave (based on the &quot;first derivative&quot;&#xD;
           wavelet transform)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QRS_D2 - peak energy of the R-wave (based on the &quot;second derivative&quot; wavelet transform)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QRS_Ei (i = 1,2,3,4) - QRS-wave energy in 4 frequency ranges (2-4-8-16-32 Hz) based on&#xD;
           wavelet transform&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T_Ei (i = 1,2,3,4) - T-wave energy in 4 frequency ranges (2-4-6-8-10 Hz) based on&#xD;
           wavelet transform&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HFQRS - the amplitude of the RF components of the QRS wave. The engineers will not have&#xD;
           echocardiography results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate parameters of the pulse wave (photoplethysmogram) and&#xD;
      electrocardiogram and compare the results with echocardiography (ejection fraction, left&#xD;
      ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral (VTI), left ventricular global longitudinal&#xD;
      strain (GLS)).The mathematical model for determining the systolic dysfunction of the left&#xD;
      ventricle will be built on the basis of the parameters of the photoplethysmogram and the&#xD;
      electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intergroup analysis of significant differences, correlation analysis and Bland-Altman method&#xD;
      will be used for statistical data analysis. All statistical analyses will be perform using a&#xD;
      computer program for statistical processing of data SPPS (statistical package for the social&#xD;
      sciences) Statistics Version 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to obtain comparative characteristics of the pulse wave and electrocardiogram&#xD;
      parameters registered by the CardioQvark monitor and the indicators of systolic function of&#xD;
      the left ventricle detected during echocardiography. The result of this study will be the&#xD;
      identification of the parameters of the pulse wave and electrocardiogram that will correlate&#xD;
      with systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle. It is planned to determine the diagnostic&#xD;
      effectiveness of this method. The accuracy of the blood pressure measurement using the&#xD;
      CardioQvark monitor will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a quick and convenient assessment of systolic function of the left ventricle and blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement will be available. So, study results will improve the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
