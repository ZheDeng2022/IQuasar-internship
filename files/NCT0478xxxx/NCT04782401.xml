      Goal: Comparison of the effects of genicular nerve block with usg and physical therapy on&#xD;
      pain, physical function for patients with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:80 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee with Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L)&#xD;
      class 2 or 3 were included in the study.Patients were randomized to two groups, first being&#xD;
      injected a total of 6 mL of lidocaine plus 40 mg of triamcinolone (TA) at 3 separate target&#xD;
      sites: the superior lateral, superior medial, and inferior medial genicular nerves with&#xD;
      exercise treatment and second being ten sessions of hotpack as a surface warmer, TENS as a&#xD;
      analgezic current, ultrasound therapy as a deep warmer with exercise treatment.For the first&#xD;
      group, the ultrasound we used: 12 MHz linear transducer. (Logic E9-GE, USA).The transducer&#xD;
      was first placed parallel to the long bone shaft and moved up or down to identify the&#xD;
      epicondyle of the long bone. The genicular arteries were identified near the periosteal&#xD;
      areas, which are the junctions of the epicondyle and the shafts of the femur and tibia, and&#xD;
      confirmed by color Doppler ultrasound.Accordingly, GNB target points should be next to each&#xD;
      genicular artery because the superior lateral, superior medial, and inferior medial genicular&#xD;
      artery traveled along each genicular nerve. Western Ontorio and McMaster Universities&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Visual Analogue Scale for pain(VAS) and six minute walk test&#xD;
      were applied before, after (two weeks) and at the 12th weeks of treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, Change from baseline WOMAC score at 12th weeks</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC is a scale to assess disease-related functional status and disability. It consists of three parts with 24 simple questions in total. Five questions are related to pain (WOMAC-A), two questions to morning stiffness (WOMAC-B), and the remaining 17 questions to physical condition (WOMAC-C). Each question is scored using 4-point Likert scale (0= None, 1= Mild, 2= Moderate, 3= Severe, 4= Very severe). Higher scores indicate severe pain, increased stiffness, and functional failure. Minimum score of the scale is 0 and maximum is 100. Higher scores mean worse outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Six minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, Change from baseline six minute walk test at 12th weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is an objective method to evaluate exercise tolerance. It was performed on an unobstructed bare 30 meters (m) floor where every 3 meters were marked. The patients were allowed to complete the test by reducing their walking speed or stopping and getting some rest, if needed. Maximum walking distance (meters) within six min was measured. Higher distance means better outcome.</description>
