    <textblock>
      The study team plans to establish a bioregistry of patients receiving biologic therapy as&#xD;
      part of their standard treatment at the Mount Sinai Therapeutic Infusion Center and&#xD;
      affiliated practices. The study team will to apply state-of-the-art approaches to assessing&#xD;
      and predicting immunological and clinical responses associated with these standards and&#xD;
      prescribed treatments. The approach is twofold. The first component is to establish a robust&#xD;
      and flexible biorepository and database that includes demographic, immunologic, exposure and&#xD;
      clinical records, and can facilitate research across disciplines, and across other registries&#xD;
      affiliated with Mount Sinai. The second component is to address specific key research&#xD;
      questions focused on using novel diagnostics to increase the effectiveness of biologic&#xD;
      treatment. Most patients will be recruited from the Mount Sinai Therapeutic Infusion Center&#xD;
      (TIC), although others receiving infusions elsewhere or at home will be recruited from&#xD;
      outpatient Sinai affiliated clinical practices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team proposes a twofold approach to determine how immunophenotype may affect the&#xD;
      course of clinical immunological disease for patients receiving biologic therapy. First, the&#xD;
      team intends to establish a biorepository and database that includes demographic,&#xD;
      immunologic, exposure and clinical records. The registry will be set up to facilitate&#xD;
      research across disease disciplines, and across other registries affiliated with ISMMS.&#xD;
      Second, over time, the team aims to address specific and an increasing number of research&#xD;
      questions focused on using novel diagnostics to increase the effectiveness of biologic&#xD;
      treatment as outlined below. Most subjects will be recruited from the Mount Sinai Therapeutic&#xD;
      Infusion Center (TIC), although others receiving infusions elsewhere or at home will be&#xD;
      recruited from outpatient affiliated clinical practices during scheduled medical visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. (Overarching) Build a repository of biological specimens, questionnaire data, and apply&#xD;
      state-of-the-art assessment tools to assess the current immunological and clinical condition,&#xD;
      and changes over time. Specimens and data will be collected in a manner that can readily&#xD;
      incorporate new technology, new research questions, link to intelligent analytics, and&#xD;
      provide a resource for future consortia across disciplines. An infrastructure will be created&#xD;
      that includes a multi-disciplinary Steering Committee to facilitate spinoff research studies&#xD;
      and harmonize protocols within the TIC and across the Sinai system, resolve procedural&#xD;
      questions, and communicate updated policies to referring physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional initial specific scientific aims related to responses to biologics prescribed as&#xD;
      part of standard practice that will be considered in this proposal are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 . Effects of anti-IgE therapy on IgE phenotypes, maturation and production, and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Effects of anti-IgE and anti-IL-5 therapies on dopaminergeric pathways and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Effects of anti-TNF, anti-CD20, and other biologic therapies on immunological and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Effects of IVIG therapy on immunological and clinical course in Common Variable Immune&#xD;
      Deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Futures studies will focus on Clinical Decision Support (CDS), Artificial Intelligence, and&#xD;
      use of technology to inform and educate current TIC patients. Future studies also will&#xD;
      feature studies related to immunological and clinical responses to additional biological&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The prescription of biological agents and immune modulators to treat chronic&#xD;
      immunological-based diseases continues to expand. This trend is predicted to continue.&#xD;
      Applying data-driven and immunophenotype-driven approaches to their use could reveal&#xD;
      additional pharmacologic targets and signal disease presence or relapse prior to the onset of&#xD;
      clinical symptoms. These advances in precision medicine also may reduce adverse drug&#xD;
      reactions and help control overall cost of healthcare associated with inefficient and 'trial&#xD;
      and error' prescribing. They also may provide information on susceptible individuals and&#xD;
      their appropriate care during healthcare crises, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these developments, prospective studies and clinical trials that feature&#xD;
      immunophenotyping to facilitate 'real world' therapeutic decision-making are limited. More&#xD;
      comprehensive immunophenotyping has predicted clinical responses to cancer immunotherapy,&#xD;
      suggesting that this approach may translate to immunologically-mediated nonmalignant&#xD;
      diseases. But widespread application to multiple chronic diseases is limited by several&#xD;
      research gaps. These include determination of: 1) new biomarkers (discovery, validation) that&#xD;
      may inform clinicians of drug responsive endotypes, 2) biomarkers that predict disease course&#xD;
      over time in replicate studies, 3) optimal methods to link immunophenotype with analytic&#xD;
      diagnostic and clinical decision-making tools to predict disease course, 4) factors that&#xD;
      mediate treatment responses, some of which may be modifiable (eg environmental exposures,&#xD;
      viruses, disease phenotypes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mount Sinai Therapeutic Infusion Center is an ideal location where investigators have the&#xD;
      potential to fill in many of these research gaps. The volume is large, with currently 1803&#xD;
      individuals actively (in 2019) receiving anti-cytokine or anti-CD20 biological treatment for&#xD;
      their immunological, dermatological and neurological disorders, largely prescribed by members&#xD;
      of the Divisions of Clinical Immunology, Rheumatology, Pulmonary, Inflammatory Bowel Disease&#xD;
      (IBD), Neurology and Dermatology. Further, investigators across Divisions (Clinical&#xD;
      Immunology, Rheumatology, IBD) and Departments (Medicine, Neurology, Dermatology) have&#xD;
      created a research working group to discuss collaborations and standardized approaches to&#xD;
      assessing immunological responses to biologics. This registry also intends to coordinate with&#xD;
      other registries at ISMMS to ensure that it utilizes common approaches to biomonitoring and&#xD;
      common data elements as much as feasible to facilitate comparisons across cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and Secondary Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial scientific hypotheses focus on these endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 An expanded repository of biological specimens and questionnaire data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 Measures of IgE phenotypes and associated clinical airway outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 Measures of changes in the dopaminergic pathway and clinical airway outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4 Measures of anti-TNF, anti-CD20, and other biologic therapies on immunological and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5 Measures of IVIG-induced immunological and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
