    <description>Implantable Alginate Hydrogel is a single use, multiple component device. It is expected to be used as a space-occupying material implanted into the myocardium to affect the shape of the left ventricle and reduce the clinical symptoms of patients with left ventricular ischemia and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
The hydrogel serves as an artificial myocardial filler to stop the continuous expansion of the ventricle and restore it to a more favorable shape and size. The expected clinical effect of the Implanted Alginate Hydrogel is to reduce the clinical symptoms of patients and improve the quality of life by improving the structure and function of the failing heart.</description>
