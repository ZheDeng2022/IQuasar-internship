      Background: - Burn injuries always leave behind some permanent marks on the body of a victim.&#xD;
      For the treatment of these scars, digital photography along with scar scales instrument are&#xD;
      an important instrument for the patient's evaluation and finally for the follow-up of scars.&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation of the patient after the use of Platelet concentration that it is a&#xD;
      beneficial treatment which affects both on hard and soft tissues healing because of having&#xD;
      growth factors deposited in PRP. Therefore, it can be used as an alternative to surgery which&#xD;
      promotes safe and natural healing in such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: -&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the efficacy of Platelet Rich Plasma plus fat grafting as compared to fat&#xD;
      grafting alone on the Vancouver scar scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: - An experimental controlled comparison trial study will be done on burn&#xD;
      patients, admitted for recovery at the Plastic surgery department, Civil Hospital Karachi&#xD;
      after the approval of the scientific committee and Institutional review board of Dow&#xD;
      University of Health Sciences, Karachi. The study participants fulfilling the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria giving consent will be randomly divided into two groups, one group will receive only&#xD;
      fat grafting whereas another group will receive Platelet Rich Plasma plus fat grafting. The&#xD;
      sample size of the study will be 52(26 in each group). Both the groups will be followed&#xD;
      initially for 15 days of two visits then monthly two visits and finally after 6 months.&#xD;
      Assessment of scar with Vancouver Scars Scale (VSS) will be done. The association of the PRP&#xD;
      plus fat cells group and control group will be done by applying Chi-square statistical test.&#xD;
      P-Value will be set for statistical significance level at &lt;0.05.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the Efficacy of platelet rich plasma injection (PRP) plus fat grafting as&#xD;
      compared to fat grafting alone on burn scar by using Vancouver Scar Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no difference between the effect of Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) plus fat grafting and&#xD;
      only fat grafting on the burn scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternate hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a difference between the effect and adverse recovery findings of Platelet-rich&#xD;
      plasma (PRP) plus fat grafting and only fat grafting on burn scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP): - Platelet-rich plasma is a blood product that has been enriched&#xD;
      with platelets, as a concentrated source of autologous platelets. PRP contains several growth&#xD;
      factors and other cytokines that stimulate the healing of bone and soft tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fat Grafting: - It's a purification process in which fat can be removed from different parts&#xD;
      of the body and injected on the face and other areas of the body through a gentle harvesting&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burn Scars: - Burn scars are the scars developed on any part of the body due to burning&#xD;
      whatever cause which is depressed, raised, shiny, smooth, or rough, or darker than natural&#xD;
      skin and maybe thicker and tougher than normal skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plastic Surgery Department, Civil Hospital Karachi&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized control trial (RCT) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group-I: will receive only fat grafting Group-II: will receive Platelet Rich Plasma plus fat&#xD;
      grafting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 months after the approval of synopsis by the authorizes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated by Open Epi online sample size software version 3.0. Take fat&#xD;
      grafting and PRP, 70% maintenance of contour restoring as compared to only 31% of controls&#xD;
      with fat grafting alone 7, 80% of power and 95 confidence levels. The total calculated sample&#xD;
      size was 52. After randomization in 8 block with size of 8. we will take 64 (34 in each&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal investigator will provide treatments to the both groups. Sixty-four subjects (32 in&#xD;
      each group) will be randomizing in 8 block with size of 8 in two treatments group by using&#xD;
      online web page sealedenvelope/ create a randomization list. The group I will be treated with&#xD;
      fat grafting only from recipient to donor site. Group II will be treated with Platelet-rich&#xD;
      plasma plus fat grafting. Both the groups will be followed initially for 15 days of two&#xD;
      visits then monthly two visits and finally after 6 months to see if there are any differences&#xD;
      between them in outcome (burn scare).&#xD;

      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All the buns patients of either age or sex coming with burn scar for plastic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Give consent for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aesthetically not pleasant&#xD;

&#xD;
      1. Immature scar 2. Systematic illness. 3. Sepsis 4. Psychiatric illness. 5. Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the project, the approval of the scientific Postgraduate committee and&#xD;
      permission from the Institutional Review Board will be taken. All the patients who fulfill&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria will be selected for this study. Written consent of the patient will&#xD;
      also be taken. Then the patients will be divided into two parts on a random selection basis.&#xD;
      The group I will be treated with fat grafting only from recipient to donor site. Group II&#xD;
      will be treated with Platelet-rich plasma plus fat grafting. The fat cells will be prepared&#xD;
      by Coleman's technique 11. The Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) will be prepared from (9 - 18 ml).&#xD;
      Whole blood of the same person with centrifugation of 3000 (RPm x 3min) with anti-coagulant&#xD;
      Citrate Phosphorus Dextrose Adenine-I (CPDA-I) and 4000 (RPm x 15 min) with Calcium Chloride&#xD;
      for activation of platelets and normal saline to resolve-centrifugation effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done by the highly qualifies pathologist of Dow University of Health Sciences&#xD;
      free of cost. Both the groups will be followed initially for 15 days of two visits then&#xD;
      monthly two visits and finally after 6 months. Assessment of scar with Vancouver Scars Scale&#xD;
      (VSS) will be done. 16&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data will be analyzed through the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&#xD;
      version 20.0. The qualitative variables gender, size, and shape of scare and clinical changes&#xD;
      will be presented in frequencies and percentages whereas quantitative variables like age,&#xD;
      size of a scare, duration, and assessment of scar with (VSS) Vancouver scare scale will be&#xD;
      evaluated through mean ± Standard deviation. The scar will be asses with the Vancouver Scars&#xD;
      Scale (VSS) 16. Chi-square statistical test will be applied to assess the difference between&#xD;
      the group. P-Value will be set for statistical significance level at &lt;0.05. Efficacy of&#xD;
      Platelet Rich Plasma Injection along with fat grafting as compared to fat grafting alone on&#xD;
      burn scar in patients of plastic surgery ward of a tertiary care hospital of Karachi.&#xD;
