  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this observational study are to assess the long-term safety and long-term&#xD;
      effectiveness of burosumab in patients with TIO who are being treated with burosumab as&#xD;
      prescribed by their physician and to monitor the course of the underlying phosphaturic&#xD;
      mesenchymal tumor (PMT) overtime in patients with TIO irrespective of their treatment status.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled patients may or may not be treated with commercially available burosumab during the&#xD;
      TIO DMP at the discretion of their treating physician. Given the observational nature of the&#xD;
      TIO DMP, specific treatments or supportive management will not be provided as part of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

        May include patients who have undergone complete tumor resection and continue to have&#xD;
        biochemical/clinical evidence of disease, patients with tumor identified, or patients in&#xD;
        whom causative tumor has not been identified and who have been diagnosed with TIO based on&#xD;
        biochemical/clinical symptom profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be treated with burosumab, or phosphate and active vitamin D&#xD;
        metabolites/analogs, as prescribed by a physician, or maybe untreated, at any time during&#xD;
        the TIO DMP.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of TIO based on the presence of an underlying PMT (confirmed&#xD;
             by imaging) AND/OR historical documentation. Note: For adult patients with TIO in whom&#xD;
             the causative PMT has never been located, and all pediatric patients, documented&#xD;
             evidence of negative genetic testing for other hereditary hypophosphatemic disorders&#xD;
             is necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patient safety, all participating female patients of child-bearing potential must&#xD;
             be willing to have pregnancy tests prior to certain assessments performed as part of&#xD;
             the DMP&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing to provide access to prior medical records including tumor pathology&#xD;
             reports and biopsy slides, imaging, biochemical, and diagnostic, medical, and surgical&#xD;
             history data, if available&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to provide informed consent after the nature of the study has been&#xD;
             explained, and prior to any research-related procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to comply with the study visit schedule and study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of TIO deemed to be caused by a tumor other than a PMT&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious medical or psychiatric comorbidity that, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             would present a concern for patient safety or compromise the ability to provide&#xD;
             consent or comply with the study visit schedule and study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 1 year of life expectancy (for any cause) in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent enrollment in a clinical trial without prior approval from the TIO DMP&#xD;
             Sponsor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergoing treatment with burosumab for an unapproved indication&#xD;
