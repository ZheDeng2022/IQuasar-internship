  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind (patient and evaluator), sham-controlled&#xD;
      study. The main objectives of this study are to evaluate the performance and safety of the&#xD;
      MyoRegulator® device in active versus sham treated stroke patients with lower-limb spasticity&#xD;
      after 5 consecutive days of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity prevalence after stroke is highly variable, ranging from 17% to 43% three months&#xD;
      post-stroke. In the lower limbs, adduction and extension of the knee with equinovarus foot is&#xD;
      the most observed pattern. Spasticity can lead to pain, ankylosis, and tendon retraction&#xD;
      which may limit the potential success of rehabilitation. Spasticity can also affect&#xD;
      quality-of-life and can be highly detrimental to daily activities such as walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial clinical trial of safety and feasibility suggested that five sessions of treatment&#xD;
      with the MyoRegulator® device temporarily reduces spasticity and overall stiffness of the&#xD;
      affected extremity with optimal reductions in spasticity occurring 2-3 weeks post stimulation&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MyoRegulator® is a non-invasive neuromodulation device using multi-site direct current&#xD;
      stimulation for the treatment of spasticity. The main objectives of this study are to&#xD;
      evaluate the performance and safety of the MyoRegulator® device in active versus sham treated&#xD;
      patients during and after 5 consecutive days of treatment sessions. Patients can take part in&#xD;
      an optional 3-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary performance endpoint is defined as the reduction in ankle joint spasticity. The&#xD;
      study will be considered to have a successful outcome if the actively treated subjects&#xD;
      demonstrate a statistically greater reduction in spasticity, as measured by the Tardieu&#xD;
      Scale, as compared to the sham treated subjects after five treatment sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoint is defined as the incidence of device-related serious adverse&#xD;
      events. The safety of the device will be demonstrated if there are no incidents of serious&#xD;
      adverse events caused or contributed to by the device treatment that are clinically&#xD;
      unacceptable in light of the treatment benefits.&#xD;
