    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of JNJ-70075200 compared with&#xD;
      placebo after administration of single ascending doses of JNJ-70075200 as oral solution (Part&#xD;
      1); multiple ascending doses of JNJ-70075200, administered as oral solution over 14&#xD;
      consecutive days (Part 2); and the option of a single dose of JNJ-70075200 administered as an&#xD;
      oral solid formulation (Part 3).&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital&#xD;
             signs, and 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. Any abnormalities,&#xD;
             must be considered not clinically significant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at&#xD;
             screening and Day -1. If the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or&#xD;
             urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included&#xD;
             only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not&#xD;
             clinically significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of pathogen driven cancers (carcinomas, sarcomas, gastric cancer, bladder&#xD;
             cancer,Cholangiocarcinoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight of at least 50 kilograms (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range&#xD;
             18 and 30 kilograms per square meter (kg/m^2) (BMI = weight/height^2) (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All women must have a negative highly sensitive serum (beta-human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants having a history of liver or renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine&#xD;
             clearance [CL] below 60 milliliter per minute [mL/min]); significant cardiac,&#xD;
             vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic,&#xD;
             rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants having a QT interval corrected according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF)&#xD;
             greater than (&gt;) 450 milliseconds (msec) for males, and &gt;470 msec for females, has a&#xD;
             complete left or right bundle branch block, or has a history or current evidence of&#xD;
             additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (for example, heart failure,&#xD;
             hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome) at screening and at Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to JNJ-70075200 or its excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not&#xD;
             be in the best interest of the participant (for example, compromise the well-being) or&#xD;
             that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants having a history of drug or alcohol abuse according to Diagnostic and&#xD;
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition) (DSM-V) criteria within 12 months&#xD;
             before screening or positive test result(s) for alcohol or drugs of abuse (including&#xD;
             barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, cannabinoids, amphetamines and benzodiazepines) at&#xD;
