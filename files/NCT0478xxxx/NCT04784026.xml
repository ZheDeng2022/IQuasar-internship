  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer incidence, which is recognized as the leading cause of death in children worldwide, is&#xD;
      gradually increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies on children who survive cancer show that the disease and its treatment have side&#xD;
      effects and long-term late effects on the musculoskeletal system, physical function, gait and&#xD;
      cognitive skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, dual task gait performance, in which cognitive and motor tasks are performed&#xD;
      simultaneously, may be affected in pediatric oncology patients. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      compare gait performance in single and dual task conditions in pediatric oncology patients&#xD;
      with healthy controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer incidence, which is recognized as the leading cause of death in children worldwide, is&#xD;
      gradually increasing. About 300,000 children aged 0 to 19 are diagnosed with cancer each&#xD;
      year, according to the international study where the International Agency for Research on&#xD;
      Cancer collected data on neoplasms (malignant and non-malignant) diagnosed in individuals&#xD;
      under 20 years of age between 2001-2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies on children who survive cancer show that the disease and its treatment have side&#xD;
      effects and long-term late effects on the musculoskeletal system, physical function, gait and&#xD;
      cognitive skills. According to the study of Beulertz et al. (2016), active ankle dorsiflexion&#xD;
      limitation, gait disturbances and decrease in walking efficiency were observed in all&#xD;
      pediatric oncology patients, which have an important role in walking, not limited to children&#xD;
      with bone tumors and central nervous system tumors.Intensive chemotherapy (eg methotrexate)&#xD;
      and the use of radiation are thought to cause damage to cortical and subcortical white&#xD;
      matter, resulting in late effects. Symptoms consistent with attention deficit disorder and&#xD;
      mental processing speed, working memory, executive function and memory deficits put cancer&#xD;
      survivors at an intellectual and academic disadvantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, dual task gait performance, in which cognitive and motor tasks are performed&#xD;
      simultaneously, may be affected in pediatric oncology patients. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      compare gait performance in single and dual task conditions in pediatric oncology patients&#xD;
      with healthy controls.&#xD;
