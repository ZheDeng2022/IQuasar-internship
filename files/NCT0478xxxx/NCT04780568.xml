  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial is to find out the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      osimertinib and tegavivint as first-line therapy in treating patients with EGFR-mutant&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic).&#xD;
      Osimertinib and tegavivint may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of osimertinib (AZD9291) in combination with tegavivint&#xD;
      (BC2059) in patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) and determine&#xD;
      the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the objective response rate (ORR) in patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC&#xD;
      treated with the combination of AZD9291 and BC2059.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the progression free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant&#xD;
      NSCLC treated with the combination of AZD9291 and BC2059.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the duration of response (DOR) in patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC&#xD;
      treated with the combination of AZD9291 and BC2059.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC treated&#xD;
      with the combination of AZD9291 and BC2059.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate biomarkers of EGFR, Notch3, and beta-catenin pathway activity in tumor biopsies&#xD;
      and blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD9291 and BC2059 in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      EGFR-mutant NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) at baseline, following 2&#xD;
      and 4 weeks of treatment to evaluate for clearance, and at time of progression to assess for&#xD;
      changes in EGFR mutation status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Measure response using computed tomography (CT) tumor volumetry and dynamic positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET)/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Identify a gene signature that may be predictive of treatment response or resistance using&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing of tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and tegavivint&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive osimertinib PO QD on days&#xD;
      1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then for 4&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

          -  Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, including uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension and active bleeding diatheses, which in the investigator's opinion makes&#xD;
