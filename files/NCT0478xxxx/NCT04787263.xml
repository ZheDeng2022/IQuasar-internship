  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at evaluating the feasibility and safety of the administration of autologous&#xD;
      T cells that have been modified through the introduction of a chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;
      targeting the B-cell surface antigen CD19, following administration of lymphodepleting&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen, in children and adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (B- ALL) or aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). The phase&#xD;
      II extension is aimed at testing the efficacy of the treatment at the optimal dose defined in&#xD;
      the phase I. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that it is feasible to successfully&#xD;
      manufacture CAR T cells to meet the established release criteria at a maximum target dose of&#xD;
      3.0 x 10^6 cells/kilogram recipient total body weight in this patient population using the&#xD;
      Miltenyi CliniMACS Prodigy® closed transduction system.&#xD;
