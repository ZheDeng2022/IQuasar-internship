          -  Participants are overtly healthy as determined by medical evaluation including medical&#xD;
             history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Japanese: Participant is of Japanese descent as evidenced by appearance and verbal&#xD;
             confirmation of familial heritage (a participant has all 4 Japanese grandparents born&#xD;
             in Japan) For Chinese: Participant is of Chinese descent as evidenced by appearance&#xD;
             and verbal confirmation of familial heritage (a participant has all 4 Chinese&#xD;
             grandparents born in China)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator,could jeopardize or would compromise the study participant's ability to&#xD;
             participate in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a history or present condition of cardiovascular, respiratory,&#xD;
             hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrinological, hematological, or neurological&#xD;

             arrhythmia, tachyarrhythmia, or myocardial infarction) capable of significantly&#xD;
             altering the absorption, metabolism, or elimination of investigational medicinal&#xD;
             product (IMP); constituting a risk when taking the study intervention; or interfering&#xD;
             with the interpretation of data&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has abnormal blood pressure (BP). Study participants must have BP and&#xD;
             heart rate (HR) within normal range in the supine position after 5 minutes rest&#xD;
             (systolic blood pressure (SBP): 90 mmHg to 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP):&#xD;
             50 mmHg to 90 mmHg, HR: 50 bpm to 100 bpm). Any values marginally (ie, no more than&#xD;
             5mmHg) outside the normal range but considered not clinically significant by the&#xD;
             Investigator would be allowed. In case of an out-of-range result, 1 repeat will be&#xD;
             allowed. If the readings are out of range again, the study participant will not be&#xD;
             included&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a current history of alcohol or drug use disorder, as defined in&#xD;
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V, within the previous 6 months&#xD;

          -  Participant has a lifetime history of suicide attempt (including an actual attempt,&#xD;
             interrupted attempt, or aborted attempt), or has had suicidal ideation in the past 6&#xD;
             months as indicated by a positive response (&quot;Yes&quot;) to either Question 4 or Question 5&#xD;
             of the &quot;Screening/Baseline&quot; version of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale&#xD;
             (C-SSRS) at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has history of or current clinical signs/symptoms consistent with&#xD;
             suspected and/or confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
             (SARS-CoV-2)/coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (eg, fever, persistent cough,&#xD;
             shortness of breath, fatigue, loss or change to senses of smell or taste)&#xD;
