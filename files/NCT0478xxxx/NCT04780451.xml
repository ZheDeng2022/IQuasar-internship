      Recreational male runners participated in 12 weeks training and omega-3 supplementation&#xD;
      programme. Before starting and at the end of the 12-week cycle, the runners performed an&#xD;
      increasing intensity treadmill test where oxygen uptake and VO2 peak were assessed.&#xD;

      40 healthy, recreational male runners participated in 12 weeks training and supplementation&#xD;
      programme. The training protocol was built based on undulatory load manipulation 3:1, which&#xD;
      was suggested to be effective to prevent overtraining and stress due to oscillations between&#xD;
      volume/intensity. Throughout the study all participants took 4 identical-looking capsules per&#xD;
      day (2 in the morning and 2 in the evening) containing either omega-3 fatty acids or medium&#xD;
      chain triglycerides as placebo in total amount of 4g of fat per day. Before starting and at&#xD;
      the end of the 12-week cycle, the runners performed an increasing intensity treadmill test&#xD;
      where oxygen uptake and VO2 peak were assessed. Additionally, blood was collected to&#xD;
      determine the concentrations of selected proteins (including eNOS, irisin, adiponectin) that&#xD;
      may be associated with potential changes in participants' oxygen uptake during the treadmill&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
