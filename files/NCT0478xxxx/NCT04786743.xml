    <textblock>
      Acute variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding remains a hot potato in cirrhotic patients.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to figure out whether urgent endoscopy (within 6h after&#xD;
      gastroenterological consultation) is superior to non-urgent endoscopy (between 6h and 24h&#xD;
      after gastroenterological consultation) in reducing re-bleeding for these patients. This is a&#xD;
      single-centered, prospective, randomized, and controlled trial. 400 eligible cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients with acute variceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to receive endoscopic intervention either within 6h or 6-24h. Randomization is&#xD;
      conducted by permuted block randomization stratified by age, systolic blood pressure (SBP),&#xD;
      and pulse rate. The primary efficacy endpoint is re-bleeding within 42 days after control of&#xD;
      acute variceal bleeding. This trial will provide valuable insights into the efficacy between&#xD;
      the urgent endoscopy group and the non-urgent endoscopy group.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, we plan to conduct a single-centered, prospective, parallel-group randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial. The study protocol observes the Standard Protocol Items rules:&#xD;
      Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013. The leader of the sponsoring&#xD;
      organization strictly implements oversight of the protocol. We intend to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of improving re-bleeding rates of cirrhotic patients with acute variceal&#xD;
      bleeding (AVB) between the urgent endoscopy and non-urgent endoscopy groups. Department of&#xD;
      gastroenterology, affiliated Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University will take&#xD;
      full charge of this trial, including recruitment of patients, endoscopic intervention,&#xD;
      admission education, in-hospital nursing, subsequent follow-up work, etc. Informed consent&#xD;
      forms from every patient will be signed before enrollment, and approval from the Ethical&#xD;
      Committees of Jinling Hospital has been obtained (authorized ethic No. DZQH-KYLL-21-01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two investigators in our department are responsible for the data collection and storage. One&#xD;
      investigator will inspect the data collected by another one. After finishing the inspection,&#xD;
      the data will be input in the off-line database constructed by the investigators. Instantly&#xD;
      they complete all of the data storage, the two investigators will conduct a double&#xD;
      inspection. The eventual data will be used for data analysis. Theoretically, there will be no&#xD;
      missing data because the investigators will inspect and record every patient's data timely.&#xD;
      Patients with missing data will be excluded from the trial. We will perform source data&#xD;
      verification by comparing them with authentic medical records to assess the accuracy,&#xD;
      completeness, or representativeness of registry data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated 400 patients will be consecutively included in the study between April 2021 and&#xD;
      December 2023. Original Glasgow-Blatchford Score is used to evaluate the condition of each&#xD;
      patient instead of a modified version. The indicators (measured within 2 hours after&#xD;
      admission) are blood urea, hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, pulse, melena, syncope,&#xD;
      hepatic disease, and cardiac failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to research from Ardevol A et al, in the 646 cirrhotic patients with AVB performing&#xD;
      endoscopy within 6h after admission, the 45-day re-bleeding rate was 26%, the results of&#xD;
      which was similar to that in another research by Ping-Hsien Chen (the overall 6-week&#xD;
      re-bleeding rate for cirrhotic patients with AVB was 25.7%). Then, we hypothesized a&#xD;
      difference of 14% would be clinically significant in re-bleeding rate. Next, we calculated at&#xD;
      least 189 patients in each group would embody the discrepancy (26% vs. 40%), with the&#xD;
      statistical power of 80% and a two-sided α level of 5%. Assuming that a certain number of&#xD;
      patients in each group will be lost to follow-up, a minimum of about 200 patients would be&#xD;
      necessary for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and time set&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive endoscopic intervention&#xD;
      either within 6h or 6-24h. Randomization is conducted by permuted block randomization&#xD;
      stratified by age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and pulse rate. The block size is&#xD;
      pre-specified, but physicians and investigators are not notified of this during the study.&#xD;
      Allocation concealment is implemented by the mobile client randomization tool &quot;Randomization&#xD;
      Allocation Tool (RAT)&quot;. There are two primary sources of patients. The majority of these&#xD;
      patients are from the emergency department, and the others are patients with cirrhosis who&#xD;
      developed AVB during hospitalization. For patients from the emergency department, the&#xD;
      interval between admission and receiving gastroenterological consultation will be controlled&#xD;
      within 10 minutes by applying the emergency green channel. However, for patients during&#xD;
      hospitalization, the time should be calculated as receiving an evaluation by the emergency&#xD;
      endoscopic team (gastroenterological consultation). In order to make it easier to record, the&#xD;
      time will be uniformly calculated as receiving gastroenterological consultation, whatever the&#xD;
      sources of patients are. The patients will be randomly allocated to undergo urgent endoscopy&#xD;
      within 6h or non-urgent endoscopy between 6h and 24h after gastroenterological consultation.&#xD;
      The following time data will be recorded: (I) time from presenting with symptoms of acute&#xD;
      variceal bleeding to admission (patients from the emergency department); (II) time from&#xD;
      admission to gastroenterological consultation (patients from the emergency department); (III)&#xD;
      time from admission to endoscopy (patients from the emergency department); (IV) time from&#xD;
      presentation to gastroenterological consultation (patients develop AVB during&#xD;
      hospitalization); (V) time from gastroenterological consultation to endoscopy (all of the&#xD;
      patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control of acute bleeding, persistent bleeding, and re-bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVB under endoscopy refers to bleed gushing or seeping from esophageal or gastric varices.&#xD;
      Control of AVB refers to persistent bleeding signs that do not occur within 24h after the&#xD;
      initial endoscopic intervention. Persistent bleeding refers to bleeding that can not be&#xD;
      controlled after the initial endoscopic intervention within 24h. Persistent bleeding is&#xD;
      defined as follows (at least one item appears): (I) vomiting of fresh blood or suction of&#xD;
      more than 100 ml fresh blood from the nasogastric tube; (II) occurring hemorrhagic shock;&#xD;
      (III) review of hemoglobin level decreasing by 30 g/L in the absence of a blood transfusion.&#xD;
      Re-bleeding refers to recurrent bleeding after control of acute bleeding. The re-bleeding is&#xD;
      defined as follows (at least one item appears): (I) hematemesis/melena/hematochezia; (II)&#xD;
      with systolic blood pressure dropping by more than 20mmHg from the original level or heart&#xD;
      rate increases by 20 beats/min; (III) review of hemoglobin level decreasing by 30 g/L in the&#xD;
      absence of a blood transfusion. Patients with persistent or re-bleeding will take secondary&#xD;
      endoscopic intervention or be transferred to undergo other treatment (surgery or transjugular&#xD;
      intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt [TIPSS]) instantaneously according to the patient's&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      (I) Before endoscopic intervention: all the patients take uninterrupted intravenous&#xD;
      administration of high dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs, 8 mg/h), somatostatin (250 μg/h),&#xD;
      and preventive application of antibiotics; (II) Initial endoscopic intervention: patients who&#xD;
      conform to non-variceal bleeding under endoscopy will not be included in this trial, but the&#xD;
      emergency endoscopic team will still strictly follow the procedure to conduct standard&#xD;
      treatment for them. For patients conforming to AVB, we use tissue&#xD;
      adhesive/sclerotherapy/variceal ligation/covered stent as the treatment methods for varicose&#xD;
      veins. The patient's position is chosen to expose the best field of vision under endoscopy,&#xD;
      and the external cannula for endoscopy is used to prevent aspiration according to the&#xD;
      patient's condition. Furthermore, initial endoscopic treatment aim at the varicose vein of&#xD;
      the bleeding site solely. After the endoscopic treatment, the patients will be transferred to&#xD;
      the gastroenterological care unit; (III) After the initial endoscopic intervention: all the&#xD;
      patients are treated with continuous high dose PPIs (8 mg/h) and intravenous infusion of&#xD;
      somatostatin (250 μg/h) for 72h, with the preventive application of antibiotics for no more&#xD;
      than 120h; during the follow-up, oral propranolol and ultrasound-guided tissue glue injection&#xD;
      therapy could be used as secondary prevention according to the patient's condition; (IV) The&#xD;
      emergency endoscopic team consists of three experienced endoscopists, each with more than ten&#xD;
      years of experience in endoscopy and over 500 cases of variceal hemostasis under endoscopy.&#xD;
      Also, there are several seasoned endoscopic nurses included, who have experience in&#xD;
      endoscopic work for more than five years, are proficient in applying endoscopic treatment&#xD;
      instruments, and cooperate with endoscopists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up time&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, the follow-up work will begin. All the patients included will be&#xD;
      followed up to no less than 42 days after control of AVB. When patients' conditions are&#xD;
      stable, further treatment of varicose veins should be decided according to their wishes and&#xD;
      statutory agents. Patients with good compliance will take standard endoscopic treatment every&#xD;
      3-4 weeks after control of AVB or re-bleeding, and the follow-up time should be once a week;&#xD;
      patients who decline to accept further treatment are followed up only once a week. The&#xD;
      follow-up forms could be either by telephone or outpatient review. If the patients are lost&#xD;
      to follow-up during the follow-up period, the eventual outpatient review or telephone dates&#xD;
      will be treated as the follow-up endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analyses are performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).&#xD;
      Continuous variables are expressed in terms of mean ± standard deviation. Student's t-test&#xD;
      and Wilcoxon rank-sum test are applied to compare normally and non-normally distributed data,&#xD;
      respectively. Categorical variables are compared employing Fisher's exact test. The analyses&#xD;
      for the primary efficacy endpoint of re-bleeding rate within 42 days between the urgent&#xD;
      endoscopy and non-urgent endoscopy groups are performed in the intention-to-treat population.&#xD;
      The rates difference and 95% CI of the two groups are calculated with and without the&#xD;
      randomization stratification factors. Besides, the re-bleeding rates are also estimated using&#xD;
      the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test is used to compare the difference in mortality and&#xD;
      re-bleeding rates between the two groups. Cox proportional hazards regression model is used&#xD;
      to estimate the hazard ratio and 95% CI. A forest plot is employed to analyze risk factors&#xD;
      affecting mortality and re-bleeding rates. Schoenfeld residual test is applied to verify&#xD;
      whether the model meets the proportional risk (PH) hypothesis. The secondary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoints are assessed in the per-protocol population. There is no prespecified plan to&#xD;
      adjust for multiple comparisons of the secondary efficacy endpoints; the analyses for&#xD;
      secondary efficacy endpoints should not be used to infer treatment effects. Prespecified&#xD;
      subgroup analyses include age (≥60 ys or &lt;60 ys), SBP (≥90 mmHg or &lt;90 mmHg), pulse rate&#xD;
      (≥100 beats/min or &lt;100 beats/min), etc. All the P values are two-tailed, and p &lt; 0.05 is&#xD;
      considered to be a significant difference.&#xD;
