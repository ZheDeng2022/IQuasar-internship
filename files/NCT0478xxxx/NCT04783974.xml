  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the correlation between the assumption of systemic&#xD;
      medications (such as SSRI, PPI, anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-hypertensive drugs) and the&#xD;
      failure of dental implant therapy in terms of occurrence peri-implantitis and/or implant&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical records of all subjects treated with dental implants during the period between&#xD;
      January 1st, 2005, and December 31st, 2020 in the Dental Clinic of the IRCCS Istituto&#xD;
      Ortopedico Galeazzi (Milan, Italy) will be screened for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: i) subjects who were 18 years old or older at the time of intervention;&#xD;
      ii) subjects who provided their informed consent for the intervention iii) patients with&#xD;
      total or partial edentulism treated with dental implants; iv) patients with at least 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up, beginning from the date of placement of the prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: i) incomplete data (e.g. absence of periapical radiographs) Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be provided by means of mean values and standard deviations. Correlation&#xD;
      between baseline parameters and outcomes will be provided through logistic regression.&#xD;
      Survival tables and Kaplan-Meier analysis will be elaborated for survival analysis,&#xD;
      considering the occurrence of implant failure and the diagnosis of peri-implantitis as&#xD;
      events. Cox regression analysis will be used in order to evaluate the influence of the use of&#xD;
      each drug on survival curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of significance was set at p&lt;0.05. The sample size was calculated in order to&#xD;
      evaluate the hazard risk of patients exposed to each specific drug (SSRI, PPI,&#xD;
      Anti-inflammatory drugs or anti-hypertensive) compared to non-exposed patients. The ratio of&#xD;
      exposed/non-exposed patients is expected to be 1:4 in the cohort. On the basis of a&#xD;
      hypothesized 5-year incidence of peri-implantitis of 0.16, HR = 2, and a 10% dropout rate,&#xD;
      the sample should be made of 358 subjects (72 exposed + 286 not exposed).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Global demographic trends clearly show the increase in life expectancy and, as a direct&#xD;
      consequence of progressive aging, the prevalence of disabling diseases with the relative&#xD;
      intake of drugs. The intake of drugs such as thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatories, proton pump inhibitors and serotonin re-uptake inhibitors has been shown&#xD;
      to be able to modulate bone metabolism with different mechanisms. Thus, they may be able to&#xD;
      influence peri-implant health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proton pump blockers (PPIs) are a class of gastric acid secretion inhibitors that are&#xD;
      currently among the best-selling drugs worldwide. The use of PPIs, especially at high doses&#xD;
      and/or in long-term treatments, has been associated to an increased risk of hip, wrist and&#xD;
      spine fractures. Different mechanisms have been suggested to explain the effects of PPIs on&#xD;
      bone metabolism, which include: reduction of calcium absorption due to an increased pH in the&#xD;
      small intestine; reduction of the osteoclastic resorption activity due to the modulation of&#xD;
      vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) at the membrane level in the vesicles of osteoclasts; inhibition&#xD;
      of non-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and FOSFO1 in the vesicles of the bone matrix,&#xD;
      increasing the expression of osteocalcin and the osteoprotegerin/RANKL ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are currently among the most common&#xD;
      antidepressants and their main indications are major depression, generalized anxiety&#xD;
      disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic attack&#xD;
      syndrome and bulimia. The action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on&#xD;
      certain receptors and transporters such as 5-HT1B, 5-HT2B or 5-HT2C can result in impaired&#xD;
      bone metabolism through increased differentiation and activation of osteoclasts. Reductions&#xD;
      in bone mineral density (BMD) have been described, among others, in patients suffering from&#xD;
      depressive syndromes which appear to be related to alterations in serotonin function. These&#xD;
      findings suggest the hypothesis that SSRIs may have an impact also on the osseointegration&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-hypertensive drugs medications have been proven to interfere with bone metabolism&#xD;
      through different mechanisms. For example, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme&#xD;
      inhibitors are able to inhibit osteoclasts activity by blocking the surface β-2 adrenergic&#xD;
      receptors, which affects the renin-angiotensin system, while thiazides may enhance bone&#xD;
      formation by increasing calcium absorption at the distal convoluted tubule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic corticosteroids are associated to various adverse reactions, especially when used at&#xD;
      high doses or for long periods. Fracture and osteoporosis are among the most common&#xD;
      corticosteroid-related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism through which NSAIDs may negatively affect bone healing has not been fully&#xD;
      explained, but it seems to be mostly related to the COX-2 blockade. Actually, it was proven&#xD;
      that COX-2 is necessary for mesenchymal cells to differentiate into osteoblasts during&#xD;
      fracture healing, while cele-coxib and other COX-2 blockers were reported to have a negative&#xD;
      effect on the healing process by limiting osteogenesis and decreasing the osteogenic&#xD;
      potential of mesenchymal stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to investigate if the systemic assumption of medications (such&#xD;
      as SSRIs, PPIs, anti-inflammatory drugs, and anti-hypertensive drugs) could imply an&#xD;
      increased risk of developing peri-implantitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims will be to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the augmented risk of implant failure correlated to the assumption of drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the correlation between the use of drugs and implant cumulative survival rate (CSR%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the relationship between drug dosage and the development of peri-implantitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  relationship between drug dosage and implant failure The present will be a&#xD;
           single-center, retrospective, observational, comparative study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of implant survival will be based on the fact that the implant is still in&#xD;
      situ, stable, and supporting a functional prosthesis. An implant that was removed or&#xD;
      spontaneously lost due to failed osseointegration will be considered an implant failure.&#xD;
      Peri-implantitis will be defined according to the following parameters: 1) presence of&#xD;
      bleeding and/or suppuration on gentle probing; 2) presence of radiographic bone loss of at&#xD;
      least 2 mm, beyond crestal bone level changes due to initial bone remodeling, evaluated&#xD;
      through comparison of baseline (one year after surgical intervention) and follow-up&#xD;
      periapical radiographs; in absence of baseline periapical radiographs, presence of bone level&#xD;
      located ≥ 3 mm apical to the most coronal portion of the intraosseous portion of the implant;&#xD;
      3) presence of an increased probing depth as compared to previous observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be collected from clinical records:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's age and sex at the time of surgical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  description of systemic diseases (if any) at the time of surgical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  description of pharmacological therapy (if any) at the time of surgical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  smoking status (number of cigarettes (if reported)) at the time of surgical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  history of periodontal disease before the surgical intervention or at the time of&#xD;
           surgical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  date of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  implant position&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  implant brand and type, diameter, length, diameter of the prosthetic platform&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  characteristics of the bone regeneration procedure (if performed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  description of surgical complications (if any)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  characteristics and timing of prosthetic rehabilitation (provisional and definitive)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  date of the last clinical control&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  date of the last radiographic control&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  failure occurrence date (if any)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  peri-implantitis occurrence date (if any)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  oral hygiene level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  frequency of maintenance recall sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be performed in a maximum period of 5 months. Data analysis will take a&#xD;
      maximum of 4 months, for a total duration of 9 months. The collected data refer to clinical&#xD;
      records of patients treated with implants from January 1st, 2005 to June 30th, 2020 (last&#xD;
      follow-up included: 6 month visit on December 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated in order to evaluate the hazard risk of patients exposed to a&#xD;
      specific drug (SSRI, PPI, Anti-inflammatory drugs or anti-hypertensive) compared to&#xD;
      non-exposed patients. The ratio of exposed/non-exposed patients is expected to be 1:4 in the&#xD;
      cohort. The 5-year incidence in non-exposed patients in a previous series of cases resulted&#xD;
      0.16, and an HR=2 is expected in the exposed patients. On the basis of these assumptions,&#xD;
      considering a 10% dropout rate, the sample should be made of 358 subjects (72 exposed + 286&#xD;
      not exposed ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a total of 358 patients who was exposed at least to one of the study drugs will be&#xD;
      included: each subject will be evaluated both in the test group of the exposure drug (vs the&#xD;
      group of subjects who did not take that drug), and in the control group for the drugs that&#xD;
      he/she has not taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation was performed using the method proposed by Schoenfeld. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      will be provided by means of mean values and standard deviations. Correlation between&#xD;
      baseline parameters and outcomes will be provided through the use of logistic regression.&#xD;
      Survival tables and Kaplan-Meier analysis will be elaborated for survival analysis,&#xD;
      considering the occurrence of implant failure and the diagnosis of peri-implantitis as&#xD;
      events. Cox regression analysis will be used in order to evaluate the influence of the use of&#xD;
      SSRI and/or PPI on survival curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all the analysis, the level of significance was set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
