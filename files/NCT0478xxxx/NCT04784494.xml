      This trial aims to test the feasibility of Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST) for Depression in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-arm open-label feasibility trial testing the feasibility of MST&#xD;
      for dPD. The trial will occur over 18 months at one academic center in Canada (UBC). The&#xD;
      enrollment goal is 20 patients with Parkinson's disease and comorbid moderate/severe&#xD;
      depression. Research subjects will provide informed consent before enrollment and&#xD;
      participation in any research procedures.The study design follows international CONSORT&#xD;
      guidelines for the reporting of results in feasibility trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered two days per week (Tuesday/Thursday). This frequency has been&#xD;
      chosen as research indicates that depression outcomes at the end of a course of ECT are&#xD;
      similar between twice and thrice a week session, but twice a week sessions are associated&#xD;
      with fewer cognitive side effects. Depression symptoms will be assessed with the Inventory&#xD;
      for Depressive Symptoms. Response and remission will follow standard definition of decrease&#xD;
      ≥50% (response) and IDS &lt; 10 (remission). Patients will receive a maximum of 16 treatments.&#xD;
      This maximum treatment number was chosen as the number of ECT treatments for an index course&#xD;
      in depression is 12, but available data on MST indicates that MST may require more treatment&#xD;
      sessions to achieve remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To evaluate the feasibility of using MST to treat dPD in preparation for a future&#xD;
      definite superiority trial comparing active MST vs. sham MST for depression in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: Enrollment will be ≥70% of the planned target (i.e. 14 out of 20&#xD;
      participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: Retention rate of randomized participants will be ≥70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To characterize the side effect profile of MST in dPD, with particular emphasis on&#xD;
      cardiovascular and cognitive side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a: Drop out rates due to side effects during treatment will be ≤10%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To obtain mean, SD, and 95% confidence intervals of potential outcome variables for&#xD;
      the future RCT to estimate the sample size of the future RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To explore the use of EEG as a biomarker of treatment response and correlate of&#xD;
      response to MST&#xD;

    <description>MST treatment will be administered over the frontal/vertex cortex using 100 Hz stimulation using the MagPro XP MST with Cool TwinCoil. The MST determination of seizure threshold will be done using 100% machine output applied at 100 Hz at progressively escalating train durations, commencing at 2 seconds and increasing by 2 seconds with each subsequent stimulation until an adequate seizure is produced. During subsequent sessions, one stimulation will be delivered using a train duration that is 4 seconds longer than the train duration at threshold (with a maximum train duration of 10 seconds).&#xD;
MST treatments will be administered twice a week, for up to 16 treatments. This will be performed under the effect of anesthesia. The treatment procedure is approximately 10 minutes, followed by a recovery period of approximately 30 minutes.</description>
