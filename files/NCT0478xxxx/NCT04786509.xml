      Wireless body ECG sensor is a feasible solution for reliable and accurate long-term heart&#xD;
      rhythm monitoring. However, there were no studies that delt with usability of this sensor in&#xD;
      field testing. Accordingly, the aim of the study is to evaluate the quality of ECG signal&#xD;
      measured with wearable wireless ECG body-sensor when used in field test settings and to&#xD;
      determine how different types of sensors' fixation affect quality of the ECG signal during&#xD;
      submaximal and maximal running settings. Twenty-three participants, 10 females and 13 males,&#xD;
      were included in the study (20.56±1.19 years). All subjects performed shuttle run (SR),&#xD;
      Cooper 2400 m (C), and 100 m sprint test (S), once wearing the sensor attached to&#xD;
      self-adhesive skin electrodes, additionally fixed with self-adhesive tapes, and secondly with&#xD;
      the sensor attached to Polar belt and strapped around the chests. Test outcomes were compared&#xD;
      applying Student t-test for dependent variables, or non-parametric Wilcoxon test, depending&#xD;
      on the results of normality test.&#xD;

      Today's lifestyle presents high risk for cardiovascular diseases, which is a leading cause of&#xD;
      death worldwide. Previous studies have targeted various risk factors for development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases, such as high blood pressure, smoking, type 2 diabetes, obesity,&#xD;
      psychological stress and physical inactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased level of physical activity has numerous beneficial long-term effects on&#xD;
      cardiovascular system, and might decrease relative risk of sudden cardiac death. However, the&#xD;
      risk of unexpected cardiovascular events is increased during, and immediately after intense&#xD;
      exercise. Two studies conducted in France, reported a daily incidence of three sudden deaths&#xD;
      and four myocardial infarctions during regular physical activity in the general population.&#xD;
      Twelve-year longitudinal study showed that average age of young recreational athletes in&#xD;
      Switzerland who died during physical activity was 27.6 years, with the incidence of&#xD;
      0.52/100.000 per year. Some studies reported dramatic increase of unexpected cardiovascular&#xD;
      events in a middle age group of recreational population, which was at the level of&#xD;
      6.5/100.000 per year. Furthermore, several studies reported higher incidence of sports&#xD;
      related cardiovascular events between general population in comparison with professional&#xD;
      athletes. Males are more affected, and the most affected age group is middle-aged between 35&#xD;
      and 59 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies noticed that the key challenge is identification of structural heart disease&#xD;
      and inheritable conditions that increase incidence for lethal arrhythmias during exercise,&#xD;
      because sudden cardiac events often occurs without any warning or prediction. Therefore,&#xD;
      early detection of persons with higher risk for sudden cardiac death is of crucial&#xD;
      importance. In this regard, numerous European countries have introduced a mandatory medical&#xD;
      examination for all persons registered in sports clubs or associations. Exercise stress test&#xD;
      (EST) which includes electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is an important part of&#xD;
      examination. However, the problem arises from the fact that EST is especially sensitive for&#xD;
      testing individuals with previous known symptoms of cardiac disease, while the positive&#xD;
      predictive value of an EST in asymptomatic subjects is relatively low. On the other hand, it&#xD;
      was proven that long term ECG monitoring during regular daily activities can be very useful&#xD;
      in detection of heart disease in people who had normal 12-lead ECG, and negative Master&#xD;
      two-step tests. Also, it was proven that it is possible to detect atrial fibrillation in&#xD;
      asymptomatic people with long-term one-channel ECG monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies showed that the wireless body ECG sensor is a feasible solution for reliable&#xD;
      and accurate long-term heart rhythm monitoring, but the sensor placement and fixation is an&#xD;
      important factor which can influence the signal quality and needs to be taken into&#xD;
      consideration. In accordance with previously said, our main goal was to determine whether it&#xD;
      is possible to measure quality electrocardiographic report using ECG body-sensor during&#xD;
      standardized outdoor tests. Additional aim was to determine whether different types of&#xD;
      sensors' fixation affect quality of the ECG signal during submaximal and maximal running&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-three were included, 13 males and 10 females, age between 19 and 23 years (Age =&#xD;
      20.56±1.19 years; Body height = 177.28±9.76 cm; Body mass = 70.11±7.68 kg). All participants&#xD;
      were physically active non-athletes, with daily involvement (3-5 times per week, 30 to 60&#xD;
      minutes of moderate to high intensity) in various physical activities (team sports, cyclic&#xD;
      activities, resistance training). To meet the criteria for participation in the study,&#xD;
      participants had to confirm they were healthy, and without known previous cardiac problems.&#xD;
      In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki participants gave the signed consent for&#xD;
      participation in the study. Prior to the tests, the purpose and protocols of the study were&#xD;
      explained in details to each participant. Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the&#xD;
      Institutional Ethical committee (Approval no. 02-1359/18-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG Signal Monitoring Wireless ECG body-sensor Savvy (Saving d.o.o., Ljubljana, Slovenia),&#xD;
      which is a certified medical device, was used for collecting ECG data. The body-sensor allows&#xD;
      ECG measurements during long-term exercise, with a sampling rate between 125 Hz and 1000 Hz.&#xD;
      An Android application, MobECG, which runs on a smartphone, connected to the sensor via&#xD;
      Bluetooth, captures and displays the measured data and saves it in the smartphone memory for&#xD;
      further processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal placement for the electrodes was close to the heart in order to obtain the&#xD;
      appropriate amplitude of ECG signal. Considering that the signals from the electrical&#xD;
      muscular activity (EMG) could disturb the ECG signal, especially during physical activity,&#xD;
      sensor position was placed to avoid large muscle groups. In this study, we tested position&#xD;
      marked as left inferior (LI). At the LI position electrodes were placed at the positions of&#xD;
      standard anterior precordial leads V1 and V2, and then sensor was translated downward by&#xD;
      approximately 10 cm (below the xiphoid), where the influence of muscular disturbances is&#xD;
      expected to be minimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first test standard self-adhesive Skintact ECG electrodes type PREMIER T-60 were used&#xD;
      (Leonhard Lang GmbH, Innsbruck, Austria). The electrodes were in the original packaging and&#xD;
      used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ECG electrodes were positioned 5 cm&#xD;
      apart. Before the positioning, the skin of the subjects was cleaned with diluted ethanol.&#xD;
      Then, two electrodes were stuck at the LI position, and the ECG body-sensor was connected.&#xD;
      Sensor was additionally fixed with self-adhesive Omniplast 2.5 cm tape (Paul Hartmann AG,&#xD;
      Heidenheim, Germany), specially designed to fix Holter electrodes (see Figure 1). Both parts&#xD;
      of the sensor were fixed together with one, approximately 40-cm-long strip of tape. In the&#xD;
      second measurement Polar soft strap belt (Polar Electro Oy, Finland) was used to connect the&#xD;
      sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measured ECG data were continuously stored in the smartphone memory and transferred after&#xD;
      the completion of the measurements to a personal computer. All the ECG measurements were&#xD;
      analysed retrospectively. The subsequent ECG analyses and signal quality were made with&#xD;
      medically certified Holter interpretation software QuickReader®AFT-1000 (Holter Supplies,&#xD;
      Paris, France). Moreover, all the measurements and the results were visually examined by a&#xD;
      medical doctor. Only signals where QRS waves were clear and recognized without doubt where&#xD;
      marked as useful. Variables used in study were: Detected QRS, QRS detected as negative (%),&#xD;
      False negative detection (%), Correct software detection (%), Load / speed with still&#xD;
      assessable HR (%), Maximal HR [bpm], Average running time (s) (for Cooper 2400 and 100 m&#xD;
      tests) and Average achieved intensity (for Shutlle run).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we used three different standardized running tests, one sub-maximal test -&#xD;
      Cooper 2400 m (C), and two maximal (all-out) tests - 100 m sprint (S) and shuttle run (SR).&#xD;
      In C test participants had to run 2400 m, while in S test they had to run 100 m at the&#xD;
      highest possible speed. In SR test standard test protocol was used. Participants had to run&#xD;
      20 meters and step across the line before audio sign (beep). Test started with speed of 8.5&#xD;
      km/h which was increased 0.5 km/h every minute, until exhaustion. Test was finished when&#xD;
      subject couldn't reach the line two times in a row, before audio sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participant made six tests, two C, S and SR tests. All tests were made in the morning,&#xD;
      and participant performed one test per day and retest until next day. Break between two tests&#xD;
      was at least 24 hours. Before performing the tests, the electrodes and sensor were positioned&#xD;
      at the LI position, and the participants sat down for 5 minutes, while the ECG was recording.&#xD;
      When the test was finished the participant sat down and rest for next 5 minutes without&#xD;
      interrupting the ECG recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics were calculated for all measured variables, and test of normality was&#xD;
      made for all the data. For the data which was not distributed normally by Kolmogorov-Smirnov&#xD;
      and Shapiro-Wilk test results, based on the results of Skewness, transformation with function&#xD;
      Log10 or Log10 reflexion was made. For all original and transformed variables that showed&#xD;
      normal distribution, for determination of differences student t-test for dependent variables&#xD;
      was used, while non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used for those which were not distributed&#xD;
      normally. Intra-class correlation was counted for repeated measurements. The significance&#xD;
      level was set to p &lt; 0.05. The statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics&#xD;
      20 software.&#xD;
