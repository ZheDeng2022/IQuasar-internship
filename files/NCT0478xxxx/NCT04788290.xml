      This study examines quality of life and patient satisfaction in postmenopausal women&#xD;
      receiving raloxifene to prevent/treat osteoporosis, and vitamin D to reduce risk of fracture&#xD;
      using clinical practice data. The purpose of this study is to observe quality of life(QOL),&#xD;
      medication compliance and patient satisfaction who got combination therapy with&#xD;
      raloxifene/cholecalciferol (raloxifene 60mg + cholecalciferol 800 IU, Rabone D®, Hanmi&#xD;
      Pharma, South Korea) for 6 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Preventing bone loss is an important concern for women during post-menopausal period.&#xD;
      Menopause significantly speeds bone loss and increases the risk for osteoporosis. This study&#xD;
      was to investigate the effectiveness on quality of life (QOL), patient satisfaction in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene/cholecalciferol combination therapy. In addition,&#xD;
      we analyzed adverse events to assess the safety profile of this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-critical observational study of women receiving&#xD;
      raloxifene/cholecalciferol (raloxifene 60mg + cholecalciferol 800 IU, Rabone D®, Hanmi&#xD;
      Pharma, South Korea) combination therapy to treat or prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis.&#xD;
      Data will be collected from patients receiving routine treatment at about 105 primary,&#xD;
      secondary, or tertiary medical institutions in South Korea. Each subject visits the&#xD;
      institution according to the protocol that designed the follow-up visits for six months to&#xD;
      examine changes in, and factors influencing quality of life (EQ-5D-5L method), patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with efficacy and convenience (questionnaire), and safety. This study will&#xD;
      approved by the institutions' IRBs and is in compliance with clinical research ethics&#xD;
      regulations.&#xD;

    <description>Change and impact factor of quality of life measured with the EuroQol (EQ-5D)&#xD;
EQ-5D-5L is designed to measure health conditions and it consists of 5 questions relating to mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Measuring EQ-5D is performed at each visit.&#xD;
The EQ-5D-5L consists of descriptive system with 5 dimensions. Each dimension has 5 levels: No problems(1), Slight problems(2), Moderate problems(3), Severe problems(4), and Extreme problems(5).</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This study is to learn more about the relationship between quality of life, patient satisfaction and medication compliance. Measuring medication compliance is performed at each visit. The subjects taking more than 80% are defined as compliance group, and the subjects taking less than 80% are defined as non-compliance group. Medication compliance will be compared between compliance group and non-compliance group.</description>

    <description>This study is to learn more about quality of life changes compared with prior medication regimens. At visit 1, all subjects conduct questionnaire surveys about quality of life. If there are subjects having prior medication regimens for osteoporosis treatment/prevention, these regimens are classified by medication group to compare and evaluate the change in quality of life after taking combination therapy with raloxifene/cholecalciferol. The prior medications are standardized according to ATC(Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) classification and analyzed based on level 4 and level 5. Change of EQ-5D index according to prior medication regimens is analyzed with average difference of the sum value.</description>
