      The object is to investigate the effects of a modified Mediterranean diet learning&#xD;
      intervention program with a Mini-flipped game strategy on dietary behavior and cognitive&#xD;
      function of elderly people in the community. Eighty-four participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the experimental group and the control group. The intervention group will last&#xD;
      for 8 weeks, with a 3 week of followup. The measurements include Mediterranean eating&#xD;
      behavior, cognitive function, sleep quality, and depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background：The world is facing an aging population, with an increase in the number of people&#xD;
      with mild cognitive impairment and dementia, creating a huge burden of medical costs for&#xD;
      individuals, families, and society. Previous studies have shown that the Mediterranean Diet&#xD;
      (MD) delays cognitive decline, but older adults are less likely to follow the Mediterranean&#xD;
      Diet and have less knowledge about the risk of dementia and protective factors of the diet.&#xD;
      This study will integrate the Asian version of the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid and local&#xD;
      ingredients from Taiwan to design a nutritional health education and game intervention for&#xD;
      the Mediterranean Diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposes：To investigate the effectiveness of developing a Mini-flipped Game-based Learning&#xD;
      strategy to promote dietary behavior and cognitive function in the community elderly with a&#xD;
      modified diet learning intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods：A randomized controlled trial is used to recruit 90 participants and then randomly&#xD;
      allocated to the experimental group and control group. In the experimental group, the&#xD;
      mini-flipped Game-based Learning strategy was used in the intervention of Modified&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet learning for the elderly in the community. The intervention was 8 weeks,&#xD;
      forty minutes adjusted Mediterranean diet learning plan once a week, which includes the&#xD;
      relationship between Mediterranean diet and dementia, knowledge of Mediterranean diet, how to&#xD;
      integrate local food ingredients into Mediterranean diet, etc. The control group was given a&#xD;
      balanced diet nutrition health education manual for the aged. All participants will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline(0 weeks), post-test(8 weeks), and follow-up(12 weeks) assessment. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is Mediterranean dietary behavior and nutritional knowledge, and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contribution： In this study, the use of a mini-flipped Game-based Learning strategy in&#xD;
      learning intervention can enhance participants' understanding of the nutritional knowledge&#xD;
      and importance of the Modified Mediterranean diet, and thus improve eating behavior and&#xD;
      cognitive function. The study is also helpful to integrate the Mediterranean diet into life&#xD;
      through this community engagement process and expect the elderly in the community to achieve&#xD;
      positive health promotion behaviors.&#xD;
