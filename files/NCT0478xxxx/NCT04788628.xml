  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the role of coordinated brain rhythms during sleep in memory&#xD;
      consolidation and determine whether playing precisely timed brief bursts of noise can enhance&#xD;
      these rhythms and improve memory in epilepsy inpatients with implanted hippocampal&#xD;
      electrodes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will test the hypotheses that coordinated brain rhythms during nonrapid eye&#xD;
      movement sleep are associated with memory consolidation and can be enhanced with auditory&#xD;
      stimulation (playing precisely timed brief bursts of quiet noise) to improve memory. The&#xD;
      investigators will measure differences in sleep and memory performance in epilepsy inpatients&#xD;
      with implanted hippocampal electrodes and continuous full scalp EEG monitoring under three&#xD;
      overnight sleep conditions: a baseline night; a memory night during which sleep-dependent&#xD;
      memory consolidation is assessed with the finger tapping motor sequence task (MST) with&#xD;
      training prior to sleep and testing the next morning; and a stimulation night during which&#xD;
      participants train on the MST, have precisely timed auditory stimulation during the sleep&#xD;
      that follows, and are tested on the MST in the morning.&#xD;
