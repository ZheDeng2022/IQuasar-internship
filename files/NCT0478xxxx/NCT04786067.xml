  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to identify kidney transplant patients that can be transitioned&#xD;
      from multi-drug immunosuppression therapy to Belatacept monotherapy, using cell free DNA and&#xD;
      gene expression as markers of immune quiescence. The primary objective will be to determine&#xD;
      if donor derived-cell free DNA (AlloSure) can be utilized to facilitate Belatacept&#xD;
      monotherapy, and to determine if Belatacept is safe and effective as immunosuppression in&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipients. The secondary objective is to determine the utility of AlloMap&#xD;
      as a predictor of immune quiescence and tolerance of immunosuppressive de-escalation to&#xD;
      Belatacept monotherapy, and to evaluate the performance of iBox in predicting adverse&#xD;
      outcomes in patients transitioned to Belatacept monotherapy&#xD;

    <measure>Negative predictable value as measured by AlloMap®</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the start of immunosuppression wean</time_frame>
    <description>Negative predictable value measured by AlloMap®, expressed as a percent, that the patient is not experiencing rejection at the time of testing.&#xD;
AlloMap® is a panel of 20 gene assays, 11 informative and 9 used for normalization and/or quality control, which produces gene expression data used in the calculation of an AlloMap test score - an integer ranging from 0 to 40. Compared with patients in the same post- transplant period, the lower the score, the lower the probability of acute cellular rejection at the time of testing.</description>

    <description>iBox is the validated tool for predicting the risk of kidney transplant loss based on artificial intelligence. Range of score is 0%-100%, higher score indicates better kidney survival.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients included in this arm are kidney transplant recipients with stable kidney function currently on or are converting to a Belatacept based immunosuppression regimen. Eligible patients who are deemed immune quiescent after a 3 month monitoring period will undergo sequential withdrawal of immunosuppression medications over a 12 month period from a three drug regimen to a Belatacept only immunosuppression regimen. During the total 15 month period patients will be monitored with monthly clinic visits, blood draws for routine monitoring as well as donor derived cell free DNA and genetic testing through KidneyCare to monitor immune suppression.</description>

    <description>Patients will have tapering of their multi-drug immunosuppression, until Belatacept is the sole medication in their immunosuppression regimen. Belatacept will be administered as an infusion, as is routinely done clinically.</description>
