    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of acalabrutinib, umbralisib, and ublituximab in&#xD;
      treating previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma. Acalabrutinib and umbralisib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Ublituximab is&#xD;
      a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Giving acalabrutinib and umbralisib with ublituximab may work better in treating mantle cell&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of acalabrutinib, umbralisib and ublituximab (AU2)&#xD;
      regimen as induction therapy in patients with treatment-naïve mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), as&#xD;
      assessed by the complete response (CR) rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) to AU2 in treatment-naive MCL. II. Evaluate the&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and duration of response (DOR) in&#xD;
      patients with treatment-naïve MCL who received AU2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of AU2 in patients with treatment-naive MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Examine the T-cell populations and functionality in patients treated with AU2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore the predictive value of minimal residual disease (MRD) in MCL. III. Explore the&#xD;
      mechanisms of resistance to AU2 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive ublituximab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes-4 hours on days 1,&#xD;
      8, and 15 of cycle 1 and days 1 of cycles 2-6. Patients also receive acalabrutinib orally&#xD;
      (PO) twice daily (BID) and umbralisib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive ublituximab IV on day 1 on cycles 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20,&#xD;
      22, 24, 26, 28, 30. Patients also receive acalabrutinib Po BID and umbralisib PO QD on day&#xD;
      1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 6&#xD;
      months for 2 years.&#xD;
