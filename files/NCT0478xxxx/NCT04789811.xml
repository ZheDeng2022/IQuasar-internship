      The Investigators aim to evaluate the effectiveness of dry needling treatment in addition to&#xD;
      stretching exercises on cramp duration, cramp intensity, cramp frequency, sleep quality, and&#xD;
      sensitivity of myofascial trigger points in patients with nocturnal calf cramp.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nocturnal leg cramps are sudden, involuntary, painful contractions of the lower extremity in&#xD;
      the nighttime, most often in the calf muscles, that gradually lessens. Its etiology is not&#xD;
      clear. It can be seen in electrolyte disturbances, drug side effects, neuromuscular diseases,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular pathologies. It has been mentioned in the literature&#xD;
      that myofascial trigger points in the gastrocnemius muscle may be associated with nocturnal&#xD;
      calf cramps. Our aim in this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of&#xD;
      stretching exercises and dry needling therapy on cramp duration, cramp intensity, cramp&#xD;
      frequency, sleep quality, and algometer measurement in patients with nocturnal calf cramps&#xD;
      and whose had myofascial trigger point in the gastrocnemius muscle.&#xD;

    <description>Myofascial trigger point sensitivity in the gastrocnemius muscle was measured with an algometer. Higher scores represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The sleep quality of the patients was evaluated with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index. The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality.</description>
