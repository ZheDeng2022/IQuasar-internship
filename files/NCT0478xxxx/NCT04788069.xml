  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During this project the effect of different types of sourdough breads consumption on satiety,&#xD;
      energy intake at subsequent meal and postprandial metabolic responses, will be investigated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 3-phase randomised cross-over trial will be applied consisting of 3 intervention periods of&#xD;
      2 weeks, with a test day performed at the last day of each intervention period. During each&#xD;
      intervention period, participants will consume a fixed amount of test bread, replacing their&#xD;
      regular bread, and they will keep food and stool diaries preceding each Test-day. Faecal&#xD;
      samples will be collected before each Test-day. On the Test-day, participants will perform a&#xD;
      gastric emptying breath test. Furthermore, blood samples and appetite ratings will be&#xD;
      collected at regular time points after consumption of the test bread for measurement of&#xD;
      glucose, insulin, gut peptides, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and blood lipids. Food intake&#xD;
      will be assessed by offering the subjects a standard lunch to be consumed ad-libitum.&#xD;
