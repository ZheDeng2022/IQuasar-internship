  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses perceived usefulness of a web-based virtual prostate cancer genetics&#xD;
      board for providers across academic, community, and veteran affairs settings to discuss&#xD;
      prostate cancer genetics cases, precision treatment, and screening recommendation.&#xD;
      Information gained from interviews and surveys of participants taking part in the virtual&#xD;
      genetics board may lend insights into perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use,&#xD;
      acceptability, self-efficacy, genetics knowledge, and barriers/facilitators to implementation&#xD;
      to refine the process.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess perceived usefulness of a virtual genetics board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess acceptability/feasibility, perceived ease of use, self-efficacy for&#xD;
      recommendations, genetics knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete a survey about genetic knowledge and self efficacy and then attend&#xD;
      virtual genetics board. After virtual genetics board meeting, participants complete a second&#xD;
      survey about perceived usefulness, ease of use, acceptability, feasibility, self-efficacy and&#xD;
      genetic knowledge. Participants may also complete a semi-structured interview after virtual&#xD;
      genetics board.&#xD;
