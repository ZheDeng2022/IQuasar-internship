  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In upper extremity surgeries, the brachial plexus block can be performed with different&#xD;
      techniques at various levels depending on the proximal and distal level of the surgery. In&#xD;
      this study, we aim to compare the different approaches of US guided costoclavicular&#xD;
      technique. Lateral approache is more common for the costoclavicular block area. However, more&#xD;
      needle maneuvers are needed especially in pediatric patients because of the coracoid process.&#xD;
      Medial approach is recommended to overcome this problem. Thus demonstrate the safety of upper&#xD;
      extremity blocks, which is an important part of multimodal analgesia, and to determine the&#xD;
      most ideal technique in the pediatric patient group who will undergo upper extremity surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the block application, the US imaging time, the difficulty level of needle imaging,&#xD;
      the number of maneuvers required to reach the target image, whether additional maneuvers are&#xD;
      required according to the local anesthetic distribution, the success of the block and the&#xD;
      duration of the surgery, the total application time of the block and the duration of general&#xD;
      anesthesia will be recorded. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate will be recorded at&#xD;
      30-minute intervals during the surgery. Standardized for pediatric patients The FLACC and&#xD;
      Wong-Baker pain scores will be followed first 24 hours after surgery. The patient will be&#xD;
      examined for motor and sensation, and analgesic doses will be recorded if used. Time to first&#xD;
      pain identification, duration of sleep, patient and surgeon satisfaction will be recorded.&#xD;

      Peripheral nerve blocks; It is widely used in daily practice for anesthesia or as a part of&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia in most surgical procedures. In upper extremity surgeries, the brachial&#xD;
      plexus block can be performed with different techniques at various levels depending on the&#xD;
      proximal and distal level of the surgery. In this study, the aim is to compare postoperative&#xD;
      analgesic effects of these two ultrasound-guided techniques in pediatric patients. In this&#xD;
      study, we aim to compare the different approaches of US guided costoclavicular technique.&#xD;
      Lateral approache is more common for the costoclavicular block area. However, more needle&#xD;
      maneuvers are needed especially in pediatric patients because of the coracoid process. Medial&#xD;
      approach is recommended to overcome this problem. Thus demonstrate the safety of upper&#xD;
      extremity blocks, which is an important part of multimodal analgesia, and to determine the&#xD;
      most ideal technique in the pediatric patient group who will undergo upper extremity surgery.&#xD;
