      Two-phased randomized controlled trial comparing the impact of microprocessor controlled knee&#xD;
      prostheses (MPK) with the impact of non-microprocessor controlled knee prostheses (NPMK) in&#xD;
      patients with a transfemoral/knee disarticulation level amputation categorized as K2&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial investigating the benefits of microprocessor controlled knee&#xD;
      prostheses (MPK) in patients with a transfemoral or knee disarticulation level amputation&#xD;
      categorized by Medicare Functional Classification Level (MFCL) as a Limited Community&#xD;
      Ambulator (K-Level 2). There are two aims for the study. Aim 1 is to understand the effect of&#xD;
      MPK technology for the K2 ambulator on reducing fear and anxiety of falling, improving&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, and participation in society and activities. Aim 2 is to&#xD;
      understand the long-term effect of MPK technology the aspects from Aim 1 as well as reducing&#xD;
      morbidity. The trial will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will cover the initial 12-month&#xD;
      period to address Aim 1, and phase 2 will monitor from 12 months to 5 years to address Aim 2.&#xD;

    <measure>Fear of Falling Avoidance Behavior Questionnaire (FFABQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 14 item survey assessment originally developed with community-dwelling older adults which measures the degree to which respondents avoid activities due to their fear of falling. Responses are on a 5-point scale with 0 = completely disagree and 4 = completely agree. The total possible score is 56 points. A higher score indicates a greater activity limitation and participation restriction as a result of the fear of falling.</description>

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) - 29</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The survey assessment comprises from 7 health domains (physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, satisfaction with social roles, and pain interference). The combined constructs serve to provide a measure of patient's quality of life. Raw scores are converted to T-scores which standardizes the scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Being above or below the standard deviation could be desirable or undesirable based on the domain being measured. Higher scores means more of the concept being measured (e.g. more fatigue).</description>

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) - Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities (APSRA)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Within the PROMIS system, this specific set of question is aimed at assessing the person's ability to perform usual social roles and activities, a construct noted to be of great significance to well-being within the World Health Organization International Classification of Function model. Four of the PROMIS-APSRA questions are included on the PROMIS-29 within the domain of 'satisfaction with social roles'. The addition of four more questions helps with the responsiveness within this specific domain. Thus the additional four questions of the PROMIS-APSRA will be administered to assess the domain of participation and activity.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>On a bi-weekly cadence, individuals will be asked to complete the Lower Limb Amputation Fall Survey. This survey was developed for the purpose of documenting number of falls and near-falls over a given period, as well as insight into the causality.</description>

    <measure>10-meter Walk Test (10mWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The 10mWT is a standardized test of self-selected walking speed in which patients are timed over the middle 6 meters (19.7 feet) of a 10-meter (32.8 feet) flat walkway. The self-selected walking speed is calculated in meters per second and has been discussed as a potential vital sign given its strong relationship with survival. It will serve as a marker of morbidity.</description>

    <description>The Timed Up-and-Go test is a standard basic mobility test that includes a sit-to-stand, gait initiation, walking, turning, and stand-to-sit. The test measures, in seconds, the time to stand up from an arm chair, walk a distance of 3 meters (approximately 10 feet), turn, walk back to the chair and sit down. It is a measure of function, has been used to assess the risk of falling, and will serve as a marker of morbidity.</description>
