  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of tauopathies such as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Cortico Basal&#xD;
      Degeneration (CBD) remains a major challenge. These rare severe neurodegenerative&#xD;
      extrapyramidal movement disorders share phenotypic overlap and are usually painful. Parkinson&#xD;
      disease (PD) is a common extrapyramidal movement disorder and continuous subcutaneous&#xD;
      apomorphine infusion (CSAI) is commonly used in advanced PD patients to alleviate motor and&#xD;
      non-motor fluctuations. Effects of subcutaneous apomorphine were investigated especially on&#xD;
      pain and, on quality of life in 7 patients with PSD or CBD.This is an observational &quot;real&#xD;
      life&quot; surveillance-based study.The Verbal Rating Scale for Pain (VRS) was used to assess&#xD;
      changes in pain level and the clinical global impression-improvement scale (CGI-I) was used&#xD;
      to assess changes in patient's illness before and during six months of treatment. Detailed&#xD;
      report of the symptoms and side effects has been recorded by home nurses throughout the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

    <description>The Verbal Rating Scale for Pain (VRS) was used to assess changes in pain level. The VRS is a five-point scale and consists of a list of adjectives describing various levels of symptom intensity: 0= no itch, 1= mild itch, 2= moderate itch , 3= severe itch and 4=very severe itch. It is used to categorize the itch intensity and features high reliability and concurrent validity. VRS scale was assess before and during six months of treatment.</description>

    <description>The clinical global impression-improvement scale (CGI-I) was used to assess changes in patient's illness. The CGI-I is a 7 point scale that assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention: 1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change from baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5=minimally worse; 6= much worse; 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment.&quot; CGI-I scale was assess before and during six months of treatment.</description>
