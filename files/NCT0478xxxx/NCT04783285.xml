  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the effect of cognitive stimulation (CS), applied&#xD;
      individually and at home, on the overall cognitive functioning, emotional state,&#xD;
      functionality, and quality of life (QoL) in adults with psychotic disorders. To this end, a&#xD;
      randomised controlled clinical trial will be conducted in which selected participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to an individual intervention group using CS or a control group. The CS&#xD;
      program is adapted from other existing protocol, composed of 32 sessions. Each session will&#xD;
      last 45 minutes and will be held twice weekly. There will be four evaluation points&#xD;
      (baseline, intra-evaluation - after 8 weeks of intervention, post-evaluation - after 16 weeks&#xD;
      of intervention, follow-up - after 8 weeks of the end of intervention).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies indicate that Portugal has one of the highest prevalence rates of&#xD;
      mental disorders in Europe. In 2016, one in five Portuguese suffered from a psychiatric&#xD;
      illness and the network of Integrated Continuous Care in mental health is small, which is a&#xD;
      major constraint to rehabilitation and support responses for people with mental health&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to include psychologists and neuropsychologists in multidisciplinary teams,&#xD;
      in actions related to mental health promotion and mental illness prevention programs, so that&#xD;
      they can provide more comprehensive interventions for other effects of chronic mental health&#xD;
      conditions, such as cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence linking psychotic disorders to impairments in functioning in most cognitive&#xD;
      domains, including memory, executive functions, and attention, and that cognitive ageing in&#xD;
      some areas may be accelerated in individuals with psychotic disorders. Thus, it is important&#xD;
      to focus interventions on cognitive functioning in patients with psychosis, even after acute&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms have improved. Executive functions appear to be of particular importance&#xD;
      in the context of mental health problems, as they appear to be particularly integral for&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning and the completion of instrumental activities of daily living. There&#xD;
      is evidence that CS interventions in individual format are associated with greater&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have supported the effectiveness and accessibility of home-based interventions&#xD;
      in people with chronic mental illness. Yet, there are few published studies on continuous&#xD;
      intervention in people with chronic mental illness and even more limited knowledge of how&#xD;
      cognitive stimulation can help chronic mental health patients, including those with&#xD;
      psychosis, to function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One Portuguese study about the effect of an individual CS program in a home setting on&#xD;
      cognitive and mood functioning in adults with psychotic disorders was tested, showed&#xD;
      encouraging results and presented in detail an intervention protocol. However, it also&#xD;
      presents some important limitations (e.g., convenience sample, lack of follow-up evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to overcome those limitations, through a randomised controlled trial, and, in&#xD;
      addition to testing the effect of the CS program on global cognition, it also aims to assess&#xD;
      its effect on emotional state, daily functioning, and quality of life.&#xD;
