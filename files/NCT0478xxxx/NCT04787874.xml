  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a program to optimize patient physical&#xD;
      fitness and nutrition (&quot;prehabilitation&quot;) prior to and after plastic surgery involving the&#xD;
      abdomen improves surgical outcomes. The investigators hope to determine how a multimodal&#xD;
      peri-operative prehabilitation program can be most effective in engaging and motivating&#xD;
      patients to physically and mentally get ready for an abdominally-based plastic surgery&#xD;
      operation. The overall goal is to determine if this program will improve post-operative&#xD;
      recovery after abdominally-based plastic surgery. The importance of this new knowledge is&#xD;
      better understanding of ways that plastic surgeons can improve outcomes, engagement, and&#xD;
      experience of patients undergoing abdominally-based plastic surgery operations. This would&#xD;
      translate to increased healthcare value and better long-term outcomes.&#xD;

Exercise component: Participants will receive an activity tracker to use during the study period (3+ weeks before surgery, and 30 days after surgery). Participants will be assigned strength exercises to work on core strength and proximal muscle strength (biceps/triceps, quads, hamstrings, calves).The exercises will mainly be focused on strengthening the abdominal wall. Exercises will be tailored to patients' individual capabilities. They will also be assigned cardio exercises - either low-intensity steady state cardio vs High Intensity Interval training. Level of cardio exercise will be tailored based on patient's Duke Activity score and baseline activity.</description>
