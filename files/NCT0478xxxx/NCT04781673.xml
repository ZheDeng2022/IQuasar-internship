    <textblock>
      Rib fractures continue to be a common occurrence in trauma patients of all ages. Traumatic&#xD;
      rib fractures can cause severe pain in patients and lead to shallow breathing and further&#xD;
      complications such as the need for mechanical ventilation, hospital or ventilator associated&#xD;
      pneumonia, atelectasis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Effective multimodal pain&#xD;
      management is needed to optimize a patient's respiratory status and can also play a role in&#xD;
      early mobility, less pulmonary complications, shorter ICU and hospital length of stay, and&#xD;
      decreased mortality. Current multimodal pain management options include opioids, muscle&#xD;
      relaxants, gabapentin, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and various&#xD;
      regional/neuraxial anesthesia techniques. Both ketamine and lidocaine infusions for pain&#xD;
      control have also been shown in studies to be safe and effective, with the benefit of&#xD;
      minimizing the use of opioids. However, there have been very few studies that have used&#xD;
      ketamine or lidocaine infusions for pain control specifically in patients with traumatic rib&#xD;
      fractures. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate ketamine versus lidocaine&#xD;
      infusions as an adjunctive therapy to reduce opioid consumption in the first 72 hours in&#xD;
      patients with multiple traumatic rib fractures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Effective pain control plays a key role is optimizing a patient's respiratory status after&#xD;
      suffering multiple rib fractures. Using multimodal pain management techniques and optimizing&#xD;
      a patient's pain control regimen helps to minimize the complications associated with rib&#xD;
      fractures, such as pneumonia and the need for mechanical ventilation. The benefit of using&#xD;
      opioid-sparing options such as ketamine or lidocaine infusions would be to avoid the side&#xD;
      effects associated with opioids, which include delirium, constipation, and depressed&#xD;
      respiratory drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine and lidocaine infusions are both medications that have been used in numerous studies&#xD;
      to effectively treat post-operative pain. Low dose ketamine infusions have also recently been&#xD;
      shown to be a safe and effective adjunct option to help reduce pain scores and decrease&#xD;
      opioid use in patients with traumatic rib fractures. Currently there is no published studies&#xD;
      to assess lidocaine's effectiveness to reduce pain scores and opioid use in traumatic rib&#xD;
      fracture patients. There is also only one study to date that has directly compared ketamine&#xD;
      to lidocaine infusions for pain control. This study occurred in 60 patients undergoing&#xD;
      elective nephrectomy and evaluated three 24-hour infusion groups: ketamine, lidocaine, or&#xD;
      placebo. The primary outcome showed that both ketamine and lidocaine infusions significantly&#xD;
      reduced 24-hour OME compared to placebo (33% ketamine, 42% lidocaine) and decreased overall&#xD;
      pain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a single center, prospective, randomized trial of adult patients with ≥ 3&#xD;
      traumatic rib fractures admitted to a Level 1 trauma center at Spectrum Health Butterworth&#xD;
      Hospital. As part of the current rib fracture protocol all patients will receive the standard&#xD;
      multimodal pain regimen at the investigator's institution, including acetaminophen, NSAIDS,&#xD;
      muscle relaxants and gabapentin. Currently ketamine infusions and regional/neuraxial&#xD;
      anesthesia techniques are added if the standard multimodal pain regimen is insufficient.&#xD;
      Lidocaine infusions have also been used at the institution for post-surgical pain control to&#xD;
      minimize opioid use. The objective of the study will be to compare ketamine versus lidocaine&#xD;
      infusions on the effectiveness to optimize pain control as well as minimize the use of&#xD;
      opioids in patients with traumatic rib fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If consent is obtained the patient will be randomized 1:1 to receive either a ketamine or&#xD;
      lidocaine infusion for pain control, along with standard of care, using a pre-designed&#xD;
      randomization schedule. Patients must be enrolled within 16 hours of hospital admission and&#xD;
      are expected to remain on the infusion for a minimum of 24 hours. The duration, titration,&#xD;
      and stopping of study drug will be dependent on the progress of the patient's overall pain&#xD;
      status and provider decision, with data being included for the study medication for up to 72&#xD;
      hours. If patients require surgery at any time the study medication will not be held unless&#xD;
      signs of adverse events occur. Patients who are unable to remain on the study infusion or&#xD;
      have a regional/neuraxial anesthetic placed before the 24-hour mark (decided based on the&#xD;
      Trauma and Surgical Intensive Care Unit services) will be considered a screen fail and no&#xD;
      data will be contributed to the study, however, the screen fail will be documented. If a&#xD;
      patient is unable to remain on infusion or has a regional/neuraxial anesthetic placed ≥ 24&#xD;
      hours, their data will be included up until that point and analyzed. Adverse event and&#xD;
      serious adverse events will be monitored throughout the entire study period, with continuous&#xD;
      cardiac telemetry being required in both study groups and daily lidocaine levels drawn in the&#xD;
      lidocaine group.&#xD;
