  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to study the impact CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) has on&#xD;
      patients glycemic control as determined by time in range (TIR 70-180 mg/dL) in the Diabetic&#xD;
      Kidney Transplant population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is one of the leading causes of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Kidney&#xD;
      transplantation is the best form of renal replacement therapy to date but requires that&#xD;
      recipients of transplant organs maintain a complicated medication regimen in order to prevent&#xD;
      graft loss. Their medications include lifelong immunosuppression, anti-microbials and other&#xD;
      maintenance medications (i.e., anti-hypertensives, heart-protective regimens, bowel care,&#xD;
      vitamins and pain medications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many transplant patients, glycemic control in the immediate post-operative period can be&#xD;
      an additional challenge. Glycemic control may be hindered by recent surgery, corticosteroids,&#xD;
      immunosuppressants, altered nutritional intake and reduced mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes professional organizations such as the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the&#xD;
      American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) recommend continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring (CGM) for anyone on intensive insulin therapy. The biggest benefit of CGM is not&#xD;
      just the actual glucose value, but also its direction and rate of change. CGM data can also&#xD;
      be downloaded and reflect patterns of glycemic control throughout the day and night,&#xD;
      including not only the average blood glucose but also time-in-range (TIR) and degrees of&#xD;
      glycemic variability. This can help identify unnotified nightly hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia&#xD;
      and help titrate medications to achieve better glycemic control. Self-Management of blood&#xD;
      glucose (SMBG) is a key component in effective glycemic management, but it places a large&#xD;
      burden on the patient. Prior to CGM, SMBG was the only option to measure daily blood glucose&#xD;
      fluctuations, but it is an imperfect tool. For patients on insulin, a blood glucose is&#xD;
      checked at minimum 4 times per day, prior to meals and at bedtime. Additionally, the utility&#xD;
      of SMBG can be endangered by patient decision making, the ability to check blood glucose,&#xD;
      adherence to testing regimen, error due to poor testing technique, inadequate blood supply,&#xD;
      contamination on fingers, or inaccuracy of some systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have shown the clinical benefit of CGM in the type-1 diabetes (T1D) and&#xD;
      type-2 diabetes (T2D) populations (ref: Beck, Olafsdottir). The DIAMOND group (Beck) showed&#xD;
      that CGM improved HBA1C and reduced hyperglycemia (BG&gt;180). Patients wearing the CGM had high&#xD;
      satisfaction scores and low perceived burden. CGM is still a new tool outside of the Type 1&#xD;
      Diabetes population but may have significant benefits for any patient on insulin. In Feb 2019&#xD;
      an international guideline on TIR (defined as blood glucose of 70-180 mg/dL) was published&#xD;
      and TIR may become a new standard for assessing glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators research focuses on TIR and the benefits of CGM in the kidney transplant&#xD;
      population. This can be essential for timely adjustments of insulin dosages when dealing with&#xD;
      glycemic derangements and steroid induced hyperglycemia. CGM can provide an immense&#xD;
      opportunity for a continuous 24/7 view of glucose values, glycemic variability, direction of&#xD;
      change and unrecognized blood glucose levels during nighttime, and influence of food and&#xD;
      activity on blood glucose values. In addition to the metrics described; the glucose&#xD;
      management indicator (GMI) or also named estimated A1C (eA1C) is a measure converting the&#xD;
      mean glucose from CGM using a formula derived from glucose readings from a population of&#xD;
      individuals, into an estimate of a simultaneously measured laboratory A1C, this value may&#xD;
      serve as an additional tool in assessing glycemic control. In conclusion: the use of a CGM&#xD;
      can aid the provider and care team in better titration of insulin and medication regimen&#xD;
      adjustment. This research hopes to give insight in a very complex population that has not had&#xD;
      access to CGM before.&#xD;
