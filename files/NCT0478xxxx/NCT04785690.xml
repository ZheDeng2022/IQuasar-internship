      Screening A child is considered for the study after undergoing a standard of care and study&#xD;
      specific eye examinations (by a study investigator as part of standard of care) that&#xD;
      identifies amblyopia appearing to meet the eligibility criteria. The study will be discussed&#xD;
      with the child's parent(s) or guardian(s) (referred to subsequently as parent(s)). Parent(s)&#xD;
      who express an interest in the study will be given a copy of the informed consent form to&#xD;
      read. Written informed consent / assent must be obtained from a parent and child prior to&#xD;
      performing any study-specific procedures that are not part of the child's routine care.&#xD;

&#xD;
             NOTE: Subjects with cycloplegic refractive errors that do not fall within the&#xD;
             requirements above for spectacle correction may be given spectacles at investigator's&#xD;
             discretion, but must follow the study-specified prescribing guidelines, as detailed&#xD;
             below.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Spectacle prescribing instructions referenced to the cycloplegic refraction&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  SE must be within 0.50D of fully correcting the anisometropia.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  SE must not be under corrected by more than 1.50D SE, and reduction in plus&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Cylinder power in both eyes must be within 0.50D of fully correcting the&#xD;
                       astigmatism.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Axis must be within +/- 10 degrees if cylinder power is ≤1.00D, and within&#xD;
                       +/- 5 degrees if cylinder power is &gt;1.00D.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Myopia must not be under corrected by more than 0.25D or over corrected by&#xD;
                       more than 0.50D SE, and any change must be symmetrical in the two eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Spectacle correction meeting the above criteria must be worn:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For at least 16 weeks OR until distance VA stability is documented (defined&#xD;
                       as &lt;0.1 logMAR change by the same testing method measured on 2 consecutive&#xD;
                       exams at least 8 weeks apart).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For determining VA stability (non-improvement):&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  The first of two measurements may be made 1) in current spectacles, or&#xD;
                            2) in trial frames with or without cycloplegia or 3) without correction&#xD;
                            (if new correction is prescribed),&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  The second measurement must be made without cycloplegia in the correct&#xD;
                            spectacles that have been worn for at least 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Note: since this determination is a pre-study procedure, the method of&#xD;
                            measuring VA is not mandated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. VA, measured in each eye without cycloplegia in current spectacle correction (if&#xD;
             applicable) within 7 days prior to randomization using the Lea symbol per ATS VA&#xD;
             protocol for children &lt; 7 years and the E-ETDRS VA protocol for children ≥ 7 years on&#xD;
             a study-approved device displaying single surrounded optotypes, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Visual acuity in the amblyopic eye 20/32 to 20/100 inclusive&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Heterotropia with a near deviation of &lt;5∆ (measured by SPCT) in habitual correction&#xD;
             (Angles of ocular deviation &gt;4∆ are not allowed because large magnitudes of the&#xD;
