  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The functional prognosis of patients with ischaemic stroke treated by thrombolysis and&#xD;
      thrombectomy is associated with complete reperfusion of the occluded artery defined by an&#xD;
      mTICI 2C or 3 score at the end of thrombectomy. However, this complete reperfusion is only&#xD;
      obtained in 60% of patients. Most often, incomplete reperfusion is due to the persistence of&#xD;
      distal occlusions, which are inaccessible to mechanical thrombectomy. Drug treatment,&#xD;
      combined with thrombectomy to increase the rate of complete reperfusion, would be a major&#xD;
      advance in the management of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized, monocentric, open-label, phase II trial to evaluate efficacy of&#xD;
      dornase alfa intravenous administration in patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis and&#xD;
      eligible for thrombectomy for ischemic stroke of the anterior circulation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months after procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Complete recanalization defined by a modified treatment in cerebral infarction (mTICI) 2C or 3 score at cerebral angiography one hour after the start of pulmozyme administration or at the end of the thrombectomy procedure (if procedure &gt;1h).&#xD;
The grade 2C corresponds to : Near complete perfusion except for slow flow in a few distal cortical vessels, or presence of small distal cortical emboli.&#xD;
The grade 3 corresponds to: complete antegrade reperfusion of the previously occluded target artery ischemic territory, with absence of visualized occlusion in all distal branches</description>
