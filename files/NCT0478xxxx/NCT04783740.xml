      The aim of this study was to determine the Turkish validity and reliability of ''The Working&#xD;
      Memory Questionnaire'' developed by Dr. Vallat-Azouvi.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Working Memory refers to the temporary storage and exchange of information required for&#xD;
      complex tasks such as language, understanding, learning, and reasoning. Working memory&#xD;
      deficits are worse in people with advanced age and low education. In addition, working memory&#xD;
      is impaired in children with traumatic brain injury, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and&#xD;
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The aim of this study is to determine the Turkish&#xD;
      version, validity, and reliability of ''The Working Memory Questionnaire''. 300 health people&#xD;
      will include in the study. In order to determine the reliability of the scale, the intraclass&#xD;
      correlation coefficient (ICC) will be used to determine the level of the relationship between&#xD;
      the results of the first and second measurements. Cronbach's alpha coefficient will be used&#xD;
      for the homogeneity of the questions in the scale. For construct validity, the correlation&#xD;
      coefficient will be used to determine the agreement between the Turkish Version of Cognitive&#xD;
      Failures Questionnaire and The Working Memory Questionnaire.&#xD;

    <description>The Working Memory Questionnaire has been designed by Dr. Vallat-Azouvi at el. specifically to assess everyday life difficulties related to working memory failures. It consists of 30 statements rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely&quot;. WMQ is consists of 3 subscales, there are storage, attention, and executive domains.The total score ranges from 0-120 points. Higher scores correspond to more self-identified difficulties</description>

    <description>The Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) is a self-report questionnaire to assess failures of perception, motor function, and memory. CFQ is consists of 25 items and 5 points Likert-type scale. The total score is ranges from 0-100 points.</description>
