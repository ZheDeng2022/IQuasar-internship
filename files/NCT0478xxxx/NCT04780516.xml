  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by symptoms such as&#xD;
      pain, itching and discomfort. This can have severe impact on the quality of life including&#xD;
      depression, embarrassment, and social isolation. The objective of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      how effective risankizumab is in changing the disease symptoms in adult participants with&#xD;
      moderate to severe psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risankizumab is an approved drug being developed for the treatment of psoriasis. Adult&#xD;
      participants who are prescribed risankizumab treatment according to the local label will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. Approximately 125 adult participants with moderate to severe&#xD;
      psoriasis will be enrolled at multiple sites across Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are prescribed to receive subcutaneous risankizumab injection by their&#xD;
      physician according to local label will be enrolled and will be followed for approximately 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or&#xD;
      clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, checking for side&#xD;
      effects, patient charts, questionnaires, and remote monitoring device (patch sensor).&#xD;
