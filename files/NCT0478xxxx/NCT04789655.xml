  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, clinical study of CC-96191 will explore the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      preliminary biological and clinical activity of CC-96191 as a single-agent in the setting of&#xD;
      Relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation (Part A) of the study will explore escalating intravenous doses of&#xD;
      CC-96191 to estimate the MTD and/or RP2D of CC-96191 as monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expansion (Part B), will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-96191&#xD;
      administered at or below the MTD in one or more expansion cohorts in order to determine the&#xD;
      RP2D.&#xD;
