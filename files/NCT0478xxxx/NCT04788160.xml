      The purpose of this study is to find out the effect of cervical sustained natural apophyseal&#xD;
      glide half rotation technique in patients with cervicogenic headache. Not many researches&#xD;
      have focused specifically on the cervical sustained natural apophyseal glide half rotation&#xD;
      technique and this study intends to see its effect in the cervicogenic headache patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervicogenic headache is a very frequent complaint that is commonly faced by general&#xD;
      population. The International Headache Society placed cervicogenic headache in the secondary&#xD;
      headache sub-group. The global prevalence of headache is about 47%, whereas 15% to 20% of&#xD;
      those are Cervicogenic headache .Females are four times more prone to Cervicogenic headache&#xD;
      than males. Persons with chronic Cervicogenic headache experience significant restriction of&#xD;
      everyday function and are limited to social involvement, and emotional sufferings. Beside&#xD;
      this, the poorer quality of life is seen in these individuals than normal. Headache can be&#xD;
      classified as primary or secondary. Primary headache originates from a vascular or muscular&#xD;
      source such as tension-type headache. Secondary headache is related to other structures with&#xD;
      cervicogenic headache being the most common type that is related to cervical spine&#xD;
      dysfunction. Up to about 70% of frequent intermittent headache are reported with associated&#xD;
      neck pain making cervicogenic headache difficult to diagnose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The C1-C2 segment is considered essential to be examined in Cervicogenic headache diagnosis.&#xD;
      Moreover, muscle tightness especially of the upper trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles&#xD;
      with impaired strength and neuromotor contract of the cervical flexors (superficial and deep)&#xD;
      are frequently encountered in subjects with Cervicogenic headache. Different therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches have been proposed for treatment of headaches; with physical therapy,&#xD;
      pharmacological drugs, and cognitive therapies most commonly used. Several studies reported&#xD;
      that manual therapy of the cervical spine can decrease pain intensity, frequency, and&#xD;
      duration in addition to reduction in neck pain and disability. The &quot;mobilization with&#xD;
      movement&quot; concept, known as the Mulligan concept, is entirely distinct from other forms of&#xD;
      manual therapy. Mulligan described the sustained natural apophyseal glide on the joint with&#xD;
      active movement done by the patient in the direction of the symptoms. This glide should be&#xD;
      pain-free, with proper force applied by a trained person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of sustained natural apophyseal glide C1-C2 has been proven in a research in&#xD;
      patients who were experiencing acute to subacute Cervicogenic headache for both short and&#xD;
      long-term periods. Mulligan recommended that mobilization should be done towards the&#xD;
      restricted site or in the direction of symptom reproduction, which is difficult to find in&#xD;
      patients experiencing headache and dizziness in only one direction. There is evidence that&#xD;
      mobilizing symptomatic and asymptomatic cervical levels results in immediate improvement of&#xD;
      pain and segmental mobility at the same level as well as adjacent areas. sustained natural&#xD;
      apophyseal glide Mulligan mobilizations are one of the most popular manual therapy techniques&#xD;
      found to be effective in treating Cervicogenic headache as mentioned in the &quot;Neck Pain&#xD;
      Guidelines 2017&quot; recommended by American Physical Therapy Association , which reported that&#xD;
      patients with neck pain and Cervicogenic headache had significant improvement with&#xD;
      self-sustained natural apophyseal glide C1-C2 for both short and long-term periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, sustained natural apophyseal glide as a treatment modality can be applied to&#xD;
      all the spinal joints, the rib cage and the sacroiliac joint. They provide a method to&#xD;
      improve restricted joint range when symptoms are movement induced. The therapist facilitates&#xD;
      the appropriate accessory zygoapophyseal joint glide while the patient performs the&#xD;
      symptomatic movement. The facilitatory glide must result in full-range pain-free movement.&#xD;
      Sustained end range holds or overpressure can be applied to the physiological movement. This&#xD;
      previously symptomatic motion is repeated up to three times while the therapist continues to&#xD;
      maintain the appropriate accessory glide. In particular, a cervical sustained natural&#xD;
      apophyseal glide is applied with the patient seated, and thus, the spine is in a vertical&#xD;
      (i.e. weight bearing or loaded) position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobilization is very effective in the management of Cervicogenic headache. The group of&#xD;
      patients who are given sustained natural apophyseal glide showed significantly greater&#xD;
      improvement in neck disability index. A research study has shown that the headache sustained&#xD;
      natural apophyseal glide is more effective as compared to the reverse headache sustained&#xD;
      natural apophyseal glide in the reduction of pain on headache scale. Another research study&#xD;
      has shown that C2 sustained natural apophyseal glide and reverse sustained natural apophyseal&#xD;
      glide technique were effective in reducing functional disability and headache intensity.&#xD;
      Also, C2 sustained natural apophyseal glide was found to be more effective in reducing&#xD;
      headache intensity when compared with the other group.&#xD;
