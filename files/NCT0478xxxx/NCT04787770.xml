      Diabetic foot disease with a global incidence of about 6% is one of the most serious&#xD;
      complications of diabetes, which brings great pain and economic burden to patients.In China,&#xD;
      the incidence rate is 8.1%, and the amputation rate is 7.3%. Every year, more than 1 million&#xD;
      diabetic patients have amputations, ranking first among non-traumatic amputations.According&#xD;
      to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the incidence of Peripheral Arterial Disease&#xD;
      (PAD) in diabetic patients is twice that of non-diabetic patients, and the resulting lower&#xD;
      limb ischemia is the main cause of the high mortality and disability rate of diabetic&#xD;
      foot.According to the International Working Group on Diabetic Foot (IWGDF), about 50%&#xD;
      patients with diabetic foot disease are complicated with PAD, and the degree of vascular&#xD;
      stenosis is closely related to the prognosis.Severe limb ischemia is a higher cause of&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcer in China than in western countries.Atherosclerosis is the main&#xD;
      pathological change of diabetic peripheral artery disease, and endothelial injury is the&#xD;
      initial link of atherosclerosis.Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a kind of important heat&#xD;
      stress protein, which accounts for about 2-3% of the total protein in cells.It is involved in&#xD;
      the correct folding and activation of intracellular proteins.Although Hsp90 is primarily&#xD;
      involved in intracellular protective mechanisms, they can also be exposed to the plasma&#xD;
      membrane and released in the extracellular space, resulting in detectable levels of Hsp90 in&#xD;
      the blood.Extracellular heat shock proteins are involved in cell-cell communication as well&#xD;
      as immune and inflammatory processes.Hsp90 promotes cell survival, migration, inflammation&#xD;
      and angiogenesis, and is therefore considered a promising target for cancer therapy.This led&#xD;
      to the development of specific HSP90 inhibitors.More recently, these inhibitors have also&#xD;
      been tested in diabetic animals.The use of the HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG significantly reduced&#xD;
      atherosclerotic lesions and induced a more stable plaque phenotype in a mouse model with&#xD;
      hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia.Hsp90 is upregulated in human carotid atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaques (especially in unstable areas of plaques) and in patients' serums, triggering&#xD;
      autoimmune antibodies against Hsp90 in patients.Is HSP90 also present in serum of patients&#xD;
      with diabetic peripheral arterial disease?Is there a relationship between secretory heat&#xD;
      shock protein 90 and arterial disease?The study that HSP90 may be involved in the molecular&#xD;
      mechanism of vascular endothelial barrier function impairment in diabetes will provide a new&#xD;
      target for the early serological diagnosis and treatment of diabetic vascular disease.The aim&#xD;
      of this study was to investigate the relationship between the degree of vascular disease and&#xD;
      serum heat shock protein 90 in patients with type 2 diabetes.The study was divided into three&#xD;
      groups: diabetic without PAD group, diabetic with PAD group and diabetic foot group.According&#xD;
      to the degree of peripheral artery disease, the patients were divided into three groups, and&#xD;
      the content of heat shock protein 90 in serum of the patients was detected.To analyze the&#xD;
      correlation between the degree of peripheral arterial disease and the content of heat shock&#xD;
      protein 90 in serum.&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. Serum collection: the nurses collected the patients' fasting blood at 6:00 am in&#xD;
           accordance with the routine blood collection procedures: 1 tube of procoagulant blood&#xD;
           and 1 tube of anticoagulant blood were collected, each tube was no less than 3ml of&#xD;
           blood;Store in a 4-degree refrigerator for disposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collection of serum and plasma: the blood samples collected by the nurse were placed in&#xD;
           a centrifuge, centrifuged at 3000 RPM for 15 minutes, and then the supernatant was&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Laboratory test: the collected serum or plasma were quantitatively tested by HSP90&#xD;
           ELISA, and the results were analyzed.The remaining serum or plasma was stored in a&#xD;
           negative 80 refrigerator.&#xD;
