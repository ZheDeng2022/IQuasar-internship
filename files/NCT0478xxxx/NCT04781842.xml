  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the impact of a boxing training program on people with Parkinson&#xD;
      Disease. The investigators were provided data for the intervention group retrospectively by&#xD;
      the organizers of the boxing club to assess participants' benefit from participation. The&#xD;
      outcome measures were selected to measure different aspects of functional mobility. Of&#xD;
      particular interest is the impact of challenging whole-body activities designed for boxing&#xD;
      and their impact on turning speed and gait. The second phase of the study will gather control&#xD;
      group information from people with Parkinson Disease who have not participated in a boxing&#xD;
      program to compare differences in pre-test and post-test data over a period of 12 weeks. The&#xD;
      specific population and study design are currently pending global pandemic restrictions.&#xD;
      Subject recruitment will involve people who have never had access to a program of this&#xD;
      nature. An alternative population for recruitment may involve the same participants from the&#xD;
      boxing club in a crossover study format since the boxing club has been suspended for over a&#xD;
      year due to health and safety concerns during the pandemic. The control group of either&#xD;
      situation would be instructed to carry on with their daily activities as usual without&#xD;
      changing their physical activity. We hypothesize that the intervention group would show&#xD;
      greater improvements in functional mobility compared to the control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effects of Parkinson Disease are progressive and cause limitations in functional mobility&#xD;
      and quality of life. This is a disease that greatly impairs the motor system with key&#xD;
      presentation of resting tremors, rigidity and bradykinesia. These impairments cause further&#xD;
      deficiencies in gait and postural stability. Most notable is festinating gait that is&#xD;
      exacerbated by direction changes and becomes a fall risk for patients. These physical&#xD;
      limitations can manifest fear and avoidance behaviors in people that ultimately decrease&#xD;
      quality of life. Activities that can improve balance, strength and coordination allow people&#xD;
      to gain confidence in their ability to participate in their daily activities. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate the impact of a boxing training program on lower extremity&#xD;
      functional strength, fall risk, gait speed, and turning speed for people with Parkinson&#xD;
      Disease compared to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for the intervention group has been provided retrospectively by the organizers of the&#xD;
      boxing club. This initial data was collected by volunteers of the club at the initial session&#xD;
      and then at 12 weeks for purposes of progress reporting to the members. Data was&#xD;
      de-identified prior to receipt by the investigators. The next phase of this study will&#xD;
      involve recruitment of participants for a control group from areas that do not have&#xD;
      established boxing programs. Pre- and post-tests will be conducted over a span of 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Outcome measures for the future control group will be the same as the original tools provided&#xD;
      by the boxing club. These measures will assess lower extremity functional strength, fall&#xD;
      risk, gait speed and turning speed. Baseline data will be taken using 30-second sit to stand,&#xD;
      Timed Up-and-Go, 180Â° turning speed, and gait speed. During the 12 week period, participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to avoid changing their physical activity. At the end of 12 weeks the&#xD;
      post-testing will be completed. Those participants in the control group will receive a gift&#xD;
      card for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If pandemic concerns prevent the recruitment of new participants for a control group, an&#xD;
      alternative approach will involve a cross-over design in which the original participants from&#xD;
      the intervention group will serve as the control group. The boxing club will be approached to&#xD;
      contact the twelve participants who provided intervention data. The boxing club has not been&#xD;
      held since March, 2020 due to the pandemic restrictions. A control period for this group will&#xD;
      be established over a twelve week period where they do not participate in any new changes to&#xD;
      their physical activity. The same outcome measures will be collected at pre-test and twelve&#xD;
      weeks later for post-testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of the in-person testing, extra precautions regarding Covid-19 have been&#xD;
      implemented including a Covid-19 and Other Communicable Disease consent form outlining&#xD;
      expectations of the participants as well as precautions by the investigators. These extra&#xD;
      initiatives include appropriate facial masks and face shields by everyone involved at all&#xD;
      times at the study site, physical distancing between investigators and participants with&#xD;
      exceptions made for safety reasons, and any other procedures established by the study site.&#xD;

    <measure>Gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Gait speed is recorded as the participant walks their comfortable walking speed on a level surface with a marked 4 meter path. The participant begins 1 meter before the start line and continues walking 1 meter past the 4 meter line to prevent acceleration and deceleration from affecting their speed.</description>

    <measure>30 Second Sit to Stand Test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 30-second sit to stand test requires the participant to rise from a chair and sit back down without using their arms as many times as they can within 30 seconds. The number of completed rises is recorded. It is a measure of lower extremity functional strength.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
