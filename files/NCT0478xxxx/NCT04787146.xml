    <textblock>
      The damage caused by patient falls is a major public health problem, due to the large and&#xD;
      growing number of people concerned, the potentially serious consequences but also the&#xD;
      financial cost generated by their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These consequences can be physical as well as psychological. Fractures and pain are the first&#xD;
      consequences that come to mind, but many others should be mentioned: post-fall syndrome, loss&#xD;
      of autonomy or even entering an institution, fear of falling, loss of confidence in itself.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During 2018, 285 reports of falls were counted within the Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital Group&#xD;
      (GhPSJ). Reducing these falls is one of the institutional goals. A dedicated working group&#xD;
      has been created to put in place preventive and corrective measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These falls can be caused by many factors to the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intrinsic:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History of a fall,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  pathologies (Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  hearing and visual disturbances,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  urinary incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. extrinsic:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Unsuitable shoes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  unsuitable habitat,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  slippery floors (eg bathroom).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the intrinsic factors, polypharmacy is also found. It has been established that certain&#xD;
      drug classes are at risk of falling, in particular psychotropic drugs (benzodiazepines,&#xD;
      hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, neuroleptics) which promote sedation and dizziness,&#xD;
      hypoglycemic drugs which cause hypoglycaemia in diabetic patients on -treated or&#xD;
      antihypertensive drugs causing hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now clearly established that drug adherence to treatment is poor in cities, giving rise&#xD;
      to omissions but also sometimes to overconsumption of certain drugs, including psychotropic&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;

    <description>From Monday to Friday, the study will be offered to patients selected consecutively and who have fallen within the previous 24 hours (between 7.55 a.m. the day before and 7.55 a.m. the next day).&#xD;
After delivery of the written information note to the patient, the investigating physician answers the patient's questions and accepts his non-objection. The patient should be given sufficient time to think things through to make the decision to participate in the study.&#xD;
Its non-opposition will be traced in the computerized medical file created on the day of its inclusion in the protocol. Each patient participating in the study retains the possibility of participating simultaneously in another research. No exclusion period is provided for in the protocol.</description>
