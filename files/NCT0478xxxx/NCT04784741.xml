  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole body vibration therapy is rapidly becoming a topic of interest for the researchers&#xD;
      around the world. Evidence suggests that Whole body vibration has an effect on improving&#xD;
      flexibility of hamstring muscle and balance in athletes. The purpose was to examine the&#xD;
      effect of low amplitude Whole body vibration on the flexibility of hamstring muscle and&#xD;
      improving balance in athletes of Pakistan&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total 60 number of athletes were analyzed and out of these 40 were included in the study&#xD;
      who full fill the inclusion criteria, selected athletes were randomly assigned into two&#xD;
      groups (control &amp; experimental). After a total 2 drop outs from control group and 3 drop outs&#xD;
      from experimental group, there were 18 athletes in control group and 17 in experimental group&#xD;
      who continued till the analysis. Experimental group was given five sessions of low amplitude&#xD;
      whole body vibration therapy for almost duration of 10 minutes, on alternative days, along&#xD;
      with static stretching of hamstring muscles for 5 minutes and the control group was given&#xD;
      only the static hamstring muscle stretches for five minutes, and same five sessions alike on&#xD;
      alternative days. Static stretching protocol had 10 stretches in total with 15 seconds&#xD;
      stretch time and 30 seconds relaxing time of hamstring muscle. All participants were assessed&#xD;
      using Biodex Whole body vibration plate, Biodex balance system , Goniometer and a&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
