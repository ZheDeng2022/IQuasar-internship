      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a brain infection. It is caused by a&#xD;
      virus. PML can happen in people with a weakened immune system. PML is associated with&#xD;
      cognitive and visual impairment as well as motor and speech disturbances. There is no&#xD;
      treatment for PML. Researchers want to see if a new drug can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if the drug NT-I7 can help increase lymphocyte numbers, which may help control PML&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with PML who are enrolled in Protocol #13-N-0017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under Protocol #13-N-0017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a 7-day inpatient stay, outpatient visits, and follow-up phone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history and physical exam. They will give urine samples.&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn from an arm vein or through an intravenous (IV) catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get up to 3 doses of NT-I7. It will be given by injection into the muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have lumbar punctures ( spinal taps ). A thin needle will be inserted into&#xD;
      the spinal canal in the lower back. Cerebrospinal fluid will be removed. X-ray may be used to&#xD;
      guide the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The MRI scanner is a&#xD;
      metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field. During MRIs, participants will lie on a table&#xD;
      that slides in and out of the scanner. Soft padding or a coil will be placed around their&#xD;
      head. They will get gadolinium, a contrast agent, through an IV catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 12 to 19 months.&#xD;

      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study of NT-I7, a long-acting recombinant IL-7 molecule, as an immune reconstitution&#xD;
      strategy for lymphopenia in patients with Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will test whether NT-I7 is a viable strategy for promoting immune&#xD;
      reconstitution in lymphopenic patients with PML. Twelve adults with PML and lymphopenia (CD4&#xD;
      or CD8 T cell count of less than or equal to 200 cells/dL) from all causes will complete this&#xD;
      pilot study. Patients will be observed as inpatient for the first 7 days following any&#xD;
      experimental drug dosing. To follow, patients will return to NIH for a second 7-day inpatient&#xD;
      stay by Day 21, and then for scheduled outpatient visits at NIH at month 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12&#xD;
      following any drug dosing. Follow up phone calls will be conducted at month 4, 5, 7 and 8.&#xD;
      Patients may be eligible for a second dose of NT-I7 at higher dose if target ALC&#xD;
      (1000/microliter) not reached, or at same dose if initial response is adequate but not&#xD;
      sustained, for a maximum of 3 doses. The primary outcome measure is change in absolute&#xD;
      lymphocyte counts (ALC). Secondary outcomes include safety and tolerability. Exploratory&#xD;
      clinical, radiological, and laboratory measures will be obtained to investigate mechanism of&#xD;
      action of NT-I7 and for biomarker development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine the kinetics and magnitude of effect of NT-I7 on absolute&#xD;
      lymphocyte counts in patients with PML and underlying lymphopenia from various causes, in&#xD;
      order to inform appropriate design of a future study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: (1) To assess safety and tolerability of NT-I7. (2) To determine&#xD;
      kinetics and magnitude of effect of NT-I7 on lymphocyte subsets. (3) To investigate effect of&#xD;
      NT-I7 on PML disease course. (4) To investigate mechanism of action of NT-I7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Change in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: (1) Adverse event tables. (2) Change in lymphocyte subset counts,&#xD;
      including CD4, CD8 and CD19 positive cells (3) Change in standardized disability rating&#xD;
      scales, PML lesion extension by brain MRI, viral quantification in CSF and survival. (4)&#xD;
      Exploratory serological and CSF measures to investigate immune response to JCV and mechanism&#xD;
      of action of NT-I7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with definite PML with detectable JCV in CSF and CD4 and/or CD8 lymphopenia will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Description of Study Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single dose of NT-I7 480micrograms/kg IM will be administered to all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be eligible for re-dosing of NT-I7 at 720microgram/kg IM if minimum target ALC&#xD;
      is not achieved by Day 27.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be eligible for re-dosing at same dose (480 microgram/kg or 720microgram/kg) if&#xD;
      minimum target ALC is reached but not sustained at least until Month 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      36 months for data collection and analysis of primary and secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  If able to become pregnant or to father a child, patient must agree to commit to the&#xD;
             use of a reliable/accepted method of birth control (i.e. hormonal contraception (birth&#xD;

             sterilization (hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or vasectomy) for the duration of the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age &lt; 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing treatment with immune-suppressive medications (exception: topical steroid use&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to any study procedures that would compromise ability to safely&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that&#xD;
             might confound the results of the trial or interfere with participation for the full&#xD;
             duration of the trial; or not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling to have coded samples and/or data saved or used in other studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Selection will be equitable among eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion of decisionally impaired adults:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Consent capacity is required at the time of enrollment to ensure that participants are able&#xD;
        to fully express understanding of participation prior to starting this more than minimal&#xD;
        risk protocol. The study question should be able to be answered by enrolling those that&#xD;
        have consent capacity at the time of enrollment, thus maximizing the risk benefit ratio. At&#xD;
        the time of enrollment, while participants have consent capacity, they will be asked to&#xD;
        appoint a DPA for research and health care to be invoked if they subsequently lose consent&#xD;
        capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with PML may lose consent capacity with disease progression, and such participants&#xD;
        will be allowed to remain in the study. This is justified, given the study question cannot&#xD;
        be answered without enrolling people with PML and there is the possibility of direct&#xD;
        benefit. In addition, at the time of enrollment the participants had capacity, agreed to&#xD;
        full participation, and chose a surrogate to speak on their behalf should they lose&#xD;
        capacity. This participant appointed DPA will be invoked should it be determined the&#xD;
        subject no longer has consent capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion of employees:&#xD;
&#xD;
        NIH employees and staff will not be solicited for participation but will not be excluded if&#xD;
        they express the desire to enroll. NIH staff and family members of study team members may&#xD;
        be enrolled in this study as this population meets the study entry criteria. Employees and&#xD;
        staff who participate in this protocol during work hours will be informed that they must&#xD;
        obtain their supervisor s permission. Neither participation nor refusal to participate as a&#xD;
        subject in the research will have an effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the&#xD;
        participant s employment, training or position at NIH.&#xD;
