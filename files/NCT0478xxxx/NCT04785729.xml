  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      almonertinib combined with pyrrolitinib in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with&#xD;
      her-2 variants detected after first-line EGFR-TKI treatment resistance. Patients with&#xD;
      first-line EGFR-TKI resistance showed HER-2 variation (including mutation and amplification)&#xD;
      in tissue or blood tests, and the treatment regimen of metinil combined with pyrrolitinib was&#xD;
      performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the treatment regimen. To determine the&#xD;
      optimal dose of pyrrolitinib, three dose groups of 240mg, 320mg, and 400mg were set, and the&#xD;
      &quot;3+3&quot; study design principle was adopted. About 27-36 people will be included in the study&#xD;
      (depending on the progress of the study)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. 18 ≤ age ≤75, regardless of gender. 2. Non-squamous NSCLC (including stage IIIB-IV&#xD;
             patients who relapsed after previous surgical treatment or were newly diagnosed).&#xD;
             According to AJCC edition 8 lung cancer Staging Criteria) 3. Previous treatment with&#xD;
             EGFR-TKI (not limited to algebra) and radiographic disease progression were permitted&#xD;
             with less than or equal to first-line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Before inclusion in this study (after the last treatment), tumor tissues or blood&#xD;
             samples were detected with EGFR-sensitive 19 exon deletion or L858R mutation (with or&#xD;
             without T790M), and her-2 mutation (including sensitive mutation or amplification, in&#xD;
             which amplification should be confirmed by FISH).&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The Eastern Tumor Tissue Cooperative Group (ECOG) physical status score was 0 or 1&#xD;
             and did not deteriorate in the previous 2 weeks, with a minimum expected survival of&#xD;
             12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. The patient had at least one tumor lesion that had not received previous local&#xD;
             treatment such as irradiation, nor had he received biopsy during the screening period,&#xD;
             and it could be accurately measured at baseline, with the longest diameter ≥ 10mm at&#xD;
             baseline (short diameter ≥ 15mm for lymph nodes). The measurement method chosen is&#xD;
             suitable for accurate repeated measurements and can be computed tomography (CT) or&#xD;
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If there is only one measurable lesion and no&#xD;
             previous local treatment such as irradiation, it may be accepted as the target lesion,&#xD;
             and a baseline evaluation of the tumor lesion shall be conducted at least 14 days&#xD;
             after the diagnostic biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. For fertile women, appropriate contraception should be used and breastfeeding&#xD;
             should not be performed for 3 months from screening to discontinuation of study&#xD;

        months after treatment is discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
