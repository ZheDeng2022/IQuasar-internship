  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, single blind, parallel controlled, multicenter clinical study was performed in&#xD;
      which patients who had undergone a cerebrospinal fluid to peritoneal shunt that met the&#xD;
      criteria were divided into two groups (test and control) in a 1:1 ratio, with the test group&#xD;
      applied disinfection by the &quot;three-step sterilization method&quot; and completed the procedure,&#xD;
      and the control group underwent the same surgical procedure according to the routine aseptic&#xD;
      disinfection procedure, relevant literatures were reviewed and the previous ones in our&#xD;
      hospital were summarized, it is intended to conduct a one-year clinical observation of the&#xD;
      two groups, to compare the perioperative and long-term infection incidence of the two groups&#xD;
      and evaluate them comprehensively, to evaluate whether the &quot;three-step sterilization method&quot;&#xD;
      disinfected patients have reduced perioperative and long term infection risk after surgery&#xD;
      compared with previous surgery with routine disinfection procedure, and to evaluate their&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;

      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative symptoms and signs, medical records, imaging data, preoperative functional&#xD;
      scores (Glasgow score, ADL score, jnphgsr score) were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Security Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Follow-up after surgery according to the study scheme, and comprehensive collection of&#xD;
           safety data, for key patient researchers should focus on, in order to comprehensively&#xD;
           and early detection of all kinds of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All adverse events are well documented, properly handled and tracked until they are&#xD;
           properly resolved or stable, and serious and unexpected events are reported to the&#xD;
           ethics committee, competent authorities, applicants and pharmaceutical supervisory and&#xD;
           administrative departments in a timely manner as required;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Major investigators regularly conduct cumulative reviews of all adverse events and, if&#xD;
           necessary, hold researcher meetings to assess the risks and benefits of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Preservation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental data is stored in Access database and stored locally after entering&#xD;
      electronic data. This clinical trial uses the subject's Research Medical Record as the&#xD;
      original data source. Researchers need to record the subject's data in the Case Report Form&#xD;
      according to the Research Medical Record. The sponsors will verify the integrity, accuracy&#xD;
      and authenticity of the data in Case Report Form.After completing the enrollment, complete&#xD;
      Case Report Form is required and the first Case Report Form copy is withdrawn by the&#xD;
      sponsor.At the end of the study, the original data, informed consent and remaining Case&#xD;
      Report Form data will be kept at the various research centers as required.The retention&#xD;
      period was 10 years after the end of the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed by double-sided test, with P &lt; 0.05 being statistically&#xD;
      significant except for those specified in particular; measurements were described by means,&#xD;
      medians, standard deviations, maximum and minimum values; counts or ranks were expressed by&#xD;
      frequency and frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homogeneity between groups was compared by t test, chi-square test or rank sum test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluation: Continuous corrected chi-2 test was used to compare the intracranial&#xD;
      infection rates within 365 days after surgery. The unilateral 95% confidence interval of&#xD;
      difference between the two groups was calculated. If the lower limit of the confidence&#xD;
      interval was greater than -10%, the superiority was established, that is, the experimental&#xD;
      group was superior to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis uses Statistical Product and Service Solutions(SPSS) 26.0 software, the&#xD;
      analysis process is all programmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was designed for superiority and inferiority according to &quot;Chow, S.C., Shao, J.,&#xD;
      and Wang, H. 2008. Sample Size Calculations in Clinical Research, Second Edition. Chapman&#xD;
      &amp;amp; Hall/CRC. Boca Raton,Florida. &quot;The main efficacy indicators were the intracranial&#xD;
      infection rate in one year after operation. The estimated infection rate was 2.8% in the&#xD;
      experimental group and 9.5% [18] in the control group. The other relevant parameters were set&#xD;
      as follows: Class I error alpha=0.05 (unilateral), test efficiency 1-beta=0.8, and the number&#xD;
      of cases in the experimental group and the control group was designed as 1:1.Comparing sample&#xD;
      size calculation formulas based on two sample rates:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate the sample size, 156 cases in the experimental group and 156 cases in the&#xD;
      control group were obtained. Considering the dropout rate of no more than 15%, 180 cases in&#xD;
      the experimental group and 180 cases in the control group were planned to be enrolled. The&#xD;
      total number of cases in the two groups was 360.This study requires at least 360 patients to&#xD;
      have sufficient test intensity to avoid false negative. In the design of the study, 600&#xD;
      patients were initially recruited, of whom 200 were from our center and 400 were from other&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;
