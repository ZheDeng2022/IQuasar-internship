      The treatments will be: 1) norepinephrine or phenylephrine infusion to maintain&#xD;
      intraoperative MAP ≥85 mmHg, delayed resumption of chronic antihypertensive medications, and&#xD;
      a target ward MAP ≥80 mmHg (tight pressure management); or, 2) routine intraoperative blood&#xD;
      pressure management and prompt resumption of chronic antihypertensive medications (routine&#xD;
      pressure management).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Consenting patients who take either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs),&#xD;
      angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or calcium channel blockers will be asked not to take&#xD;
      the medications on the morning of surgery, and instead bring them with them to the hospital.&#xD;
      Qualifying patients will be randomized 1:1, with random-sized blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be implemented by clinicians in collaboration with research personnel.&#xD;
      Arterial catheter transducers will be positioned at the level of the right atrium, and&#xD;
      adjusted as necessary if patient position is changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments will be: 1) norepinephrine or phenylephrine infusion to maintain&#xD;
      intraoperative MAP ≥85 mmHg, delayed resumption of chronic antihypertensive medications, and&#xD;
      a target ward MAP ≥80 mmHg (tight pressure management); or, 2) routine intraoperative blood&#xD;
      pressure management and prompt resumption of chronic antihypertensive medications (routine&#xD;
      pressure management).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tight pressure management: In patients assigned to tight pressure management, angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers will not be given the morning&#xD;
      of surgery. Other chronic antihypertensives will only be given as necessary to treat&#xD;
      hypertension. Clinicians will be encouraged to insert the required arterial catheter before&#xD;
      anesthetic induction because much hypotension occurs shortly after anesthetic induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A norepinephrine or phenylephrine infusion (in the preferred local concentration) will be&#xD;
      prepared, connected to an intravenous catheter, and activated at a low rate. Norepinephrine&#xD;
      can be safely given through a central catheter or peripherally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be induced with propofol or etomidate which will be given in repeated&#xD;
      small boluses or target-controlled infusion in an effort to keep mean arterial pressure ≥85&#xD;
      mmHg. Clinicians will be encouraged to use etomidate when rapid-sequence inductions are&#xD;
      required. Simultaneously, the vasopressor infusion will be adjusted with the same goal.&#xD;
      Anesthetic dose, fluid administration, and vasopressor administration will be adjusted with&#xD;
      the goal of maintaining the individual designated baseline mean arterial pressure. Invasive&#xD;
      or non-invasive advanced hemodynamic monitoring is not required, but should be used when&#xD;
      practical. Clinicians should use available information to optimize vascular volume,&#xD;
      afterload, and inotropy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resumption of chronic anti-hypertensive medications will be delayed until the third&#xD;
      postoperative day unless deemed necessary to treat hypertension or for some other clear&#xD;
      indication (e.g., preventing atrial fibrillation in a chronic beta-blocker user) because &gt;90%&#xD;
      of MINS occurs within 48 hours after surgery. When necessary to treat hypertension, chronic&#xD;
      antihypertensive or new medications can be used per clinician preference. Clinicians will&#xD;
      make what efforts they can to maintain postoperative mean arterial pressures ≥80 mmHg during&#xD;
      the initial three postoperative days by maintaining adequate hydration, using inotropic and&#xD;
      chronotropic drugs, and vasopressor as necessary. This protocol specifies the blood pressure&#xD;
      target but leaves implementation to clinical judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine pressure management: In patients assigned to routine pressure management, ACEIs,&#xD;
      ARBs, and/or calcium channel blockers can be given the morning of surgery if deemed&#xD;
      appropriate by the attending anesthesiologist. The arterial catheter will be inserted before&#xD;
      or after induction of anesthesia per clinician preference. General anesthesia will be induced&#xD;
      and maintained per routine. Blood pressure will not be deliberately reduced, but per routine&#xD;
      clinicians will presumably not intervene until MAP is &lt;65 mmHg. As usual, chronic&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive medications will be restarted shortly after surgery unless contraindicated&#xD;
      by hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, other aspects of anesthetic management will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
      responsible anesthesiologist, including the types and volumes of various fluids. Volatile or&#xD;
      intravenous anesthesia is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no limitation on ancillary vasoactive, chronotropic, and inotropic drugs.&#xD;
      Clinicians will be free to use advanced hemodynamic monitoring (e.g., pulse-wave analysis,&#xD;
      esophageal Doppler, etc.). Blood products will be given per routine. Similarly, postoperative&#xD;
      analgesic management will be per routine and clinician preference. Neuraxial and peripheral&#xD;
      nerve blocks are permitted, but epidural catheters should not be activated until surgery is&#xD;
      nearly finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because patients must be fairly sick to qualify for GUARDIAN, some will go to directly from&#xD;
      surgery to critical care units, or much less often, become unstable and require transfer from&#xD;
      a routine ward to an ICU. In either case, every effort will be to maintain randomized&#xD;
      treatments and blood pressure targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases, good judgement will predominate. Clinicians should always act in their&#xD;
      patients' best interests, irrespective of the GUARDIAN protocol&#xD;
