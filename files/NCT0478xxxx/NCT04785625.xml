    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study&#xD;
      of the INL-001 (bupivacaine HCl) implant, at 300 mg, in patients following abdominoplasty.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo abdominoplasty and have INL-001 or placebo implanted intraoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a screening period, an inpatient period (preoperative, intraoperative,&#xD;
      immediately postoperative) of approximately 4 days and an outpatient follow-up period (up to&#xD;
      30 days after treatment). Efficacy assessments will be made through 72 hours after treatment&#xD;
      (after implant placement). Posttreatment safety assessments will be made throughout the study&#xD;
      after the informed consent form is signed, and as specifically scheduled through 72 hours&#xD;
      posttreatment, on day 7 (telephone), on day 15 (clinic visit), and on day 30 (clinic visit).&#xD;
      Unless the investigator determines further hospitalization is necessary, the patient will be&#xD;
      discharged on the day occurring 72 hours after surgery Inpatient day 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening period, all patients will undergo eligibility and other screening and&#xD;
      safety assessments. On the day of surgery, patient eligibility will be reconfirmed before the&#xD;
      start of surgery, patients will be randomly assigned to treatment, and adverse events and&#xD;
      prior/concomitant medications will be reviewed. Patients will undergo an abdominoplasty&#xD;
      conducted under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event and concomitant medication information, including use of rescue pain&#xD;
      medication, will be collected throughout the study (inpatient and outpatient). Surgical wound&#xD;
      healing/grading assessments and assessment for signs and symptoms potentially indicative of&#xD;
      systemic bupivacaine toxicity will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, patient reports of pain intensity using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale&#xD;
      (NPRS) will be recorded at multiple time points through 72 hours posttreatment. Patients will&#xD;
      be permitted rescue medication (oral and/or intravenous) to manage breakthrough pain when it&#xD;
      occurs.&#xD;

    <measure>SPI24</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Sum of pain intensity (SPI).The time weighted sum of pain intensity from 0 to 24hours (ie, the area under the NRS PI curve from 0 to 24 hours). For the purpose of SPI computation, Pain Intensity at Time 0 (Baseline PI) is set to zero for all patients who have test article implantation. Minimum value would be &quot;0&quot; and Maximum value would be 240. Time-weighted SPI is calculated as the sum of the pain intensities between successive time points (i.e., if SPI24 = ∑[PI x (time t - time t-1)], where &quot;t&quot; represents a given time point,&quot;t-1&quot; represents the previous time point, and time is expressed in hours). This represents the AUC (Area Under the Curve) of the pain intensities when calculated with the trapezoidal rule.</description>

    <description>Sum of pain intensity (SPI).The time weighted sum of pain intensity from 0 to 48 hours (ie, the area under the NRS PI curve from 0 to 48 hours). For the purpose of SPI computation, Pain Intensity at Time 0 (Baseline PI) is set to zero for all patients who have test article implantation. Minimum value would be &quot;0&quot; and Maximum value would be 480. Time-weighted SPI is calculated as the sum of the pain intensities between successive time points (i.e., if SPI24 = ∑[PI x (time t - time t-1)], where &quot;t&quot; represents a given time point,&quot;t-1&quot; represents the previous time point, and time is expressed in hours).

    <measure>SPI72</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Sum of pain intensity (SPI). The time weighted sum of pain intensity from 0 to 72 hours (ie, the area under the NRS PI curve from 0 to 72 hours). For the purpose of SPI computation, PI at Time 0 (Baseline PI) is set to zero for all patients who have test article implantation. Where 0 indicates &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 indicated &quot;worst pain possible&quot;. A lower score is a better outcome. Minimum value would be &quot;0&quot; and Maximum value would be 720. Time-weighted SPI is calculated as the sum of the pain intensities between successive time points (i.e., if SPI72 = ∑[PI x (time t - time t-1)], where &quot;t&quot; represents a given time point,&quot;t-1&quot; represents the previous time point, and time is expressed in hours).

This is a basic measurement of counting in total the number of morphine tablets (15 mg) patients had use within a 24 hour period (typically called &quot;rescue&quot; to help manage pain.
