      This open-label, randomized study will assess the comparative effectiveness of two versus&#xD;
      three active MDMA-assisted therapy sessions in U.S. military veterans with at least moderate&#xD;
      chronic PTSD treated in an outpatient VA treatment clinic. The study will be conducted in up&#xD;
      to 60 participants. Prior to the randomized portion of the study, each therapist pair team&#xD;
      will treat one participant under the 3-session model, and one participant under the 2-session&#xD;
      model. In total, 8 participants will be treated under this proof of principle therapist&#xD;
      training lead-in. A 120 mg dose of MDMA, followed by a supplemental dose (60 mg) unless&#xD;
      contraindicated, is administered during the treatment period with manualized psychotherapy in&#xD;
      2 or 3 open-label monthly Experimental Sessions. This ~ 8-12-week Treatment Period includes&#xD;
      three Preparatory Sessions prior to the first MDMA-assisted session. During the treatment&#xD;
      period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non-drug&#xD;
      therapy. The Primary Outcome measure, the change in CAPS-5 from Baseline, is assessed by a&#xD;
      centralized, blinded Independent Rater (IR) pool at post-treatment for each group.&#xD;

    <description>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS-IV) is a clinician administered and scored assessment of PTSD symptoms via structured interview based upon PTSD diagnosis in DSM-IV. It contains symptom subscales, a CAPS-IV total severity score, and a diagnostic score. The total severity score is a sum of symptom frequency and intensity scores for the subscales B (re-experiencing), C (avoidance) and D (hypervigilance) and ranges from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating greater severity of PTSD symptoms. The dichotomous diagnostic score is based upon meeting each of five criteria, including index trauma, presence or absence of Criteria B, C, D described above, duration of symptoms and distress and is scored as meeting versus not meeting criteria for diagnosis.</description>
