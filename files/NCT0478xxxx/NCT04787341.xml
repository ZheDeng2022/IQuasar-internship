  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The association of doublet chemotherapy (FOLFOX and FOLFIRI) and anti-EGFR-moAbs (panitumumab&#xD;
      or cetuximab) is a standard option for the first-line treatment of unresectable RAS and BRAF&#xD;
      wt mCRC patients, especially with left-sided primary tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In RAS wt mCRC patients refractory to chemotherapy and anti-EGFR naive, the standard&#xD;
      treatment sequence is an anti-EGFR-based therapy (panitumumab or cetuximab +/- irinotecan)&#xD;
      followed by regorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a phase II randomized Japanese study named REVERCE, a higher OS was reported in favour of&#xD;
      an experimental strategy of regorafenib followed at progression by cetuximab +/- irinotecan&#xD;
      compared with the reverse standard sequence in chemorefractory and anti-EGFR-naïve, RAS wt&#xD;
      mCRC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the limitations of the REVERCE study (phase II trial with a premature conclusion for&#xD;
      poor accrual) do not allow us to draw definitive conclusions. In addition, nowadays, patients&#xD;
      candidates to an anti-EGFR-based treatment, receive anti-EGFRMoAbs in earlier lines of&#xD;
      therapy thus affecting the translation of these results in the current clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective analyses and a phase II single-arm trial showed promising activity of anti-EGFR&#xD;
      rechallenge in patients who previously achieved benefit from a first-line anti- EGFR-based&#xD;
      treatment and not bearing RAS mutation on ct-DNA at the rechallenge baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these considerations, the Investigators designed the present phase II randomized&#xD;
      study of panitumumab followed at progression by regorafenib versus the reverse sequence in&#xD;
      RAS and BRAF wt mCRC patients with the following characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. previous treatment with, or not considered candidates for, fluoropyrimidine,&#xD;
           oxaliplatin, irinotecan and an anti-angiogenic agent (bevacizumab or aflibercept);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RECIST response or stable disease lasting at least 6 months to a previous first-line&#xD;
           anti-EGFR-based treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. RAS and BRAF wt ct-DNA at the time of screening. The aim of this study is to compare the&#xD;
           two sequences in a Caucasian population of patients candidates to anti-EGFR rechallenge.&#xD;

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative blood pregnancy test at the&#xD;

             women after puberty, unless they are postmenopausal for at least 12 months, are&#xD;
             surgically sterile, or are sexually inactive A postmenopausal state is defined as no&#xD;
             menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating&#xD;
             hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a&#xD;
             post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal&#xD;
             replacement therapy. However in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH&#xD;

             investigational agent half-lives (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Women of childbearing potential with either a positive or&#xD;
             no pregnancy test at baseline. Postmenopausal women must have been amenorrheic for at&#xD;
             least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential. Sexually active males&#xD;
             and females (of childbearing potential) unwilling to practice contraception (barrier&#xD;
