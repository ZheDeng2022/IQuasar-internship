  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is to test if a 28-channel ECG (MECG) system would efficiently&#xD;
      differentiate the patients suspected to have CAD or ACS with acceptable sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity, and optimize this portable self-built-in multichannel ECG recorder system with&#xD;
      various algorithms. The 28-channel ECG (MECG) system is a multi-channel real-time&#xD;
      cardiovascular performance evaluation system. The system mainly includes: a multi-channel ECG&#xD;
      signals measurement unit, a multi-channel ECG signals processing device, and an ECG signals&#xD;
      reconstruction unit. The method uses a MAMA-END algorithm, to mark ECG signals to replace the&#xD;
      original ECG signal and to extract and reconstruct a first signals having QRS wave, and a&#xD;
      second signal having T wave; then method detects and marks the start of Q wave and the end of&#xD;
      T wave on the first signal and the second signal. Therefore, the method is able to determine&#xD;
      and evaluate if a patient does have cardiovascular disease, and to locate the lesion&#xD;
      positions of a patient having cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

      We shall conduct this prospective clinical study to define the specific patterns of&#xD;
      multichannel ECG change in adults with suspected CAD or ACS. For multichannel ECG (M-ECG)&#xD;
      examination, the signal will be recorded with a Self-built-in ECG recorder. However, the&#xD;
      examinations, diagnosis, medications, or procedures for the patients will only depend on the&#xD;
      decision made by the primary care physicians through the traditional ways. The M-ECG results&#xD;
      will not be used by the primary physicians for any diagnosis or decision-making of the&#xD;
      patients. That is, the final diagnosis of CAD will be made with coronary angiography and the&#xD;
      final diagnosis of ACS will be made with the traditional criteria (symptoms, traditional ECG&#xD;
      changes, and cardiac enzyme changes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multichannel ECG Study The Self-built-in M-ECG recorders have passed the electrical security&#xD;
      test. Multichannel ECG study will be performed under the approval of the Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board. Before ECG examination, subjects will receive adequate orientation of the examination&#xD;
      procedures and will complete inform consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the ECG recording ,the patent will lie down flat on the bed, and 4 ECG leads with&#xD;
      commercially available pads (Covidien Kendall ECG electrodes Medi-trace 200) will be applied&#xD;
      on the 4 extremities, respectively. Using xyphoid process as a right lower reference point, a&#xD;
      18cm x 18cm patch integrated with 24 evenly distributed electrode pads (Covidien Kendall ECG&#xD;
      electrodes Medi-trace Mini 100) will be applied on the left chest wall . Then, the ECG&#xD;
      signals will be recorded through the self-built-in ECG recorders. The overall period for&#xD;
      recording will be around 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postprocessing and analysis of the ECG data will be performed with a PC computer by an&#xD;
      analyzer without prior knowledge of the patient's clinical information. After ECG data is&#xD;
      acquired, the analytic software will provide an electrical mapping of QTc dispersion (SIQTC).&#xD;
