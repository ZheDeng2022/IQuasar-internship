  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound-guided brachial plexus blocks are used successfully for upper extremity surgeries.&#xD;
      In this randomized prospective single-blind study, ASA I-II patients aged 18-65 years&#xD;
      undergoing hand, wrist, and forearm surgery will be randomly divided into two groups. First&#xD;
      group will receive ultrasound-guided coronal oblique supraclavicular block using a 22G, 50 mm&#xD;
      stimulator needle, and the second group, ultrasound-guided lateral sagittal infraclavicular&#xD;
      block using a 22G 100 mm stimulator needle. We will prepare, 30 ml of 1:1 0.5% bupivacaine&#xD;
      and 2% prilocaine with 5 mcg adrenaline per milliliter as local anesthetic mixture. Block&#xD;
      application time, block success, sensory and motor block levels, and postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      time will be recorded and compared between the groups. Accordingly, the success rate of the&#xD;
      two methods will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this prospective single-blind study, patients will be divided into 2 groups with the&#xD;
      closed envelope method. Patients will be taken to the block application room before the&#xD;
      operation. Standard monitoring (pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure, ECG) will be&#xD;
      applied to the patients. Premedication will be provided with 1mg IV midazolam after&#xD;
      peripheral vascular access. Blocks will be performed by an experienced anesthesiologist under&#xD;
      the guidance of USG and evaluated by another anesthesiologist who is blind to the block&#xD;
      technique. After the antisepsis of the area, a 22G 100 mm stimulator needle will be used in&#xD;
      the infraclavicular approach and a 22G 50 mm in the supraclavicular block. Intermittent&#xD;
      negative aspiration will be performed during all procedures to detect possible vascular&#xD;
      puncture. 30 ml of 1:1 0.5% bupivacaine and 2% prilocaine plus 5 mcg adrenaline per ml will&#xD;
      be used as local anesthetic mixture. The infraclavicular block will be applied by the lateral&#xD;
      sagittal method under USG guidance. Supraclavicular block will be applied in the coronal&#xD;
      oblique plane while the probe is placed on the clavicle. Following the blocks, the 5th, 10th,&#xD;
      15th, 20th, 25th, and 30th-minute sensory block levels, 10th, 20th, and 30th-minute motor&#xD;
      block levels will be recorded. Sensory block level; Axillary, median, radial, ulnar,&#xD;
      musculocutaneous, cutaneous brachia, and cutaneous antebrachii medialis nerve level will be&#xD;
      evaluated with the pinprick test and its level will be recorded. (0 = painful, no block; 1 =&#xD;
      partial block-analgesia, only tactile sensation; 2 = complete block, no pain). The motor&#xD;
      block will be evaluated with a modified bromage scale: 0: No blocks, he can lift his arm; 1:&#xD;
      Arm is weak but active; 2: Arm is motionless but fingers are active; 3: Complete block, no&#xD;
      movement in hand or arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block success; At the 30th minute of LA application, the pinprick test will define the&#xD;
      presence of insensibility or only a sense of touch in the musculocutaneous, radial, ulnar,&#xD;
      median, cutaneous antebrachii nerves. If any of these nerves are not blocked, it will be&#xD;
      considered a failed block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesia time; It will be considered as when the NRS(Numeric Rating Scale)&#xD;
      isâ‰¥1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain Score Follow-up; patients' pain scores will be recorded by checking their NRS scores at&#xD;
      the 2nd, 6th, 12th, 24th hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory (the time from local anesthetic injection until the patient fully perceives the upper&#xD;
      limb) and motor (the time from local anesthetic injection until the patient's upper extremity&#xD;
      regains full muscle strength) block time will be recorded as the block return time. Pain&#xD;
      score during block application will be evaluated with the NRS. Block application time will be&#xD;
      defined as the time from the moment the needle passes the skin until the local anesthetic is&#xD;
      given and withdrawn. Block formation time will be defined as the time required to initiate&#xD;
      anesthesia and analgesia in all 5 distal nerves. Patient and surgeon satisfaction will be&#xD;
      evaluated as 1 = complete dissatisfaction, 2 = moderate satisfaction, 3 = full satisfaction,&#xD;
      after the procedure. Patients will be followed up for 24 hours in terms of undesirable side&#xD;
      effects, vascular puncture, hematoma, signs of LA toxicity, respiratory distress,&#xD;
      pneumothorax, and horner syndrome. As rescue anesthesia, sedoanalgesia will be tried with&#xD;
      remifentanil infusion, if it is not successful, general anesthesia will be started with a&#xD;
      laryngeal mask. As postoperative analgesic regimen, patients will receive 3 x 1000 mg IV&#xD;
      acetaminophen. As rescue analgesia, Tramadol 1 mg/kg IV will be ordered to be administered&#xD;
      when the patient's NRS is 3 or more. The first time when the patient receives rescue&#xD;
      analgesia and the total dose of rescue analgesia for the first 24 hours will be recorded.&#xD;
