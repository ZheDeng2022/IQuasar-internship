  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for better ways to help women prevent pregnancy. Every month, a&#xD;
      woman's body prepares for pregnancy in a process called the menstrual cycle. When pregnancy&#xD;
      does not happen, menstruation occurs. During menstruation, women lose blood and tissue from&#xD;
      inside the womb. This bleeding can last for about 2 to 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormonal intrauterine contraception aims to help women prevent pregnancy by stopping the&#xD;
      process of the menstrual cycle. Intrauterine means that the contraception is in the form of a&#xD;
      device that is inserted into a woman's womb by her doctor. The device then releases the&#xD;
      contraception into the womb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have found that when women use hormonal contraception, the disruption to the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle can cause changes to how often and for how long women will bleed. So, the&#xD;
      researchers in this study want to learn more about the menstrual bleeding patterns of women&#xD;
      in Spain who are using hormonal intrauterine contraception for the first time. In other&#xD;
      words, In particular for the LNG-IUSs, irregular bleeding due to the local effect of&#xD;
      levonorgestrel on the endometrium is common, particularly during the first 3 months of use,&#xD;
      and it is of interest to know if this is a major reason why Spanish women discontinue this&#xD;
      very effective method and what other factors may be associated with discontinuation. The&#xD;
      researchers will then use this information to estimate how many women choose to stop using&#xD;
      the contraception. The participants will be able to enroll in this study after requesting&#xD;
      hormonal intrauterine contraception from their doctor. They will be women between the ages of&#xD;
      18 and 35 who have never used hormonal intrauterine contraception before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will visit the study site 3 times. On the first visit, they will receive the&#xD;
      hormonal intrauterine contraception. The doctors will also check their health to make sure&#xD;
      they can join the study. The participants will visit the study site again 4-12 weeks later,&#xD;
      and one last time after 1 year of having the hormonal intrauterine contraception. During&#xD;
      these visits, the doctors will ask the participants questions about any medical problems they&#xD;
      have and if they want to continue using the contraception. Throughout the study, the&#xD;
      participants will use a mobile app to track information about their menstrual bleeding and&#xD;
      how they feel about it.&#xD;
