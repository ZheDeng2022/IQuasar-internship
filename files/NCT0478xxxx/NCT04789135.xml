    <textblock>
      Interstitial Cystitis / bladder pain syndrome (CI / BPS) is a debilitating pathology with a&#xD;
      negative impact on the quality of life of affected individuals. It is characterized as the&#xD;
      sensation of pain or discomfort related to the urinary bladder, accompanied by symptoms of&#xD;
      the lower urinary tract, in the absence of infection. Among the phenotypes are Cystitis with&#xD;
      Hunner's ulcer, essentially inflammatory pathology and without Hunner's lesion,&#xD;
      non-inflammatory frequently associated with somatoform systemic changes. Functional changes&#xD;
      in urothelium and epithelial barrier, neurogenic inflammation and autoimmune mechanisms are&#xD;
      involved in the development of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical ozone has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytoprotective, antimicrobial and&#xD;
      immunomodulatory properties. When administered, it is dissolved in biological fluids,&#xD;
      immediately reacting with glycoproteins composed of carbohydrates and polypeptide chains.&#xD;
      This reaction results in the formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), lipid oxidation products&#xD;
      (LOS), increased activation of erythroid-related nuclear transcription factors (Nrf2)&#xD;
      activation of antioxidant response transcription elements (ARE) and increased variety of&#xD;
      antioxidant enzymes that act as free radical scavengers. Benefits of O3 have been&#xD;
      demonstrated in the treatment of neuropathic pain and hyperalgesia associated with the&#xD;
      analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this work is to evaluate the effect of intravesical ozone gas administration&#xD;
      in patients with Interstitial Cystitis / Painful Bladder Syndrome with low response to&#xD;
      conventional therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Interstitial Cystitis / bladder pain syndrome (IC / BPS) is a debilitating pathology with a&#xD;
      negative impact on the quality of life of patients. According to the European Society for the&#xD;
      Study of IC / BPS (ESSIC) it is expressed as a sensation of pain, pressure or discomfort&#xD;
      related to the urinary bladder accompanied by symptoms of the lower urinary tract. Symptoms&#xD;
      occur in the absence of infection and obvious pelvic pathologies lasting more than six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CI / BPS has a variety of clinical phenotypes and potential etiologies. Among the&#xD;
      phenotypes are included cystitis (IC) associated with Hunner's ulcers, known as ESSIC BPS&#xD;
      type 3 and without Hunner's lesion, ESSIC type 1,2. Differentiation between the sub-types is&#xD;
      performed through cystoscopy by the presence or absence of Hunner's lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dysfunctions resulting from IC / BPS originate around the bladder, adjacent pelvic organs&#xD;
      and part of the neural tissue that controls bladder function. Functional changes in&#xD;
      urothelium and epithelial barrier, neurogenic inflammation and autoimmune mechanisms are&#xD;
      involved in the development of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urothelium is covered by a layer of glycosaminoglycans (GACs) forming a protective&#xD;
      barrier to the underlying tissues against urinary constituents and promoting selective&#xD;
      control of molecules towards the bladder wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular and structural changes in the GACs layer associated with the inflammatory process&#xD;
      cause changes in urothelial permeability allowing toxic substances and urinary cations to&#xD;
      reach the muscle and neural layer. The loss of the urothelial barrier allows chemical,&#xD;
      cytotoxic stimuli to come into direct contact with peripheral bladder afferent neurons with&#xD;
      persistent sensitization, central nervous amplification and local inflammatory reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurotransmitters released by peripheral neurons, including vasoactive peptides, calcitonin&#xD;
      and tachykinins induce mast cell degranulation and release of pro - inflammatory mediators&#xD;
      such as histamine, serotonin, tryptase, TNF-α and NGF, IL6 resulting in local inflammation.&#xD;
      These inflammatory mediators act on afferent neurons in a positive feedback loop resulting in&#xD;
      the release of neurotransmitters that exacerbate mast cell degranulation and local&#xD;
      inflammatory response, with functional destruction of bladder tissue, fibrosis, low Detrusor&#xD;
      compliance and hyperactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alterations in the Autonomic Nervous System with sympathetic hyperactivity and exacerbation&#xD;
      of the sensation of pain induces a condition of hyperalgesia associated with stress, in&#xD;
      addition to contributing to the maintenance and worsening of the functional changes of the&#xD;
      bladder. Persistent spinal cord activation can mediate pain after resolution of the&#xD;
      inflammatory process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bladder pain syndrome is a common cause of chronic pelvic pain. It presents low long-term&#xD;
      therapeutic response, innovative therapeutic modalities in the field of current studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ozone gas (O3) is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms with an unstable structure given a&#xD;
      mesomeric effect. It has an average life of 40min at 20º C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest in the therapeutic use of O3 in several diseases is growing. This interest is&#xD;
      associated with anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, antioxidant, antimicrobial and&#xD;
      immunomodulatory properties. Animal models suggest beneficial and prophylactic effects of O3&#xD;
      therapy on age-related oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When administered, O3 is dissolved in biological fluids, reacting immediately with&#xD;
      glycoproteins composed of carbohydrates and polypeptide chains (proteoglycans, collagen types&#xD;
      II and IV). This reaction results in the formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), lipid&#xD;
      oxidation products (LOS), increased activation of erythroid-related nuclear transcription&#xD;
      factors (Nrf2) activation of antioxidant response transcription elements (ARE) and increased&#xD;
      variety of antioxidant enzymes that act as free radical scavengers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of O3 have been demonstrated in the treatment of neuropathic pain and hyperalgesia&#xD;
      associated with the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect. Animal models demonstrate&#xD;
      decreased and normalized expression of caspases and IL -1β, TNF. At low doses, O3 reduces the&#xD;
      synthesis of prostaglandins (PGS) by inhibiting prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PGHS2)&#xD;
      and cyclooxygenase (COXs). This fact is critical in preventing neural sensitization following&#xD;
      persistent stimulation of intracellular pathways responsible for the excessive release of&#xD;
      cytokines, PGs, or glutamate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CRITERIA. All patients must undergo the signature of the Informed Consent Form for&#xD;
      Medical Treatment with Medicinal Ozone METHODOLOGY This is an interventional, controlled&#xD;
      study that provides for the application of intravesical ozone gas as an alternative treatment&#xD;
      for patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome The study foresees the&#xD;
      participation of 50 patients with interstitial cystitis /bladder pain syndrome and will be&#xD;
      developed in the Hospital Unit of Nephrology and Urology Distal, located in the city of&#xD;
      Jacareí, São Paulo, Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA 1.1 History A thorough general medical history to identify typical&#xD;
      diagnostic symptoms of Interstitial cystitis and bladder pain syndrome and other potential&#xD;
      mimicking causative conditions. Figure 1 shows a flowchart of clinical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Physical examination The physical exam include an abdominal and pelvic exam, with&#xD;
      particular focus for masses, bladder distension and suprapubic tenderness. In men,&#xD;
      sensitivity will be analyzed through palpation of the perineal area between the scrotum and&#xD;
      anus. In women sensitivity will be analyzed through palpation of the anterior vaginal wall&#xD;
      along the course of the urethra up to the bladder neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 DIAGNOSTIC METHODS A. Urinalysis and Culture A urine dipstick will be performed on all&#xD;
      patients The laboratory method of qualitative and quantitative determination of pathogenic&#xD;
      microorganisms in the urinary tract will be performed. Urinary tract infection will be&#xD;
      characterized by the bacterial growth of at least 105 Colony Forming Units per ml of urine&#xD;
      (100.000 CFU / mL). The collection of urinary sample will be performed with aseptic technique&#xD;
      avoiding contamination with the microbiota of the perineum, prostate, urethra and vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Ultrasound Urinary Tract Abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography will be performed on all&#xD;
      patients. C. Urodynamic Assessment Study carried out with the purpose of obtaining functional&#xD;
      information on vesical storage and emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D Symptom scores Symptom score IC / BPS will be used to establish a baseline of symptom&#xD;
      severity at admission and subsequently, track response to treatment and disease relapse. It&#xD;
      Will be used in the O'Leary-Sant Symptom and Problem Index, that is validated and widely used&#xD;
      as a self-report measure of urinary and pain symptoms and how problematic these symptoms are&#xD;
      for individuals. The measure assesses both symptoms and problems of IC/BPS each with four&#xD;
      questions, yielding a symptom score (ICSI), problem score (ICPI), and total severity score.&#xD;
      Symptom scores (ICSI) range from 0 to 21 and problem scores (ICPI) range from 0 to 16, with a&#xD;
      total ICSI/ICPI combined score ranging from 0 to 37[21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PROTOCOL Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be subjected to conventional&#xD;
      treatment of the diagnoses made and submitted to the application of intravesical medicinal&#xD;
      ozone gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic Scheme&#xD;
&#xD;
      1° Bladder wash with 0.9% Saline - 500 ml performed through urethral tube n° 10; 2° Bladder&#xD;
      emptying ; 3° Medical Ozone gas infusion 20 µg / ml - 60ml, intravesical forecast of two&#xD;
      weekly sessions, with a total of six applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Follow-up Patients will be evaluated at each session using the score IC/BPS and&#xD;
      possible side effects. At the end of the sixth session, Uroculture and Urofluxometry will be&#xD;
      scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly assessments will be scheduled for up to six months from the end of treatment to&#xD;
      verify the maintenance of therapeutic response over time DATA ANALYSIS Qualitative data will&#xD;
      be grouped into categories followed by the corresponding percentage. The analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using SPSS software and Microsoft Excel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be presented in frequency distribution tables with mean, median and&#xD;
      descriptive statistics. Statistical analysis performed using Student's t-test with&#xD;
      significance values p&gt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL RISK It is a risk procedure estimated as small since the administration of Ozone&#xD;
      with controlled doses is safe and determinant of small side effects. The discomfort caused by&#xD;
      the use of the urethral tube is small and performed safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specialized professionals who will conduct the experiments will be available and able to&#xD;
      offer any necessary attention BENEFIT Patients who will be included in the present study have&#xD;
      chronic pathology with impaired quality of life and inadequate response to conventional&#xD;
      therapy. Based on scientific evidence, Ozone Therapy is expected to be a treatment&#xD;
      alternative.&#xD;

    <description>The O 'Leary Sant Symptom and Problem Index is validated as a self-report measure of urinary symptoms and pain and how problematic these symptoms are for individuals with IC / BPS. The measure assesses symptoms and problems of IC / BPS through four questions, generating a symptom score (ICSI), problem score (ICPI) and total severity score. Symptom scores (ICSI) range from 0 to 21 and problem scores from 0 to 16, with a combined total score of 0 to 37. ICSI and ICPI score values greater than 6 alone are considered severe symptoms. Symptom scores (ICSI) greater than 5 have 94% sensitivity and 50% specificity for the diagnosis of patients with IC / BPS.&#xD;
At the end of the study, the symptom score cut-off point (ICSI) below 5 will be considered as a therapeutic response measure. The problem scores will be assessed through an improvement percentage, with values greater than 75% being considered as adequacy.</description>
