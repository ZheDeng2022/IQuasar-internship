      To compare the performance of stool-based SDC2 DNA methylation test and commercially&#xD;
      available Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) for detection of advanced colorectal neoplasia and&#xD;
      other precancerous lesions in the asymptomatic Chinese community population. The potential&#xD;
      uses of a risk-scoring system (APCS) would be evaluated too.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In China, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains to be the leading cancer of the digestive system.&#xD;
      According to nationwide cancer statistics using population-based cancer registry data in&#xD;
      China, age-standardized incidence rate of CRC and age-standardized mortality rate increased&#xD;
      significantly from 2000 to 2015. It induces a substantial financial burden in terms of&#xD;
      healthcare utilization and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) lost. Fecal Occult Blood Tests&#xD;
      (FOBT) and colonoscopy have been proposed as the main primary screening modalities for&#xD;
      asymptomatic subjects by international guidelines and Asia Pacific Consensus Statements.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, shortage and uneven distribution of colonoscopy resources combined with huge&#xD;
      population base consisted of the current situation in China. Previous population-based CRC&#xD;
      screening programs usually employed questionnaires and/or FOBT to assess high-risk groups and&#xD;
      recommended colonoscopy. This algorithm faced difficulties such as complex traditional&#xD;
      questionnaires, low colonoscopy adherence, and a high false-positive rate. When the&#xD;
      Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic further limited the implementation of colonoscopy, the&#xD;
      contradictions developed more acute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Hong Kong group had designed and validated a colorectal cancer risk scoring system based on&#xD;
      age, gender, smoking history, and family history through the results of screening in 11&#xD;
      Asia-Pacific cities. The Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening (APCS) score was more concise and&#xD;
      divided the population into three categories: low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk.&#xD;
      Compared with the low-risk population, the probability of advanced colorectal neoplasia in&#xD;
      intermediate-risk and high-risk population increased by 2.6 times and 4.3 times respectively.&#xD;
      Because of simplicity and efficiency, it was recommended by Asia-Pacific screening guidelines&#xD;
      and several guidelines in China. Another APCS related multi-center study indicated that by&#xD;
      selecting high-risk subjects and low/average-risk subjects with a positive fecal&#xD;
      immunochemical test (FIT) for colonoscopy, the colonoscopy workload could be reduced by 50%&#xD;
      compared with the strategy of primary colonoscopy in those same subjects. All these&#xD;
      experiences deserved to be drawn on during the post-pandemic era.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent decade has witnessed a rapid development of non-invasive biomarkers to detect CRC.&#xD;
      Stool DNA(sDNA) Testing is a novel screening test for CRC, using molecular techniques to&#xD;
      identify CRC-relevant biomarkers in stool. One of its toolkits, Multitarget Stool DNA Testing&#xD;
      (FIT-DNA), was first approved by the FDA in 2014 for its application in clinical practice,&#xD;
      which has been widely promoted in the United States. Subsequently, it was endorsed by&#xD;
      multiple societies as one of the recommended screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a stool test of methylated Syndecan-2(SDC2) has been developed as a fecal-DNA&#xD;
      product targeted to improve the diagnostic accuracy of CRC screening. A meta-analysis of&#xD;
      previous clinical studies reporting the accuracy of stool DNA methylation tests in detecting&#xD;
      CRC included 46 studies totaling 16,149 patients. The most accurate single gene was found to&#xD;
      be SDC2 with a pooled sensitivity of 83.1% (72.6%, 90.2%) and a specificity of 91.2% (88.6%,&#xD;
      93.2%). A recent study involving 1,110 subjects from 2017 to 2018 by three Chinese tertiary&#xD;
      hospitals assessed the performance of the SDC2 sDNA test. The sensitivity of the SDC2 sDNA&#xD;
      test was 301/359 (83.8%) for CRC, 16/38 (42.1%) for advanced adenomas, and 134/154 (87.0%)&#xD;
      for early-stage CRC (stage I-II), while maintaining a specificity of 699/713 (98.0%).&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there were limitations in the design of these original studies. For instance,&#xD;
      most involved small, hospital-based CRC cases and controls that might not fill the knowledge&#xD;
      gap between population screening. Additional clinical trials are required to further validate&#xD;
      its diagnostic accuracy in other populations, especially community-setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study intends to include asymptomatic subjects from the communities along the southeast&#xD;
      coast of China. Potential participates would be randomly recruited via community public&#xD;
      communication. The subjects would be asked to fill in a concise questionnaire obtained&#xD;
      through a public WeChat account after informed consent. Basic information would be acquired&#xD;
      while APCS score and correspondent risk categories would be calculated automatically. After&#xD;
      sampling education (on-site + online), stool collection devices of sDNA and quantitative&#xD;
      fecal immunochemical test (qFIT) would be distributed to all subjects. Two samples of stool&#xD;
      from single defecation would be requested to put into the two collection devices according to&#xD;
      instructions respectively by the subjects themselves at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts would be made by the public WeChat account and the community staff to urge samples&#xD;
      recover from subjects as quickly as possible (prefer within 24h after defecation. Later than&#xD;
      5 days would be deemed ineligible). Community staff would deliver the samples qualified in&#xD;
      the initial evaluation to the standardized laboratory for testing as quickly as possible. If&#xD;
      APCS be evaluated high-risk or any of qFIT or sDNA tests positive, the risk of the subject&#xD;
      would be considered increased. Colonoscopy would be strongly recommended, and priority and&#xD;
      rapid arrangement would be made in the corresponding center. For subjects with&#xD;
      low/intermediate-risk APCS and negative qFIT and sDNA, the project team also encourages the&#xD;
      subjects to accept colonoscopy on the basis of a clear understanding of benefits and risks.&#xD;
      We would help to arrange colonoscopy as early as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All colonoscopy examinations would be performed in the designated endoscopy centers by&#xD;
      experienced endoscopists while monitoring quality of colonoscopy (bowel preparation, cecal&#xD;
      intubation rate and withdrawal time). Full-time recording personnel would be arranged to&#xD;
      follow up and record the relevant information of colonoscopy. For the subjects diagnosed with&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, the postoperative diagnosis and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging of the&#xD;
      subjects would be retrieved.&#xD;
