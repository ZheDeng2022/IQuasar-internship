  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While guideline-directed nonpharmacological strategies for chronic low back pain are well&#xD;
      established, optimal chronic pain management for emergency department patients has yet to be&#xD;
      defined. Mindfulness interventions can be used for management of chronic conditions, yet are&#xD;
      understudied as a primary approach for patients with chronic pain discharged from the&#xD;
      emergency department. Currently, there is limited evidence examining whether an individual&#xD;
      telehealth mindfulness intervention is a feasible and acceptable for these patients. This&#xD;
      study will develop, pilot, and evaluate the feasibility and effects of an 8-session (12-week)&#xD;
      telehealth mindfulness intervention for patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic low&#xD;
      back pain&#xD;
