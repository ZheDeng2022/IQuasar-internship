  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regardless of the method used to measure BP, initial and ongoing training of technicians and&#xD;
      healthcare providers and the use of validated and calibrated devices are critical for&#xD;
      obtaining accurate BP measurements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shortage of human resources and the importance of remaining up-to-date to provide healthcare&#xD;
      services highlighted the development of distance education for nurses. In addition&#xD;
      information presented via the distance learning method via software systems was more stable&#xD;
      than the face-to-face method via lecture, and it saved time and energy. Nurses are&#xD;
      responsible for BP monitoring and assessment in the clinical setting. Finding new strategies&#xD;
      for distance education is of great concern and ,compared with traditional face-to-face&#xD;
      interventions, those carried out through social networks have the advantage that the&#xD;
      participant does not need to attend the sessions in person, and offers unlimited access to&#xD;
      the intervention materials whenever they wish.&#xD;
