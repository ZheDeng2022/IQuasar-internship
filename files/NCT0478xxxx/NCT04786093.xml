  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized Phase II study which is designed to determine the impact of stereotactic&#xD;
      radiotherapy and durvalumab on quality-of-life and oncologic outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Durvalumab (Imfinzi) and stereotactic radiotherapy, with&#xD;
      each fraction of radiotherapy is given every other day on a standard stereotactic ablative&#xD;
      radiotherapy (SAbR) schedule or every four weeks on the personalized ultra-fractionated&#xD;
      stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR) schedule. Subjects will be followed for a period&#xD;
      of 2 years after completion of treatment or until death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
      Specifically, subjects will be followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months&#xD;
      following treatment. After the 2 year follow up, the patient can continue routine follow up&#xD;
      with their physicians, per standard of care. Subjects removed from therapy for unacceptable&#xD;
      adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>We hypothesize that Durvalumab and stereotactic radiotherapy, in the form of PULSAR and SAbR, and durvalumab will confer a 60% increase in improvement in quality of life over the historical control rate of 33%, for an absolute improvement of 27%. Using a two-sided exact binomial test with a two-sided significance level of 0.1 and 80% power, we estimate that we will need to enroll 23 patients per arm do detect a difference. Accounting for 10% attrition, we will plan to enroll 52 patients.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>To assess the impact of durvalumab and stereotactic radiotherapy, in the form of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAbR) or personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR), will lead to improved QoL (quality of life) in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer using the European organization for Research and treatment of cancer questionnaire.

    <description>Durvalumab (initially developed as MEDI4736) is a human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa subclass that inhibits binding of PD-L1 (B7-H1, CD274) to PD-1 (CD279) and CD80 (B7-1). MEDI4736 is composed of 2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical light chains, with an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa. MEDI4736 contains a triple mutation in the constant domain of the Ig G1 heavy chain that reduces binding to complement protein C1q and the fragment crystallizable gamma receptors involved in triggering effector function.</description>
