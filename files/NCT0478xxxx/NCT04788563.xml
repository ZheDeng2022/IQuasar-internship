    <textblock>
      Heat-sensitive moxibustion, an important mean of external therapy of traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine, has unique advantages in treating various chronic diseases than common moxibustion.&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of heat-sensitive&#xD;
      moxibustion for primary hypertension under community self-management setting using a&#xD;
      multicenter, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial design with patient-preference arms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary hypertension is a common chronic disease that threatens the life and health of human&#xD;
      beings. The conventional western drug therapy often has side effects and many patients are&#xD;
      unable to achieve ideal blood pressure control with drugs alone. Therefore, the treatment of&#xD;
      primary hypertension still requires active exploration of complementary and alternative&#xD;
      therapies with clear clinical efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heat-sensitive moxibustion is an innovative moxibustion therapy. By stimulating the patient's&#xD;
      special moxibustion sensation, heat-sensitive moxibustion can achieve better results than&#xD;
      traditional moxibustion for many diseases, including primary hypertension. Heat-sensitive&#xD;
      moxibustion is an easy, inexpensive and safe treatment method. The practitioner does not need&#xD;
      to be professionally qualified to perform moxibustion, making it a suitable technique for&#xD;
      patients to self-medicate on a daily basis. Traditional moxibustion has been shown to lower&#xD;
      blood pressure in patients with primary hypertension. Theoretically, heat-sensitive&#xD;
      moxibustion could achieve better blood pressure lowering effects, but its effects in lowering&#xD;
      blood pressure in the setting of self-management in community patients is unclear. To verify&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of heat-sensitive moxibustion community self-management for&#xD;
      hypertension, we plan to perform a randomized controlled trial. In this trial, we designed&#xD;
      the trial grouping scheme as a randomized controlled trial with patient preference arms in&#xD;
      order to improve patient adherence and reduce the impact of patient preference effects.&#xD;
