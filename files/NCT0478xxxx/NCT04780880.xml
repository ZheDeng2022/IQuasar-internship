  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to obtain data on the occurrence of injuries, their mechanisms and&#xD;
      types among children and adolescents from a youth soccer club. In addition, in order to&#xD;
      determine the potential risk of injury, the investigators will examine the prognostic factors&#xD;
      on the basis of tests assessing the antropometric, anatomical, physical and fitness&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the 2020/2023 seasons, participants will be obliged to report injuries to to sports&#xD;
      physiotherapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervision and data collection on injuries will be documented by experienced sports&#xD;
      physiotherapists. Using the Injury Record Form, a standardized definition and classification&#xD;
      of injuries in line with the International Olympic Committee Consensus describing methods for&#xD;
      recording and reporting epidemiological data on injuries and diseases in sport (Bahr et al.&#xD;
      2020). In addition, the data will also come from a physiotherapeutic examination, and in the&#xD;
      case of severe injuries (requiring specialist consultation), a medical examination&#xD;
      (orthopedic and / or neurological) and imaging tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training and match exhibition (time spent by participants during training units and match&#xD;
      games) will be recorded individually for each participant by the coaches of a given team&#xD;
      (year). The given data (in minutes) will allow to determine the total time of sports&#xD;
      exposure. The participant's missed training and / or competition due to an injury will also&#xD;
      be analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>The Functional Movement Screen (FMS) is a screening tool used to identify limitations or asymmetries in movement patterns. FMS consists of 7 movement tasks (deep squat, lunges, hurdle steps, a push-up, straight-leg raises, shoulder mobility, and rotary stability). Each task will be visually assessed by an experienced physiotherapist and marked on a 4-point scale (0-3, worst-best). The total maximum score that can be obtained is 21 points.</description>
