  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of two different doses of 7-Keto compared to placebo&#xD;
      on resting metabolic rate. One third of subjects will be given the lower 7-Keto dose, one&#xD;
      third will be given the higher 7-Keto dose and one third will be given the placebo.&#xD;
