  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non blinded two arm cluster randomized control trial, aimed at assessing the&#xD;
      feasibility of using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification/define Daily Doses&#xD;
      system tool to monitor antibiotic use at lower primary levels of care in Uganda.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the feasibility of using the ATC/DDD in three districts of&#xD;
      Southwestern Uganda. The unit of intervention will be a health facility. Eighteen (18)&#xD;
      randomly selected government owned health facilities at levels II, III and IV will be split&#xD;
      evenly between the intervention and non intervention arms. Antibiotic prescriptions of new&#xD;
      adult (in-patients and ambulatory) patients with antibiotic utilization records from the&#xD;
      selected facilities will be enrolled in the study. The intervention is the introduction of&#xD;
      the ATC/DDD plus the training on its importance and use by healthcare providers. The&#xD;
      facilities selected will be far apart from each other to avoid contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm: The ATC/DDD tool shall be piloted in all selected facilities of the 3&#xD;
      randomly selected districts of Mbarara, Bushenyi and Kasese. The prescribers at these&#xD;
      facilities will be trained about the importance and usability of the ATC/DDD tool. A pre and&#xD;
      post assessment of the prescribers understanding of the tool's usability will be done prior&#xD;
      to piloting the tool. This will guide the focus of the training and any other necessary&#xD;
      support after the training. The trained prescribers will use the latest tool version to&#xD;
      evaluate drug utilization of antibiotics (anti-infectives for systemic use) used at their&#xD;
      respective facility levels for a period of 6 months. Prescriptions and drug administration&#xD;
      reviews will be done in three phases and for 5 days following the National Medical Stores&#xD;
      delivery schedule for medicines, that is, shortly after delivery of drugs (phase 1), midway&#xD;
      (phase 2) and towards the end of the delivery period (phase 3). The evaluation will involve&#xD;
      computation of antibiotic utilization parameters using the latest version of the ATC/DDD by&#xD;
      both the trained healthcare providers and an independent research team. Findings will be&#xD;
      compared for both groups to ensure implementation infidelity. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and antibiotic utilization records:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For inpatients: On the day of patient recruitment, health workers will routinely conduct&#xD;
           baseline assessment of the consented patients to obtain data on demographics, clinical&#xD;
           conditions and medications. Daily reviews of patients shall be conducted as routinely&#xD;
           done by the clinicians until discharge, referral, death or loss to follow-up. A data&#xD;
           extraction template will then be used to capture both baseline and daily follow-up&#xD;
           patient information . Medication data will be obtained from the patient's hospital file&#xD;
           (clinical notes, treatment sheets and drug administration charts), dispensing records of&#xD;
           ward units, pill count validation of a patient's oral medication (capsules, tablets,)&#xD;
           and of unused injectable medicine vials or ampoules in the possession of the patient or&#xD;
           the caregiver. This will be done on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For ambulatory patients: Only prescription data will be obtained from Out-patient&#xD;
           Department (OPD) registers, dispensing logs and/or patients' charts using a data&#xD;
           extraction template.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-intervention arm: These will continue with the standard practice. However, the research&#xD;
      team will collect data during the respective phases highlighted in the intervention arm for&#xD;
      computation using the latest version of the ATC/DDD tool and comparison.&#xD;
