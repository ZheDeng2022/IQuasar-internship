  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients treated for cataract surgery benefit from a short outpatient course with&#xD;
      topical local anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having to undergo surgery, especially on the eye, without being asleep, can be stressful.&#xD;
      Sometimes waiting in a waiting room with other patients can increase this stress. Patient&#xD;
      anxiety may increase blood pressure potentially leading to the prescription of nicardipine to&#xD;
      allow surgery to be performed. The patient's anxiety also increases the surgeon's stress,&#xD;
      which can alter the conditions for performing the intervention and increase the risk of&#xD;
      intraoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the administration of anxiolytics, nurses have few options for patients with anxiety.&#xD;
      However, the treatment response time is not always appropriate and the patient's cooperation&#xD;
      during the procedure can sometimes be impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of music on preoperative anxiety has been evaluated in several studies and has&#xD;
      shown a significant decrease in anxiety before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MusicCare® is a &quot;digital treatment&quot; based on the principles of hypnoanalgesia which has been&#xD;
      tested in the management of patients with various pathologies (depression, Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, chronic pain, etc.) and has shown relative effectiveness. the absence of&#xD;
      intervention on the pain and anxiety of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of cataract surgery with topical local anesthesia, we would like to assess the&#xD;
      contribution of offering the MusicCare® listening device on patients' anxiety about absence&#xD;

    <description>The device consists of a headset and a touch pad. The patient can choose the style of music he prefers among 5. The 'U-shaped sequence' offered by MusicCare® is based on the principle of hypnoanalgesia. Musical induction is personalized according to the patient's preference. It will gradually lead to a hypnotic state of consciousness modified by variations in musical components such as rhythm, frequencies, orchestral formation and volume. A listening session lasts about 20 minutes.</description>
