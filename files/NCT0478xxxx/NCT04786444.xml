      investigating three Lots of VLA1553. Overall, approximately 402 healthy subjects aged 18 to&#xD;
      45 years will be enrolled into the study, approximately 134 subjects per VLA1553 Lot.&#xD;
      Subjects will be block-randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into the three study arms to receive one&#xD;
      of three Lots of VLA1553 as a single i.m. vaccination. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      demonstrate Lot-to-Lot manufacturing consistency of VLA1553 28 days following vaccination.&#xD;
