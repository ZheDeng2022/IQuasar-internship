      PET Trial to Evaluate Target Occupancy of CVL-231 at Muscarinic Receptors Type 4 in Brain&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CVL-231 is a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) activator that selectively binds to&#xD;
      the M4 muscarinic receptor subtype (M4 mAChR). CVL-231 is being developed for treatment of&#xD;
      psychosis in schizophrenia. The aim of this trial is to characterize the relationship between&#xD;
      the M4 receptor occupancy in different regions of the brain following a single oral doses of&#xD;
      CVL-231 in healthy adult subjects by positron emission tomography (PET) using the radioligand&#xD;
      [11C]MK-6884.&#xD;
