      This is a 2-part multicenter Phase 1b study designed to test icapamespib in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent brain lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the trial will be a standard 3 by 3 dose escalation design where different doses&#xD;
      are examined. Part 2 will be a dose expansion cohort to further evaluate the recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The RP2D is defined as the dose level recommended for further clinical&#xD;

      This is a 2-part multicenter Phase 1b study designed to test the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of single agent oral icapamespib in patients with recurrent brain lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the trial will be a standard 3 by 3 dose escalation design where different doses&#xD;
      are examined. Part 2 will be a dose expansion cohort to further evaluate the recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The RP2D is defined as the dose level recommended for further clinical&#xD;
      study, or the highest dose tested. The RP2D may be the same as the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) or modified from the MTD based on assessment of overall exposure, safety experience in&#xD;
      Cycle 2 and beyond, and clinical benefit data in the study. The RP2D will be determined in&#xD;
      the dose expansion phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Up to 30 patients with 1st, 2nd or 3rd recurrence of IDH wild type glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme (GBM) or grade 3 or 4, Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant astrocytoma will be&#xD;
      enrolled to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and MTD of single&#xD;
      agent oral icapamespib administered daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Icapamespib will be administered orally once daily for each 28-day cycle. The initial dose in&#xD;
      this trial will be 20 mg in Cohort 1. Dose escalation will proceed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  100% increment until the first drug-related Grade 2 adverse event (AE) occurs, then&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  50% increment until the first drug-related Grade 3 event occurs, then&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  33% increment until the first Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) occurs, then&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20% increment until RP2D is declared.&#xD;
