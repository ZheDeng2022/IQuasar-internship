  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized control trial investigates whether a psychosocial intervention&#xD;
      targeting parent-adolescent conflict is feasible and acceptable, in preparation for a future&#xD;
      trial that will test whether the intervention can improve treatment outcomes for youth&#xD;
      diagnosed with depression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parent involvement in psychosocial interventions for youth diagnosed with internalizing&#xD;
      disorders has been cited as a contributor to better outcomes for these youth, and parent&#xD;
      components have been included in several evidence-based interventions for adolescent mental&#xD;
      health problems. Additionally, youth experiencing mood and behaviour changes that come about&#xD;
      as a result of a depressive episode can lead to frustrated/overprotective reactions from&#xD;
      parents, which can contribute to worse outcomes for these adolescents. Interventions focused&#xD;
      on addressing parent-adolescent conflict and reducing negative interactions can potentially&#xD;
      support recovery from depression and reduce episode relapse. However, there is very little&#xD;
      research on including parent components in psychosocial interventions specifically aimed at&#xD;
      youth depression. This randomized control trial aims to fill this gap by randomizing parents&#xD;
      of youth receiving treatment for depression into either 1) an 8-week virtual or in-person&#xD;
      group parent intervention, or 2) usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be parents or caregivers (for simplicity, the term &quot;parent&quot; is used to&#xD;
      refer to parents or caregivers) of adolescents aged 13-18 with depression who are part of the&#xD;
      care pathway for youth depression at a mental health research hospital in Toronto, Canada.&#xD;
      Their adolescents will also participate in the study in order to provide multi-informant&#xD;
      data; however, should adolescents decline to participate in the study, their parent will&#xD;
      still be able to take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents and adolescents will complete a combination of questionnaire, interview, and&#xD;
      observationally coded measures at pre- and posttreatment, along with questionnaire measures&#xD;
      at mid-treatment and 3 months follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>The parent intervention group will undergo 8 weekly, manualized group sessions, with between 6 and 10 parent participants. Sessions are structured and follow an agenda including check-in and review of home practice, discussion of a skill or strategy, and review and assignment of home practice. Group sessions are held weekly for 1.5 hours and include both didactic, discussion, and practice elements, as well as assigned home practice.</description>

    <description>Parents in the usual care condition will be involved in their adolescent's care as is standard in our clinical program. With adolescent consent, parents are invited to participate in a single, 2-hour orientation session for parents/caregivers that provides information about depression, as well as the role of sleep, diet, and exercise in improving mood. Based on adolescent preference, parents can also attend regular psychiatric appointments with their adolescent, in which they will receive further information about depression and may receive and provide information about their adolescent's depression symptoms and response to psychosocial and pharmacological interventions. This control condition will allow us to determine whether the parent intervention is more effective than a relevant clinical alternative.</description>

             of 11 or greater on the parent version, of the 20-item Conflict Behavior&#xD;
             Questionnaire; or b) a rating of 2 or higher on item 2 or 3 (Item 2 &quot;getting along&#xD;
             with your mother/mother figure;&quot; item 3 &quot;getting along with your father/father&#xD;
             figure&quot;) of the youth-report version of the Columbia Impairment Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  both parent and adolescent speak, read, and write English at a Grade 6 level or above&#xD;
