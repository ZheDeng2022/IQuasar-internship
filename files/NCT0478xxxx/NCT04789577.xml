    <description>CBER criteria for seroconversion rate (SCR) for 18 to 64 years of age is shown if LL of the 99.17% CI for the SCR meets or exceeds 40%, and for ≥ 65 years of age, if the LL of the 99.17% CI for the SCR meets or exceeds 30%. Seroconversion is defined as a post-vaccination antibody titer ≥ 40 1/DIL in the serum of participants seronegative before vaccination (i.e. titer &lt; assay cut-off at Day 1). For seropositive participants (i.e. titer ≥ assay cut-off at Day 1), seroconversion requires a 4-fold rise in postvaccination HI antibody titer (but at least a titer of 40 1/DIL). The percentage of participants is calculated with Clopper-Pearson exact two-sided 99.17% CIs. Note: The cut-off value for antibody titer is defined by the laboratory before the analysis.</description>

    <description>Anti-MN antibody titers are expressed as Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs). The GMTs calculations are performed by taking the antilog of the mean of the log concentration/titer transformations. Values for the antibody concentrations/titers below the assay cutoff will be assigned half the assay cut-off value for the purpose of GMT computation. MN analyses are performed on the MN subset that includes approximately 420 participants (60 per group). The first 30 participants per treatment group are selected in the ≥ 65 age group and then the first 15 participants in 18 to 49 years and 50 to 64 years age groups. If there are not 15 participants for the 18 to 49 or 50 to 64 years age groups, they are selected whichever has the smaller number fully and then have a total of 30 for the total among these 2 age groups per treatment group. All samples are collected first, then selected for the subset.</description>

    <description>Vaccine Response Rate (VRR) is expressed as the percentage of participants with a vaccine response defined as at least a 4-fold increase in antibody titer as compared to the antibody titer at Day 1 (pre-vaccination). Antibody titers below the cut-off of the assay are given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of vaccine response calculation. For VRR, the percentage of participants is calculated with Clopper-Pearson exact two-sided 95% CIs. MN analyses are performed on the MN subset.</description>
