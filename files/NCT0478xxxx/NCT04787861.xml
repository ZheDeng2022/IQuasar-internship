      To investigate the effects of the addition of motorized movement therapy versus conventional&#xD;
      chest physiotherapy alone on pulmonary functions, exercise capacity, and endurance in&#xD;
      children with Down Syndrome (DS). Methods: This randomized controlled study included 40&#xD;
      children (24 boys &amp; 16 girls) with DS. Their ages ranged from 9 to 13 years. The control&#xD;
      group received conventional chest physical therapy program, three sessions per week for 12&#xD;
      weeks. The study group received an aerobic exercise regimen using a motorized movement&#xD;
      therapy device 3 times /week in addition to the same traditional program used with the&#xD;
      control group. Pulmonary function tests, and six-minutes walking test were measured at&#xD;
      baseline, after 18 sessions and after 36 sessions of treatment.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1st second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 6 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the maximal volume of air that can be expired in 1st second of forced vital capacity maneuver using spirometry. We measured FEV1 at baseline and at end of 18 sessions (week 6) and 36 sessions (week 12).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in forced vital capacity (FVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 6 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the maximal volume of air that can be expired while patient performs forced expiration as fast and as deep as possible using spirometry.&#xD;
We measured FVC at baseline and at end of 18 sessions (week 6) and 36 sessions (week 12).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in FEV1/FVC ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 6 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1/FVC is used to differentiate obstructive from restrictive patterns by spirometry. We measuredFEV1/ FVC at baseline and at end of 18 sessions (week 6) and 36 sessions (week 12).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 6 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).is the maximal flow rate achieved during FVC maneuver using spirometry.&#xD;
We measured PEFR at baseline and at end of 18 sessions (week 6) and 36 sessions (week 12).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 6 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) is the maximal volume of air that can be moved by voluntary ventilation in 1 minute while the patient breathes deeply and rapidly for 12 to 15 seconds using spirometry.&#xD;
We measured MVV at baseline and at end of 18 sessions (week 6) and 36 sessions (week 12).</description>
