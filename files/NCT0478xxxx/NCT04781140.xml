    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale, 4th Edition, Preschool Version (ADHD-RS-IV-P) Total Score at End of Study. The ADHD-RS-IV-P consists of 18 items that correspond directly to the DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD and are also subdivided into two subscales: inattention (9 items) and hyperactivity-impulsivity (9 items).The clinician rates the frequency and severity of each symptom on a 4-point Likert-type scale, where 0 = Never or rarely, 1 = Sometimes, 2 = Often, and 3 = Very often. The Total Score is the summation of all 18 items ranging from 0 and 54, and subscale scores are the summation of 9 items ranging from 0 and 27 for both Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity. Lower scores represent a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Effect of SPN-812 on the global assessment of severity of illness as assessed by the Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Score at End of Study. The CGI-S is a single item clinician rating of clinician's assessment of the severity of the ADHD symptoms in relation to the clinician's total experience with patients with ADHD. The CGI-S is evaluated on a 7-point scale with 1 = Normal, not at all ill, 2 = Borderline Ill, 3 = Mildly Ill, 4 = Moderately Ill, 5 = Markedly Ill, 6 = Severely Ill, and 7 = Extremely Ill. Successful therapy is indicated by a lower overall score in subsequent testing.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) Score at End of Study.The CGI-I is an assessment of how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of treatment. The CGI-I is evaluated on a 7-point scale with 1 = Very much improved, 2 = Much improved, 3 = Minimally improved, 4 = No change, 5 = Minimally worse, 6 = Much worse, and 7 = Very much worse. Successful therapy is indicated by a lower overall score in subsequent testing.</description>
