  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ziresovir following a single ascending&#xD;
      oral dose administration in healthy adult subjects under fasted conditions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 3 dose cohorts are planned. The ziresovir dose level of each cohort is determined based&#xD;
      on the collective clinical and nonclinical data of ziresovir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed dose levels of Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 are 300 mg and up to 600 mg and up to 900 mg,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of up to 24 subjects will be randomized with 18 subjects to receive active drug and 6&#xD;
      subjects to receive placebo in a double-blind fashion. Eight subjects will be randomized in&#xD;
      each dose cohort, with 6 subjects to receive active drug and 2 subjects o receive placebo.&#xD;
