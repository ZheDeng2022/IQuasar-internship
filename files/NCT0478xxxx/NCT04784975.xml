  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well-established that persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at an increased risk for&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality related to bone fracture due to poor bone health, however we do not&#xD;
      fully understand the mechanism behind the increased fracture risk. We are examining bone&#xD;
      health and the microbiome in adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes to better&#xD;
      understand the reasons behind this increased risk.&#xD;

      This pilot study aims to look at measures of bone health, the gut microbiome and measures of&#xD;
      glycemia/glycemic variability in those with preclinical and clinical diabetes. Our primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcomes are to characterize these variables, with our long term objectives to&#xD;
      better understand the natural history of bone health in T1D, help characterize the etiology&#xD;
      of worse bone health in those with T1D, and try to identify potential time periods for&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Willing and able to comply with study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        For participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D):&#xD;
&#xD;
        - T1D diagnosed clinically by an endocrinologist as documented in medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  use of oral or parenteral antibiotics within 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  use of probiotics/prebiotics/synbiotics within 3 months of enrollment; persons who eat&#xD;
             yogurt will be asked to stop for 30 days prior to stool collection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  use of medications that will affect bone, including glucocorticoids, bisphosphonates&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  chronic medications (other than insulin for those with T1D or a stable dose of thyroid&#xD;
             hormone)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  uncontrolled chronic gastrointestinal disease including celiac disease (persons with&#xD;
             T1D will be screened for celiac disease with a Tissue Transglutaminase Antibody&#xD;
             (tTG)/Immunoglobulin A (IgA) if not done in prior 2 years)&#xD;
&#xD;

             osteogenesis imperfect) or skeletal dysplasia that would affect skeletal assessment&#xD;
             (such as hypochondroplasia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the&#xD;
             safety or rights of the subject participating in the study or would make it unlikely&#xD;

&#xD;
        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Healthy Controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any diabetes autoantibody&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any type of diabetes or hyperglycemia (HbA1câ‰¥5.7%)&#xD;
