    <textblock>
      In this study, it is aimed to determine the effect of Neuman Systems Model based nursing&#xD;
      approach on stress an coping with stress for women received intrauterine insemination (IUI)&#xD;
      treatment. The study has been planned as a single blind experimental study in&#xD;
      pretest-posttest design with randomized control. Sample group is going to be chosen from&#xD;
      women who have taken IUI treatment in Ankara University Fertility Diagnosis, Treatment,&#xD;
      Research and Application Center. Sample size of the study has been determined as 72 such that&#xD;
      intervention=36 and control=36. While gathering data, personal information form, The COMPI&#xD;
      Fertility Problem Stress Scales and The COMPI Coping Strategy Scales are going to be used. In&#xD;
      the scope of the study, four interviews with women in intervention group are going to be done&#xD;

    <measure>The COMPI Fertility Problem Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after intrauterine insemination procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is used for the assessment of the levels of stress experienced by infertile couples. As a Likert-type scale, it has three sub-scales in relation to personal, marital and social domains and contains a total of 14 items. 'Stress in personal domain' sub-scale contains six items, and the minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from it are successively 0 and 20 points. 'Stress in marital domain' sub-scale has four items, and the minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from it are successively 0 and 14 points. 'Stress in social domain' sub-scale is comprised of four items, and the minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from it are successively 0 and 12 points. A high score to be obtained from the sub-scale refers to the increase in the stress level.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The COMPI Coping Strategy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after intrauterine insemination procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The scale contains 19 items and has four sub-scales. The minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from the sub-scale of 'active-avoidance' coping method which is comprised of four items are successively 4 and 16 points. The sub-scale of 'active-confronting' coping method contains seven items. The minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from this sub-scale are successively 7 and 26 points. The minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from the sub-scale of 'passive-avoidance' coping method which is comprised of three items are successively 3 and 12 points. The sub-scale of 'meaning-based' coping method contains five items. The minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from this sub-scale are successively 5 and 20 points. A higher score to be obtained from the subscale means that the method is used more when coping with with stress.</description>
