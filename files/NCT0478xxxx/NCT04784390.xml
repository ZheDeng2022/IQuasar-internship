  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this PoC study is to evaluate the potential therapeutic efficacy of binocular&#xD;
      video games played on a tablet and to compare the efficacy of binocular video games versus&#xD;
      patching in amblyopic patients 4 to 7 years old (Part A) as well as to gain experience with&#xD;
      binocular video games in older children population of 8 to12 years old (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A and Part B are designed to provide long term data on durability of binocular video&#xD;
      games treatment.&#xD;

      The study consists of two parts, Part A: randomized, single masked PoC study in children 4 to&#xD;
      7 years old at Screening, and Part B: open-label substudy in children 8 to 12 year old at&#xD;
      Screening.&#xD;
