      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess the complete remission (CR) rate of magrolimab in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory cHL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of magrolimab in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
           adult subjects with relapsed or refractory cHL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the overall response rate (ORR)&#xD;

    <measure>Complete Response (CR)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant's response to treatment will be assessed per the Lugano criteria. The criteria are:&#xD;
Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all lesions, evidence, and effects of disease&#xD;
Partial Response (PR): ≥50% decrease in SPD of the 6 largest lesions with no increase in the size of the other nodes; splenic / hepatic nodules regress ≥50%, and with no new sites of disease&#xD;
Stable disease (SD): less than PR.&#xD;
Progressive disease (PD): sum of the product of dimensions (SPD) of lesions increased ≥50% from smallest value The outcome will be reported as the number of participants with a CR after 4 and 8 cycles of treatment (4 and 8 months), and if CR is achieved anytime within 2 years (&quot;overall&quot;).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Magrolimab related Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Magrolimab safety and tolerability will be assessed on the basis of magrolimab related adverse events occurring within 4 cycles of treatment (4 months). The outcome will be reported as the number of magrolimab related adverse events judged mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3), life threatening (Grade 4), or fatal (Grade 5), numbers without dispersion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response (OR)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response (OR) is defined as the sum of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) plus the number of participants who achieve a partial response (PR). Treatment response will be assessed per the Lugano criteria (aka the Cheson criteria). The criteria are:&#xD;
CR: Complete disappearance of all lesions, evidence, and effects of disease&#xD;
PR: ≥50% decrease in SPD of the 6 largest lesions with no increase in the size of the other nodes; splenic / hepatic nodules regress ≥50%, and with no new sites of disease&#xD;
Stable disease (SD): less than PR.&#xD;
Progressive disease (PD): sum of the product of dimensions (SPD) of lesions increased ≥50% from smallest value The outcome will be reported as the number of participants with either a CR or a PR after 4 and 8 cycles of treatment (4 and 8 months). For participants who undergo a subsequent stem cell transplant, the value will be recorded as the time to transplant (censored).</description>

    <description>All subjects will have a baseline PET CT and excisional or core needle biopsy within 1 month of study enrollment and baseline electrocardiogram and laboratory studies within 1 week of study enrollment. All subjects will receive treatment with magrolimab and pembrolizumab according to the dosing schedule. Magrolimab IV given on cycle 1, 2 and 3. Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV given on Cycle 1, 2 and 3. Patients may continue to receive treatment on the study for a maximum of 24 months or until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or bridge to stem cell transplantation (SCT).</description>
