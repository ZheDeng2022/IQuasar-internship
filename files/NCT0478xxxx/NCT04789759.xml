  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a dental extraction is performed, sequential cascade of events happens that lead to a&#xD;
      modeling and remodeling of the area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phenomenon leads to bone resorption and consequential volume loss atrophy. In literature&#xD;
      several biomaterials (Autogenous, alloplastic, allografts and xenografts) were tested as&#xD;
      alveolar fillers with the aim of controlling this physiologic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socket preservation is today a very widely spread dental technic to preserve the alveolar&#xD;
      dimensions, that uses a wide range of biomaterials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alloplastic materials have a fair evidence to work in several regenerative procedures in the&#xD;
      oral and maxillofacial region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot trial aims to characterize Histologic bone healing pattern in a human socket&#xD;
      preservation model of 2/3 biphasic calcium sulfate cement matrix's and Hydroxyapatite (HA&#xD;
      granules).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alterations in Volumetric alveolar socket changes in a socket preservation clinical model&#xD;
      will also be studied.&#xD;

      Aim : To evaluate histologic performance and volumetric outcome of a bone substitute used in&#xD;
      dentistry for guided bone regeneration procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model : Human Socket preservation surgery with a control group of spontaneous alveolar&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria includes a class 2 or 3 (loss of at least 1/3 of the buccal bone of the&#xD;
      alveolar socket) post-extraction sockets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Experimental Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atraumatic extraction of the hopeless tooth without flap retraction, after socket mechanical&#xD;
      debridement , fill with 2/3 biphasic calcium sulfate cement matrix's with Hydroxyapatite (HA&#xD;
      granules) and covered with a resorbable membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Month after a CBCT is performed for implant planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At implant placement a 2 mm trephine will be used for core extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements (Stl File) on the day of surgery (Baseline T0) and at implant placement (3 month&#xD;
      after tooth extraction) (T1) and after delivery final crown (T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discrepancy (Trueness) Between STL Files in Teeth Adjacent to Implant will be used at T0, T1&#xD;
      and T2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologic measure comprise percentage of vital bone formation, fibrous/connective tissue,&#xD;
      and material remnant, in a socket preservation model&#xD;
&#xD;
      To Measure Volumetric changes reverse engineering software (Geomagic Control X, 3D Systems)&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other evaluation parameters involve radiographic Cone Beam Computer Tomography evaluation,&#xD;
      primary stability, implant survival and implant success rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Control Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atraumatic extraction of the hopeless tooth without flap retraction, after socket mechanical&#xD;
      debridement Measurements (Stl File) on the day of surgery (Baseline T0) and at 3 month after&#xD;
      tooth extraction) (T1) Discrepancy (Trueness) Between Standard Tessellation Language Files in&#xD;
      Teeth Adjacent to Implant will be used at T0 and T1&#xD;
