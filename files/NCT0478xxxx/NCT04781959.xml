  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REaCT-5G will compare bone pain from a single dose of Pegfilgrastim to 5 doses of daily&#xD;
      filgrastim in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) significantly reduces febrile&#xD;
      neutropenia (FN) risk and has helped maintain dose intensity and dose density when treating&#xD;
      breast cancer with chemotherapy. This is crucial as survival outcomes are significantly&#xD;
      impaired if dose intensity are reduced. National and international guidelines recommend the&#xD;
      use of G-CSF as primary prophylaxis with most commonly used breast cancer chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens. Filgrastim (FIL) as a G-CSF that has been in use since the early 90s. Pegfilgrastim&#xD;
      (PEG) is a long-acting, pegylated version of FIL that requires only one injection per&#xD;
      chemotherapy cycle instead of daily FIL injections for 5 to 10 days per cycle. PEG and FIL&#xD;
      both come at the potential cost of bone pain, the most common side effect. G-CSF related bone&#xD;
      pain is often severe, leading to refusal or cancellation of G-CSF and early discontinuation&#xD;
      of chemotherapy. We propose to perform a pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial to compare bone pain experienced by patients receiving either PEG or 5-day-FIL&#xD;
      with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
