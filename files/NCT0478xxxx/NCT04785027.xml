  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of PSORI-CM01&#xD;
      formula vs Gu Ben Hua Yu formula combined with Expanded Allogeneic AD-MSCs in patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe psoriasis. And it explores the expectations of patients for the treatment&#xD;
      of traditional Chinese medicine combined with stem cells and their expectations to&#xD;
      participate in this study. The trial would provide preliminary data for large sample clinical&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is an immune-mediated, genetic disease manifesting in the skin or joints or both.&#xD;
      Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities,&#xD;
      patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and&#xD;
      biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or&#xD;
      limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to&#xD;
      find new treatment for psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As current experience and cases of AD-MSCs in the treatment of psoriasis are still relatively&#xD;
      small, and it is unknown about their safety and efficacy combined with traditional medicine&#xD;
      in the treatment of psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study designed a randomized controlled trial to compare PSORI-CM01 formula vs Guben&#xD;
      Huayu formula combined with expanded allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the&#xD;
      treatment of psoriasis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of PSORI-CM01 formula vs Gu Ben Hua Yu formula combined with Expanded Allogeneic&#xD;
      AD-MSCs in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. And it also aims to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility and the potential of the protocol for the full-scale randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, 16 subjects will be enrolled in this study and their expectations for the&#xD;
      treatment of traditional Chinese medicine combined with stem cells and their experience to&#xD;
      participate in this study will be interviewed.&#xD;
