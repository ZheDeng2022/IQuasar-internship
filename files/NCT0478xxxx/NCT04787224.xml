      Vestibular socket therapy with immediate implant placement is compared in infected and&#xD;
      non-infected sockets regarding implant survival, bone thickness and soft tissue height .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For non infected sockets, a 15c blade (Stoma, Storz am Mark GmbH, Emmingen-Liptingen Germany)&#xD;
      was used to cut a 1-cm long vestibular access incision , 3-4 mm apical to the mucogingival&#xD;
      junction of the involved tooth. The socket orifice and the vestibular access incision were&#xD;
      connected by a subperiosteal tunnel that was created using a periotome and a micro-periosteal&#xD;
      elevator (Stoma, Storz am Mark GmbH, Emmingen-Liptingen Germany). Implants, (Biohorizons,&#xD;
      Birmingham, Al, USA) , were installed using a 3D printed surgical guide (Surgical Guide&#xD;
      Resin, Form 2, Formlabs). A flexible cortical membrane shield (OsteoBiol® Lamina, Tecnoss®,&#xD;
      Torino, Italy) of heterologous origin, 0.6 mm in thickness was prepared by hydrating and&#xD;
      trimming it. It was then tucked through the vestibular access incision, till it extended 1 mm&#xD;
      below the socket orifice, and stabilized using a membrane tack (AutoTac System Kit,&#xD;
      Biohorizons Implant Systems, Birmingham, Alabama Inc, USA) to the apical bone. The gap&#xD;
      between the implant and the shield/the labial plate was then filled with particulate bone&#xD;
      graft [75% autogenous bone chips harvested form local surgical sites and 25% inorganic bovine&#xD;
      bone mineral matrix (MinerOss X , Biohorizons, Birmingham, Al, USA)]. For the infected&#xD;
      sockets, the 6-day protocol was implemented. Atraumatic extraction of the infected tooth by&#xD;
      the periotome was followed by curettage, mechanical debridement and chemical irrigation using&#xD;
      metronidazole irrigation solution (500mg/100ml, Amrizole, Amria Pharma, Alexandria, Egypt).&#xD;
      The root of the involved tooth was cleaned with an ultrasonic cleaner, cut to its apical&#xD;
      third, reimplanted into the socket and maintained there for 6 days by bonding its crown to&#xD;
      the adjacent teeth using composite resin. Implant and crown placement were done as described&#xD;
      above for the non-infected socket group.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>implant survival</measure>
    <time_frame>implant insertion- 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Implant survival was reported as defined by Buser et al by the absence of peri-implant infection, persistent subjective complaints such as pain, foreign body sensation, and/or dysesthesia, radiolucency around the implant, and/or any detectable implant mobility.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>mucosal recession</measure>
    <time_frame>crown insertion- 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Amount of mucosal recession was identified midfacially and at the apex of the mesial and distal papillae by superimposing the STL files of the models, obtained via intra-oral scanning, at the baseline (of the unrestorable tooth) with those after 12 months of implant insertion. The 3D software roughly aligned of both pre-and postoperative models through 3 identical points, identified on their surfaces. The best-fit algorithm of the software then perfected the superimposition process. The superimposed models were then imported into an STL viewer, where the measurements were performed. This method was proven to be accurate in volumetric measurements of hard and soft tissues.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>labial plate thickness changes</measure>
    <time_frame>implant insertion- 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>. Changes in the thickness of the labial plate of bone was measured by superimposing CBCT images obtained at the baseline (time of tooth extraction) and those after 12 months.</description>
