  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a open label study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      intravenous T3011 given alone and in combination with intravenous pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, first-in-human study of T3011 given via intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      infusion as a single agent and in combination with IV pembrolizumab in participants with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The Phase 1 Part A portion of the study is a single&#xD;
      agent dose escalation which will use a 3+3 design to evaluate escalating doses of T3011.&#xD;
      Total enrollment will depend on the toxicities and/or activity observed, with approximately&#xD;
      24 evaluable participants enrolled. Once the IV T3011 RP is established, the Phase 1 Part B&#xD;
      part of the study will begin. Phase 1 Part B is IV T3011 in combination with IV pembrolizumab&#xD;
      dose escalation which will use a 3+3 design to evaluate escalating doses of IV T3011 in&#xD;
      combination with IV pembrolizumab. Total enrollment will depend on the toxicities and/or&#xD;
      activity observed, with approximately 18 evaluable participants enrolled. Upon completion of&#xD;
      Phase 1 Part B, Phase 2a will begin. The safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of IV&#xD;
      T3011 given in combination with IV pembrolizumab will be evaluated in 15 participants with&#xD;
      histologically or pathologically confirmed metastatic NSCLC (Arm A) and 15 participants with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors with metastasis in either the liver and/or lung (Arm B).&#xD;
