  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a unique clinical and biological database that collects standardized clinical&#xD;
      information during the management of all patients with bone marrow failure syndromes (BMF) in&#xD;
      France (multicenter registry), from diagnosis and throughout follow-up during the natural&#xD;
      history of the disease, treated or not. In parallel, biological samples (blood and/or bone&#xD;
      marrow and/or skin) are collected during clinical care and are biobanked in Saint-Louis&#xD;
      Hospital (Hematology laboratory) in order to be used in translational research related to&#xD;
      bone marrow failure diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry has two main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Public health care evaluation and improvement: to assess the medical and social needs&#xD;
           inherent to the management of these rare diseases; to precisely assess the level of&#xD;
           diagnosis and management of bone marrow failure syndromes in France; to evaluate the&#xD;
           impact and guidance of the French reference center guidelines for diagnosis and&#xD;
           treatment; to evaluate the real-life efficacy and tolerance of any given specific&#xD;
           treatments; to analyze treatment's cost-effectiveness according to each situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Epidemiology: to determine the incidence, prevalence, and distribution of different&#xD;
                bone marrow failure syndromes at the national level;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Biology: to better understand the pathophysiology of BMF; to identify and to study&#xD;
                complications within each entity, such as mechanisms underlying clonal evolution,&#xD;
                new forms of inherited BMF and acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/MDS-predisposition&#xD;
                syndromes, and to better and deeper characterize known entities;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment: to identify prognostic factors and predictors of response; to identify&#xD;
                side effects and impact of treatment on others organs and natural functions; to&#xD;
                assess patients' quality of life as early as possible since diagnosis and&#xD;
                throughout follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life evaluated using questionnaire &quot;European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire&quot; (EORTC QLQ-C30- v3). The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. A high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning. A high score for the global health status/ QoL represents a high QoL and a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems.&#xD;
