  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate whether an early intraoperative transverse abdominis&#xD;
      plane block (TAP block) will provide superior analgesia to a late intraoperative TAP block. A&#xD;
      fixed amount of bupivacaine will be used for the TAP block and the primary outcomes will be&#xD;
      measured by patient reported numerical assessment scores for pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single blinded, prospective study designed to determine optimal timing of&#xD;
      transverse abdominis plane block (TAP block) in laparoscopic gastric sleeve patients.&#xD;
      Research has shown that administration of TAP block during these cases does show improved&#xD;
      post-operative pain control. There are no trials specifically evaluating the timing of&#xD;
      administration in regards to superiority of pain control. To the investigators knowledge, no&#xD;
      prospective study has ever been done investigating whether TAP block performed at the&#xD;
      beginning of the case versus at the end of the case makes a difference in the amount of&#xD;
      relief experienced by the patient. the investigators hypothesize that early intra-operative&#xD;
      block will be superior to late intra-operative block in both post-operative pain as well as&#xD;
      decreased length of stay in hospital secondary to reduction in peripheral and central nervous&#xD;
      system hyper excitability. Before beginning the research study, ~200 plain envelopes will be&#xD;
      made each containing one option written on paper indicating early intra-operative or late&#xD;
      intra-operative TAP block. There will be equal numbers of both options. It will be the&#xD;
      responsibility of either the PI or sub-investigators to select a random envelope and bring it&#xD;
      to the operating room at the time of surgery. All patients involved in the study will have&#xD;
      given informed consent in the office prior to surgery. On the day of surgery after the&#xD;
      patient is induced and intubated, the PI or sub-investigator will open the envelope revealing&#xD;
      the timing of the TAP block. Depending on what is revealed from the envelope, the patient&#xD;
      will either receive the early intra-operative TAP block or the late intra-operative TAP&#xD;
      block. The TAP block will be performed using 60 ml for right sided TAP block (side of&#xD;
      specimen extraction) and 30 ml for left sided TAP block (non extraction side). 30 ml of&#xD;
      bupivicaine solution will also be used for intraperitoneal irrigation as is already routinely&#xD;
      done during these cases by the primary surgeon for additional analgesia. This will be&#xD;
      performed at the conclusion of all cases regardless of which arm the patient is in. For the&#xD;
      early intra-operative TAP block, optiview trocar entrance will be performed in the upper&#xD;
      abdomen followed by CO2 insufflation. After introduction of the camera into this trocar, the&#xD;
      right lateral abdominal wall will be visualized with the laparoscope. An 18-gauge needle will&#xD;
      be introduced externally at the center of the mid axillary line between the lower costal&#xD;
      margin and the iliac crest until the surgeon feels a &quot;pop,&quot; after which the surgeon will&#xD;
      inject the first 2 mL of 0.25% bupivicaine to verify the correct position. Doyle's internal&#xD;
      bulge sign (the bulge seen when the transversus abdominis muscle and peritoneum is pushed&#xD;
      internally) will be visualized and the remainder of the 60 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine will be&#xD;
      injected. The contralateral block will be performed according to the same technique but with&#xD;
      only 30 ml of bupivicaine. The late post-operative block will be performed in the same&#xD;
      fashion but after completion of the surgery just prior to removing the trocars and&#xD;
      desufflation. The intraperitoneal irrigation with 0.25% bupivicaine solution will be&#xD;
      performed at the end of the case using 30 ml total sprayed above the stomach, under the&#xD;
      diaphragm, and over the bed of the spleen. All other medications intra-op and post-op&#xD;
      including anesthesia will remain standardized according to the current HF Macomb bariatrics&#xD;
      protocols. The data collection will take place immediately post-op, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24&#xD;
      hours post-op using the numerical assessment score (NAS) for pain which will be performed at&#xD;
      the time vitals are taken by the nursing aids. The investigators will also be analyzing&#xD;
      post-operative vomiting and length of stay in hours.&#xD;
