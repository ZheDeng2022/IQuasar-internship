  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean scar defect is one of the complications after cesarean section (CSD). CSD may be&#xD;
      further caused many long term complications, such as abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility,&#xD;
      uterine scar pregnancy and uterine rupture. Vaginal repair due to CSDs is a minimally&#xD;
      invasive and effective method that maintains fertility. The main concern linked to surgery is&#xD;
      the quality of healing of the myometrial incision. However, no diagnostic method has yet been&#xD;
      widely accepted to assess the healing process. Thus, the authors investigated uterine healing&#xD;
      after vaginal repair with two-dimensional (2D) power Doppler ultrasound (PDU) in this study.&#xD;

      The inclusion criteria were CSD patients who had one or more cesarean deliveries, patients&#xD;
      who had intermenstrual spotting after the cesarean section or those in which the thickness of&#xD;
      the residual myometrium (TRM) was less than 3.0 mm at the preoperative stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who had a history of endocrine disorders, coagulation disorders, use of intrauterine&#xD;
      devices, sub-mucous myoma, endometrial diseases, endometrial cysts, uterine fibroids, and&#xD;
      adenomyosis after cesarean section were excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After vaginal repair, all patients were followed by traditional 2D US scanning and Doppler&#xD;
      velocimetry on Days: 0, 2, 30, 60 and 90. Authors evaluated: scar diameter and Doppler&#xD;
      velocimetry and resistance index (RI) of the uterine arteries, at their ascending branch.&#xD;
