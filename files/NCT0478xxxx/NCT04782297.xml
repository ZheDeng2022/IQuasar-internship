      The primary objective of this observational PMCF study is to collect clinical data on the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Medcomp Long Term Hemodialysis (LTHD) Catheter Kits in compliance with&#xD;
      MDR 2017/745.&#xD;

      Open Label, Consecutive Series, Observational cohort study of patients using Medcomp LTHD&#xD;
      catheters. Prospective and retrospective patients will be enrolled. The study will include&#xD;
      patients in the EU who are receiving or have received one of the three subject Medcomp LTHD&#xD;
      Catheters as their initial HD catheter. The data available and summarized for these products&#xD;
      are considered sufficient to determine if undesirable side effects exist for the subject&#xD;
      device and conclude that the device conforms to the requirement on acceptability of side&#xD;
      effects (2017/745 MDR GSPR Annex 1). Additionally, the benefits of the subject devices&#xD;
      outweigh the risks, and it can be concluded that the devices conform to the requirement on&#xD;
      acceptable benefit/ risk profile (2017/745 MDR GSPR Annex 1).&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Titan HD Catheter</arm_group_label>
    <description>The Titan HD Catheter is a double lumen catheter that provides 2 dedicated (arterial/venous) access lumens. Each lumen is connected through an extension line with female luer connectors. The arterial and venous catheter lumens connect to a hub to facilitate connection of extension tubes with clamps intended to prevent air/fluid communication and control fluid flow through the catheter. At the proximal end of the extension tubes are female Luer fittings to provide a needleless connection. The clamps and the sleeves are color-coded red for the arterial lumen and blue for the venous lumen. Each catheter has a cuff which is intended to be positioned underneath the skin at the skin exit to aid in securing the catheter and to provide a barrier to minimize the risk of infection. Each lumen is connected through an extension line with female Luer connectors. The transition between lumen and extension is housed within a molded hub.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Hemo-Flow Catheter</arm_group_label>
    <description>The Hemo-Flow® Catheter has two lumens (one arterial lumen, one venous lumen) comprised of a biocompatible polymeric material that contains radiopaque filler to allow radiographic imaging of the distal tips to ensure proper placement into the superior vena cava. The arterial lumen is utilized to withdraw blood from the patient and the venous lumen returns the blood to the patient after treatment</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Hemo-Cath LT Catheter</arm_group_label>
    <description>The Hemo-Cath® LT Catheter is designed for continuous extraction of a patient's blood and reinfusion of filtered blood. It has two lumens: the arterial lumen is utilized to withdraw blood from the patient and the venous lumen returns the blood to the patient after treatment. In order to increase filtering efficiency, the tip of the extraction (&quot;inflow&quot;) lumen is separated from the reinfusion (&quot;outflow&quot;) lumen, minimizing the reentry of dialyzed blood from the venous return into the arterial inflow (&quot;recirculation&quot;). This separation is achieved with a step-tip design.</description>
