  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominopelvic bleeding can occur due to numerous causes including for the vast majority,&#xD;
      trauma, surgery complications and tumors. Interventional radiologists often exclude arterial&#xD;
      acute hemorrhage using cyanoacrylate or a liquid embolic agent, but few prospective results&#xD;
      have been published to assess their efficacy and safety. The historic and most studied liquid&#xD;
      embolic agent to date is Onyx. Results in the treatment of acute peripheral non-neurologic&#xD;
      hemorrhage have been detailed in a meta-analysis published in 2015. This systematic review&#xD;
      found 19 articles presenting 131 patient cases and 150 lesions treated with Onyx from 2005 to&#xD;
      August 2014. There were 11 case series and 8 case reports but no prospective trial. The most&#xD;
      common presenting symptoms were of gastrointestinal (GI) origin (n = 51). Rebleeding of the&#xD;
      baseline lesion occurred in 7/131 patients. No deaths resulting from complications of the&#xD;
      embolic procedure were reported. One patient died of persistent hemoptysis after treatment&#xD;
      with Onyx. No deaths were directly attributable to the use of Onyx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a peripheral embolization procedure with available embolic agents other than&#xD;
      SQUIDPERI, residual feedings or collateral vessels became gradually less visible to the&#xD;
      operator due to the high radiopacity of the liquid. It was therefore essential to develop an&#xD;
      embolization system with lower radiopacity, or with radiopacity that decreases over time.&#xD;
      Additionally, depending on the angioarchitecture and flow characteristics, it is important to&#xD;
      have an embolic agent with various viscosities. SQUIDPERI is a liquid embolic agent with&#xD;
      various viscosities and radiopacities. It is indicated for the embolization of lesions in the&#xD;
      peripheral vasculature but its use is poorly reported as of today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective non interventional multicenter study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of SQUIDPERI for the treatment of abdominopelvic arterial acute bleeding&#xD;
      or imminent risk of bleeding.&#xD;
