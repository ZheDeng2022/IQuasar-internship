    <description>The Cutaneous Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) is a clinician rated scale composed of 56 items designed to assess the disease activity and damage in CLE in adults. The disease activity (CLASI-A) sub-score ranges from 0 to 70: 0-9 indicating mild disease, 10-20 indicating moderate disease, and 21-70 indicating severe disease.</description>
