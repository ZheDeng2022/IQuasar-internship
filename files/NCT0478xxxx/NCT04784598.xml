      Introduction: Persistent hindfoot pains are very common and prevalent complaints in the&#xD;
      Brazilian population. One of the treatments recommended for these conditions in the&#xD;
      literature is the use of insoles. However, to use this resource it is necessary that the&#xD;
      individual wear closed shoes and this is an obstacle to treatment in cities with hot climate.&#xD;
      Thinking about an alternative treatment, the customized slippers with the corrective elements&#xD;
      of the insoles can be an alternative to increase adherence to this type of treatment.&#xD;
      Objective: To compare different types of hindfoot elements in insoles adapted in slippers in&#xD;
      individuals with persistent hindfoot pain.&#xD;

      Methodology: This is a clinical, controlled and randomized, double-blind study, in which 81&#xD;
      patients with a diagnosis of persistent hindfoot pain will be evaluated and randomized into 3&#xD;
      groups. Group 1 will receive a customized slipper with 3mm horseshoe foot pieces and 2.5mm&#xD;
      EVA cover (shore A 28). Group 2 will receive a customized slipper with 3mm medial / lateral&#xD;
      wedge foot pieces and 2.5mm EVA cover (shore A 28). Group 3, considered to be control, will&#xD;
      receive a plain slipper with no elements, only with an EVA cover of 2.5 mm (shore A 28) with&#xD;
      the same characteristics as the intervention groups. The evaluator and the patient will be&#xD;
      considered blind. The evaluations will be carried out at the beginning (T0), after 12 weeks&#xD;
      of wearing the slippers (T12) and a reassessment at week 16 (T16) to monitor the pain. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be pain (numerical pain scale); secondarily the foot posture (Foot&#xD;
      Posture Index), functionality by the FFI - Foot Function Index questionnaire to assess&#xD;
      functionality, and finally the 6-minute walk test for walking performance. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis: The data will be analyzed by t-student tests, Mann-Whitney test, repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVA and analysis by intention to treat.&#xD;

    <description>Brazilian version of the Foot Function Index questionnaire.15 This questionnaire aims to evaluate the functionality of the foot and is divided into three subscales, which are pain, difficulty and functional limitation. The outcome of all domains was summed and divided by three to achieve the final result of the questionnairewhich can vary from 0% to 100%, and are proportional to functional impairment of the limb.The higher the percentage, the greater the functional alteration presented by the patient</description>
