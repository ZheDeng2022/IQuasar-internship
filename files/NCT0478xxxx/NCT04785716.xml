      Retrospective observational study of patients treated with niraparib in an individual patient&#xD;
      access program in Norway.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have emerged as new treatment options in&#xD;
      ovarian cancer. While there is now also evidence for the efficacy in the first line setting,&#xD;
      they were initially studied in recurrent disease both as maintenance after chemotherapy but&#xD;
      also as treatment on its own. The NOVA study was conducted in the maintenance setting of&#xD;
      patients with recurrent high-grade serous ovarian-, tube or peritoneal cancer who had&#xD;
      responded to platinum-based chemotherapy. In 2017 Tesaro opened an individual patient access&#xD;
      program in Norway, and in July 2017 the first Norwegian patient was enrolled. We performed a&#xD;
      retrospective observational study of patients treated with niraparib in the individual&#xD;
      patient access program in Norway. The objective of the study is to provide preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy and safety data in a rather unselected population of non-gBRCA patients with&#xD;
      recurrent ovarian-, tube-, or peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
