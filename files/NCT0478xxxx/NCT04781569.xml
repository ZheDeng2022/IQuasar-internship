    <textblock>
      This study is to obtain a comprehensive view of S. aureus adaptations in the infected human&#xD;
      host and (i) to improve the understanding of the interface between antibiotic therapy,&#xD;
      resistance development and virulence factor adaptation in S. aureus infected patients, and&#xD;
      (ii) to adapt these findings into a more sustainable use of antimicrobials for therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus (S.) aureus is notorious for its ability to develop resistance. This study is&#xD;
      to obtain a comprehensive view of S. aureus adaptations in the infected human host and (i) to&#xD;
      improve the understanding of the interface between antibiotic therapy, resistance development&#xD;
      and virulence factor adaptation in S. aureus infected patients, and (ii) to adapt these&#xD;
      findings into a more sustainable use of antimicrobials for therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with S. aureus infections who will routinely undergo diagnostic and surgical&#xD;
      procedures will be identified. Intraoperative samples from the site of infection during&#xD;
      surgery will be taken. Additionally, two blood drawing events (22.5ml in total) will be&#xD;
      performed and nose swabs will be taken. The biological material will be analysed. This&#xD;
      project will be the first to study different phenotypes of invasive S. aureus directly from&#xD;
      its environment in vivo.&#xD;

        Hospitalized patients with probable or proven S. aureus infection will be screened at the&#xD;
        University Hospital of Basel. Patients with confirmed S. aureus infection who correspond to&#xD;
        the eligibility criteria will be asked to participate in the research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy volunteers who correspond to the eligibility criteria will be asked to participate&#xD;
        in the research project and recruited by oral communication from the institutions&#xD;
        Biozentrum, University Hospital Basel, and University of Basel.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria for patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In collaboration with the orthopedic surgeons, patients with probable or proven S.&#xD;
             aureus infections will be identified who will routinely undergo diagnostic and&#xD;
             surgical procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for healthy participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy control group should be generally well-being&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for patients and for healthy participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy: Pregnant or lactating women will be excluded (urinary pregnancy test will&#xD;
             be performed in women of childbearing age)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  General health condition: Current or recurrent disease that could cause complications&#xD;
             that may affect the study or may set the patient at risk&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diseases/ Illness: Psychiatric or other mental disorders which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator may probably affect the full understanding of the study (including signs&#xD;
             of dementia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Language: Insufficient knowledge of german language to understand the procedure and&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Vulnerability: Individuals whose willingness to volunteer in the research project may&#xD;
             be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits&#xD;
             associated with participation, such as members of a group with a direct hierarchical&#xD;
             structure (refer to ICH Guidelines E6 (R1) for GCP, 1.61)&#xD;
