  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cluster randomized controlled study of 40 primary care clinics in Northern Israel (20&#xD;
      intervention clinics, 20 usual care clinics) to evaluate the value of introducing a precision&#xD;
      medicine/genomic approach/paradigm on the clinical and economical outcomes of the clinics.&#xD;
      Intervention includes 3 elements: 1. DNA extraction and evaluation (up to the level of WGS);&#xD;
      2. Feces sample for microbiome study, 3. Wearable devices for continuous monitoring of body&#xD;
      functions. Expected number of participants is 100,000 in each arm. Results will be calculated&#xD;
      for a clinic as a unit and not for individuals (each clinic to be compared to &quot;twin&quot; selected&#xD;
      clinic).&#xD;

      Study major aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess whether employing a paradigm of genomic/precision medicine in primary care clinics can&#xD;
      lead to an improvement in the medical or economic outcomes of the clinic as a unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific and secondary aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study differences in morbidity, mortality, quality of life or the cost of medical&#xD;
           service indicators between clinics operating under a genome driven paradigm compared to&#xD;
           usual care clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine whether the public has an interest in extensive genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine whether the medical staff has an interest and ability to assimilate a genomic&#xD;
           approach in the routine clinic work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identify links between genetic markers (mutations, variants) and different diseases&#xD;
           (incidence or clinical behavior) or different drug responses (resistance, effectiveness,&#xD;
           side-effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Examine whether the implementation of prolonged personal monitoring devices will lead to&#xD;
           improved morbidity and mortality indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Examine whether measuring genomic variability in the microbiome has implications on&#xD;
           health status or means of coping with different diseases and different health&#xD;
           conditions.&#xD;
