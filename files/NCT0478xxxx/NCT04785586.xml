  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effectiveness and adherence of three web-based weight&#xD;
      management interventions, all based on the HealthyWeightCoaching (HWC) within a&#xD;
      HealthyWeightHub.fi (HWH) platform. HWC is a 12-month web-based intervention including&#xD;
      information and exercises to promote weight loss. Each patient is allocated a personal coach&#xD;
      to encourage progress on the platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current setting, the investigators study how minimal added support will affect the&#xD;
      effectiveness and adherence of the web-based program. The patients are randomized into three&#xD;
      groups all of which include the HWC platform. In addition, group 1 will be offered three&#xD;
      individual face-to-face sessions via video and group 2 three group face-to-face sessions via&#xD;
      video. Group 3 acts as the control group offering the basic HWC protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients (target n=120) are enrolled from the occupational health of the city of&#xD;
      Helsinki.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is one of the major public health problems globally, affecting an ever-increasing&#xD;
      proportion of working age adults. In addition of increasing the risk of many&#xD;
      obesity-associated diseases, obesity is associated to impaired ability to work, making it a&#xD;
      relevant occupational health concern. Treatment of obesity requires long-term interventions,&#xD;
      but nevertheless, it is challenging to provide long-term treatment when resources in&#xD;
      real-life health care systems are limited. To that need, new cost-effective and accessible&#xD;
      intervention methods are created. One of these is the a real-life web-based obesity&#xD;
      management program HealthyWeightCoaching (HWC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HWC has shown promising results in obesity management, but alike in other fully virtual&#xD;
      interventions, one of the challenges has been adherence. Creating hybrid-models by addition&#xD;
      of face-to-face contacts to the web-based structure, has been shown to improve adherence and&#xD;
      therefore the effectiveness of the intervention. However, data on hybrid interventions for&#xD;
      weight management is still scarce and calls for further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current setting, the investigators study how minimal added support will affect the&#xD;
      effectiveness and adherence of the web-based program. The patients are randomized into three&#xD;
      groups all of which include the HWC platform. In addition, group 1 will be offered three&#xD;
      individual face-to-face sessions via video and group 2 three group face-to-face sessions via&#xD;
      video. Group 3 acts as the control group offering the basic HWC protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on health and lifestyle are collected at 0, 6, 12 month time points. The 12-month&#xD;
      intervention is followed by a 5 year monitoring period. The data collection includes&#xD;
      questionnaires, measurements and laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients (target n=120) are enrolled from the occupational health of the city of&#xD;
      Helsinki. The participation is free for the patient.&#xD;
