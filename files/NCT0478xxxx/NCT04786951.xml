  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is considered as one of the most severe subtypes of eating disorders&#xD;
      (ED), with important medical complications, high mortality rates, and high comorbidity with&#xD;
      other disorders, such as anxiety disorders. Likewise, to what happens in anxiety disorders,&#xD;
      several studies have suggested the presence of dysfunctional body-related Attentional Bias&#xD;
      (AB) in patients with ED and, specifically, in AN patients. Patients with AN tend to focus&#xD;
      their attention on their body, in a dysfunctional way, by showing body checking behaviors,&#xD;
      and scrutinizing their general appearance and weight-related body parts. This body-related AB&#xD;
      has been associated with higher levels of body dissatisfaction, one of the most important&#xD;
      risk factors for the development and maintenance of ED. In addition, body-related AB may be&#xD;
      responsible for decreasing the effectiveness of body exposure-based treatments used in&#xD;
      patients with AN. For this reason, it is necessary to develop new treatment techniques by&#xD;
      adding specific components that aim to reduce body-related AB. It has been proposed to&#xD;
      include AB modification techniques within the body exposure therapy, as an effective&#xD;
      treatment to reduce body-related AB, body dissatisfaction, and body anxiety. To date, our&#xD;
      group has been the first, to use a combination of virtual reality (VR) and eye-tracking (ET)&#xD;
      techniques to assess the presence of a body-related AB in non-clinical samples. In order to&#xD;
      improve AN-based treatments, this project aims to develop a new AB modification procedure,&#xD;
      using ET and VR technologies. In addition, this project aims to integrate this AB&#xD;
      modification procedure as a part of a body exposure-based treatment that aims to reduce the&#xD;
      fear of weight gain experienced by patients with AN. Finally, this project aims to assess&#xD;
      whether adding two separate components of body exposure-based therapy and AB modification&#xD;
      training would result in a more effective intervention. It is expected that adding a specific&#xD;
      component of VR body exposure procedure in the usual treatment for AN, enhanced through the&#xD;
      illusion of ownership toward the virtual body, will result in more effective treatment. In&#xD;
      addition, it is expected that adding an AB modification training in the body-exposure-based&#xD;
      procedure, will result in a further increase the effectiveness of the treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a phenomenon known as attentional bias (AB), described as the propensity to pay more&#xD;
      attention to certain types of stimuli or information (e.g., disorder-relevant information)&#xD;
      over other sorts of information (Williamson et al., 2004), adult and young patients with&#xD;
      Anorexia Nervosa (AN) show a tendency to focus more on self-reported unattractive body parts&#xD;
      than other body parts (Jansen, Nederkoorn, &amp; Mulkens, 2005; Tuschen-Caffier et al., 2015;&#xD;
      Bauer et al., 2017). Dysfunctional body-related AB presumably maintains body image&#xD;
      disturbances, usually reported by patients with AN, by processing only body information that&#xD;
      is consistent with dysfunctional cognitive schema content (such as, I am getting a fatter&#xD;
      belly), while schema-inconsistent information (e.g., I am getting thinner) is not equally&#xD;
      noticed or processed, usually being visually neglected (Rodgers &amp; DuBois, 2016; Williamson et&#xD;
      al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysfunctional body-related AB may be responsible for decreasing the effectiveness of body&#xD;
      exposure-based treatments used in patients with AN. For this reason, it is necessary to&#xD;
      develop new treatment techniques by adding specific components that aim to reduce the&#xD;
      body-related AB. In a previous project conducted by our group, preliminary evidence was found&#xD;
      in favor of a body-related AB modification among patients with AN, after a Virtual Reality&#xD;
      (VR)-based mirror-exposure intervention. A key aspect to understand these results might rely&#xD;
      on the procedure conducted, in which, patients had to focus on different parts of the virtual&#xD;
      body (from the head to the shoes) and were asked to orally express what they though and felt&#xD;
      about those body areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project aims to go further, and includes AB modification techniques within the&#xD;
      body exposure therapy, as an effective treatment to reduce body-related AB, body&#xD;
      dissatisfaction and body anxiety among patients with AN. To the date, our group has been the&#xD;
      first, to use a combination of virtual reality (VR) and eye-tracking (ET) techniques to&#xD;
      assess the presence of a body-related AB in clinical and non-clinical samples. Specifically,&#xD;
      this project aims to assess whether adding two separate components of body exposure-based&#xD;
      therapy and AB modification training would result in a more effective intervention. It is&#xD;
      expected that, adding an AB modification training in the body-exposure based procedure&#xD;
      (experimental group), will further increase the effectiveness of the treatment compared with&#xD;
      the treatment as usual (control group). Specifically, after comparing measures before and&#xD;
      after the treatment, it is expected that patients at the experimental group would show a&#xD;
      significant increase in BMI values, and a significant reduction of other AN symptomatology&#xD;
      (e.g., fear of gaining weight, body image disturbances) and body-related AB, compared to the&#xD;
      group control. Likewise, it is expected that these changes will be maintained at the&#xD;
      follow-up after six-month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be conducted at the VR-PSY Lab, University of Barcelona, and the Eating&#xD;
      Disorders Units of the Hospital Sant Joan de DÃ©u of Barcelona and Hospital de Bellvitge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with AN will be exposed to immersive virtual using a VR head mounted display&#xD;
      (HTC-PRO Eye) with a precise ET included. In addition to the two controllers that HTC-PRO&#xD;
      usually provides, three additional body trackers will be used to achieve full body motion&#xD;
      tracking. The virtual environment will consist in a room with a large mirror on the front&#xD;
      wall. The mirror will be large enough to reflect every limb of the body and will be placed&#xD;
      1.5 m in front of the patients. A young female avatar wearing a basic white t-shirt with blue&#xD;
      jeans and black trainers will be created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the treatment, all sessions will last approximately one hour and will take place&#xD;
      once a week. All sessions will start by inducing the FBI and assessing the VASs. Exposure&#xD;
      treatment on the body will start with a virtual body with the same BMI as the patient. The AB&#xD;
      modification training will be based on an adaptation of the AB induction procedure proposed&#xD;
      by Smeets, Jansen and Roefs (2011). The training will be developed through the visual&#xD;
      selection of geometric figures (e.g. square, rectangle, circle) that fit approximately with&#xD;
      specific parts of the body. Each of these figures can have different colors. Specifically,&#xD;
      the patient must detect and identify the figures that will appear in different parts of the&#xD;
      avatar's body (figure 2). In half of the trials, the shape of the figure must be&#xD;
      discriminated and in the remaining 50%, the discrimination will be based on color. Throughout&#xD;
      training, the geometric figures will appear on weight-related body parts in 45% of the&#xD;
      trials, and in another 45% of the trials it will appear on non-weight-related body parts. In&#xD;
      the remaining trials (10%), the test will appear on one of three neutral stimuli located next&#xD;
      to the avatar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ET raw data will be transformed into suitable quantitative data using the Ogama (Open Gaze&#xD;
      Mouse Analyzer) software. Previously weight-and non-weight related areas of interest (AOIs)&#xD;
      will be defined. Weight-related AOIs will be defined based on the weight scale of body items&#xD;
      from the PASTAS questionnaire (Reed, Thompson, Brannick, &amp; Sacoo, 1991) and drawn onto a&#xD;
      picture of a female avatar in a frontal view. Body parts included in the W-AOIs will be the&#xD;
      legs, thighs, buttocks, hips, stomach (abdomen) and waist. After the separation of the&#xD;
      weight-related-AOIs, the remaining body parts (head, neck, chest, shoulders, arms, and feet)&#xD;
      will be labeled as non-weight-related AOIs. Participants' selective visual attention will be&#xD;
      measured using the complete fixation time and number of fixations on the areas of interest&#xD;
      (AOIs).&#xD;
