  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a condition of reduced the capacity in multiple body systems and causing adverse&#xD;
      outcomes because of decreasing the ability to cope with stressors. Female sex, the changes of&#xD;
      the body imposed by ageing, and coping strategies for stressors are causal mechanisms in the&#xD;
      development of frailty. This project is designed with the salutogenic model that is focused&#xD;
      on the concepts of health, stress, and coping. The aim of this project is to assess the&#xD;
      effect of Salutogenic Frailty Prevention Program on promoting sense of coherence and&#xD;
      preventing the development of frailty in women aged 55 years and over&#xD;

    <description>Experimental: SAFRAPP Intervention&#xD;
Participants in this group will receive a 6-week SAFRAPP intervention, comprising of laughter yoga, health education and case management. SAFRAPP will be conducted on social media (Facebook and WhatsApp).</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Control Grup</arm_group_label>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Salutogenic Frailty Prevention Program</intervention_name>
    <description>Laughter yoga: The first component of intervention is the laughter yoga that is a combination of warm up exercise, deep breathing exercises, childlike playfulness and laughter exercises. Each session of laughter yoga will be offered twice a weekly and 40 minutes each time.&#xD;
Health education: The second component of intervention consisted of six health issues which are &quot;health, frailty and generalized sources of resistance for frailty&quot;, the most common medical condition and medication use&quot;, &quot;physical activity&quot;, &quot;healthy diet&quot;, &quot;falls prevention&quot; and &quot;cognitive and psychosocial well-being&quot;.&#xD;
Case management: The third component of intervention is activities that determine each participant's health needs with the Omaha System and support them for the use of appropriate resources.</description>
