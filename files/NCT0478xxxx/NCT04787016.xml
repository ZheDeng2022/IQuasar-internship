      During the modern times, researchers have notably increased their knowledge, grounded on&#xD;
      literature, with regards to the relationship between core stability and athletic performance.&#xD;
      Number of research studies have also been completed that underline the benefits of core&#xD;
      stability training on injury prevention or performance, but in combination with other&#xD;
      training modalities such as speed, power, strength and agility. Although several studies have&#xD;
      investigated core stability benefits in athletes but there are very limited studies have&#xD;
      presented the role of Pilate training in increasing the core strength and stability of&#xD;
      cricket players in order to maximize their performance in the game. This study will&#xD;
      contribute in describing the effects of Pilate training in cricket players.&#xD;
