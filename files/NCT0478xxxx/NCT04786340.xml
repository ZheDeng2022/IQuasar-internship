  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12 week, 2-arm, blinded, single-site, placebo-controlled Phase II study in subjects&#xD;
      with Type II Diabetes and painful peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed with 4 periods: screening, baseline/day 0, outpatient treatment, and&#xD;
      safety follow-up. Site visits take place At -30 days, -7 days, Day 0, Week 3 (phone&#xD;
      assessment), 6, 9 (phone assessment) and 12/end of study [EOS]. There is also a Week 14 phone&#xD;
      call for a safety review with the subject. The purpose of this early phase 2 trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of both the active topical solution and the&#xD;
      placebo also called the 'vehicle' formulated as a topical solution that penetrates the skin&#xD;
      of the lower legs and tops of the feet. There are also secondary and exploratory objectives&#xD;
      to determine if this active has efficacy properties during the 12-week treatment period as&#xD;
      hypothesized. Even though pirenzepine is approved and used for another indication&#xD;
      systemically, the sponsor believes the active in a topical solution to be effective in&#xD;
      treating painful peripheral neuropathy commonly found in diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are both objective and subjective tests being introduced in this trial due to the&#xD;
      unique nature of the study, and lack of defined and standardized efficacy parameters.&#xD;
