      Purpose: This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation&#xD;
      exercises and laughter therapy on the mental health and treatment outcomes of women receiving&#xD;
      IVF treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups Methods: Participants were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the intervention (IG; n = 71) and control group (CG; n = 70). The&#xD;
      progressive muscle relaxation and laughter therapy was administered to women in the&#xD;
      intervention group in the IVF center for 3-4 times and 40 minutes. The CG received routine&#xD;
      care. Data were collected using baseline and oocyte retrieval day STAI and BDI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infertility, one of the important components of reproductive health, affects one in four&#xD;
      couples in developing countries.The emergence of assisted reproductive techniques such as in&#xD;
      vitro fertilization (IVF) gives infertile couples the opportunity to have both pregnancy and&#xD;
      a baby. Couples are affected emotionally during IVF treatment and women experience more&#xD;
      problems than men. The majority of women experience emotional problems such as anxiety and&#xD;
      depression because of infertility, invasive treatment procedures, physiological effects of&#xD;
      gonadotropin stimulation and positive outcome expectation.Considering the effect of anxiety&#xD;
      and depression on infertile women, it is important to examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      progressive muscle relaxation exercises and laughter therapy as complementary therapy in&#xD;
      psychosocial care.&#xD;

    <description>Beck Depression Inventory: The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item self-reporting scale consisting of emotional, cognitive, somatic, and motivational components to measure the level and severity changes of depressive symptoms. In BDI, it is seen that as the total score obtained from the scale increases, the individual's level of experiencing depressive emotions increases proportionally.</description>

    <description>In the first session of the researcher (S.K.), the participants were explained the effects of anxiety and stress on the treatment in simple terms for 5 min. Then, information was given about the effects of laughter therapy and progressive muscle relaxation on the body. Laughter therapy was applied for 15-20 min. Then, the lights were turned off and progressive muscle relaxation exercises were performed for 15-20 min under candlelight and accompanied by music. The procedures were received as a group (2-6 people) in 3-4 face-to-face sessions.</description>
