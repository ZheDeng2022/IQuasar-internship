  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Solius&#xD;
      Photobiological System in improving serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in vitamin D&#xD;
      deficient/ insufficient adults of various skin types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The invetigators will conduct an double-blinded randomized clinical trial in 100 adults to&#xD;
      compare the changes in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between subjects who received and do&#xD;
      not receive weekly exposures to Ultraviolet B Radiation (UVB) generated by the Solius&#xD;
      Photobiological System for 16 weeks.&#xD;

      Study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 100 healthy adults will be enrolled ages &gt;18; both sexes, for vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency screening in order to enroll 80 adults with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency&#xD;
      (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;30 ng/mL). Participants will be randomized 1:1 into two groups:&#xD;
      40 adults for treatment arm who will receive weekly exposures of ultraviolet radiation&#xD;
      generated by the Solius Photobiological system, and 40 adults for sham comparator arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment group that will be exposed to the Solius Photobiological System will first&#xD;
      undergo an evaluation of each individual's sensitivity to the Solius Photobiological System&#xD;
      UVB using the device titration system for the first 5 weeks. Once determined after the 5&#xD;
      weeks, the subjects will be enrolled in a 16-week study where they will be exposed to their&#xD;
      individualized titration evaluation. For the sham comparator group, they will undergo the&#xD;
      procedures as the treated group with the exception that the Solius Photobiological System&#xD;
      will only be turned on to emit visible radiation. At these visits, each subject assigned into&#xD;
      both groups will be asked questions about consumption of vitamin D, sun exposure, and whether&#xD;
      he/she has had any adverse changes in his/her health. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels will&#xD;
      be measured at baseline and monthly, and the levels will be analyzed to compare between those&#xD;
      who receive and who do not receive the UVB radiation intervention for baseline and during the&#xD;
      16-week treatment period. After the 16-week intervention, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      return the study site weekly for measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D for 4 weeks. Serum&#xD;
      25(OH)D levels will be determined using the Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method. Safety will be monitored by interviewing the participants&#xD;
      each UVB exposure for any adverse events, including erythema or any other skin reactions.&#xD;
