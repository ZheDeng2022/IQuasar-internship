  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This intervention includes the introduction of the Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG )Smart&#xD;
      PSA Screening Guidelines and implementation of patient navigation/ care coordination for men&#xD;
      with elevated PSA (&gt;4.0 ng/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guidelines include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What age to start?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How often to repeat screening?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What age to stop?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What PSA threshold should trigger a biopsy referral?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary care providers (PCP) hold the key to implementing effective early detection of&#xD;
      Prostate Cancer (PCa), but uncertainty about how to use PSA for screening without causing&#xD;
      undue overtreatment of indolent cancer, has greatly inhibited implementation, even in&#xD;
      high-risk communities. This is a single-arm intervention study to test implementation of the&#xD;
      Smart PSA strategy plus system-level patient navigation/ care coordination in the Mile Square&#xD;
      Health Center(MSHC), in order to: a) identify barriers and facilitators to inform&#xD;
      implementation of care, b) evaluate the impact on provider confidence regarding prostate&#xD;
      cancer screening, and, c) measure its effect on observed PSA levels, biopsy referral rates,&#xD;
      and biopsy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 PCPs employed by MSHC who provide care for male adults will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      surveys at baseline, (prior to an in-service training) and at 3,6, 9 and 12 months. The&#xD;
      surveys will use 5-point Likert scales to assess the respondent's self-report of their&#xD;
      knowledge regarding PSA screening, attitudes, behavior; and confidence in presenting the&#xD;
      issue, discussing it with patients, interpreting results and making recommendations based on&#xD;
      them; and to elicit comments on how to improve implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historical data of 4500 patients covering a one year period prior to the intervention will be&#xD;
      used to measure the impact of the intervention on measurable outcomes&#xD;
