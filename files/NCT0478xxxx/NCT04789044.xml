  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to determine the safety of PEG fusion when used with&#xD;
      primary repair or reconstruction in patients with an acute upper extremity peripheral nerve&#xD;
      injury. PEG is safe and effective for extending the half-life of circulating pharmaceutical&#xD;
      products, when used in conjunction with a topical hemostatic agent in surgical wounds, and&#xD;
      when used as a colon cleanser for endoscopic surgical procedures. However, PEG fusion has not&#xD;
      been rigorously tested as a safe reagent to promote nerve regeneration in humans. Therefore,&#xD;
      the goal of this Phase 2a clinical trial is to establish safety data and to examine the&#xD;
      effect of PEG fusion on clinical outcomes including recovery of sensory and motor function.&#xD;
      Results will be externally validated using data collected in the DoD funded prospective NERVE&#xD;
      study and will provide preliminary evidence to power a larger phase II efficacy trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 20 patients receiving simple repair and 20 patients receiving autograft&#xD;
      reconstruction within 24 hours of injury. Patients within each group will be randomized to&#xD;
      either PEG fusion mediated repair (n=10) or PEG mediated reconstruction (n=10); or&#xD;
      conventional nerve repair (n=10) or conventional nerve reconstruction (n=10). We hypothesize&#xD;
      that (1) the rate of complications within 1 month of surgery in patients treated with PEG&#xD;
      fusion will be comparable to that of patients treated with conventional nerve repair, (2) the&#xD;
      rate of complications within 1 month of surgery in patients treated with PEG fusion will be&#xD;
      comparable to that of patients treated with conventional autograft reconstruction, (3) there&#xD;
      will be no detrimental effects from PEG fusion on nerve regeneration over 2 years compared to&#xD;
      patients treated with conventional nerve repair or reconstruction, (4) recovery of sensory&#xD;
      and motor function will occur earlier (within 6 months) among patients treated with PEG&#xD;
      fusion compared to patients treated with conventional nerve repair, (5) recovery of sensory&#xD;
      and motor function will occur earlier (within 6 months) among patients treated with PEG&#xD;
      fusion compared to patients treated with conventional autograft reconstruction (6) patients&#xD;
      treated with PEG fusion will have better range of motion, greater hand strength, less&#xD;
      disability, less pain, and higher rates of treatment satisfaction compared with patients&#xD;
      treated with conventional repair or autograft reconstruction.&#xD;
