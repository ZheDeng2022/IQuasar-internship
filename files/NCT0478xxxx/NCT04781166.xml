  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this program is to test a brief, online, cognitive behavioral intervention for&#xD;
      people who struggle with self-harm or suicidal urges or behavior in the context of&#xD;
      emotion-related impulsivity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be asked to complete 7 brief online modules to cover how to understand&#xD;
      emotion-triggered impulsivity, to better detect states of high emotion and arousal, to learn&#xD;
      new strategies for self-calming high arousal, and to pre-plan how to cope with high arousal&#xD;
      states. As part of the program, participants receive daily texts and prompts to remind them&#xD;
      of the intervention content and skills. At baseline and follow-up, participants will complete&#xD;
      measures of emotion-related impulsivity, self-harm, and suicidality.&#xD;
