      To present the clinical characteristics of pelvic or extra-pelvic endometriosis and explore&#xD;
      the potential risk factors of pathogenesis and recurrence by comparing patients with&#xD;
      endometriosis at different sites&#xD;

      Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease defined as the presence of endometrial glands&#xD;
      and stroma outside of the internal epithelial lining of the cavum uteri, affecting up to 10%&#xD;
      of reproductive age women. It is rarely found in extrapelvic locations.This form of&#xD;
      endometriosis may be difficult to diagnosis due to pleomorphic presentation. Despite complete&#xD;
      excision with a safe margin and histopathological examination has been considered as&#xD;
      definitive diagnosis and primary therapeutic treatment for extra-pelvic endometriosis, what&#xD;
      is understood mainly comes from case reports and retrospective observations with limited&#xD;
      number of cases. Moreover, approximately 6%-14% of patients with PEM who had underwent&#xD;
      narrowly operative resection still suffered recurrent lesions, while risk factors were barely&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with endometriosis at different sites in our hospital were collected for analysis of&#xD;
      clinical characteristics namely demographic information, medical history, surgical records,&#xD;
      pathological and imaging reports, serum levels of cancer antigen 125 (CA125), peri-operative&#xD;
      medication. During long-term follow-up, prognosis of individuals could be identified by&#xD;
      telephone or clinical interview. Based on data from medical records or clinical observation,&#xD;
      risk model predicting recurrence will be established by comparing patients with different&#xD;
      outcomes or exposed to different risk factors. Thus, management of endometriosis might be&#xD;
      improved. Hopefully, pathogenesis of recurrent and primary endometriosis might be explained.&#xD;
