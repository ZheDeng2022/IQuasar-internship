      This study investigated how torso and shoulder positioning can help restore coordinated hand&#xD;
      movements in stroke patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke patients and healthy subjects were randomly divided into two different groups and&#xD;
      tested in different positions. In study group 1, the exercise test consisted of two motor&#xD;
      tasks carried out in two different starting positions: sitting and supine. During the first&#xD;
      examination, the subject sat on the therapeutic table (without back support), feet resting on&#xD;
      the floor (active stabilization of the trunk and shoulder). The upper limb was examined in&#xD;
      adduction, with the elbow bent in the intermediate position between pronation and supination&#xD;
      of the forearm. In the supine position, the upper limb was held beside the subject's body&#xD;
      (adduction in the humeral joint, elbow flexion in the intermediate position; passive&#xD;
      stabilization of the trunk and shoulder).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In study group 2, the exercise test again consisted of two motor tasks carried out in two&#xD;
      different starting positions: supine with the upper extremity positioned perpendicularly to&#xD;
      the trunk (passive stabilization of the trunk, active stabilization of the shoulder), and&#xD;
      supine with the upper limb held beside the subject's body (adduction in the humeral joint,&#xD;
      elbow flexion in the intermediate position; passive stabilization of the trunk and shoulder).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A manual electronic dynamometer (EH 101) was used for grip strength measurement (error of&#xD;
      measurement, 0.5 kg/lb). A Hand Tutor device (composed of a safe and comfortable glove&#xD;
      equipped with position and motion sensors, and the Medi Tutor(TM) software) was used to&#xD;
      measure the range of passive and active movement (error of measurement, 5 - 10 mm), as well&#xD;
      as the speed/frequency of movement (error of measurement, 0,5 cycle/sec.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the range of passive movement in the radial-carpal joint (flexion and extension) and&#xD;
      fingers (global flexion and extension) was measured in each position using the Hand Tutor&#xD;
      Device. Then the subject made active movements in the same order. Finally, the subject was&#xD;
      asked to make moves as quickly and in as full a range as possible. The measurement of grip&#xD;
      strength with a dynamometer was performed in each position after the range of motion and&#xD;
      speed/frequency tests.&#xD;
