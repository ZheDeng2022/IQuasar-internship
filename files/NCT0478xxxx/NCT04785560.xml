    <textblock>
      Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (=iNPH) is a condition with disturbed circulation of&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (=CSF) causing symptoms such as balance and gait disorders, urinary&#xD;
      incontinence and cognitive impairment in patients with cerebral ventricular dilation. The&#xD;
      exact incidence is unknown but has been estimated at about 8.9% of the population over the&#xD;
      age of 80 and the incidence is estimated to increase with an aging population. The symptoms&#xD;
      can be temporarily improved by draining cerebrospinal fluid and so-called shunting (surgery&#xD;
      with diversion of cerebrospinal fluid from the brain to the abdominal cavity). The symptoms&#xD;
      and pathophysiology of iNPH are poorly described as well as the protein distribution in&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (proteomics) of the disease. There is also a need for improved&#xD;
      diagnostical and prognostical tools that can guide in patient selection for surgery. The&#xD;
      radiological tools in evaluating the disease and it´s progression need to be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a shunt valve (Codman Certas Plus) used since 2015 that is widely used in clinical&#xD;
      use and is well studied in research laboratories but little in clinical studies. The project&#xD;
      aims to, before and after surgery, on patients with iNPH who will undergo investigation and&#xD;
      shunting with Certas Plus at our department and in comparison with healthy controls: 1. Apply&#xD;
      and evaluate a novel method to determine the volume of circulating CSF (volumetry). 2. Study&#xD;
      the correlation between changes in volumetry and clinical outcome 3. Study NPH patients'&#xD;
      distribution of proteins in cerebrospinal fluid and their change over time after shunting. 4.&#xD;
      Evaluate the efficacy and functions of the Certas Plus valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, the investigators hope to find increased knowledge about the NPH disease and its&#xD;
      pathophysiology as well as useful instruments that can both predict the probability for a&#xD;
      patient to be improved by a shunt operation and determine if a shunt has stopped working and&#xD;
      thus be able to avoid unnecessary risky operations.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND &amp; SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (=iNPH) is a condition with disturbed cerebral&#xD;
      dynamics causing symptoms in the form of balance and gait disorders, incontinence and&#xD;
      cognitive impairment in patients with cerebral ventricular dilation. The condition is much&#xD;
      more common than is generally known with a prevalence that increases sharply with age, from&#xD;
      2.1% in the age of 70 to 8.9% in ages over 80 years. Adams and Hakim described the disease as&#xD;
      early as 1965 based on symptomatology and reversibility of symptoms after CSF tapping.&#xD;
      However, it was not until 2005 that a compilation of evidence-based guidelines for the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of the disease came out, the iNPH International Guidelines. It was&#xD;
      stated that at present, in addition to the CSF tap-test there is no reliable predictive test&#xD;
      for a patient's likelihood to respond to shunting . There are several different scales for&#xD;
      assessing the severity of the disease, one of which is the iNPH scale, with the subscales of&#xD;
      gait, balance, neuropsychology and continence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Department of Neurosurgery (NK) and Neurological (NL), Linköping University Hospital,&#xD;
      there has been a well-functioning multi-professional team since 2004. The team investigates&#xD;
      and treats iNPH with referrals coming from the Southeastern healthcare region of Sweden.&#xD;
      Annually approximately 250 referrals are received, 70-80 patients are evaluated and at least&#xD;
      40 patients are operated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting. The evaluation consists in the&#xD;
      first stage of radiological examinations, a clinical assessment by a neurologist, followed by&#xD;
      motor assessment by a physiotherapist and cognitive assessment by an occupational therapist.&#xD;
      CSF tap-tests are usually performed in which up to 50 ml of cerebrospinal fluid is drained by&#xD;
      lumbar puncture, which in iNPH usually relieves the symptoms. Assessment also includes video&#xD;
      recording of the movement pattern of a qualitative assessment. The results, together with the&#xD;
      radiology, are weighed together and then the team if the patient should be offered treatment.&#xD;
      The patients are operated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting at NK and followed up at NL with&#xD;
      the same motor and cognitive tests three months after the operation, after which the results&#xD;
      are evaluated. In larger studies, approximately 70 % of iNPH-patients receiving a shunt&#xD;
      improve postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shunt therapy is the only treatment of iNPH and has been available since the 1950s. The goal&#xD;
      of treatment is to reduce the amount of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricular system and&#xD;
      thereby normalize the volume in the ventricular system. Since the early 1990s adjustable&#xD;
      shunt valves are increasingly used. This means that the valve if necessary can be adjusted&#xD;
      after implantation with an external magnet applied to the site of the valve. The disadvantage&#xD;
      of most adjustable valves is that the valve setting can be adjusted inadvertently when&#xD;
      exposed to strong magnetic fields, for example if the patient undergoes a magnetic camera&#xD;
      examination. Adjustable valves, however, bring many advantages as the resistance can be&#xD;
      adapted to the patient's needs even after the operation. For example, one of the most common&#xD;
      complications after shunting (subdural hematoma) can often be treated by raising the valve&#xD;
      resistance. In 2015 the company Codman Johnson &amp; Johnson introduced a novel shunt valve,&#xD;
      Certas Plus, which is an adjustable shunt with eight different settings. The valve is&#xD;
      established in clinical practice. Special features are the highest setting (8) which is 40 cm&#xD;
      H20, which is a very high resistance which in theory should be equivalent to a turned off&#xD;
      shunt and is called by the company &quot;virtual off&quot;. It is also designed to be MR-resistant and&#xD;
      thus does not change setting when exposed to a MRI magnetic field. These features have so far&#xD;
      been tested in vitro but no clinical studies have yet been performed. The advantages of these&#xD;
      functions are potentially fewer surgical procedures and inpatient care and also enables&#xD;
      patients in the Southeastern healthcare region to carry out planned and acute MRI&#xD;
      examinations in their home hospital without having to go to the Neurosurgical department in&#xD;
      Linköping for valve readjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventricular dilatation is a radiological diagnosis. Since the 1940s, the largest diameter&#xD;
      between the lateral boundaries of the lateral ventricles and the largest biparietal diameter&#xD;
      on the inside of the skull have been measured to obtain the so-called Evans index by dividing&#xD;
      the two and obtaining the ratio. It is easy to measure but is a method with many sources of&#xD;
      error and poor sensitivity to volume changes in the ventricular system. There is a need for a&#xD;
      more reliable method in both clinical practice and research. Volumetry, i e measuring the&#xD;
      volume of the ventricles, has become an increasingly used method which, however, has not yet&#xD;
      taken place in clinical practice due to time-consuming manual calculation. With MRI images&#xD;
      that are converted in a special software (ITK-SNAP), the volume may be calculated and a&#xD;
      three-dimensional image of the ventricular system can be plotted. A few studies in the&#xD;
      literature have studied the relationship between shunt valves resistance and reduction in&#xD;
      ventricular volume. There are no prospective blinded studies studying the change in&#xD;
      ventricular volume related to shunt therapy, shunt resistance, nor are there any studies on&#xD;
      whether there is a correlation between ventricular volume reduction and postoperative&#xD;
      clinical outcome. A study group in Uppsala has recently published a study on shunted&#xD;
      iNPH-patients where a novel MRI-technology developed in Linköping (SyntheticMR) clearly can&#xD;
      show how ventricular volume decreases after treatment without changing Evans' index. In the&#xD;
      same study, it was also possible to show how another parameter in the ventricles, the&#xD;
      so-called callosal angle, clearly changes after shunting. This is part of a radiological&#xD;
      assessment scale, Radscale, which can be applied to this patient group. The same research&#xD;
      group has previously also been able to show with SyntheticMR how the ventricular volume&#xD;
      decreases after tap tests on iNPH patients to be restored to the original within 24 hours.&#xD;
      CMIV (=Center for Medical Imaging and Visualization) at US Linköping has several of the&#xD;
      University Hospital's 3-Tesla MR cameras and a good technological and scientific knowledge of&#xD;
      SyntheticMR as the method is developed there. Using a short MRI protocol (6 minutes), it&#xD;
      produces quantitative data of the condition of the brain tissue, which makes it easy to&#xD;
      ascertain what is gray and white brain matter, the brain cells' support protein myelin as&#xD;
      well as cerebrospinal fluid and calculates the volume of each component. Sequences with&#xD;
      standard protocols for hydrocephalus, including DTI (=Diffusion Tensor Imaging) sequences,&#xD;
      require an additional 15-20 minutes in the MRI camera. SyntheticMR can also as the hitherto&#xD;
      only method easily calculate the volume of CSF that is located outside of the ventricles in&#xD;
      the basal cisterns and brain sulci. However, no one has so far studied the volumes of&#xD;
      extracerebral CSF in the healthy brain or in iNPH. In addition, no one has studied how this&#xD;
      volume extracerebral CSF changes in response to shunting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proteome is the collective name of the proteins that an organism or an organ synthesizes.&#xD;
      The proteome is not constant but varies between different organs in the same organism and in&#xD;
      the same organ over time and change in the diseased organism or organ. Proteomics is the&#xD;
      science of these proteins and can be used to examine when and where certain proteins can be&#xD;
      found, concentrations of these, how they are broken down, modified and interact in various&#xD;
      physiological and disease processes. Some neurological diseases have been characterized in&#xD;
      their proteomic alterations, such as essential tremor and chronic neuropathic pain, by the&#xD;
      members of our for research group. The proteomics of the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with&#xD;
      iNPH is relatively unexplored with only three studies in the literature. These have&#xD;
      characterized a few proteins that stand out compared to what is expected in a healthy brain.&#xD;
      No comparative studies between CSF taken via lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid from the&#xD;
      ventricles have been performed. At the department of Pain- and Rehabilitational medicine at&#xD;
      Linköping University Hospital a proteomics lab (PAINOMICS lab) with many scientific&#xD;
      publications is established. The standard methods available for proteomics studies are&#xD;
      two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D electrophoresis) and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).&#xD;
      These are applied to analyze up to a thousand proteins in one sample and with antibody-based&#xD;
      technology validate them. With antibody-based technology, one can also analyze up to 86&#xD;
      cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and metabolic substances in a so-called multiplex&#xD;
      panel. The data sets obtained in proteomic studies are complex. These datasets are made up of&#xD;
      many and highly correlated variables (concentrations of proteins). One can then compare&#xD;
      content changes of proteins between patients with iNPH and controls establish a difference in&#xD;
      &quot;fingerprint&quot; of the proteome. There is a great need for new biomarkers as a complement to&#xD;
      currently available methods for making a definite diagnosis, assessing the probability that&#xD;
      the therapy will be successful and creating a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      iNPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES, SCIENTIFIC ISSUES AND SUBSTUDIES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate and validate a clinically useful method of monitoring ventricular volumes with&#xD;
           Synthetic MRI. Comparison against an established volumetric method (ITK-SNAP) and for&#xD;
           intra- and inter-assessor reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Map ventricular volumes and amount extracerebral intracranial CSF during normal&#xD;
           physiological conditions in healthy control persons and of INPH patients and calculate&#xD;
           how these volumes change after shunting in INPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate how volume change and change in volumetry and iNPH Radscale after shunting&#xD;
           correlate to clinical outcome 3 months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine the shunt valve CERTAS PLUS for its function and safety for MR resistance in&#xD;
           vivo and correlate the degree of reduction in ventricular volume based on the resistance&#xD;
           of the valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Map the proteomic expression of iNPH in CSF and blood plasma pre-operatively and monitor&#xD;
           change at 3, 12 and 36 months after ventriculoperitoneal shunting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Compare how the proteomics in CSF in iNPH differ between lumbar and ventricular CSF and&#xD;
           blood plasma. Examine whether the iNPH patients lumbar CSF is different compared to a&#xD;
           neurologically healthy cohort control persons of similar age and patients with essential&#xD;
           tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT PLAN, IMPLEMENTATION AND SELECTION OF RESEARCH OBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Swedish National Ethics Review board (Etikprövningsmyndigheten), ref no 2020-0071920, has&#xD;
      approved this project plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty patients who have undergone the NPH team's investigation and are deemed suitable for&#xD;
      shunt treatment are recruited consecutively for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group consisting of 50 volunteer individuals over 60 years of age is recruited via&#xD;
      the operation waiting list of the departments of Orthopedics, Urology and Gynaecology at&#xD;
      Linköping University Hospital. Volunteers will be recruited from elderly patients who during&#xD;
      planned orthopedic/gynecological/urological surgery in spinal anesthesia will undergo a&#xD;
      lumbar puncture for the application of the anesthesia. Volunteers will preoperatively undergo&#xD;
      an MRI examination including standard sequences as well as SyntheticMR protocols for&#xD;
      volumetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NPH team's pre-operative investigation of iNPH patients consists of the following&#xD;
      examinations: 1. Clinical assessment by a neurologist. 2. Balance and ability to walk is&#xD;
      assessed by a physiotherapist. Tests include Timed Up and Go (TUG) , number of steps and time&#xD;
      as well as gait scale, balance scale and 10 m walking as part of the iNPH scale. 3. An&#xD;
      occupational therapist assesses the cognitive functions and performs the following tests:&#xD;
      MMSE (=Mini-Mental State Examination), Grooved pegboard, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test,&#xD;
      Stroop color naming and Stroop interference , Trail Making Test A and B. 4. Estimation of&#xD;
      urinary incontinence is done on the urinary incontinence scale. All assessments are combined&#xD;
      in the iNPH scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lumbar puncture with measuring of intrathecal pressure, analysis of cells, protein,&#xD;
      antibodies against Lyme disease and the CSF tap-test is included in the basic investigation.&#xD;
      The patient's medical history, symptoms and results from radiology and CSF tap-test are&#xD;
      discussed within the NPH team to decide whether the patient is deemed suitable for a shunt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are recommended shunting by the team and do not meet the study's exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are called to a outpatients visit to Dr Rafael Holmgren, are informed of the&#xD;
      intended operation and associated risks and offered study participation after oral and&#xD;
      written information. Patients are offered time to think and get back to the contact nurse's&#xD;
      telephone before answering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers in the control group are recruited among patients planned for surgery in spinal&#xD;
      anestesia by the departments of Orthopedics, Urology and Gynaecology at Linköping University&#xD;
      Hospital. They are informed of possible participation in the study orally by telephone or if&#xD;
      so desired during an outpatient consultation with Dr Rafael Holmgren in addition to written&#xD;
      information. Participants in the control group will before their operation undergo an&#xD;
      MRI-examination with standard protocol and Synthetic MRI. Before spinal anaesthesia is&#xD;
      administered 10 ml of lumbar CSF is drawn for analysis of the proteomic profile as is a blood&#xD;
      sample for the same purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating iNPH-patients to be shunted will the day before the surgery undergo an MRI with&#xD;
      modified standard protocol and SyntheticMR; time required is about 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients undergo general anesthesia the following day and a lumbar puncture is performed,&#xD;
      after which 10 ml of cerebrospinal fluid is collected. Simultaneously, a blood sample is also&#xD;
      taken for proteomic analysis. The patient is operated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting by a&#xD;
      standard procedure by one of three surgeons (Dr Rafael Holmgren, Dr Peter Zsigmond or Dr&#xD;
      Martin Nilsson at NK). Patients receive a Codman CERTAS PLUS shunt valve with one out of two&#xD;
      valve settings blinded to the operator, patient and radiological investigators (set by&#xD;
      another colleague in accordance with randomization): 4 (=110 mm H20 , conventional default&#xD;
      setting) or 8 (&gt;400 mm H20 a k a &quot;virtual off&quot;). As the cerebral ventricles are punctured by&#xD;
      the catheter another 10 ml CSF for proteomics is collected here. The samples are transported&#xD;
      to the proteomics laboratory, centrifuged, aliquoted into small aliquots before being frozen.&#xD;
      They are then stored in the biobank at Occupational and Environmental Medicine at the&#xD;
      Linköping University Hospital (registered with the National Board of Health and Welfare).&#xD;
      Each incoming subject is given a unique code number and all test tubes are marked with this&#xD;
      number. The code key is kept in a locked cabinet at the Department of Neurosurgery in&#xD;
      Linköping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 36 hours (range 24-48 hours) after the operation, the patient undergoes a new&#xD;
      MRI examination with SyntheticMR and after this examination, the valve setting is checked&#xD;
      with a reader compass held over the valve. The patients who initially received setting 8 of&#xD;
      the valve are now adjusted to receive the standard setting 4, unless they have suffered a&#xD;
      subdural hematoma after the operation, which is detected in the MRI examination&#xD;
      postoperatively. The patient is then discharged to either the home or their local hospital.&#xD;
      Thus, all patients return home with a functioning shunt treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are called back for standard follow-up for shunted iNPH patients after three&#xD;
      months for a return visit to the surgeon and carry out a clinical examination/follow-up by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist and occupational therapist with the same protocol for the motor and cognitive&#xD;
      tests as before the operation. Patients also undergo a new MRI examination with the same&#xD;
      protocol as before the operation. The shunt valve setting is checked after the MRI to confirm&#xD;
      that the valve setting is the same as before. Also, the shunt valve chamber is punctured&#xD;
      under sterile conditions with a small needle to obtain 10 ml of CSF from the ventricles and a&#xD;
      blood sample is also taken for proteomic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are called back to the operating physician one and three years after the operation&#xD;
      for clinical assessment and new puncture of the shunt valve and blood tests with the same&#xD;
      procedure as at the 3-month check-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All shunt-related complications, including adjustments of the shunt resistance in connection&#xD;
      with MRI, are registered continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSF- and blood samples assays are performed by Professor Bijar Ghafouri at Painomics lab with&#xD;
      both mass spectrometry and 2D-electrophoresis to identify, separate the proteins and ELISA&#xD;
      techniques to characterize them. The identity of the sample is blinded to the examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI studies are analyzed in a specific software adapted for assessment of volumes in studies&#xD;
      made with both conventional technology (ITK SNAP) and SyntheticMR technology by Dr Holmgren&#xD;
      and Dr. Georgiopoulos. The patient's identity and shunt setting are blinded to the examiners&#xD;
      as well as timing of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL BASIS FOR THE SIZE OF THE STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      An amount of fifty iNPH-patients is judged adequate to answer the project's stated&#xD;
      objectives. This is because the studies in proteomics at iNPH (by Chen et al and Li et al,&#xD;
      see references) included 18 and 15 patients, respectively, and obtained clear statistically&#xD;
      significant results. The studies on ventricular volume calculated with Synthetic MRI after&#xD;
      lumbar puncture and shunting by Virhammar et al included 23 and 18 patients, respectively,&#xD;
      and gave clear statistically significant results. The number of neurologically healthy&#xD;
      control subjects/volunteers in the control group amounts to 50 to correspond to the number&#xD;
      INPH patients.&#xD;
