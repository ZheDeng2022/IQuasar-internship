  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will target a population at high risk for colorectal cancer, overweight and obese&#xD;
      participants with a history of a colon polyp in the past 3 years to test whether a&#xD;
      high-legume, high-fiber diet will simultaneously increase weight loss and suppress intestinal&#xD;
      biomarkers of cancer risk compared to a control diet (healthy American). In addition, it will&#xD;
      explore potential mechanisms through which the high-legume intervention diet facilitates&#xD;
      weight loss and intestinal health.&#xD;

      The goal of the research is to conduct a clinical trial featuring study-provided&#xD;
      pre-portioned entrées (2 entrées per day months 1-3, 1 entrée per day months 4-6) and&#xD;
      strategic nutritional instruction to guide participants to integrate legumes into a healthy&#xD;
      high-fiber diet pattern. The research will target a population at high risk for colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, overweight and obese participants with a history of a colon polyp in the past 3&#xD;
      years, to test whether a high-legume, high-fiber diet will simultaneously increase weight&#xD;
      loss and suppress intestinal biomarkers of cancer risk compared to a control diet (healthy&#xD;
      American). In addition, it will explore potential mechanisms through which the high-legume&#xD;
      intervention diet facilitates weight loss and intestinal health.&#xD;

Participants continue on their respective diets in mos. 7-12 but assume responsibility for food preparation. The HLD will contain approximately 250g of legumes per day (~1 ½ cups cooked) in months 1-3 provided in two pre-portioned single serving entrées (i.e. ~125g each). A study nutritionist will provide in-person and written guidance for including sides that are nutritionally balanced with energy intake to lose 1-2 lbs. /wk.</description>

To meet NIH data sharing requirements selected data will be deposited in appropriate research data repositories (e.g., NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Workbench). For genomic data, all data generated by this project will be made publicly available through adequate public genomic data warehouses as appropriate to the data type (NCBI Short Read Archives, Gene expression omnibus, etc.). Sequence data will be screened for the presence of sequences from human and these will be removed from public submissions unless directed otherwise by the NIH. Our algorithms will be made available through publications and as standalone programs when this is feasible. All new genomic and microbiome datasets will be deposited in public databases.</ipd_access_criteria>
