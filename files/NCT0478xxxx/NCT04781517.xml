  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The commonly used scales (ODI+JOA-29+VAS) lack the assessment of lumbar stiffness, and there&#xD;
      is no scale for evaluating lumbar stiffness in China.Based on the Delphi method and the&#xD;
      analytic hierarchy process, this study will improve and optimize the quality of life&#xD;
      evaluation system for patients with severe degenerative lumbar disease, so as to obtain a&#xD;
      concise, practical, and effective patient-reported outcome instrument.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although lumbar fusion can improve function by correcting deformity,restoring spinal&#xD;
      stability,and reducing pain, it also by intention leads to spinal stiffness which can impair&#xD;
      function of daily activities.The commonly used scales (ODI+JOA-29+VAS) lack the assessment of&#xD;
      lumbar stiffness.Lumbar Stiffness Disability Index (LSDI) has not been used widely, and there&#xD;
      is no scale for evaluating lumbar stiffness in China.In addition, even if LSDI is modified,&#xD;
      there is still an evaluation dilemma: after lumbar long-segment fixation, the pain and&#xD;
      neurological function-related scale scores show that the quality of life is improved, while&#xD;
      the lumbar stiffness-related scale scores show that the quality of life is reduced . So&#xD;
      overall, is the patient's quality of life improved or decreased? Simply combining these two&#xD;
      types of scales cannot explain clearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study can be roughly divided into the following 5 main steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1:Collect and sort out the dimensions and exhaustive items that affect the patients'&#xD;
      quality of life by systematically reviewing the related literature and a qualitative&#xD;
      interview study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Through a cross-sectional survey and experts' meetings, the items is initially&#xD;
      optimized, and 35-45 items will be retained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: Screen 20-25 excellent items by 2-3 rounds of Delphi method, then use the analytic&#xD;
      hierarchy process to determine the weight of each item, so as to establish a initial PRO&#xD;
      instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4: Verify the reliability and validity of the initial PRO instrument, and further&#xD;
      optimize the initial PRO instrument in order to be used in clinical practice and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 5: Verify the responsiveness of the initial PRO instrument, calculate the ES, SRM, AUC&#xD;
      and MICD values of the initial PRO instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a novel, concise, practical, and effective PRO instrument for use in degenerative&#xD;
      lumbar disease patients will be established.&#xD;
