  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is currently one of the most substantial health burdens. Due to the production of&#xD;
      marked and sustained weight loss, bariatric surgery is an increasingly used therapeutic&#xD;
      modality to combat obesity and its comorbidities. Surgical rearrangement of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract dramatically alters metabolism and hormones, and results in changes in&#xD;
      neurological and hypothalamic signalling, including affected gut-brain axis, which coalesce&#xD;
      to exert a profound influence on eating behaviour. In this context, many patients self-report&#xD;
      changes in appetite, satiety and food preferences. However, the mechanisms of such functional&#xD;
      changes, and how they relate to food decision-making and food purchase behaviour remain&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators propose a novel approach using digital receipts from&#xD;
      loyalty card to unravel the effect of bariatric surgery on eating and food purchase behaviour&#xD;
      in daily life in the second part.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this project is to elucidate the changes in food behaviour among obese&#xD;
      adults undergoing bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to observe the effect of bariatric surgery on food purchase behaviour&#xD;
      using digital receipts from grocery shopping. The investigators hypothesize that bariatric&#xD;
      surgery leads to changes in food purchase behaviour in obese adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The further objective is to compare food purchase behaviour between obese adults against&#xD;
      values of an existing reference population, and to assess whether these differences tend to&#xD;
      be reduced post-surgery among operated participants.&#xD;

The Nutri-Score is based on a discrete continuous scale from -15 (most healthy) to 40 (least healthy). The score is then transcribed into five colour categories (A-E, ranging from bright green (most healthy) to red (least healthy)).</description>
