  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to determine if Distance Reiki therapy offers a quality of&#xD;
      life benefit, and improves immunity compared to patients receiving Sham Distance Reiki&#xD;
      therapy or no additional Reiki intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reiki is a popular complementary medicine modality sought after by patients. This non-&#xD;
      intrusive Japanese based therapy centers on the guiding of energy through a Reiki&#xD;
      practitioner to the patient which facilitates innate healing by modulation of energy fields.&#xD;
      Reiki is formally classified as biofield therapy by the National Center for Complementary and&#xD;
      Alternative Medicine (NCCAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current research indicates that Reiki shows promise as a noninvasive healing tool for mind&#xD;
      and body, particularly among patients with cancer. However, the data validating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Reiki integrated within a structured medical paradigm and the effect on&#xD;
      cancer immunity remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the clear demand for Reiki among cancer patients but skepticism within the medical&#xD;
      community, this trial will aim to determine an objective patient reported quality of life&#xD;
      (PRQoL) benefit by utilizing validated tools, in order to effectively implement Reiki into&#xD;
      traditional medical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple myeloma patients are at high risk of serious illness from the COVID-19 virus during&#xD;
      this pandemic, and so distance Reiki will be carried out via video conferencing platform.&#xD;
