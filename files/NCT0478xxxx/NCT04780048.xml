  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how the patient factors, co-morbid conditions,&#xD;
      pre-operative workup, anatomy of the defect, reconstruction details, operative techniques,&#xD;
      and type of repairs contribute to the final outcome of abdominal wall reconstruction. The&#xD;
      outcomes of interest are: in-hospital complications, discharge disposition, hospital and ICU&#xD;
      length of stay, long term follow-up (recurrence, reoperation, and explantation rates).&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal wall defects are commonly seen in trauma and EGS patients. During the last decade&#xD;
      numerous advances have been made in the management of patients with abdominal wall defects.&#xD;
      These defects are repaired by various surgical techniques including mesh repair (synthetic&#xD;
      vs. biologic), primary repair, etc. However, the outcomes of patients after these injuries&#xD;
      are highly variable and many of these patients suffer from in-hospital complications, mesh&#xD;
      infections requiring explantation, and recurrence. Various factors play a role in the final&#xD;
      outcome of the patient. These include factors associated with the initial surgery or disease&#xD;
      (trauma or emergency general surgery), patient demographics (age, gender, co-morbidities),&#xD;
      preoperative features (hemoglobin and laboratory parameters), technique of repair (onlay,&#xD;
      inlay, retro rectus) and the types of mesh used. However, the role of each of these factors&#xD;
      in the final outcome of patients remains unclear in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Study Type: Observational Observational Study Model: Cohort Time Perspective:&#xD;
      Prospective Enrollment: 250 Number of Groups/Cohorts: 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attending physicians will discuss possible participation in the study with patients who meet&#xD;
      initial screening criteria and have been scheduled for abdominal wall repair/ventral hernia&#xD;
      repair. If a patient agrees, they will be approached by our research coordinator to discuss&#xD;
      consenting. The research coordinator will introduce herself and her role with Westchester&#xD;
      Medical Center, and read the following script. A translator for Spanish speaking patients&#xD;
      will be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hello, my name is _______________. I am a research coordinator with the Department of Surgery&#xD;
      here at Westchester Medical Center. I'm talking to you today because you or your family&#xD;
      member are scheduled to have a surgery that involves abdominal wall repair. Dr. Latifi, the&#xD;
      Director of the Department of Surgery, is conducting a study looking at outcomes from this&#xD;
      surgery. We are interested in how this procedure and personal factors, such as having&#xD;
      diabetes, may contribute to how long you stay in the hospital, have a recurrence or develop&#xD;
      an infection. Participation in this study does not require anything additional from you. You&#xD;
      will receive the same care if you do or do not participate. The only difference is we would&#xD;
      maintain your outcome data for analysis purposes. Would you be interested in learning more&#xD;
      about the study and discussing study details with me and Dr. Latifi? If so, are you able to&#xD;
      meet and when would you like to meet? Or, if you do not know yet, can you provide me with&#xD;
      your phone number or the best way to contact you to schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss&#xD;
      the study?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Coordinator meets and collects potential participant contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meeting will be held to describe study in more detail and to consent participant and/or&#xD;
      representative. If participant is already in the hospital for the procedure, the meeting will&#xD;
      be held as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research involves no more than minimal risk to subjects as it provides no additional&#xD;
      treatment for patients who had abdominal wall defects and are undergoing surgery. Data will&#xD;
      be obtained on their pre and perioperative details, their interventions, and final outcomes.&#xD;
      This study will use a chart review of data from electronic medical records for current&#xD;
      patients. Subjects will be recruited, consented, and medical record data will be gathered&#xD;
      prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records containing Protective Health Information such as admission and discharge date&#xD;
      will be obtained from the hospital Electronic Medical Record database in the form of a query&#xD;
      spreadsheet to determine hospital and ICU length of stay. All data will be de-identified&#xD;
      using a unique identifier that is assigned to each record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be queried from the database and kept in a password protected excel spreadsheet.&#xD;
      Only the PI and designated research personnel will have the access to the Protective Health&#xD;
      Information and data linkage file. The PI designated research team members will have the&#xD;
      access to the de-identified data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored and secured in a logbook/secured computer with the PI. Hard copies will&#xD;
      also be stored in closed envelopes in locked cabinets in PI's office. The data will be kept&#xD;
      for a period of seven years and then later will be destroyed. Data will be stored by the&#xD;
      Westchester Medical Center (WMC) Lead PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic Plan: Chi-square difference tests will be used to assess significant differences in&#xD;
      predictors on categorical outcomes. T-tests will be used to assess mean differences in&#xD;
      predictors on continuous outcomes. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses&#xD;
      will be conducted for outcomes such as all-cause mortality, pneumonia, sepsis, and&#xD;
      multi-organ failure. Univariable and multivariable linear regression will be performed for&#xD;
      hospital length of stay.&#xD;
