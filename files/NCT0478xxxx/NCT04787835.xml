  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wide-awake surgery with local anesthesia is a widely described approach to performing&#xD;
      numerous minor hand procedures, such as tendon repairs and percutaneous fracture pinning, but&#xD;
      is less frequently used for hand fractures treated with open reduction internal fixation&#xD;
      (ORIF). This is in part due to the need for a tourniquet to visualize the fracture site,&#xD;
      however pain-free tourniquet time with local anesthesia is roughly 20 minutes, which is&#xD;
      shorter than the average time for fracture fixation (Gillis). While general anesthesia for&#xD;
      hand ORIFs may be avoided with more proximal blocks such as a brachial plexus or bier blocks,&#xD;
      these still require presence of an anesthesiologist during the procedure, increasing human&#xD;
      resource utilization and costs. Development of an anesthetic technique for hand ORIFs which&#xD;
      could be performed by surgeons in a clinic setting that provides sufficiently long pain-free&#xD;
      tourniquet times could decreases costs, as well as patient wait times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the pain patients experience after 20 minutes of&#xD;
      tourniquet application with local anesthetic infiltration is not due to direct pressure on&#xD;
      the proximal arm, but rather distal digital ischemia pain. Previously, it has been shown that&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided regional block of the median, radial, and ulnar nerves in the forearm is&#xD;
      effective analgesia for awake hand surgery (Winter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no randomized studies investigating if forearm nerve blocks can prolong&#xD;
      pain-free tourniquet time compared to local anesthesia infiltration, by blocking this&#xD;
      ischemic pain in the distal arm. The investigators' objective is therefore to determine if&#xD;
      forearm nerve blocks prolong pain-free tourniquet time compared to local anesthetic&#xD;
      infiltration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With increasing caseloads in some healthcare systems, patients requiring hand surgery may&#xD;
      wait over two weeks for time in the general operating room schedule. During this time,&#xD;
      fractures may heal, leading to a need for more extensive and longer procedures such as&#xD;
      osteotomies in addition to reduction and fixation. It also prolongs time away from work, as&#xD;
      well as home for rural patients who must relocate while awaiting surgery in major centers.&#xD;
      Previously, it has been shown that performing closed hand fracture fixation on awake patients&#xD;
      in a clinic or procedure room setting leads to 60-100% increases in daily case volume&#xD;
      compared to the main operating room (OR) (Gillis, Steve). Fixation of hand fractures in this&#xD;
      setting has also been shown to cost over 2000$ less than in the OR, by reducing staffing&#xD;
      requirements, equipment, and anesthesia costs (Steve).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing hand surgery in awake patients under local anesthesia has been shown by numerous&#xD;
      studies to be a safe and effective. Wide-awake hand surgery is generally well-tolerated, has&#xD;
      lower post-operative opioid requirements, and is often preferred by patients (Thompson).&#xD;
      Furthermore, by preventing the need for general anesthesia, this technique allows hand&#xD;
      surgery to be performed in patients who may otherwise not be operative candidates. In Canada,&#xD;
      awake surgery under local anesthesia is commonly done for tendon repairs, carpal tunnel&#xD;
      release, and percutaneous pinning of fractures without a tourniquet (Gillis, Steve, Peters).&#xD;
      While tourniquet use improves visualization of the operative field, when only local&#xD;
      anesthesia is used patients can typically tolerate the tourniquet for less than 20 minutes&#xD;
      before pain begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ORIFs, the use of a tourniquet is ideal for exposure of the fracture site. Current&#xD;
      literature suggests that the maximum pain-free tourniquet time is roughly 20 minutes, which&#xD;
      is less than the average length of fracture fixation in hand fractures (Gillis). Intravenous&#xD;
      regional anesthesia (IVRA), i.e. Bier blocks, are well-established means of providing&#xD;
      anesthesia for hand surgeries requiring tourniquet use, and enable tourniquet times from 20&#xD;
      minutes to two hours (Dekoninck, Brown). While these blocks prevent the need for general&#xD;
      anesthesia, they still require an anesthetist to perform and monitor the block. More&#xD;
      recently, forearm tourniquets with IVRA have been shown to be non-inferior to traditional&#xD;
      proximal arm tourniquets, with lower doses of post-operative opioids required (Dekoninck,&#xD;
      Farbood). However, compared to local anesthesia, IVRA for procedures were tourniquets are&#xD;
      preferred still increases costs, staffing requirements, and resource use as they often take&#xD;
      place in the OR. However, local anesthetic infiltration by the treating surgeon may not&#xD;
      provide sufficient pain relief for the amount of tourniquet time required to complete an&#xD;
      average ORIF of a long bone in the hand. Therefore, although many methods of anesthesia for&#xD;
      hand ORIFs exist, include local anesthetic infiltration and proximal nerve blocks, there is&#xD;
      not yet one 'gold standard' approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound guided peripheral nerve blocks at the forearm level have previously been shown to&#xD;
      be a safe, effective method of providing regional anesthesia for minor hand procedures, that&#xD;
      are tolerated well by patients (Winter). The technique can be quickly taught to even junior&#xD;
      residents, and does not require any specialized equipment outside of the ultrasound probe&#xD;
      (Winter). These blocks take roughly five minutes to perform, and anesthesia is achieved after&#xD;
      an additional five minutes, shorter than typical times for blind forearm nerve blocks&#xD;
      (Lovely).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the pain patients experience after 20 minutes of&#xD;
      tourniquet application with local anesthetic infiltration is not due to direct pressure on&#xD;
      the proximal arm, but rather distal digital ischemia pain. Previously, it has been shown that&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided regional block of the median, radial, and ulnar nerves in the forearm is&#xD;
      effective analgesia for awake hand surgery (Winter). Currently, there are no randomized&#xD;
      studies investigating if forearm nerve blocks can prolong pain-free tourniquet time compared&#xD;
      to local anesthesia infiltration, by blocking this ischemic pain in the distal arm. The&#xD;
      investigators' objective is therefore to determine if forearm nerve blocks prolong pain-free&#xD;
      tourniquet time compared to local anesthetic infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients over 18 years of age, with single meta-carpal or phalangeal fractures will be&#xD;
      considered for inclusion. These patients will be identified through femergency room consults,&#xD;
      referrals from outside centers, and attending surgeon clinics at the investigators'&#xD;
      institution. Currently, if patients require open-reduction internal fixation (ORIF) for these&#xD;
      injuries, they are then assessed for suitability for having their procedure while awake using&#xD;
      local anesthesia. Patients who are candidates for awake ORIFs will then be informed of the&#xD;
      research study by a resident, physician assistant, or attending physician, and have the&#xD;
      opportunity to consent to participation. This will not be done by a resident/physician&#xD;
      assistant/attending physician who will be performing or assisting with the procedure.&#xD;
      Patients who consent to participation will then be randomized to either the control or&#xD;
      intervention group. The study will be open-label as both the patient and resident/surgeon&#xD;
      will be aware of the type of block (forearm vs local) performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks and benefits associated with forearm and local anesthesia blocks will be explained&#xD;
      to the patient as part of the informed consent, prior to randomization. Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from attending physician clinics, however the staff screening patients for&#xD;
      eligibility and conducting informed consent will not be the individual who is either a)&#xD;
      performing the surgery, or b) collecting, analyzing, or interpreting the data. Patients will&#xD;
      have the remaining length of their clinic appointment to contemplate participation in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients in either group begin to experience pain during their procedure the tourniquet&#xD;
      will be taken down and the time will be recorded. Participants in both groups will receive&#xD;
      adequate analgesia, as additional local anesthetic will be administered if patients express&#xD;
      pain during the procedure. Total procedure time will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resident/physician performing the procedure will record the site of the fracture, type of&#xD;
      fixation used (i.e. lag screw, plate), duration of the entire procedure, type and amount of&#xD;
      local anesthetic used, and duration of pain-free tourniquet time. Any additional local&#xD;
      anesthetic required during the procedure will be recorded. Any deviations from the expected&#xD;
      procedure (i.e. need for osteotomy), or other intraoperative complications will also be&#xD;
      recorded. The Research Ethics Board (REB) will be notified of any harms to patients, as a&#xD;
      result of the study, occur. Any subsequent recommendations from the REB regarding study&#xD;
      termination will be followed. If any patients experience local anesthetic toxicity, sustain&#xD;
      nerve or blood vessel damage, or experience other intra-operative complications as a result&#xD;
      the study intervention(s), the study will be placed on hold until full review of the data is&#xD;
      complete, and terminated if appropriate. Patients who were involved of the study to date will&#xD;
      be contacted explaining the reason for termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, the resident involved in the procedure will provide the patient with the&#xD;
      survey questions. The individuals conducting the surveys will not otherwise be involved in&#xD;
      the study. This will be a two question survey recording the amount of pain felt during the&#xD;
      procedure and overall experience with their awake hand ORIF. Both questions will be scored on&#xD;
      a Numerical analogue scale (NAS) from 1-10. If the patient is unable to physical write due to&#xD;
      splinting of the dominant hand, the resident will record the answers verbalized by the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the study will be reviewed on a weekly basis. All complications will be noted. Any&#xD;
      major complication (resulting in harm or near-harm to a patient) will prompt review of the&#xD;
      study data to date for any further complications, including which group the participant(s)&#xD;
      experiencing the complication were assigned to.&#xD;
