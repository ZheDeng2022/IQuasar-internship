  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the preliminary&#xD;
      antineoplastic activity, safety and tolerability of HA121-28 tablets administered orally in&#xD;
      patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of approximately 30 patients with MTC will be enrolled. The patients will undergo a 3&#xD;
      weeks-on and 1week-off treatment scheme with HA121-28 tablets 600 mg orally once daily in the&#xD;
      28-day cycle until disease progression or intolerable toxic reaction, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
      During the administration of HA121-28 tablets, vital signs, physical examination, ECOG&#xD;
      performance status, hematology and chemistry test, ECG, adverse events and concomitant drugs&#xD;
      will be evaluated every four weeks, calcitonin and pregnancy test will be performed every 8&#xD;
      weeks. CT for tumor assessment will be performed every 8 weeks for the first year, and every&#xD;
      12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
