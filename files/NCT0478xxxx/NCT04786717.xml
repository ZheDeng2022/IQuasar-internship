  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbopelvic movement control is crucial for movement stability during weight loading&#xD;
      training, and also an important risk factor for the occurrence and recurrence of low back&#xD;
      pain (LBP). Previous studies indicated that athletes with LBP had poorer lumbopelvic movement&#xD;
      control, and the deficits in lumbopelvic control could be remained after LBP remission.&#xD;
      However, there has been no study investigating the effect of LBP history (LBPH) on the&#xD;
      performance of the loaded squatting task, and lumbopelvic movement control in people who&#xD;
      practice regular weight training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aims of this study are to examine the differences in lumbopelvic movement&#xD;
      control, kinematics and muscle activation during the loaded squatting task in weight training&#xD;
      practitioners with LBP, LBPH, and asymptomatic controls, to compare the cortical control&#xD;
      mechanisms between 3 types of motor control training strategies, and to investigate the&#xD;
      intervention effect of motor control training on restoring the lumbopelvic movement control&#xD;
      and squatting performance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lumbopelvic movement control is crucial for movement stability during high weight loading&#xD;
      training, and also an important risk factor for the occurrence and recurrence of low back&#xD;
      pain (LBP). Previous studies indicated that athletes with LBP had poorer lumbopelvic movement&#xD;
      control, and for those athletes who have recovered from LBP, some research data still showed&#xD;
      that poor lumbopelvic control remained. However, there has been no study investigating the&#xD;
      effect of LBP history (LBPH) on the performance of the loaded squatting task, and lumbopelvic&#xD;
      movement control in people who practice regular weight training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aims of this study are to examine the differences in lumbopelvic movement&#xD;
      control, kinematics and muscle activation during the loaded squatting task in weight training&#xD;
      practitioners with LBP, LBPH, and asymptomatic controls. In the next part of the study,&#xD;
      investigators will further investigate the intervention effect of motor control training on&#xD;
      restoring the lumbopelvic movement control and squatting performance. Methods: This is an&#xD;
      exploratory, cross-sectional, and intervention study. First part: investigators plan to&#xD;
      recruit 15 participants between 20-40 years old, practicing loaded squatting for 3 days a&#xD;
      week for at least one year or once a week for more than two years, and having LBPH; 15&#xD;
      matched participants with current LBP, and 15 controls for the study. All subjects will&#xD;
      undergo a series of squatting task (4 X 10 repetitions) and the kinematics and muscle&#xD;
      activation of the rectus abdominus, transverse abdominus/internal obliqus, eractor spinae,&#xD;
      and gluteus maximus will be recorded and analyzed using Noraxon myoRESEARCH (Noraxon U.S.A.,&#xD;
      Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA). A set of lumbopelvic movement control tests will also be&#xD;
      conducted. The kinematics, muscle activation, and movement control test scores will be&#xD;
      compared between groups. The second part, investigators plan to recruit 45 weight training&#xD;
      practitioners with LBPH, randomized into three groups (core muscle training, movement control&#xD;
      training, combined imagery and movement control training), and compare the effect of 4-week&#xD;
      training on squatting performance and lumbopelvic movement control. Statistical analysis:&#xD;
      Comparisons of all continuous variables are performed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA),&#xD;
      and the intervention effect will be assessed using the repeated measures ANOVA. Chi squared&#xD;
      test is used to examine the group differences in lumbopelvic movement control testing. The&#xD;
      significance level is set at 0.05.&#xD;

They will perform each lumbar movement control exercise in different position. Starting from the lying position, then progressing to sitting, standing with support, and the last level will be standing without support. Each set of movement will be practiced 10 times, totally 10 sets. It will take approximately 5~8 minutes to finish each movement. The subjects will learn 5~8 types of the movement every week.</description>
