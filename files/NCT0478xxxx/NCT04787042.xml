  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter Phase 1a open-label, dose escalation study, and a Phase 2 study of&#xD;
      ST-067. Phase 1a is a first-in-human (FIH) dose escalation study in patients aged 18 years or&#xD;
      older diagnosed with solid tumors who have exhausted available standard. Phase 2 will enroll&#xD;
      patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed with the following solid tumors: melanoma, renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma, triple negative breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the head and neck, and microsatellite instability-high tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1a is designed to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of ST-067 monotherapy using a&#xD;
      modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design. ST-067 is administered as subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection once weekly. Pre and on treatment biopsies will be mandated for all patients. There&#xD;
      will be evaluation of PK and PD effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will evaluate the preliminary efficacy of ST-067 administered at the RP2D to patients&#xD;
      with the following tumor types. A Simon 2 stage design is used to calculate the sample size&#xD;
      and early stopping rules will be employed in the event of lack of efficacy in any of the&#xD;
      cohorts. RECIST 1.1 will be used to assess tumor response every 8-12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Melanoma (n=28)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal cell carcinoma (n=25)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Triple-negative best cancer (n=25)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-small cell lung cancer (n=25)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (n=28)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MSI-Hi tumors (n=25)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed for each patient throughout the study.&#xD;
