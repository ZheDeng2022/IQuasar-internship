  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a new non-invasive imaging technology, called&#xD;
      Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT), can be used in the pre-operative setting to better&#xD;
      visualize the blood supply of reconstructive flaps used in Plastic Surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT) is a novel, non-invasive imaging technique which can&#xD;
      perform deep tissue imaging with high spatial resolution and optical contrast. The system&#xD;
      utilizes short-pulsed lasers to generate photoacoustic waves in biological tissues. These are&#xD;
      then detected by a 512-element full-ring transducer array, which allows for high spatial&#xD;
      resolution, especially in deep tissues. In addition, PACT utilizes diffuse optical&#xD;
      tomography, in which the light absorption of hemoglobin at visible or near-infrared&#xD;
      wavelengths, provides excellent contrast for the imaging of human vasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies of PACT imaging have evaluated this technique to image the human breast as an&#xD;
      alternative modality for breast cancer screening as well as to image human extremities for&#xD;
      the evaluation of vascular disease. The full-ring transducer array offers a significant&#xD;
      advantage in spatial resolution, especially in deep tissues, over the standard linear arrays&#xD;
      employed in the standard, widely-used handheld ultrasonic transducers. In addition, diffuse&#xD;
      optical tomography allows for strong vascular contrast over a large field of view without the&#xD;
      use of exogenous contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flap reconstructive surgery utilizes a patient's own soft tissues to recreate structures,&#xD;
      fill large soft tissue defects, provide joint coverage, or perform other reconstructive&#xD;
      operations. Examples of patients who would require flap reconstructive surgery include&#xD;
      patients undergoing mastectomies and patients who have suffered from trauma with significant&#xD;
      tissue loss. Tissue flaps have a defined blood supply which originate from the original site&#xD;
      of the tissue. The flap can be compromised if the arterial supply or venous drainage is&#xD;
      jeopardized during tissue transfer. Therefore, an accurate understanding of the blood supply&#xD;
      of the tissue flap is crucial for successful flap reconstructive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current pre-operative vascular imaging modalities for flap reconstructive surgery include&#xD;
      handheld Doppler ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and the gold standard&#xD;
      computed tomography angiography (CTA). Doppler ultrasonography is technician-dependent,&#xD;
      inaccurate, and lacks optical contrast. MRA is expensive, requires a lengthy imaging time,&#xD;
      and requires the administration of intravenous contrast. CTA is also expensive, also requires&#xD;
      the administration of intravenous contrast, and requires the administration of ionizing&#xD;
      radiation. PACT does not require the administration of intravenous contrast or ionizing&#xD;
      radiation, and provides excellent spatial resolution and optical contrast. Therefore, PACT&#xD;
      would be an optimal pre-operative vascular imaging modality for flap reconstructive surgery.&#xD;
