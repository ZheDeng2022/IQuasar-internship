    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase II study to evaluate efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, and pharmacokinetics characteristics of HA121-28 tablets in advanced biliary tract&#xD;
      cancer (BTC). A total of approximately 30 subjects with advanced BTC will be enrolled. The&#xD;
      subjects will undergo a 3 weeks-on and 1week-off treatment scheme with HA121-28 tablets 600&#xD;
      mg orally once daily in the 28-day cycle until disease progression or intolerable toxic&#xD;
      reaction, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
