  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, interventional, monocentric, prospective early feasibility study,&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the safety of implant and short-term integration into the tissue of the&#xD;
      YANG sensor. In addition, the set up will enable data collection which will be used to&#xD;
      develop the software algorithm to allow real-time, continuous measurement of glucose, ketone&#xD;
      and lactate levels in the interstitial fluid in adults with diabetes mellitus, in a future&#xD;
      version of the device.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>The YANG SENSOR is an active implantable device, for Real Time Continuous Glucose, Lactate and Ketone Measurement</intervention_name>
    <description>The YANG SENSOR is an active implantable device, that is intended to be implanted in the subcutaneous abdominal tissue, approximately 10mm below the skin. The SENSOR is battery powered. The battery is wirelessly recharged through the skin by the YANGEXD, using a charging coil ('Donut') applied to the skin with an adhesive patch at the level of the SENSOR. The 'Donut' also receives data from the sensor.</description>
