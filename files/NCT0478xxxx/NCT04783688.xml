  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, multiple models of Full Face Snorkel Mask (FFSM) have entered the retail market.&#xD;
      However, several fatalities have been reported to the non-profit agency Divers Alert Network&#xD;
      (DAN) for snorkelers who were using FFSMs, and most of these fatality reports have unclear or&#xD;
      unreported causes of death. This project is to determine the characteristics of the FFSMs&#xD;
      when they are in use by snorkelers. Volunteers will be asked to snorkel in a water tank while&#xD;
      breathing through several models of commercially available FFSM, one at at time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The scientific testing will take place in the water tank of Foxtrot chamber at the Duke&#xD;
      Center for Hyperbaric Medicine &amp; Environmental Physiology. This Center (referred to as &quot;Duke&#xD;
      Hyperbarics&quot;) has a long history of testing various aspects of undersea physiology and causes&#xD;
      of injury and death. Duke Hyperbarics will conduct the physical tests, and DAN (Divers Alert&#xD;
      Network) personnel will also supervise the scientific testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental test subjects will be divided into two categories. Before testing, both&#xD;
      categories will come in for a screening day, where they will go through the informed consent&#xD;
      process and be medically screened for safety to perform activity. For the first category of&#xD;
      subjects (Group A), five volunteer subjects will be recruited with no restrictions on age or&#xD;
      fitness level. An effort will be made to include representative test subjects from older age&#xD;
      ranges (&gt;35 years old) in this group. To ensure they can safely perform light activity, they&#xD;
      will be screened for cardiovascular disease, both by questionnaire and by a physical exam&#xD;
      during the screening day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group (Group B) will be age 18-40, non-smoking, and screened for fitness using a&#xD;
      physical exam and a VO2max test. The reason for these two groups is to ensure that a spectrum&#xD;
      of test subjects is examined across the comprehensive range of ages and fitness levels that&#xD;
      may participate in snorkeling as recreation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The testing will be designed to assess the function of the FFSMs produced by multiple brands&#xD;
      compared to each other as well as compared to conventional snorkels. Test subjects will be&#xD;
      positioned horizontally in warm water. They will be face-down on a bicycle ergometer,&#xD;
      grasping handlebars for stability. On the test day, each subject will undergo three test&#xD;
      procedures, using first a conventional snorkel then two different brands of FFSM while&#xD;
      pedaling the underwater bicycle. Group A will be asked to pedal at a rate that is comfortable&#xD;
      for them, while Group B will be given a targeted higher work rate to achieve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each FFSM test, the test subject will be asked to place the mask on themselves but&#xD;
      provided no further instruction. The pressure exerted by the mask on the forehead will also&#xD;
      be measured by placing a small, flexible, force-sensitive gauge between the skirt and the&#xD;
      skin (this gauge needs to be in place for only a few seconds and will be removed before&#xD;
      snorkeling). At the end of each test, the subjects will be asked to remove the FFSM quickly&#xD;
      in response to an audible or visual alarm that will appear three times at randomized&#xD;
      intervals. Their ability to remove the masks quickly will be timed.&#xD;
