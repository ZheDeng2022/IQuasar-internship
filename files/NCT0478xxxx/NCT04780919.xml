  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which we monitor&#xD;
      the effects of low-energy focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) in patients with&#xD;
      Achilles tendinopathy (AT). Participants will be randomly divided into two groups. ESWT&#xD;
      according to selected parameters will be applied to Group A. Group B will receive sham ESWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will have the same program. The research for one patient lasts a&#xD;
      total of 8 weeks (2 months) from the initial to the final examination. In the first week,&#xD;
      there will be a clinical examination by a physiotherapist, an ultrasonographic examination,&#xD;
      and the patient will complete a VISA-A questionnaire. At the end of the examination, the&#xD;
      patient will be randomly assigned to group A or B and receive the first application. For the&#xD;
      next 4 weeks, additional applications will be performed once a week. The interval between&#xD;
      individual applications should be at least 7 days. Thus, a total of 5 applications of ESWT or&#xD;
      sham ESWT will be performed. The final examination will take place 3 weeks after the last&#xD;
      application and will include the same procedures as for the initial examination.&#xD;

      session, there will be a clinical examination by a physiotherapist, which includes case&#xD;
      history questions, measuring range of motion (measured by weight-bearing lunge test),&#xD;
      functional loading tests (1-leg heel rise test, 1-leg hop test) and an ultrasonographic&#xD;
      examination (tendon cross section area and width at the maximal tendon antero-posterior width&#xD;
      place). In addition, the patient will complete a VISA-A questionnaire. At the end of the&#xD;
      initial session, the patient will be randomly assigned to group A or B and receive the first&#xD;
      application. For the next 4 weeks, additional applications will be performed once a week. The&#xD;
      interval between individual applications should be at least 7 days. Thus, a total of 5&#xD;
      applications of ESWT or sham ESWT will be performed. The final examination will take place 3&#xD;
      weeks after the last application and will include the same procedures as for the initial&#xD;
