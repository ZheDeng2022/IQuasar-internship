      BACKGROUND The activation of adaptive immune responses depends on dendritic cells (DCs) and&#xD;
      macrophages, myeloid cells of the innate immune system specialized in antigen presentation&#xD;
      and in the activation of T cells. This peculiarity of myeloid cells is fundamental not only&#xD;
      during diseases infectious but also in the context of cancer, as phagocytes pick up antigens&#xD;
      associated with cancer cells and present them to T cells within the tumor microenvironment or&#xD;
      in tumor-draining lymph nodes to obtain antitumor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, a positive correlation was observed between the overall tumor content of DC&#xD;
      and the survival of cancer patients with different tumors, as well as a better reactivity to&#xD;
      therapies based on the use of immunocheckpoint inhibitors (ICB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of different dendritic cell subtypes has recently been revealed, as well as a&#xD;
      specific adaptation of each subtype to the tumor environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a critical point since the functional heterogeneity of DCs, macrophages and T cells&#xD;
      in the tumor microenvironment is probably one of the factors responsible for the success or&#xD;
      failure of anticancer immunotherapies. ICB-based therapies have revolutionized the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with cancers, such as melanoma and lung cancer, but are currently only beneficial&#xD;
      to a minority of patients. Improving understanding of the tumor immune microenvironment is&#xD;
      the key to predicting clinical responses to existing therapies and possibly the development&#xD;
      of new immunotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE Myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages infiltrate many different&#xD;
      types of tumors and can exert an antitumor function by activating T and NK cells, or they can&#xD;
      carry out a pro-tumor activity by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibitory&#xD;
      molecules. The presence within the tumor of several conventional DC subtypes has been&#xD;
      associated with a better prognosis while a pro-tumor function has been proposed for&#xD;
      unconventional DCs such as CD14 + CD1c + DC. The presence of macrophages has been associated&#xD;
      with a protumoral action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the functional heterogeneity of myeloid cells and T cells&#xD;
      within the tumor microenvironment is one of the factors responsible for the success or&#xD;
      failure of antitumor immune responses. High resolution definition of myeloid cell subtypes&#xD;
      and tumor associated T cells, their phenotype, distribution within the tumor, as well as&#xD;
      their functional characteristics will help to understand the complexity of the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Upon collection, each sample will be identified and labeled with a unique ID.&#xD;
      The pathologist will sample the material and select the tissue that can be used for the&#xD;
      experiment after having taken all that is needed for diagnostic purposes. The research sample&#xD;
      will be placed in test tubes and kept on ice. It will then be sent to University of&#xD;
      Milano-Bicocca laboratory. The tumor will be cut into pieces and single cell suspensions will&#xD;
      be prepared with the human tumor dissociation kit and the gentleMACS ™ dissociator (Miltenyi&#xD;
      Biotech) according to the standard protocol. Cell suspensions will then be isolated by&#xD;
      density gradient centrifugation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will analyze approximately 60 patients for immunofluorescence studies and 4&#xD;
      patients for single cell transcriptomic analyzes (single cell RNA-seq). Single cell analysis&#xD;
      performed by 4 patients has already shown to be sufficient to identify different subtypes of&#xD;
      immune cells. Immune cells will be treated to obtain a cell suspension enriched in myeloid&#xD;
      cells. This will allow for accurate subtypes analysis of DC, macrophages and CD4 + T cells&#xD;
      and to identify even very rare populations that could be lost in unselected samples due to&#xD;
      dilution. The pre-sorting strategy will be based on the expression of CD45 and MHC class II&#xD;
      and on the absence of expression of CD3, CD19, CD56, Ly6G to exclude T, B, NK and&#xD;
      neutrophils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residual material will not be stored. It is assumed that patients will be enrolled and&#xD;
      analyzed over a 5-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 5 diifferent tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task1: Preparation and sequencing of the single cell RNA-seq library; Task 2: Single cell&#xD;
      RNA-seq bioinformatics analysis; Task 3: Flow cytometric analysis of the DC subtypes present&#xD;
      in the tumor microenvironment; Task 4: Spatial distributions of DC subtypes in the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment Task 5: Evaluation of the association between subtypes of myeloid cells&#xD;
      present in the tumor microenvironment and survival;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will end with the bioinformatics analysis of the data and the validation of them&#xD;
      through flow cytometric analyzes&#xD;

Comparisons between groups will be performed using t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) when more than two groups are compared.&#xD;
In case of rejection of the null hypothesis for the ANOVA tests, pairwise comparisons will be made using the Tukey method for checking the α error in the presence of multiple non-orthogonal comparisons. If the variables are not normally distributed, the corresponding non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon Mann Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis test) will be applied.&#xD;
Given the large number of tests performed, the positive false discovery rate (pFDR) method will be applied to take into account the multiplicity problem.</description>
