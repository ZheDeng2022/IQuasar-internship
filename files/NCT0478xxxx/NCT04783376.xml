  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current management of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) depends on the use of intensive&#xD;
      insulin therapy - either by insulin pump therapy or multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy -&#xD;
      and the use of carbohydrate counting to determine the mealtime bolus insulin dose according&#xD;
      the carbohydrate contents of each meal or snack. However, several studies reported that the&#xD;
      fat and protein contents of the meals can also affect the postprandial blood glucose levels&#xD;
      and result in delayed postprandial hyperglycemia especially after high fat and protein meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no widely accepted regimen to calculate insulin required for the fat and protein&#xD;
      contents of meals especially for patients using multiple daily injection regimen. This study&#xD;
      aims to find a better method to cover the increased insulin requirements following mixed fat&#xD;
      and protein meals. The study will compare the effect of splitting mealtime bolus insulin&#xD;
      doses into pre-meal and post-meal portions to the standard regimen which involve giving bolus&#xD;
      dose depending on carbohydrate content only with additional correction doses 2 to 3 hours&#xD;
      after the meal to compensate for the postprandial hyperglycemia induced by fat and protein&#xD;
      content of the meals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include children and adolescents aged 6 - 18 years, diagnosed with T1DM for at&#xD;
      least 1 year, using multiple daily injection regimen and carbohydrate counting. The study&#xD;
      participants will be admitted at the pediatric department, Sohag University Hospital for 1&#xD;
      week to adjust insulin doses. adjustments will be made to basal doses, insulin to&#xD;
      carbohydrate ratio (ICR), insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will have three test lunch meals on 3 consecutive days consumed at the&#xD;
      pediatric department, Sohag university hospital at 12 PM. The test meals will consist of two&#xD;
      slices of a deep pan pizza base topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella full fat soft cheese,&#xD;
      and minced beef. (weight: 150 g, carb. 40 g, fat: 15 g, protein: 20 g, total calories 360&#xD;
      kcal). The meal will be consumed within 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood glucose level before the meal should be between 80 to 150 mg/dl. Correction doses can&#xD;
      be given 3 hours before the test if needed to bring the blood glucose level to the desired&#xD;
      target range before the test meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be assigned to use each one of the following interventions on a separate&#xD;
      day in a random sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention A: the participant will have a mealtime bolus dose of fast-acting insulin&#xD;
           10 minutes before the meal representing 100% of the dose calculated according to the&#xD;
           carbohydrate content of the meal and the individual insulin to carbohydrate ratio (ICR).&#xD;
           If hyperglycemia (blood glucose level &gt;180 mg/dl) developed after 3 hours, the&#xD;
           participant will receive an additional correction dose of fast-acting insulin calculated&#xD;
           according to the individual insulin sensitivity factor (ISF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention B: the bolus insulin dose for the meal will be calculated according to the&#xD;
           carbohydrate content of the meal and the individual insulin to carbohydrate ratio (ICR)&#xD;
           and additional 30% of the calculated dose will added to cover the fat and protein&#xD;
           content of the meal. This total dose will be divided into 2 portions. A premeal portion&#xD;
           (60% of the total dose) will be given 10 minutes before the meal. The remaining 40% of&#xD;
           the total dose will be given 30 minutes after the premeal dose. Both doses will be given&#xD;
           as fast-acting insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention C: the bolus insulin dose for the meal will be calculated according to the&#xD;
           carbohydrate content of the meal and the individual insulin to carbohydrate ratio (ICR)&#xD;
           and additional 30% of the calculated dose will added to cover the fat and protein&#xD;
           content of the meal. This total dose will be divided into 2 portions. A premeal portion&#xD;
           (60% of the total dose) will be given 10 minutes before the meal as fast-acting insulin.&#xD;
           The remaining 40% of the total dose will be given 30 minutes after the premeal dose as&#xD;
           regular insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types of insulin: insulin lispro (Humalog 100 IU/mL) as fast-acting insulin and regular&#xD;
      insulin (Humulin R) as regular insulin (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA).&#xD;
      Insulin doses will be calculated, splitted, approximated to the nearest 0.5 unit and given&#xD;
      using Humapen Luxura half- unit increments insulin pens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capillary blood glucose level will be measured by a calibrated finger-prick blood glucose&#xD;
      meter before the meals and every hour for the next 6 hours after the test meals. Moreover,&#xD;
      venous blood glucose and serum cholesterol and triglycerides levels will be measured 3 hours&#xD;
      after the test meals.&#xD;
