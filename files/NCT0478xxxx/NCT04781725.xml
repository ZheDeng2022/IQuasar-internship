  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, multi-center, parallel design, window of opportunity trial&#xD;
      evaluating intratumoral INT230-6 in up to 90 patients with early stage breast cancer. In a&#xD;
      2:1 randomization, patients on the treatment arm will receive intratumoral INT230-6&#xD;
      injections prior to breast surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study comprises 2 consecutive parts. The first part will be to test safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of the dosing procedures. Results from Part I of the study will standardise the&#xD;
      optimal dose and frequency of INT230-6 for participants in Part II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: Open-label 2:1 randomized study of up to 30 patients. Treatment arm patients will be&#xD;
      given up to 3 doses of INT230-6 injected weekly prior to breast surgery, at a dose based on&#xD;
      longest diameter. The control arm patients receive no treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Double-blind, 2:1 randomized study of up to an additional 60 patients. The placebo&#xD;
      arm includes a saline injection of similar dose and frequency as the treatment arm (up to 2&#xD;
      doses of INT230-6/saline injected weekly prior to breast surgery).&#xD;
