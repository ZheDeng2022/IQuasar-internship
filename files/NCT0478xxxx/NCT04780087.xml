  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the increase in numbers of women who engage in heavy, free-weight resistance exercise&#xD;
      training (e.g. powerlifting, weightlifting, cross fit), the knowledge on how such exercise&#xD;
      may affect fertility, pregnancy and birth outcomes is poor. Based on observational and&#xD;
      associational studies of pregnant women in labour, recommendations are not to lift more than&#xD;
      11 kg in external load after mid-term, or to lift more than a total of 100 kg during a day.&#xD;
      Ignoring such recommendations is associated to increased risk of miscarriage and&#xD;
      preeclampsia, and of low birthweight and premature birth, respectively. As such, fit women&#xD;
      who continue to exercise during pregnancy, are met with scepticism and warnings, resulting in&#xD;
      shame and insecurity. Such attitudes may also result in physical inactivity during pregnancy,&#xD;
      being on the contrary of what is recommended for a healthy pregnancy and delivery. Elite&#xD;
      athletes may additionally be deprived from an early return to sport if not being able to keep&#xD;
      exercise intensity close to pre-pregnancy period. With poor knowledge on how fit, strong&#xD;
      women respond to high external loads during pregnancy exercise, recommendations are to follow&#xD;
      the general guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this observational study, is to explore how regular resistance exercise training&#xD;
      may affect fertility, and how high external loads in resistance exercise training during&#xD;
      pregnancy in resistance trained women affect; a)their pregnancy and birth outcome, and&#xD;
      b)health of the women and their children up to 12 months post-delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women who are experienced in heavy, free-weight resistance exercise training, and&#xD;
      who choose to continue their exercise regimes during pregnancy, are recruited in social media&#xD;
      to regularly respond to an online questionnaire on personal health, foetus development, and&#xD;
      the newborn child health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reference group of pregnant women being regularly physical active (still not lifting free&#xD;
      weights of high loads) are concurrently recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All will respond to questionnaire at mid-term, and week 23, 30 and 40 of pregnancy. During&#xD;
      maternity leave the women will be asked to respond to questionnaires at 1 month, 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months and 12 months post-delivery.&#xD;
