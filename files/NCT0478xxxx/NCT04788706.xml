      ABSTRACT Objectives: To investigate the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) application&#xD;
      combined with Russian Electrical Stimulation on pain, mobility, functionality, range of&#xD;
      motion, muscular strength, and activity in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized controlled double-blind study. Setting: Specialist Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Services. Participants: Eighty participants with knee osteoarthritis were randomized.&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants were randomized into four groups: Group I (n=20; LLLT over three&#xD;
      weeks followed by an eight-week receiving Russian electrical stimulation), Group II (n=20;&#xD;
      Placebo laser over three weeks followed by an eight-week receiving Russian electrical&#xD;
      stimulation), Group III (n=20; LLLT over three weeks followed by an eight-week receiving LLLT&#xD;
      application combined with Russian electrical stimulation), Group IV (n=20; Placebo laser over&#xD;
      three weeks followed by an eight-week receiving Placebo laser application combined with&#xD;
      Russian electrical stimulation). The groups treated with LLLT received treatments with&#xD;
      invisible infrared laser (904 nm, 3 Joules/point). The Placebo groups received identical&#xD;
      treatment, but the infrared laser output was disabled. The sessions occurred three times a&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the change in knee pain and functionality&#xD;
      (Lequesne). Secondary outcomes included change in mobility (8 meters and Timed Up and Go&#xD;
      test), range of motion (goniometer), muscular strength (dynamometer), activity (Western&#xD;
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis questionnaire) and medication intake.&#xD;

    <description>were evaluated by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test19 and the 8-meter walk test.20 The TUG test, a measure of functional mobility, quantifies in seconds the time that the individual needs to stand up from a chair, walk 3m, turn back toward the chair and sit down again. The 8-meter walk test measures the time and number of steps required for a person to walk 8m.</description>

    <measure>Muscular strength</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months from baseline (follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>was estimated at maximal isometric force for the quadriceps, using a portable dynamometer (Lafayette, USA). Under stabilized conditions, patients, sitting with knees flexed at 60 (measured by a goniometer),21 were asked to extend the legs as far as they could. Three trials were conducted, and the mean value was obtained.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months from baseline (follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>was measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) questionnaire,22 which is self-administered and measures pain, frozen joints and physical activity. Increased scores suggest decreased activity.</description>
