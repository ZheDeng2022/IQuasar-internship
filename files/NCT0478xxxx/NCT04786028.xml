      This is a phase II multi-center, open label, single arm study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of Isatuximab administered intravenously in combination with CyBorD induction&#xD;
      treatment and Lenalidomide maintenance treatment in a 28-day long cycle in autologous stem&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multicenter, open label, single arm study that will evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of Isatuximab administered intravenously at 10 mg/kg in combination with CyBorD&#xD;
      induction treatment and Lenalidomide maintenance treatment in a 28-day long cycle in&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplant-eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The induction treatment consists of four cycles of Isa-CyBorD. Isatuximab will be given on&#xD;
      days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 of cycle 2-4 in combination with&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide at 300 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, Bortezomib at 1.5 mg/m2 on days 1, 8,&#xD;
      15 and 22 and Dexamethasone at 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the induction phase, all subjects achieving at least stable disease will have stem&#xD;
      cell mobilization per standard institutional procedures. This is followed by high dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy (Melphalan 200 mg/m2) and autologous stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ((If, for unexpected logistical reason, there is a foreseen delay of stem cell mobilization&#xD;
      or transplantation of more than eight weeks after the end of cycle four of induction, an&#xD;
      additional cycle of Isa-CyBorD can be given at the investigator's discretion.))&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maintenance treatment consisting of Isatuximab at 10 mg/kg administered intravenously on&#xD;
      days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of cycle 1, days 1 and 15 of cycle 2 and 3 and day 1 all subsequent&#xD;
      28-day maintenance cycles in combination with Lenalidomide administered orally at 10 mg on&#xD;
      days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle will be administered starting at day 100 (+/- 7 days) after&#xD;
      the transplant. Lenalidomide, if tolerated well, will be increased to 15 mg starting with&#xD;
      cycle 3.&#xD;
