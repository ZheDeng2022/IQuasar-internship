    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to quantify and compare the serum amino acid profile, and muscle&#xD;
      protein synthesis rates, in response to consuming isonitrogenous amounts of ground meat (beef&#xD;
      and pork) or plant-based alternatives -(soy and pea protein-based patties).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 1: Describe the post-prandial amino acid profile in serum in the 3 hours&#xD;
      following consumption of the following four burger patties, in quantities calculated to&#xD;
      deliver 20 grams of protein: ground beef, ground pork, Beyond Meat® burger, and tofu burger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 2: Compare the ability of these four different foods to activate mTORC1 and&#xD;
      protein synthesis in muscle.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit will be a brief meeting conducted over Zoom with one of the investigators&#xD;
      (Karine Schaal), who will go over the study details with the volunteer, answer their&#xD;
      questions, and obtain informed consent. Subjects will sign the informed consent&#xD;
      electronically, using DocuSign. Subjects will be given a copy of their signed informed&#xD;
      consent form. A paper copy of the consent form will be kept in a locked file cabinet in the&#xD;
      office of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study volunteers will come to the CTSC Clinical Research Center (CCRC) on four separate&#xD;
      occasions. The CCRC is located in the Cypress Building adjacent to the UC Davis Medical&#xD;
      Center (2221 Stockton Blvd, Suite D, Sacramento CA 95817).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four study visits will be test visits scheduled over a two week period (i.e. twice per&#xD;
      week for 2 weeks), at the same time in the morning following and overnight (&gt; 12 hour) fast.&#xD;
      They will be asked to refrain from vigorous exercise, caffeine, nicotine and alcohol for 24&#xD;
      hours prior to each visit. Female volunteers will be asked to schedule their study visits&#xD;
      within the first two weeks of their menstrual cycle (starting on the first day of menstrual&#xD;
      bleeding), in order to control for ovarian hormone fluctuations which may impact digestion&#xD;
      and metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the CCRC on the first test visit, each volunteer's height and weight will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Baseline blood draw. Subjects will then be placed in individual testing rooms, equipped&#xD;
      with a reclining phlebotomy armchair. A registered nurse or nurse practitioner will insert a&#xD;
      22G catheter in a forearm vein and an initial 3.5 mL baseline blood sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Test meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline blood sample is collected, subjects will consume one of the following four&#xD;
      burgers in isonitrogenous amounts to deliver 20 g of protein:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  106g ground beef patty (85% lean + 15% fat)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  118g ground pork (72.5% lean + 27.5% fat)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  113g Beyond Meat® patty&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  113g tofu patty&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each food will be weighed before cooking. The beef, pork and Beyond® burgers will be grilled&#xD;
      on an indoor electric grill until internal temperature reaches 165°F to comply with the USDA&#xD;
      Recommendations for Food Safety (beef and pork, minimum 160°F) and manufacturer instructions&#xD;
      (Beyond Meat®). Tofu burgers are pre-cooked and will be warmed by grilling for 2 minutes, per&#xD;
      manufacturer recommendations. The internal temperature of the burgers will be monitored using&#xD;
      a meat thermometer. The burgers will be served to the volunteers as soon as they are finished&#xD;
      cooking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to consume each patty without buns or condiments within a 10 minute&#xD;
      period, and instructed to chew thoroughly. They will also be asked to drink a 6 ounce glass&#xD;
      of water with the meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Postprandial blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consumption of the test meal, the participants will remain at the research site, in&#xD;
      their individual testing room, for another 3 hours, sitting quietly - they may bring books or&#xD;
      electronic devices to pass the time. Five more blood samples of 3.5 mL each will be obtained&#xD;
      at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes after the test meal, totaling six blood draws of 3.5mL per&#xD;
      visit (21mL per visit), and 84 mL of blood drawn in total for each subject completing the&#xD;
      entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected in 3.5 mL serum separating tubes. Approximately 50 microliters of&#xD;
      whole-blood will be used to measure blood glucose within 5 minutes of the draw. The rest will&#xD;
      be allowed to clot for 1hr before centrifugation at 1000 x g for 10 minutes.The serum will be&#xD;
      frozen and kept at -80°C until processed. 100 microliters of each serum sample will be used&#xD;
      for determining amino acid concentrations by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at&#xD;
      the UC Davis Proteomics Core. Another 100 microliters will be used to measure insulin&#xD;
      concentrations via enzyme-linked immunoassay. The rest of the serum will be used for&#xD;
      developing the mTORC1 bioassay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order in which subjects receive each test meal will be randomized to avoid any order&#xD;
      effect, and at least a two-day washout period will be given between visits.&#xD;
