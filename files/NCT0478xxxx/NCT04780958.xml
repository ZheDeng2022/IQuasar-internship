  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinol and retinol binding protein were studied in the umbilical cord blood of 44 preterm&#xD;
      infants with gestation age of &lt; 30 weeks. Serum retinol and RBP levels were determined by&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The rate of transplacental retinol passage was calculated.&#xD;
      The demographic data of mother and baby, vitamin use in the mother, antenatal steroid&#xD;
      application and diseases diagnosed during pregnancy were recorded. An evaluation was made of&#xD;
      the retinol, RBP and factors of the mother and baby affecting the transplacental retinol&#xD;
      passage. The relationship between retinol and retinol binding protein levels and neonatal&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity was investigated.&#xD;

      Study Population Babies born at this hospital with a gestational week of &lt;30 were included in&#xD;
      the study. Patients were excluded in the presence of a major abnormality or known congenital&#xD;
      metabolic disease in the mother or baby, and the presence of chronic liver, kidney or&#xD;
      gastrointestinal system disease in the mother, or if the family did not give consent. A&#xD;
      record was made of the gender and birth weight of the babies and gestation week, maternal&#xD;
      age, gravidity, status of vitamin intake and use of vitamin A during pregnancy, and antenatal&#xD;
      steroid administration in the mothers. A record was made of the presence of early membrane&#xD;
      rupture (EMR) diagnosed during the present pregnancy of the mother, preeclampsia/eclampsia,&#xD;
      pregnancy-induced hypertension, urinary infection, gestational diabetes mellitus and anemia,&#xD;
      if present. We recorded also neonatal mortality and morbidity such as respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage,&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling and Test Study Method Umbilical cord blood was drawn at birth in all babies included&#xD;
      in the study by experienced individuals using a vacutainer. Approximately 6 ml of venous&#xD;
      blood was also drawn from the antecubital region of the mothers immediately after the birth&#xD;
      in a biochemistry tube, and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4500 rpm after the completion of&#xD;
      coagulation, and the sera were separated. Serum samples were frozen and stored at -80° until&#xD;
      the analysis was performed. For the analysis, serum samples were thawed in appropriate&#xD;
      circumstances and all analyzes were performed at the Medical Biochemistry Laboratory of&#xD;
      Atatürk University at a single session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the serum samples, the retinol levels were analyzed using ELISA kits from the Bioassay&#xD;
      Technology Laboratory ( E1548 Hu Jiaxing, Zhejiang, China), RBP levels were analyzed using&#xD;
      ELISA kits of Elabscience (E-EL-H1581 Texas USA) following the standard protocol suggested by&#xD;
      the manufacturer at the Dynex automated ELISA reading device (Dynex Technologies&#xD;
      Headquarters, Chantilly, USA). The measurement range of the kit for retinol and RBP was&#xD;
      2ng/ml- 800 ng/ml and 0,07 - 100 ng/mL, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formula &quot;umbilical cord retinol/maternal retinol x100&quot; was used for the calculation of&#xD;
      placental retinol passage rate in order to show the percentage of maternal retinol passing to&#xD;
      the umbilical cord .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinol deficiency was evaluated according to the WHO data. A level of &lt; 20 µg/dl was&#xD;
      accepted as a deficiency. The level of deficiency was accepted as &lt; 200 ng/ml since the unit&#xD;
      used in this present study was ng/ml.&#xD;
