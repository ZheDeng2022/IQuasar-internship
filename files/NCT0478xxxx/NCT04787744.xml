      The primary goal of this study is to determine if adding PET-directed local therapy improves&#xD;
      disease control compared to standard systemic therapy alone in Veterans with oligorecurrent&#xD;
      prostate cancer on PET/CT. The investigators will conduct a multi-institutional phase II/III&#xD;
      randomized trial comparing SST with or without PET-directed local therapy using radiation or&#xD;
      surgery to all metastases and if a local recurrence is present.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate Cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among Veterans, comprising 30% of new&#xD;
      cancer diagnoses in the VA. Eighty-five percent of men present with localized prostate&#xD;
      cancer, which is typically treated with active surveillance or curative local therapy using&#xD;
      surgery or radiation therapy. Unfortunately, twenty percent of Veterans undergoing curative&#xD;
      local therapy will develop metastatic recurrence. These men typically receive palliative&#xD;
      systemic hormonal therapy to control the participants disease. Despite this, over half of men&#xD;
      will have cancer progression within 1-2 years and half will die within 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two diverging paradigms have been studied in recent years to improve the survival of men with&#xD;
      recurrent metastatic prostate cancer. First, a subset of patients has oligorecurrent disease,&#xD;
      defined as 1-5 sites of metastases. These patients are hypothesized to have an intermediate&#xD;
      clinical state in which ablative local therapy with surgery or radiation to all metastatic&#xD;
      sites of disease (metastasis-directed therapy; MDT) can lead to durable disease control and&#xD;
      potentially cure in select patients. Recent Phase II randomized trials have demonstrated&#xD;
      improved long-term progression-free survival with MDT in the absence of systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, 75% of patients receiving MDT for oligorecurrent cancer develop progression in new&#xD;
      areas, arguing that systemic therapy is needed to treat occult metastases. This is supported&#xD;
      by data demonstrating that earlier palliative hormonal therapy is associated with improved&#xD;
      survival. In fact, the second approach that has been studied in recent years, is whether&#xD;
      escalating hormonal therapy by adding novel androgen receptor axis targeted agents or&#xD;
      chemotherapy improves outcomes in men with metastatic prostate cancer. Multiple phase III&#xD;
      randomized trials demonstrate that escalating hormonal therapy with these novel therapeutic&#xD;
      agents improves progression-free survival and overall survival dramatically. Therefore, these&#xD;
      agents have been integrated as an option into today's standard systemic therapy (SST) for&#xD;
      metastatic recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the promise of MDT to induce long-term cancer control and the effectiveness of SST to&#xD;
      prevent further cancer progression, there is an urgent need to determine whether adding MDT&#xD;
      to SST improves disease outcomes further. Additionally, prior studies have excluded patients&#xD;
      with local recurrence. However, these comprise a large proportion of Veterans with&#xD;
      oligorecurrent prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the investigators study is to determine if adding PET-directed local&#xD;
      therapy (treatment of local recurrence on PET/CT and/or MDT) improves disease control&#xD;
      compared to SST alone in Veterans with oligorecurrent prostate cancer. The investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a multi-institutional phase II/III randomized trial comparing SST with or without&#xD;
      PET-directed local therapy. Other goals of the study are to determine any differences in&#xD;
      patterns of cancer progression, survival, and quality of life. The investigators also will&#xD;
      determine if certain mutations present in tumor DNA can predict if Veterans will benefit from&#xD;
      PET-directed local therapy and encourage banking of tumor tissues for future analyses in a&#xD;
      separate tumor registry study (VA MAPP).&#xD;

             must be a candidate for salvage local therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  The imaging studies required for enrollment were performed within 90 days prior&#xD;

             local therapy that will lead to prohibitively high risk of toxicity from subsequent&#xD;
