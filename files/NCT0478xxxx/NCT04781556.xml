  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by a decrease in bone density with deterioration&#xD;
      of the micro-architecture and the appearance of bone fragility, responsible for an increased&#xD;
      risk of fractures. The most common osteoporotic fractures are spinal, wrist and femoral neck&#xD;
      fractures. Osteoporosis affects 22.7% of women and 6.9% of men in France. Each year, around&#xD;
      8.9 million fragility fractures are identified worldwide, with an incidence in France in 2017&#xD;
      of 382,000 patients in France in 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The economic impact, the functional consequences and the quality of life of patients with&#xD;
      osteoporosis, fracture or not, have been widely described in the literature in recent years.&#xD;
      There is indeed a great alteration in the mobility, functional capacities and overall quality&#xD;
      of life of these patients, measured by composite scores such as Short Form-36 (SF-36),&#xD;
      EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) , the Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), or more&#xD;
      specifically for osteoporosis, osteoporososis quality of life questionnaire (OQLQ) or its&#xD;
      shortened version OLQ, the osteoporosis assessment questionnaire (OPAQ), the Quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO) (specific for vertebral&#xD;
      fractures), etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, few studies have focused on the repercussions of osteoporotic fractures at work,&#xD;
      because this pathology affects more elderly subjects (&gt; 65 years old) and therefore retirees.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      New osteoporosis management programs have emerged in recent years, in order to improve the&#xD;
      management of this pathology by linking the specialties concerned. Among them, La Filière&#xD;
      Fracture (in Anglo-Saxon: Fractures Liaisons Services: FLS) of the Paris Saint-Joseph&#xD;
      Hospital Group (GHPSJ), created in 2015, aims to follow up patients consulting the GHPSJ for&#xD;
      an osteoporotic fracture of spinal location. , the upper end of the femur or the lower end of&#xD;
      the radius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the creation of the sector, 2,486 patients have been recruited; it was found that in&#xD;
      529 of these patients (or 21.3%), the osteoporotic fracture occurred at an age of less than&#xD;
      65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact on the work of an osteoporotic fracture has been little studied in the literature:&#xD;
      a study focused specifically on fractures of the upper extremity of the femur, and found, in&#xD;
      291 patients under 65 years recruited between 2009 and 2013, a 65% return to work rate at 12&#xD;
      months, or around a third of patients who have not returned to professional activity at one&#xD;
      year. A study published in 2016 assessed return to work delay and factors associated with&#xD;
      return to work in 275 patients with fragility fractures in Canada; 88% had returned to work&#xD;
      with an average absenteeism period of 20.5 days. The average duration of presenteeism&#xD;
      (presence at work but with reduced productivity due to the fracture) was 2.9 hours in 4&#xD;
      weeks. Another Japanese study found a risk ratio of 4 (p &lt;0.001) to greater absenteeism in&#xD;
      patients with several osteoporotic fractures, with no difference found in terms of&#xD;
      productivity at work compared to patients with a history of a single fracture or without&#xD;
      history of osteoporotic fracture. The female sex, the need for surgical management, the&#xD;
      existence of work with the need to carry heavy loads were associated with a prolonged return&#xD;
      to work time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective here is to assess the occupational impact of osteoporotic fractures occurring&#xD;
      in active patients under 65 years of age, and to look for factors predicting a return to work&#xD;
      within 3 months after the fracture.&#xD;
