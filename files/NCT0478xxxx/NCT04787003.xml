      immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) or atezolizumab&#xD;
      (anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody) in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      (OVV-01 combined with PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody dose gradient exploration);&#xD;

      Phase Ia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm investigator-initiated clinical&#xD;
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intratumoral injection of OVV-01 injection in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to enroll in 1 ~ 3 study sites nationwide about 9 ~ 18 patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors for whom the standard treatment failed and currently no standard&#xD;
      treatment is available or standard treatment is not suitable due to medical reasons, to&#xD;
      conduct a phase Ia study, i.e., the First in Human (FIH) trial of OVV-01 injection, using the&#xD;
      traditional &quot;3 + 3&quot; approach for dose gradient exploration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm investigator-initiated clinical&#xD;
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intratumoral injection of OVV-01 injection&#xD;
      combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to enroll in 1 ~ 3 study sites nationwide about 12 ~ 24 patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors for whom the standard treatment failed and currently no standard&#xD;
      treatment is available or standard treatment is not suitable due to medical reasons, to&#xD;
      conduct a phase Ib study, using the traditional &quot;3 + 3&quot; approach and based on the phase Ia&#xD;
      results, 2 dose gradients of OVV-01 are used in combination with pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      atezolizumab, respectively, to explore the efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm investigator-initiated clinical&#xD;
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intratumoral injection of OVV-01 injection&#xD;
      combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to enroll in 1 ~ 3 study sites nationwide about 15 ~ 20 patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors for whom the standard treatment failed and currently no standard&#xD;
      treatment is available or standard treatment is not suitable due to medical reasons, to&#xD;
      conduct a phase Ic study.&#xD;
