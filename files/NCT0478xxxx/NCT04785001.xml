      By combining the usual care of patients eligible for spinal cord stimulation (SME) with&#xD;
      measurements of the HRV index (Heart Rate Variability), objective measurements of activity&#xD;
      (number of steps, quality of sleep) and measurements of connectivity obtained by anatomical&#xD;
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the collection of preliminary data&#xD;
      necessary for the analysis of markers correlated with the efficiency of stimulation will be&#xD;
      possible. Ultimately, these markers could be used to optimize the perioperative management of&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The rebellious chronic neuropathic pain of the lower limbs (including the sequelae&#xD;
      lumbosciatica) causes a major functional repercussion and an impairment of the quality of&#xD;
      life. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is offered when other treatments are ineffective or&#xD;
      insufficient (K. Kumar et al., 2007). This technique has been used in routine care for over&#xD;
      20 years, with a well-established clinical benefit for these indications, and recognized by&#xD;
      HAS (see 2014 recommendations in appendix 1). Moreover, recent technical progress has made it&#xD;
      possible to provide better user comfort for implanted patients, in particular with new&#xD;
      stimulation methods that best adapt to the activities and feelings of the patients (De Ridder&#xD;
      &amp; Vanneste, 2016; V . Kumar et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic objectives defined between the candidate patient for EMS and the Pain team&#xD;
      are part of a personalized rehabilitation and reintegration process. This is to reduce the&#xD;
      pain felt by the patient but also the functional impact, by gradually resuming activity,&#xD;
      taking into account the specific situation of each patient. Functional limitation depends on&#xD;
      several factors, such as exercise deconditioning but also fear of movement that is essential&#xD;
      to assess in patients who are candidates for EMS. Patient care involves an assessment made by&#xD;
      a trained multi-professional team in which the role of the pain coordinator (IDEC) is&#xD;
      central, with therapeutic education work through regular physical and telephone&#xD;
      consultations. Self-administered questionnaires analyzing functional abilities, quality of&#xD;
      life and pain are currently being used for the pre- and post-operative assessment of patients&#xD;
      undergoing EMS. Although they are a diagnostic and decision-making tool, they nevertheless&#xD;
      correspond to a subjective assessment of the patient of his abilities as he sees them, and&#xD;
      not to an assessment of his actual objective abilities. Thus, despite the technical progress&#xD;
      represented by the new stimulation methods, the perioperative assessment of patients treated&#xD;
      for EMS lacks personalized tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent development of technological tools that are easy to use on a daily basis, such as&#xD;
      activity trackers and smartwatches, is an attractive option in chronic pathologies, but still&#xD;
      insufficiently used in current medical practice. A review of the literature has shown the&#xD;
      value of the use of activity trackers, particularly in postoperative follow-up and functional&#xD;
      rehabilitation (Appelboom et al., 2016), and in low back pain patients (GORDON &amp; BLOXHAM,&#xD;
      2017 ). Another study evaluating the data collected by an actimeter integrated into a&#xD;
      stimulation generator compared to the patient's verbal report on his activities reports an&#xD;
      overestimation of the functional impact by patients in self-evaluation (Goudman et al.,&#xD;
      2018). Likewise, a study on the evaluation of the quality of sleep highlighted a difference&#xD;
      between the feelings reported by the patient, the self-questionnaires and the data recorded&#xD;
      in polysomnography (Jaeger et al., 2019), with a trend to increase sleep disorders. All of&#xD;
      these studies confirm the limits in terms of the reliability of declarative data and the need&#xD;
      for objective measures to assess the symptoms of patients in chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, some of these devices have recently made it possible to evaluate the vmHRV&#xD;
      (vagally-mediated Heart Rate Variability) index (Hernando et al., 2018). This physiological&#xD;
      index has been studied for MOTIVE_Protocole_v1_20200610 HBD_2020_23 IDRCB 2020-A01731-38&#xD;
      11/40 several years, and has shown its interest in various chronic pathologies such as&#xD;
      depression, cardiovascular pathologies, fibromyalgia (Kemp et al., 2010). Thus, compared to&#xD;
      healthy control subjects, patients with chronic pain have a decreased vmHRV index linked to&#xD;
      lower vagal activity (Koenig et al., 2016). In addition, in chronic pain patients, a&#xD;
      correlation was observed between taking analgesics, the impact of pain on daily life and a&#xD;
      significantly reduced vmHRV index. Moreover, patients with little relief from drug treatment&#xD;
      had the lowest vmHRV index (Koenig et al., 2015), thus showing a link between this index and&#xD;
      the severity of chronic pain, its daily impact, l effectiveness of drug treatment. Likewise,&#xD;
      a correlation has been demonstrated between the degree of catastrophization of pain in&#xD;
      patients and the vmHRV index (Koenig et al., 2016). Finally, a recent review of the imaging&#xD;
      data associated with the measurement of the HRV index suggests a link between functional&#xD;
      connectivity and the activity of certain brain regions (ventral striatum, anterior cingulate&#xD;
      cortex, medial pre-frontal cortex, putamen ), the ability to manage stress and emotions, and&#xD;
      the HRV index (Thayer et al., 2012), thus proposing a neurovisceral integration model. The&#xD;
      vmHRV index can therefore be considered as an objective marker in the assessment of emotional&#xD;
      and physiological coping skills in a patient with chronic pain. This aspect is crucial in the&#xD;
      evaluation and management of these patients, and more particularly when an invasive therapy&#xD;
      is envisaged such as EMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the development of certain imaging sequences makes it possible to study the&#xD;
      anatomical (diffusion tensor sequences: DTI) and functional (functional MRI sequences)&#xD;
      connectivity in regions of interest in patients, in particular at rest (Fox &amp; Raichle, 2007).&#xD;
      During nociceptive stimulation, the functional activation of certain regions of interest was&#xD;
      demonstrated, grouped together under the term &quot;pain matrix&quot;: insula, primary and secondary&#xD;
      somatosensory cortex, thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, pre- frontal, tonsil and&#xD;
      peri-acqueductal gray matter (Apkarian et al., 2005; Leknes &amp; Tracey, 2008). Chronic pain&#xD;
      alters the functioning of neural circuits in these regions, leading to changes in&#xD;
      connectivity and activity observable in neuroimaging (Baliki et al., 2012; Wood et al.,&#xD;
      2007). A prospective study conducted in 39 patients has also shown the predictive character&#xD;
      of some of these changes during the chronicization of pain in a cohort of patients suffering&#xD;
      from subacute low back pain (Baliki et al., 2012): patients developing pain patients (which&#xD;
      lasts beyond 6 months) immediately presented an alteration in the functioning of the neural&#xD;
      circuits involved in motivation, with a stronger anatomical and functional connectivity&#xD;
      between the nucleus accumbens and the medial pre-frontal cortex, compared to the patients&#xD;
      recovering from the subacute episode. Since then, other studies have suggested a link between&#xD;
      the process of pain chronicization and changes in the anatomical and functional connectivity&#xD;
      of cortico-striated circuits involved in cognitive and motivational aspects (Navratilova &amp;&#xD;
      Porreca, 2014). Activation of the meso-limbic motivational and reward circuit has also been&#xD;
      shown to be involved in the perception of pain relief (Leknes et al., 2011; Navratilova et&#xD;
      al., 2012; Seymour et al., 2005) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of these new cardiac markers (HRV), radiological (anatomical and functional&#xD;
      connectivity in MRI) and activity (connected watch) in the management of patients eligible&#xD;
      for stimulation medullary will be evaluate. The use of a connected watch continuously&#xD;
      measuring activity (number of steps, distance covered), sleep (duration of deep and light&#xD;
      sleep, number of nocturnal awakenings), and the HRV index could provide an objective&#xD;
      assessment and complementary to the self-questionnaires and the usual interviews. The MRI&#xD;
      profile of anatomical and functional connectivity in the regions of interest linked to&#xD;
      chronic pain and motivation in patients treated for EMS, would allow to seek a link between&#xD;
      functional outcome, motivation and the ability to adapt and manage stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By combining the usual care of patients eligible for an EMS with measurements of the HRV&#xD;
      index, objective measurements of activity (number of steps, quality of sleep), and&#xD;
      connectivity measurements obtained on MRI, the collection of preliminary data to identify&#xD;
      markers correlated with the effectiveness of EMS will be possible. Ultimately, these markers&#xD;
      could be used to optimize the perioperative management of these patients.&#xD;
