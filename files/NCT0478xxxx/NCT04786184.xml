  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is part of a phased approach to refine, optimize, and test the feasibility of CALM&#xD;
      Breathing. Preliminary participant feedback from our CART (Capnography-Assisted Respiratory&#xD;
      Therapy) study was applied to adapt and design CALM Breathing (including its dose, schedule,&#xD;
      delivery, and home program). This pilot builds on initial lessons learned and identifies&#xD;
      intervention areas still needing greater development to assure the success of a future large&#xD;
      trial, targeting a subpopulation at risk, that is, those with COPD and anxiety sensitivity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to establish success benchmarks of CALM Breathing and to&#xD;
      test feasibility of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. recruiting a target group of adults with COPD and concurrent anxiety, including building&#xD;
           a partnership with the NYU Pulmonary department; ensuring adequacy of recruitment and&#xD;
           study referral procedures;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ASI-16 anxiety sensitivity cut-point for eligibility;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. randomizing participants to CALM Breathing and Wait-List;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. assessment procedures; confirming our estimates of time needed to administer&#xD;
           assessments; evaluating participant ratings of assessment burden; and testing that&#xD;
           target timelines and blinding are achievable;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. facilitating timely PR intake assessment initiation (to limit wait);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. implementing manualized CALM Breathing, including adequacy of dose (timing, frequency,&#xD;
           and session duration), fidelity procedures, and transportation funds; attention will be&#xD;
           given to additional considerations and tailoring needs of patients with significant&#xD;
           anxiety sensitivity and/or anxiety disorders;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. implementing home-based breathing exercise component (e.g., new RR device fidelity&#xD;
           checks and new distribution of therapist-guided audio exercises using an MP3 player to&#xD;
           improve adherence rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. retaining participants at 3-month follow-up post-PR, including ensuring adequacy of&#xD;
           retention strategies.&#xD;

In Phase II, both groups will be offered Rusk's 10-week PR program (care as usual). Access to timely initiation of PR will be facilitated.

    <description>CALM Breathing is a mind-body breathing therapy that links CO2 changes to dyspnea and anxiety symptoms and targets breathing efficiency and self-efficacy in COPD. CALM Breathing: Individual interoception- based breathing therapy with capnography (non- exercise training) Home Program: Monitored home- based breathing exercises; RR biofeedback; goal setting; exercise logging. Coaching: Motivational interviewing. Personnel: PT, EP, occupational therapist, or nurse. Frequency: 1-hour sessions, twice per week for 4 weeks. Exercises: • 10 core breathing exercises with ETCO2 biofeedback in recovery postures at rest and with body movement (gentle stretches and brief low-moderate intensity physical activity). • Breathing biofeedback (ETCO2, RR, airflow pattern). Education: Education on anxiety; COPD Patient Guide.</description>

    <description>After referral to Rusk Rehabilitation's outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program, participants randomized to the Wait-List control group will be put on a PR wait list (usual care). In Phase II, all participants will receive PR of 1-hour sessions, twice per week for 10 weeks. Traditional outpatient PR: Group exercise training (ET) combined with pursed lips breathing (PLB) training; 1:2 therapist to patient ratio. Home Program: Unmonitored walking exercise 1-2 days/week; no biofeedback monitoring. Coaching: Traditional monitoring and verbal cueing. Personnel: PT or EP. Frequency:&#xD;
1-hour sessions, twice per week for 10 weeks. Exercises: • ET of muscles of ambulation with exercise equipment, such as on a treadmill or cycle ergometer (30-min), plus 15-min strengthening and posture exercises; O2 supplementation as needed. No breathing biofeedback. • PLB instruction only during exercise training. Education: Verbal and written information.</description>

        Participants may not have suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviors within the past year&#xD;
        (PHQ-9 item 9 score &gt;0 or score of &gt;1 on psychologist interview- administered Clinician&#xD;
        Suicide Assessment Checklist, which is a Modified Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating&#xD;
        Scale-CSSRS). Participants cannot have morbid obesity (body mass index (BMI) &gt; 40) or&#xD;
        neuromuscular disease or be pregnant. Benzodiazepines and other acute-acting medications&#xD;
