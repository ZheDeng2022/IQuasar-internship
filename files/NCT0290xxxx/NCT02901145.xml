    <textblock>
      patients with progressive/relapsed solid tumors who failed first line therapy , will be&#xD;
      treated biweekly with the anti PD1- Nivolumab. at least one month after treatment initiation&#xD;
      low dose cyclophosphamide will be started .&#xD;
&#xD;
      patients on trial will submit tissue and blood tests for whole exome an immune genomic&#xD;
      signature. patients will also undergo repeated immunophenotype as part of follow up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is an inhibitory receptor that prevents immune activation.&#xD;
      PD-1 blockade can mediate reactivation of immune mediated tumor killing leading to tumor&#xD;
      regression . Another mechanism of tumor associated immune inactivation is elevation of rates&#xD;
      of T regulatory cells. This process may be prevented by treatment with low dose&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate safety and tolerability of the anti PD1 antibody Nivolumab combined&#xD;
      with other immunomodulating treatments, in pediatric patients with relapsed/progressive solid&#xD;
      tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with IV Nivolumab 3mg/kg over 60 minutes on day 1 and 15 of each&#xD;
      cycle of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dose finding phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Six patients will be accrued for the first cohort and treated for 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If an adverse event &gt;grade 2 will occur in&gt;2 patients, study medication dose will&#xD;
                be reduced by 25% and another cohort of 6 patients will be accrued on the reduced&#xD;
                dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Dose finding cohorts will be accrued until determination of a dose with allowed DLT&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Expansion phase&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Following dose determination patients will be accrued, to the final number of 30&#xD;
                patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Cyclophosphamide at the dose of 50 mg/dayx7days every 14 days (one week on one week&#xD;
                off ) will be started . immunophenotype will be done every 28 days and dose of&#xD;
                cyclophosphamide will be elevated by 25mg /day every month until highest ratio of&#xD;
                CD8/CD25FOXP3 cells will be reached for every child&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. All patients will be treated for 1 year or until imaging proven disease&#xD;
                progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Required follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. All patients will undergo tumor bed imaging (CT/MRI-based on tumor location) with&#xD;
                metastatic evaluation (according to standar follow up) every 4 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Tumor response will be measured based on RECIST criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Toxicity assessment will be done according to the CTCAE v. 4.03&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Collateral studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Immunohistochemical analysis for PD1 and PDL1 will be done on pretreatment paraffin&#xD;
           embedded tissue to estimate it's ability to predict response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Immune profile of peripheral blood lymphocytes including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ FOX P3+ cells&#xD;
           and it's correlation to objective response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exome sequencing of the tumor and peripheral blood will be done for every patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exome will be evaluated for driver mutations and immunologic genomic signature.&#xD;
