  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Project UPLIFT is a manualized intervention that includes a script for use by the telephone&#xD;
      facilitators in leading activities and discussions; use of a script is possible because the&#xD;
      delivery is not face-to-face. Activities and discussions are designed to increase knowledge&#xD;
      about epilepsy and mental health; monitoring, challenging, and changing of thoughts; coping&#xD;
      and relaxing; attention and mindfulness; focusing on pleasure; the importance of&#xD;
      reinforcement; and preventing relapse. Sessions are designed to last one hour by telephone,&#xD;
      and are comprised of a check-in period, teaching on the topic of that week's session, group&#xD;
      discussion, a skill-building exercise, and a recommended practice for the week. They are&#xD;
      co-facilitated by a research staff and an UPLIFT trained adult with epilepsy. The same&#xD;
      facilitators lead all eight sessions of a particular group. Facilitators will receive&#xD;
      training in delivery of the program, including delivery of a practice session, from the&#xD;
      Co-PI, a Georgia-licensed clinical psychologist. She will also supervise the facilitators&#xD;
      throughout the program delivery. As noted above, spiritualism and religion; oral,&#xD;
      interpersonal communication; and appreciation of intuition and experience are commonly held&#xD;
      values in the African American community. This suggests that Project UPLIFT, with its&#xD;
      activities based in experiential, meditative exercises, and oral, group discussion over the&#xD;
      telephone may be a good fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. The outcome evaluation of the efficacy of the Project UPLIFT telephone intervention&#xD;
      groups will be assessed using a cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants/Procedure. A total of 60 participants will be recruited. Participants must&#xD;
      self-identify as black or African American. All participants must be English-speaking, age 18&#xD;
      or older, mentally stable as assessed by the T-MMSE, have been diagnosed with epilepsy for at&#xD;
      least three months, and screen positive for depression or anxiety on the Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4). They must also have access to a telephone,&#xD;
      be willing to attend eight hour-long telephone groups, and be willing to be audio-recorded.&#xD;
      Individuals who are on antidepressant medication will not be excluded from this study, since&#xD;
      CBT has been demonstrated to have a greater effect on relapse prevention than antidepressant&#xD;
      medication. Once recruited, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two strata, each&#xD;
      comprised of five 6-person groups. After each 12-participant cohort is recruited, they will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to Stratum 1 (intervention) or Stratum 2 (treatment-as-usual waitlist).&#xD;
      During weeks 1-4, all participants will be pre-tested. During weeks 5-10, participants in&#xD;
      Stratum 1 will receive Project UPLIFT, while participants in Stratum 2 are called weekly for&#xD;
      a brief check-in. During weeks 11-14, all participants will receive interim testing. During&#xD;
      weeks 15-22, participants in Stratum 2 will receive Project UPLIFT. During weeks 23-26, all&#xD;
      participants will be post-tested. Five months after the completion of their final UPLIFT&#xD;
      session, participants will be contacted for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention in stratum 1, stratum 2 will serve as a control. In addition, the&#xD;
      design allows a replication of the results in the initial intervention group (stratum 1) by&#xD;
      the delayed intervention group (stratum 2). By the end of the intervention, all 10 6-person&#xD;
      groups will have received the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Strategy Conferencing Methods. In order for the participants to communicate with one&#xD;
      another as well as the facilitators, the telecommunicated group intervention sessions will&#xD;
      use GoToMeeting. This conferencing method allows the moderator to not only record the call&#xD;
      but also to screening participants waiting to join the call with the option to accept or&#xD;
      reject those waiting, dismiss in-meeting participants, lock the meeting as well as dial out&#xD;
      to participants. Use of this service is free of charge to MSM faculty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Measures will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental Stability will be assessed using the T-MMSE. The T-MMSE measures cognitive status,&#xD;
      based on questions regarding orientation to time and place, recall, attention, naming,&#xD;
      repetition, and a three-stage command. It was adapted from the Mini-Mental State Examination,&#xD;
      takes about 5-10 minutes to administer, and has been shown to be a valid form of the&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of Anxiety or Depression will be assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4&#xD;
      (PHQ-4).This is a very brief self-report instrument containing 2 depression items and 2&#xD;
      anxiety items. It is a compilation of the PHQ-2111 and the GAD-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suicidal Intent or Planning will be assessed with the following items revised from the Youth&#xD;
      Risk Behavior Survey to include only the past month: (1) During the past month, did you ever&#xD;
      seriously consider attempting suicide? (2) During the past month, did you make a plan about&#xD;
      how you would attempt suicide?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Measures will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability will be assessed using the 8-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8),&#xD;
      which has been demonstrated to correlate with number of psychotherapy sessions attended, and&#xD;
      therapy outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost and Health Outcomes will be assessed at baseline using the self-report survey instrument&#xD;
      developed by Lairson and colleagues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed by comparing changes in knowledge, skills,&#xD;
      and epilepsy self management from pretest to interim test to posttest across the strata.&#xD;
      Changes in anxiety, depression, or PTSD symptom scores will also be evaluated using the&#xD;
      methods described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge and Skills will be assessed using a measure in prior studies of Project UPLIFT.This&#xD;
      instrument includes two sections, one for knowledge and one for skills. The knowledge items&#xD;
      have true-false responses. The skills items have Likert-scaled response options measuring the&#xD;
      value of each skill and the frequency of use of that skill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self management will be assessed using the latest version of the Epilepsy Self Management&#xD;
      Scale (ESMS). The current version of this instrument includes 38-items and takes about 10&#xD;
      minutes to complete. IT includes subscales for Medication Management, Information Management,&#xD;
      Safety Management, Seizure Management, and Lifestyle Management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depressive Symptoms will be assessed using two different measures. The mBDI, a modified form&#xD;
      of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), will be used as one measure of depressive symptoms at&#xD;
      pretest,interim, posttest, and follow-up. The mBDI is a measure of depression severity during&#xD;
      the past 2 weeks. It contains the original 21 items of the BDI, but adds a positive response&#xD;
      category for each item, such that the responses are scaled from 0 (positive) to 4 (severe).&#xD;
      As a result, the mBDI is better at detecting differences in depression when depression scores&#xD;
      are low. The 21-item BDI has also been shown to be valid for assessing depression among&#xD;
      persons with epilepsy. Administration takes 5 to 10 minutes. The second measure of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms will be the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a 10-item&#xD;
      instrument that closely follows diagnostic criteria for Major Depression as cited in the&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders. The PHQ-9 has been validated for&#xD;
      diagnosing Major Depressive Disorder in primary care and in obstetric-gynecologic patients.&#xD;
      The PHQ-9 can also be used to identify Major Depressive Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of Anxiety will be assessed using two measures that are parallel to those used for&#xD;
      depressive symptoms. Like the BDI, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) is another 21-item,&#xD;
      self-report instrument, but it asks about the past week. Response choices range from 0 (not&#xD;
      at all) to 3 (severe). As with the BDI, administration takes 5 to 10 minutes. The second&#xD;
      anxiety measure will be the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), a 7-item scale developed&#xD;
      and validated within a primary care setting. The scale can also be completed by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) will be assess using the PTSD-8. It is&#xD;
      comprised of 4 Intrusive items, 2 Avoidance items, and 2 Hypervigilance items, for a total of&#xD;
      8 items. Item responses are on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (all the&#xD;
      time). Likert-scale scoring permits measurement of symptom severity. This instrument has been&#xD;
      tested across a range of diverse trauma samples including whiplash patients, rape victims,&#xD;
      and disaster victims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation. Process evaluation data will be obtained from the attendance records of each&#xD;
      intervention session. Outcome evaluation measures will include changes in knowledge, skills,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Data from the pretest, interim&#xD;
      test, and post-test will be entered by a Research Assistant, using SPSS. Changes in&#xD;
      knowledge, skills, and mental health symptoms will be assessed using repeated measures&#xD;
      multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) across the variable of time (pretest, interim).&#xD;
      Maintenance will be assessed comparing follow-up to pretest, and follow-up to immediate post&#xD;
      (interim for stratum 1, post-test for stratum 2).&#xD;
