  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common clinical affliction involving the back muscles, nerves, and bones.&#xD;
      This condition mainly manifests as limited lumbar mobility, decreased back muscle strength&#xD;
      and endurance, and disordered as well as asymmetrical movement of lower back muscles.&#xD;
      Although these symptoms can severely impact quality of life and work, most patients report no&#xD;
      precise origin of the condition. Low back pain may be associated with mechanical&#xD;
      musculoskeletal damage, inflammation, cancer, and infection. More than 80% of adults&#xD;
      experience low back pain at some point during their lifespan, although most patients are&#xD;
      between 40-80 years old. As many countries have an aging population, the incidence of low&#xD;
      back pain is increasing globally. Most patients suffer recurrent low back pain, which becomes&#xD;
      more and more serious with each manifestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with nonspecific low back pain often choose conservative treatments, such as&#xD;
      physiotherapy. Compared with surgery and drug therapy, physiotherapy is advantageous as a&#xD;
      treatment associated with low trauma, high comfort, few side effects, and low cost. Previous&#xD;
      studies have confirmed that treatment with ultrashort waves can improve blood and lymph&#xD;
      circulation in diseased areas and enhance the phagocytosis of macrophages and leukocytes, as&#xD;
      well as having an anti-inflammatory effect, making it effective in the treatment of low back&#xD;
      pain. Additionally, thermotherapy can directly expand the microvascular network of external&#xD;
      annulus fibrosus, increase vascular permeability, promote venous return of partial metabolic&#xD;
      waste, increase analgesic substance endorphin levels in vivo, suppress the generation of&#xD;
      pathological excitatory foci in the brain, and accelerate the self-repair of injured cells,&#xD;
      thus improving low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chinese traditional massage is also a common clinical therapy. The application of pressure to&#xD;
      the waist, hip, and lower limb on the affected side of the body can improve local blood&#xD;
      circulation, promote the absorption of inflammatory exudates, reduce muscle tension, loosens&#xD;
      abdominal adhesion, and mitigate muscle spasms to restore a normal anatomical position.&#xD;
      Indeed, the efficacy of massage in the treatment of low back pain has been confirmed,&#xD;
      according to five reports addressing manipulation for treating low back pain in Science&#xD;
      Citation Index and four separate trials regarding such manipulation listed in&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transpubic symphysis reset is a massage therapy for treatment of low back pain. Although the&#xD;
      efficacy of this treatment has been observed in the clinic, few studies have reported on the&#xD;
      efficacy of transpubic symphysis reset in mitigating low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, management, analysis, and open access Data collection Two physicians, who&#xD;
      will not participate in the experimental treatment or evaluation, will collect all patient&#xD;
      data. The investigators will use the double data entry strategy. The data will be summarized&#xD;
      and numbered by the research manager. A database will be established using Excel software.&#xD;
      For questionable data, the data manager will present the data query table to the investigator&#xD;
      for review and response. The researcher will answer the questions and return the table as&#xD;
      soon as possible. The data manager will modify and check the data according to the&#xD;
      researcher's answer. If necessary, the data manager can resubmit a question sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management After blind review and database confirmation, the researcher in charge,&#xD;
      sponsor, and statisticians will lock the database. The locked database will not be altered&#xD;
      and will be preserved, along with the original records, by Shengjing Hospital, China Medical&#xD;
      University, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis All data will be statistically analyzed by professional statisticians. The&#xD;
      results of these statistical analyses will be reported to a researcher and used to prepare&#xD;
      the research report. An independent data monitoring committee will be responsible for data&#xD;
      monitoring and management throughout the entire trial to ensure scientific accuracy,&#xD;
      stringency, authenticity, and integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open access Published data will be available at www.figshare.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis All data will be statistically analyzed using the SPSS 17.0 statistical&#xD;
      software package in line with the intention-to-treat principle. Data will be expressed as&#xD;
      mean Â± SD. Measurement data will be analyzed with an analysis of variance for independent&#xD;
      samples. Normally distributed data will be analyzed using group t-tests. Non-normally&#xD;
      distributed data will be compared using the Wilcoxon test. A value of P &lt; 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality Patient information, including name, identity card number, address, and&#xD;
      telephone number, will be encrypted in accordance with relevant Chinese laws and regulations.&#xD;
      The findings will be published for scientific purposes without revealing any patient&#xD;
      identities, except as required by law. Encoded information will be stored properly in&#xD;
      Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. To ensure that the research is in accordance&#xD;
      with the applicable laws and regulations, relevant national authorities and the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University will review patient records.&#xD;
