      The study intervention involved in this study is the addition of a dose of volasertib as a&#xD;
      part of the initial chemotherapy regimen for AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will involve a combination of the following drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volasertib (the study drug)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Idarubicin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cytarabine&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for&#xD;
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this research study, the participant will receive Volasertib in combination with&#xD;
      two other chemotherapy drugs, Idarubicin and Cytarabine. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration) has not approved volasertib as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Idarubicin and Cytarabine are chemotherapy agents that are commonly used to treat individuals&#xD;
      diagnosed with AML. Volasertib inhibits proteins called &quot;polo-like kinases,&quot; which are&#xD;
      necessary for cell division. Volasertib binds to these proteins and this inhibits the growth&#xD;
      of cancer cells. Volasertib has been used in laboratory studies and those studies suggest&#xD;
      that volasertib may slow down the growth of Cancer. In a previous clinical trial in patients&#xD;
      with the participant type of leukemia where Volasertib was given along with low doses of&#xD;
      Cytarabine, this drug was found to have some clinical activity against AML. In this study,&#xD;
      researchers would like to combine Volasertib with standard chemotherapy (Cytarabine and&#xD;
      Idarubicin) in order to see if it can be given safely with chemotherapy in individuals with&#xD;
      AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this research study is to determine the highest dose that Volasertib&#xD;
      can be given with Idarubicin and Cytarabine without severe or unmanageable side effects. The&#xD;
      dose identified in this study will be used in future research studies.&#xD;

             leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults, age 18 years or older at the time of diagnosis, eligible for standard&#xD;
             induction chemotherapy according to their treating physician.&#xD;

          -  Must not have received systemic antineoplastic therapy including radiation therapy&#xD;
             within 14 days of the study enrollment, except hydroxyurea or 6-mercaptopurine for the&#xD;
             purposes of cytoreduction as per the treating physician. Patients may also have&#xD;
             received all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) if there is an early suspicion of acute&#xD;
             promyelocytic leukemia (APL, M3-AML), although if confirmed to have APL these patients&#xD;
             will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing age must have negative pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin &lt; 3 times the ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels&#xD;
                  above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of volasertib (BI 6727) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason and because other chemotherapeutic agents are known to be teratogenic,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of therapy. Should&#xD;
             a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded from this study if they are found to harbor &quot;favorable&quot; risk&#xD;
             cytogenetics41 including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  APL, t(15;17)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  t(8;21)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  inv(16) or t(16;16) A sample to evaluate patient cytogenetics will be sent at the&#xD;
                  time of diagnosis per standard clinical care and the absence of these&#xD;
                  cytogenetics must be confirmed by Day 8. If the cytogenetic analysis reveals that&#xD;
                  the patient harbors favorable risk cytogenetics, or if the cytogenetic results&#xD;
                  are not received prior to Day 8, the participant will be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with acute bilineal/biphenotypic leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             entering the study, except for hydroxyurea, 6-MP, and ATRA, as noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemo-, hormono-, radio- or immunotherapy or therapy with monoclonal antibodies or&#xD;
             small tyrosine kinase inhibitors within the past 4 weeks prior to treatment with the&#xD;
             trial drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistence of clinically relevant therapy related toxicity from previous anti-cancer&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior allogeneic bone marrow or organ transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible&#xD;
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer&#xD;
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current clinical central nervous system (CNS) symptoms deemed by the investigator to&#xD;
             be related to leukemic CNS involvement (no lumbar puncture required, clinical&#xD;
             assessment per investigator's judgment is sufficient).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with volasertib or another polo-like kinase inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of active Hepatitis B or C infection. A patient with a prior infection may&#xD;
             participate, so long as the infection is not active at the time of study screening&#xD;
             tests and according to investigator discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or history of ventricular or life-threatening arrhythmias or diagnosis of&#xD;
             long-QT syndrome. Baseline QTc must be 470 msec or less, according to the Friderica&#xD;
             correction method,42 calculated as the mean of 3 ECGs taken at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or history of congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class&#xD;
             3 or 4, or any history of documented diastolic or systolic dysfunction (LVEF &lt;50%, as&#xD;
             measured by MUGA scan or echocardiogram).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to the trial drugs or other contraindication to standard &quot;7+3&quot;&#xD;
             induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Although not absolute exclusion criteria, several known drug-drug interactions should&#xD;
             be considered during enrollment (see Section 5.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because volasertib, along with standard&#xD;
             induction chemotherapy, carries the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with volasertib as well as cytarabine and&#xD;
             idarubicin, breastfeeding should be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with volasertib. In addition, these&#xD;
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychological, familial, social, or geographic factors that otherwise&#xD;
             preclude them from giving informed consent, following the protocol, or potentially&#xD;
             hamper compliance with study treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are otherwise felt unable to comply with the protocol, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator.&#xD;
