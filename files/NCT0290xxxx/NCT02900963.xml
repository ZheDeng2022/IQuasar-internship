    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are standard treatment of head and neck cancer alone or&#xD;
      associated to surgical treatment. Early (during treatment or the following weeks) and late&#xD;
      side effects contribute to malnutrition in this population at risk. In this context,&#xD;
      nutritional support adapted by dietary monitoring and enteral nutrition (nasogastric tube or&#xD;
      gastrostomy) are often necessary. The early identification of the patients with high&#xD;
      malnutrition risk and requiring enteral nutrition is necessary to improve the tolerance and&#xD;
      efficacy of treatment. This prospective study research the factors of malnutrition during&#xD;
      head and neck radiotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world, Malnutrition occurs&#xD;
      frequently at the time of diagnosis as consequences of alcohol consumption and tobacco use&#xD;
      that is quite common in this patients population, and of local tumor invasion, obstructing&#xD;
      the function of swallowing and chewing. In addition, during the treatment, mucositis,&#xD;
      anorexia, dysphagia, mouth sores, and other acute and late toxic effects of radiotherapy (RT)&#xD;
      and chemotherapy frequently worsen the nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor nutritional status and chemotherapy or RT-toxicity, lead to treatment interruption&#xD;
      frequently and is also associated with higher risk of infection, hospital readmission, early&#xD;
      death, worse survival outcomes, and deterioration in the quality of life (QoL). According to&#xD;
      published results, one third of the patient would have benefit from a complete treatment. In&#xD;
      addition, the correlation exists between some biological parameters (CRP, albumin,&#xD;
      neutrophils, Hb) and the nutritional status. Therefore, it deems essential to maintain&#xD;
      nutritional status in head and neck cancer patients undergoing RT and chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary counseling and oral supplements showed positive influences on nutritional outcomes&#xD;
      and QoL However, their role is limited when it comes to obstruction or mucositis. Thus,&#xD;
      enteral feeding may be a choice either through nasogastric tube (NGT) or percutaneous&#xD;
      endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Studies investigated the effects of PEG compared with NGT were&#xD;
      not conclusive or showing no consistent results on nutritional status, treatment&#xD;
      interruption, nutrition-related hospital admission, and tube-related complications in the&#xD;
      head and neck cancer patients receiving RT or chemo-radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal method and the timing of placement are still debated. Consequently, the aim of&#xD;
      this study is to collect data on our current daily practice on supplementary nutrition method&#xD;
      ( NGT, PEG) in head and neck cancers patients treated in our radiation therapy unit and to&#xD;
      identify factors predicting good treatment outcomes( ie full treatment administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to collect nutritional data during the treatment, to study the&#xD;
      nutritional status in relation to acute or late adverse events, to study the impact of an&#xD;
      early enteral feeding on clinical and biological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary study: Sarco-Nutrineck The aim of this ancillary study is to collect data on&#xD;
      prevalence of low muscle mass in this population, treatment outcomes and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline: body height and weight, calculated BMI. Biological parameters: albumin,&#xD;
      orosomucoid, transthyretin, CRP Daily - during the treatment period: weight Weekly - during&#xD;
      the treatment period: albumin, orosomucoid, transthyretin, CRP. The Nutritional and&#xD;
      inflammatory status score will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical criteria on the requirement of enteral nutrition (or need for artificial nutrition)&#xD;
      in case of weight loss persisting at least for three days during radiotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether nutritional screening on admission can be&#xD;
      used to determine risk levels for adverse clinical events and treatment outcome ( full&#xD;
      treatment administration) in head and neck cancer and to propose a risk stratification based&#xD;
      on nutritional screening before radiotherapy or concomitant chemo radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tube (NGT) will be placed according to the following procedure: The weight will be assessed&#xD;
      on daily basis and will be compared to the figure at baseline, before treatment. If the&#xD;
      weight loss is superior to 2 kg, the patient will consult a radiotherapist who will perform a&#xD;
      physical examination, a nutritional assessment (history, appetite change, taste, quantity and&#xD;
      quality of oral food intake, medication, details regarding weight change and BMI). In&#xD;
      addition to dietary counselling and oral supplementation, If indicated, analgesic drugs and&#xD;
      or treatment of associated mucositis will be prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of persisting weight loss or severe dysphagia or no oral solid food intake, a&#xD;
      nasogastric tube (NGT) will be placed by a nurse and a personalized nutritional counselling&#xD;
      by a dietician will be organized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological exams will be done according to our local practice and standard, and the results&#xD;
      will be analyzed to assess the safety. Regular clinical exams will be realized. All adverse&#xD;
      events will reported according to the common terminology criteria for adverse events scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up period. The patients will benefit from a clinical exam, height, weight, BMI,&#xD;
      biological exam (including albumin, orosomucoid, transthyretin, CRP) one month after the end&#xD;
      of the treatment, and then at three months and at twelve months, late toxicities will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether nutritional screening on admission can be&#xD;
      used to determine risk levels for adverse clinical events and treatment outcome (full&#xD;
      treatment administration) in head and neck cancer and to propose i) isk stratification based&#xD;
      on nutritional screening before radiotherapy or concomitant chemo radiotherapy ii) decisional&#xD;
      algorithm on placement of a NGT&#xD;
