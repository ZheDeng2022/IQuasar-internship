  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trastuzumab is an important treatment for HER 2 positive breast cancer. But trastuzumab can&#xD;
      cause injury to the heart, and this is one of the main reasons it cannot be administered as&#xD;
      planned. Heart injury can often be successfully treated using cardiac medications. The aim of&#xD;
      SCHOLAR is to evaluate whether it is safe to continue trastuzumab in individuals with mild or&#xD;
      moderate cardiac injury, while treating them with appropriate cardiac medications. In this&#xD;
      way the investigators hope to be able to optimise the delivery of a treatment to patients&#xD;
      with breast cancer that has proven survival benefits, especially when administered for a full&#xD;
      12-month course.&#xD;

      The SCHOLAR study design will be a modified phase I, non-randomized clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially a cohort of 5 participants will be enrolled. They will continue to receive&#xD;
      trastuzumab. All participants in SCHOLAR will also be prescribed standard-of-care treatment&#xD;
      for patients with LV systolic dysfunction, including the beta-blocker, carvedilol, and the&#xD;
      ACE-I, ramipril, as tolerated, at the maximum doses tolerated, up to carvedilol 25mg BID and&#xD;
      ramipril 10mg once daily. If at any time 1 or more of the first 5 participants develop cDLT,&#xD;
      de-escalation will occur. De-escalation will involve a change in the eligibility criteria to&#xD;
      exclude patients with LVEF &lt;45% and patients with NYHA class II, III, or IV heart failure. A&#xD;
      further 5 patients will then be recruited. If 2 or more of the second 5 participants develop&#xD;
      cDLT after de-escalation, the intervention will be considered unsafe, and the study will be&#xD;
      closed. If the intervention is considered safe either using the initial eligibility criteria&#xD;
      or the de-escalated eligibility criteria, the study will be closed after 20 participants have&#xD;
      been recruited. If at any time during the study &gt;20% of participants develop cDLT, the&#xD;
      intervention will be considered unsafe, and the study will be closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen by a cardiologist at the following time points (referenced from the&#xD;
      baseline visit): baseline, 3 weeks ± 1 week, 6 weeks ± 1 week, 3 months ± 1 week, 6 months ±&#xD;
      1 week, 9 months ± 1 week, 12 month ± 1 week&#xD;
