  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot study of the CivaSheet, a new type of intraoperative radiation therapy&#xD;
      (IORT) device that offers several advantages over existing techniques of performing IORT. The&#xD;
      CivaSheet device in this study is already approved by the FDA and is not an experimental&#xD;
      device. This study will allow us to determine how feasible it is to implant the CivaSheet&#xD;
      into patients undergoing surgery for abdominal and pelvic tumors, and assess any possible&#xD;
      side effects of the device. This study, if successful, may allow us to offer the CivaSheet&#xD;
      more widely as treatment option to future patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic, cytologic, or radiologically evidence of locally advanced, residual or&#xD;
             recurrent solid malignancy of the abdomen or pelvis requiring surgical resection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maximum projected treatment length 15cm and width 5cm, which are the dimensions of the&#xD;
             largest available CivaSheet&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically fit and willing to undergo resection of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1, or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ANC ≥ 1.5 cells/mm3, PLT≥100,000/mm3, PT/aPTT within normal limits at time of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy, in the clinician's judgment, greater than 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable&#xD;
             method to avoid pregnancy after the receipt of brachytherapy. Male subjects must also&#xD;
             agree to use effective contraception during the treatment period and until 1 year&#xD;
             after the completion of brachytherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any concurrent medical or psychiatric condition or disease which, in the&#xD;
             investigator's judgment, would make them inappropriate candidates for entry into this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who, in the investigator's judgment, are unwilling or unable to consent to&#xD;
             and return for recommended post-treatment scans as outlined in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on concurrent anti-cancer therapy, unless specifically agreed to by the&#xD;
             patient's medical oncologist and consenting professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with contraindications to general anesthesia, as determined by the treating&#xD;
             physician or surgeon&#xD;
