  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is the most widespread parasitic illness in the world, and it is endemic to Guiana.&#xD;
      Although the number of cases has decreased since 2005, sources of infection still remain,&#xD;
      particularly within illegal gold mines. These malaria carriers/sufferers often use&#xD;
      self-medication to deal with malaria symptoms, resulting in a risk of resistance to&#xD;
      anti-malarial treatments, and particularly to artemisinine. The mobility of this population&#xD;
      across the Guiana Shield increases both the risk of malaria spreading and the resistance of&#xD;
      this illness to treatment in the region, and puts the population at risk of new outbreaks of&#xD;
      this disease despite the great efforts put into anti-malarial policy in this region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fighting malaria within this population is therefore a dual public health challenge: on the&#xD;
      one hand, make it possible for the WHO to eliminate malaria from the Guiana Shield by 2017,&#xD;
      on the other to limit resistance to artemisinine in this region. However, Guiana's particular&#xD;
      context - namely the illegal status of gold mines and the difficult geographical access, the&#xD;
      Harpie military operations, the illegality of carrying out malarial diagnosis tests and&#xD;
      treating cases without the presence of a health professional - prevents us from achieving&#xD;
      this goal using the same tools as our neighbours in Suriname, whose &quot; Looking for Gold,&#xD;
      Finding Malaria &quot; programme was a success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of the malarial epidemiology in this population will enable us to&#xD;
      propose innovative, more adapted measures to combat malaria within these guyanese&#xD;
      populations. This is an transversal, multicentric observational study.&#xD;

      Main Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the prevalence of Plasmodium carriers in the population of illegal gold mine&#xD;
      workers in French Guiana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the proportion of different Plasmodium species affecting this population and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine parasitaemia levels;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the gametocyte index;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Map the number and proportion of P. falciparum cases for the different river sites where&#xD;
           gold mining is carried out;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the lifestyle, knowledge, attitude and behaviour of these populations&#xD;
           concerning malaria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the prevalence of mutations linked to the resistance of parasites to&#xD;
           artemisinine derivatives;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyse the global genetic diversity of these parasites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the global health of gold miners&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will make it possible to characterise the malaria epidemic in&#xD;
      illegal gold-mining sites across French Guiana, evaluate the size of the human reservoir and&#xD;
      the prevalence of ACT-tolerant parasites, identify the most urgent areas to be dealt with,&#xD;
      suggest appropriate plans of action for this, and adopt more efficient public information&#xD;
      campaigns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population: People working on illegal gold mining sites in French Guiana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  works on a gold mining site in French Guiana&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  has been at the resting site for less than seven days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is over the age of 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  accepts to take part in this study&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  refuses to take part in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is under the age of 18&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling of the 240 people needed for this study will be achieved through chance meetings&#xD;
      and the resulting snowball effect at gold mining resting sites on the Surinamese banks of the&#xD;
      Maroni river.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acquisition of authorisations from the competent French authorities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Authorisation from the competent Surinamese authorities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment of one mediator/translator, one state registered nurse and one doctor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collaboration with Dr Cairo (program &quot;looking for gold, finding malaria) in Suriname to&#xD;
           plan the field missions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Teams from Suriname and French Guiana will work joinly in the field: eligible persons&#xD;
           will be enrolled in the study, the others can be tested by the Surinamese team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion of subjects through chance meetings and the snowball effect at resting sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consent of patients and checking of inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance of three diagnostic tests for each person, including&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  an RDT on site&#xD;
&#xD;

                guidelines;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If necessary, provision of a results sheet describing the necessary doses for&#xD;
                treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Performance of thick and thin blood smears for transport to the CHAR&#xD;
                     parasitology laboratory for analysis;&#xD;

                     an icebox between 4°C et 10°C for the CNR malarial parasitology lab at the&#xD;
                     Institut Pasteur de la Guyane;&#xD;
