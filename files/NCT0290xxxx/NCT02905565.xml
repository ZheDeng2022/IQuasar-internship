    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on to&#xD;
      standard of care study of NBP softgel capsules for the treatment of mild to moderate AIS in&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on to standard-of-care study with&#xD;
      a primary objective to assess the safety of NBP treatment in patients with mild to moderate&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke. The secondary objectives include determination of pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      profile and exploratory evaluation for the efficacy of NBP treatment in stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All randomized subjects will also receive standard supportive medical care for treatment of&#xD;
      AIS throughout the study. The overall duration of the study will be approximately 90 days,&#xD;
      including 30 days of treatment and an additional 60 days for follow up assessments. Subjects&#xD;
      will be hospitalized long enough to receive the first four doses of study drug. After&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital, subjects will continue to take study treatment daily through Day&#xD;
      30 and have scheduled assessments completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain the blind, all subjects will take 4 softgel capsules BID, which will contain&#xD;
      either 100 mg NBP or matching placebo. The first dose must be taken within 12 hours of the&#xD;
      onset of the AIS defined as the last known normal.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males or females aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 85 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test at Screening and be practicing a medically&#xD;
             acceptable method of contraception with an annual failure rate of less than 1% until&#xD;
             the completion of the trial or 60 days after discontinuation of study treatment. Women&#xD;
             are considered not childbearing if they are &gt; 1 year postmenopausal or surgically&#xD;
             sterile (ie, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy tubal&#xD;
             ligation). If serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG) is the standard of care,&#xD;
             then this value can be used to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate cortical or subcortical AIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able to swallow the softgel capsules as defined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Completes screening procedures such that study treatment is first administered within&#xD;
             24 hours of stroke onset. The stroke onset time will be defined as the last known&#xD;
             normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. If Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) is given as part of standard of care, the first&#xD;
             dose of NBP must be administered no sooner than 4 hours after the end of the tPA&#xD;
             infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A standard NIHSS score of 4 to 17, inclusive. If patients receive tPA and/or&#xD;
             endovascular treatment (EVT), the NIHSS score must be obtained after the infusion&#xD;
             and/or procedure is completed. If sedation is used for EVT, then the NIHSS score must&#xD;
             be obtained after sedation no longer confounds the assessment. All subjects must meet&#xD;
             a NIHSS consciousness score of 0-1 in order to meet eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Functionally independent, as defined by a Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 1&#xD;
             before their present illness as determined by the subject or provided by a&#xD;
             representative if the subject is unable to participate at the time of study entry&#xD;
             (determined by retrospective assessment by the Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Capable of understanding the purpose and risk of the study and has signed, in writing,&#xD;
             the Informed Consent Form (ICF). If the subject is not capable of this at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment, a legally authorized representative (LAR) will provide written informed&#xD;
             consent in accordance with all regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Ability to comply with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female subjects who are pregnant, lactating/breast-feeding, or plan to become pregnant&#xD;
             within the next 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Suspected diagnosis of stroke isolated to brainstem or brain areas other than cortical&#xD;
             or subcortical AIS that may have caused the present symptoms, based on the opinion of&#xD;
             the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Rapidly improving or resolving symptoms, suggesting a possible transient ischemic&#xD;
             attack (TIA) rather than a qualifying stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Signs of acute intracranial hemorrhage or symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation of&#xD;
             AIS defined by a 4-point worsening in NIHSS from presentation, or other cause of acute&#xD;
             stroke symptoms (other than early ischemic findings) on cranial imaging at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of intracranial hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Seizure at onset of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A previous clinical diagnosis of stroke within 6 months of current AIS. A previously&#xD;
             undiagnosed stroke evidenced on screening CT or MRI may be enrolled provided it does&#xD;
             not affect neurological and functional assessments based on the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Uncontrolled severe hypertension defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 220 mm&#xD;
             Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 110 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Treatment with intensive antihypertensive therapy within 4 hours of randomization.&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. An international normalized ratio (INR) ≥ 1.5 if not being treated with anticoagulant&#xD;
             therapy, or an INR ≥ 3.5 if being treated with an acceptable anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. A serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level &gt; 1.5&#xD;

             Gilbert's disease) at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Clinically significant renal dysfunction (including serum creatinine level &gt; 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
             or 177 µmol/L) at Screening.&#xD;
