      SEHER Plus- Strengthening Evidence base on scHool-based intErventions for pRomoting&#xD;
      adolescent health, seeks to evaluate a school based adolescent health promotion intervention&#xD;
      delivered by two different delivery agents viz. teacher-as-SEHER Mitra (TSM) and lay school&#xD;
      counsellor called as SEHER Mitra (SM) in government- run secondary schools in Bihar, India.&#xD;
      SEHER Plus will be implemented in the same randomly assigned 74 schools wherein, the SEHER&#xD;
      trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02484014)-a three armed clustered randomised trial (CRT) was&#xD;
      implemented to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these two models compared&#xD;
      with the Tarang-Adolescence Education Programme (usual care) implemented by the State&#xD;
      Government of Bihar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SEHER trial hypothesised that both interventions, compared to the control arm, would lead&#xD;
      to a greater impact on school climate (school connectedness and relationship with teachers&#xD;
      and fellow students). In addition, the interventions would increase the knowledge, attitude&#xD;
      and awareness, and promoting healthy behaviours in youth on reproductive and sexual health&#xD;
      outcomes, mental health and substance use, and gender related attitudes and violence. The&#xD;
      SEHER trial also hypothesized that the addition of more resource intensive component (the SM&#xD;
      arm) would be associated with the best outcomes. The hypothesis for the SEHER Plus is that&#xD;
      students who will have exposure to the SEHER intervention activities in two academic years&#xD;
      (Class IX and X) will show greater benefits on the primary, secondary and exploratory&#xD;
      outcomes than students who have exposure to the SEHER intervention activities in one academic&#xD;
      year (Class IX).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and objective: India is home to 358 million young people in the age group of 10 to&#xD;
      24; of these 243 million are between 10 and 19 years age. This represents a huge opportunity&#xD;
      that can transform the social and economic fortunes of the country. Key public health&#xD;
      challenges for adolescents in India include unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted and&#xD;
      reproductive tract infections, injuries, growing misuse of alcohol, tobacco and other&#xD;
      substances, and mental health problems such as depression, anxiety disorders and suicide.&#xD;
      Schools provide an ideal platform for addressing these health issues and the World Health&#xD;
      Organization's Health Promoting Schools framework seeks to address some of the structural&#xD;
      determinants of these health concerns. The recent Cochrane review assessed school- based&#xD;
      interventions and found that 'whole school' or 'school environment' interventions are&#xD;
      effective in addressing a range of health outcomes among adolescents including bullying,&#xD;
      aggression, and tobacco use. However, there is no comparable evidence on effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness on school-based health promotion programmes in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sangath has implemented SEHER-Strengthening Evidence base on school-based intErventions for&#xD;
      pRomoting adolescent health (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02484014) , which is a jointly funded&#xD;
      programme (by The MacArthur Foundation and United Nation's Population Development Fund,&#xD;
      India) that seeks to develop and evaluate a comprehensive adolescent health promotion&#xD;
      intervention delivered by two different delivery agents viz. teacher as SEHER Mitra (TSM) and&#xD;
      a lay health worker called as SEHER Mitra (SM) in government run secondary schools in Bihar,&#xD;
      India. Following hypotheses are addressed through SEHER trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For primary outcome measure: It is hypothesized that the intervention strategies in&#xD;
           addition to usual intervention (Tarang-AEP) will have a graded effect on overall school&#xD;
           climate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For secondary outcome measures: The interventions will build positive attitude towards&#xD;
           gender equity, build knowledge of and attitude towards reproductive and sexual health,&#xD;
           reduce self-reported bullying, violence and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For exploratory outcome measures : The interventions will decrease tobacco, alcohol and&#xD;
           other substance use, reduce suicide behaviour (suicide thoughts and attempts) and&#xD;
           increase safe sexual behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses for SEHER Plus:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SEHER Plus will address the additional benefits of providing an exposure to intervention&#xD;
      activities for two years versus one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For primary outcome measure: The students who will have exposure to the SEHER intervention&#xD;
      activities in addition to the usual intervention (Tarang-AEP) in two academic years (Class IX&#xD;
      and X) will show greater benefits on overall school climate than students who have exposure&#xD;
      to the SEHER intervention activities and usual intervention (Tarang-AEP) in one academic year&#xD;
      (Class IX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For secondary outcome measures: The students who will have exposure to the SEHER intervention&#xD;
      activities in addition to the usual intervention (Tarang-AEP) in two academic years (Class IX&#xD;
      and X) will show improved positive attitude towards gender equity, increased knowledge of and&#xD;
      attitude towards reproductive and sexual health, reduced self-reported bullying, violence and&#xD;
      depression than students who have exposure to the SEHER intervention activities and usual&#xD;
      intervention (Tarang-AEP) in one academic year (Class IX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For secondary outcome measures: The students who will have exposure to the SEHER intervention&#xD;
      activities in addition to the usual intervention (Tarang-AEP) in two academic years (Class IX&#xD;
      and X) will report reduced incidence of tobacco, alcohol and other substance use, reduced&#xD;
      incidence of self-reported suicide attempts and reduced incidence of sexual behaviour than&#xD;
      students who have exposure to the SEHER intervention activities and usual intervention&#xD;
      (Tarang-AEP) in one academic year (Class IX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SEHER intervention with the already existing Tarang-AEP will enhance the effect on the&#xD;
      above mentioned outcomes; the effects will be minimal to moderate among the students who have&#xD;
      two years exposure and are from low resource intensity intervention (Teacher-as-SEHER Mitra:&#xD;
      Arm-I), and the effects will be the greatest and significant among the students who have two&#xD;
      years exposure and are from high resource intensity intervention (School Mitra: Arm-II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: The school as the unit of randomisation are allocated to one of the&#xD;
      intervention arms or comparison using minimisation during the pilot study of the SEHER&#xD;
      project (June 2014-March 2015). Although, usually a pilot study would be conducted in&#xD;
      different schools from those in the main trial, it has been possible for SEHER to conduct the&#xD;
      pilot study in the main trial schools because a new cohort of standard IX students will be&#xD;
      entering school every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before randomisation, a list of eligible schools for randomisation (n=112) from the total&#xD;
      number of secondary and higher secondary schools in Nalanda district of Bihar (n=136) was&#xD;
      generated. The following criteria were used to generate the list: implementation of&#xD;
      Tarang-AEP programme, total number of students in the school, and total number of employed&#xD;
      teachers in school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 112 schools, 75 were randomly selected for the random allocation. To have a&#xD;
      representative pool of 75 schools, and to ensure an equal number of schools of each type in&#xD;
      each of the three trial arms, 68 % of co-educational (63 out of 93), 69% of only girls' (9&#xD;
      out of 13) and 50% only boys' schools (3 out of 6) were selected. All the 75 schools are&#xD;
      allocated to comparison or one of the intervention arms by using minimization. To carry out&#xD;
      the allocation by minimisation, the arms were balanced on the following variables (each of&#xD;
      the variable will be classified into categories):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Type of school (secondary= 1; and secondary and higher secondary school= 2);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. School size (small=100-300; medium=301-600, and large=601 and above students ), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nature of school (Co-education=1; only boys'=2; and only girls' =3). The random&#xD;
           allocation by using minimization was carried out by an independent statistician (Gian&#xD;
           Luca DiTanna, LSHTM) using the R software package .&#xD;
&#xD;
      One school from the TSM arm dropped out after the pilot study and hence there are now 24&#xD;
      schools in this arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: All the students who are enrolled in class IX in the academic year March 2015-&#xD;
      April 2016 and all the students who are enrolled in the class IX in the academic year March&#xD;
      2016- April 2017 will be invited to participate in the outcome assessment to be completed in&#xD;
      December 2016/January 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will not collect any baseline assessment for the students who are enrolled&#xD;
      in Class IX in the academic year 2016-17. As part of the SEHER trial, the students who are&#xD;
      enrolled in class IX in the academic year 2015-16 have participated in two outcome&#xD;
      assessments; one in July 2015 and other in March/April 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process Evaluation: Process evaluation will be an integral part of the research design and&#xD;
      will examine the quality of programme implementation (i.e. its integrity or fidelity), the&#xD;
      completeness of its delivery, and the extent to which stakeholders engage with it. In doing&#xD;
      so, it can help explain the programme's outcomes and identify ways to improve and/or&#xD;
      replicate it. Two types of indicators will be collated to evaluate the fidelity of the&#xD;
      delivery of the SEHER interventions, viz. their quantity and quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nested qualitative evaluation: A qualitative evaluation will be conducted at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention to: a) explore deliverers' and recipients' responses to the intervention, and b)&#xD;
      explore the school communities perception about the effect of the SEHER intervention on the&#xD;
      students' health and academic attainment. The qualitative component will comprise of focus&#xD;
      group discussions with single sex groups of class IX and X students, TSMs and SMs, and&#xD;
      in-depth interviews with purposively selected male and female students from class IX and X&#xD;
      who have availed counselling services, principals, Tarang nodal teachers and other teachers,&#xD;
      TSMs/SMs and supervisors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: Two types of quantitative data will be collected: intervention process, and&#xD;
      outcome assessment. All outcome assessment data will be collected in paper form, as will&#xD;
      process data from TSMs/SMs. All the data will be manually entered into Access database. Range&#xD;
      and consistency checks will be performed at monthly intervals for all process data. Queries&#xD;
      identified will be resolved promptly by the trial management team, and the database updated,&#xD;
      maintaining the audit trail. All data will be kept in separate databases and only merged into&#xD;
      a master database after data collection is completed and each individual database will be&#xD;
      locked. All process data will be backed-up on external hard disks on monthly basis. Access to&#xD;
      pre-locked data will be password protected at multiple levels and no member of the trial team&#xD;
      apart from the data manager and independent statistician will have access to these passwords.&#xD;
      After the dataset is locked, the dataset will remain password-protected and trial&#xD;
      investigators will have access to the datasets. For all data, a separate file linking names&#xD;
      and trial identification codes will be kept and password protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:Quantitative analyses will be carried out using STATA (version 14). Below is a&#xD;
      summary of the investigator's approach to the analysis. A detailed analysis plan will be&#xD;
      agreed with the Data Safety and Monitoring Board towards the end of the trial and/or before&#xD;
      any analysis is undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses: Initial analyses will describe the characteristics of enrolled&#xD;
      participants within and across arms (for example: age and socioeconomic background).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures will be summarised at end-line by each cluster, arm-wise and year-wise&#xD;
      exposure, and overall. These will be summarised by means (SD), medians (Inter- Quartile&#xD;
      Range) or numbers and proportions as appropriate by key relevant subgroups (such as age, and&#xD;
      gender).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome analyses: The primary analyses, based on cross sectional survey, will be&#xD;
      intention-to-treat at the end of the trial and using multi-level modelling to take into&#xD;
      account clustering at the school level. Gender-wise sub-group analysis will be performed. The&#xD;
      trial outcomes will be evaluated for the primary and secondary outcomes based on the change&#xD;
      in the intervention arm compared to the change in the comparison. The primary trial impact&#xD;
      comparison will be arm-wise analysed between the the students who have exposure to&#xD;
      intervention activities for two academic years and the students who have exposure to&#xD;
      intervention activities for one academic year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed effects regression will be performed to analyse changes in primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes at school-level. Effect sizes will be presented as risk ratios for binary outcomes&#xD;
      (for e.g. experience of bullying), and as mean differences for continuous outcomes (for e.g.&#xD;
      overall school climate score); 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be derived for both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reporting and presentation of this trial will be in accordance with the CONSORT&#xD;
      guidelines for cluster randomised trials, with the primary comparative analysis being&#xD;
      conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.&#xD;
