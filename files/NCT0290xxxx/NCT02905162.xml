  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To inform the design of a future transitional HIV care intervention for releasees, the study&#xD;
      proposes to prospectively assess clinical outcomes for HIV-infected prisoners after release;&#xD;
      explore factors from health behavior theory that are associated with post-release retention&#xD;
      in care, with a special focus on Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs); and conduct formative research&#xD;
      to determine releasee and stakeholder knowledge, attitudes, and preferences surrounding&#xD;
      transitional care interventions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enrol approximately 552 releasees from Lusaka Central Facility, Mwembeshi&#xD;
      Correctional Facility, Kamwala Remand Centre, and Chainama Correctional Facility and Kabwe&#xD;
      Correctional Complex. HIV care retention, mortality and changes in CD4 count and HIV-1 viral&#xD;
      load at 6 month post-release information will be obtained from the SmartCare database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validated psychometric instruments will be used to assess AUD prevalence and alcohol use&#xD;
      severity pre-incarceration, at release and about 3 to 6 months post-release. Using&#xD;
      mixed-methods, effects of AUDs on retention in care at 3 and/or 6 months post-release will be&#xD;
      estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-group analyses among HIV-infected individuals on ART and those enrolled in care but not&#xD;
      yet on ART (i.e. pre-ART) will enable assessment of AUD effects on biological markers of HIV&#xD;
      disease control and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Behavioural Model for Vulnerable Populations, and validated psychometric instruments,&#xD;
      questionnaires, and in-depth interviews, factors beyond AUDs that may influence post-release&#xD;
      retention in HIV care will be evaluated. Finally, preferred and relevant program elements for&#xD;
      a future prisoner transitional HIV care pilot will be examined by conducting in-depth&#xD;
      interviews with a purposive sample of approximately 26 HIV-infected releasees and leaders&#xD;
      from the Zambian government and prominent implementing partner organizations, as well as&#xD;
      focus group discussions with frontline prison officers, health workers, and representatives&#xD;
      of leading civil society organizations in Zambia.&#xD;
