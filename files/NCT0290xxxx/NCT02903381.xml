    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a new drug called &quot;nivolumab&quot; as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      smoldering multiple myeloma in order to prevent or postpone development of active multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients with smoldering multiple myeloma do not have symptoms but are at risk for&#xD;
      progressing to active multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cell,&#xD;
      which is an important part of the immune system. Patients with active multiple myeloma&#xD;
      generally require treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the effectiveness of an&#xD;
           investigational drug(s). The investigational drugs used in this research study are;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  lenalidomide&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preliminary experience suggests that the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone&#xD;
           may prevent or postpone smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) from becoming active multiple&#xD;
           myeloma. The purpose of this research study is to determine if the addition of nivolumab&#xD;
           may improve the rate of prevention in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not&#xD;
           approved the combination of nivolumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone as a treatment&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug derived from thalidomide. Lenalidomide works by&#xD;
           stopping blood flow to your cancer cells and signaling your cancer cells to die off. The&#xD;
           FDA has approved lenalidomide for the treatment of many types of cancer including&#xD;
           multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone, also FDA approved, is a type of steroid and is usually combined with&#xD;
           other chemotherapy for the treatment of blood cancers, such as myeloma and leukemias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab is approved by the FDA for some lung cancers, some skin cancers, some kidney&#xD;
           cancers, and Hodgkin lymphoma. It is currently being evaluated for use in the treatment&#xD;
           of several other types of cancers. Nivolumab may kill or stop cancer cells from growing&#xD;
           by blocking a signal in the cells allowing the immune system to fight the cancer. This&#xD;
           drug is a human monoclonal antibody, which is a molecule that is made in a laboratory&#xD;
           that is designed to act identically to cells in the immune system.&#xD;
