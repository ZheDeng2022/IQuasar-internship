  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects a new drug, palbociclib, has on&#xD;
      prostate cancer and will look at the side effects of treatment with palbociclib. The&#xD;
      researchers doing this study are also interested in looking for markers that may help predict&#xD;
      which patients are most likely to be helped by palbociclib and to see how the cancer cells&#xD;
      respond to palbociclib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard or usual treatment for this disease may be chemotherapy or other types of&#xD;
      treatment to slow the spread of the disease and relieve some symptoms of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palbociclib is a new type of drug for prostate cancer. Laboratory tests show that it may help&#xD;
      slow the growth of prostate cancer. Palbociclib has been shown to help patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer but it is not known if the drug is useful for treating prostate cancer.&#xD;
