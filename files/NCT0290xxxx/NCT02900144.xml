  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this trial is to develop and investigate the effects of a modified&#xD;
      comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) protocol for children and adolescents&#xD;
      with chronic tic disorders and ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBIT is a first-line behavioral treatment for individuals with tic disorders. However, the&#xD;
      benefit of CBIT is mitigated in those with co-occurring ADHD, as ADHD is negatively&#xD;
      associated with effect size in behavioral treatments for tics. Additionally, while tic&#xD;
      disorders are associated with reduced quality of life measures, CBIT is 'tic-specific.'&#xD;
      Despite improving tics, measures do not show associated improved quality of life. Currently,&#xD;
      there are no standardized behavioral treatments for tics that account for ADHD symptoms&#xD;
      and/or addresses the impact that tics and ADHD symptoms have on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim is to develop a treatment protocol that combines elements from CBIT, Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for ADHD and factors targeting psychosocial impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim is to determine the treatment feasibility and acceptability (e.g. retention,&#xD;
      reasons for treatment refusal and dropout, and motivation) of this modified CBIT treatment.&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate and assess the randomization process, the treatment modules,&#xD;
      and the expectations and satisfaction of the participants and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final aim is to use a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) design to evaluate improvement&#xD;
      using measures including tic, ADHD and quality of life scales as rated by a blinded&#xD;
      clinician. Though the investigators will evaluate efficacy of the modified protocol, the&#xD;
      primary purpose will remain feasibility. The hope is to use this study to develop larger&#xD;
      trials in the future.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Comprehensive behavior intervention for tics (CBIT) is a first-line behavioral treatment for&#xD;
      individuals with tic disorders. However, the benefit of CBIT is mitigated in those with&#xD;
      co-occurring ADHD, as ADHD is negatively associated with effect size in behavioral treatments&#xD;
      for tics. Additionally, while tic disorders are associated with reduced quality of life&#xD;
      measures, CBIT is 'tic-specific.' Despite improving tics, measures do not show associated&#xD;
      improved quality of life. Currently, there are no standardized behavioral treatments for tics&#xD;
      that account for ADHD symptoms and/or address the impact that tics and ADHD symptoms have on&#xD;
      quality of life. The main purpose of this trial is to develop and then investigate the&#xD;
      effects of a modified comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) protocol for&#xD;
      children and adolescents with chronic tic disorders and ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Development a treatment protocol. The first aim is to develop a treatment protocol&#xD;
      that combines elements from CBIT, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for ADHD, and factors&#xD;
      targeting psychosocial impairment. A new treatment protocol, called &quot;Living With Tics&quot; was&#xD;
      recently developed by Dr. Eric Storch et al to help improve quality of life in those with tic&#xD;
      disorders. In addition to incorporating components of modules of the above listed treatments,&#xD;
      the modules themselves will be adapted to be more accessible to those with ADHD. As tic&#xD;
      disorders often have a significant impact on the family, the investigators will incorporate&#xD;
      parent involvement into the treatment as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Treatment Feasibility and Acceptability. The investigators' second aim is to determine&#xD;
      the treatment feasibility and acceptability of the developed protocol. They will examine the&#xD;
      retention rates, reasons for treatment refusal and dropout, and subject/parents motivation&#xD;
      for this modified CBIT treatment. They plan to evaluate and assess the randomization process,&#xD;
      the treatment modules, and the expectations and satisfaction of the participants and their&#xD;
      parents. They will use measures including expectancy and satisfaction scales, and Likert&#xD;
      scales will be provided at the end of each session to help determine which components of the&#xD;
      modules were most and/or least helpful. From those results, the investigators can continue to&#xD;
      adapt the treatment protocol for future, larger studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Pilot test the treatment's effectiveness. The final aim is to conduct a pilot&#xD;
      randomized control trial (RCT) to test the developed protocol in youth with tic disorders and&#xD;
      co-morbid ADHD. Half the subjects will undergo treatment with the modified protocol, and half&#xD;
      of the subjects will receive standard CBIT treatment. A broad range of outcome measures will&#xD;
      be used to evaluate tic symptoms, ADHD symptoms, and quality of life, and predictors of&#xD;
      treatment response will be explored. The following scales will be used: Yale Global Tic&#xD;
      Severity Scale (YGTSS), NICHQ Vanderbilt Assessment Scales, and Pediatric Quality of Life&#xD;
      Inventory-Child Version (PedsQL) scale, as rated by a blinded clinician. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators will compare which components were most/least helpful to subjects. Though the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate efficacy of the modified protocol, the primary purpose will&#xD;
      remain feasibility. The investigators hope to use this study to develop larger randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modified CBIT treatment will be based on the original CBIT protocol developed by Dr. John&#xD;
      Piacentini et al in 2010, a CBT for ADHD in adolescents protocol recently developed by Dr.&#xD;
      Susan Sprich et al, and Dr. Eric Storch's &quot;Living with Tics&quot; protocol. Techniques from other&#xD;
      studies, which combined and adapted protocols will be incorporated as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be divided into three phases: Evaluation/Psychoeducation, Basic&#xD;
      Intervention, and Relapse Prevention, with a total of 12 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to beginning the treatment, to make sure the subject qualifies, parent(s) and subject&#xD;
      will be asked to come in to complete a baseline assessment component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation/Psychoeducation (Sessions 1-2): The first 1-2 sessions will focus on assessing the&#xD;
      subject's tics and ADHD symptoms, and assessing the impact of tics and ADHD on the subjects'&#xD;
      lives. Psychoeducation about tics/Tourette Syndrome and ADHD, and the CBIT and CBT models&#xD;
      will be provided. The therapist will create a hierarchy with the patient regarding which tics&#xD;
      are most bothersome and what other symptoms/stressors are most impactful on everyday life.&#xD;
      Planning and organizing skills and the idea of function-based interventions will also be&#xD;
      introduced. Participants will be encouraged to bring their parent(s) to these initial&#xD;
      assessment sessions to familiarize the parent(s) with the treatment methods and allow them to&#xD;
      ask questions about tics and ADHD and/or the intervention. If appropriate, parents will be&#xD;
      involved in the treatment or homework procedures, but this will vary depending on the comfort&#xD;
      level and potential benefit as assessed for each child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic Interventions (Session 3 to Session 10): Beginning in Session 3, basic CBIT, cognitive&#xD;
      and behavioral methods will be taught during office sessions and assigned as homework&#xD;
      throughout the treatment. In addition to including modules that will specifically target ADHD&#xD;
      symptoms (such as those on organization and planning and distractibility), modules in general&#xD;
      will be designed to target an ADHD population. Modules will include a combination of activity&#xD;
      schedules, positive reinforcements to promote on-task behavior, short &quot;brain breaks&quot; in&#xD;
      between activities, repetition of key concepts, and the use of visual aides during the&#xD;
      sessions and between sessions at home. Handouts describing the topics covered will also be&#xD;
      provided to the parent/patient at the conclusion of each session. Relaxation techniques will&#xD;
      be incorporated. Some adapted modules from &quot;Living with Tics&quot; will be included depending on&#xD;
      the patients' identified difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapse Prevention (Sessions 11-12): The final sessions, each spaced two weeks after the last&#xD;
      session, will focus on relapse prevention. The purpose of the spaced sessions in to allow the&#xD;
      patient to get more practice and learn to be their own therapist in between meetings.&#xD;
      Residual problems and fears about ending treatment will be addressed, and unrealistically&#xD;
      optimistic or pessimistic thoughts about treatment termination will be challenged. Patients&#xD;
      will learn to anticipate possible symptom recurrence and its relationship to stress, mood,&#xD;
      and other factors; counter negative thoughts about setbacks; and handle lapses and setbacks.&#xD;
      Parents will also be encouraged to attend the last session(s) if the child/adolescent or&#xD;
      clinician feels it would be appropriate.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a DSM-5-based diagnosis of Tourette Syndrome or Persistent Motor or Vocal Tic&#xD;
             Disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a diagnosis of ADHD by DSM-5 standards, or a previous diagnosis of ADHD where&#xD;
             there are some residual symptoms (at least 7/18) but does not currently meet&#xD;
             diagnostic criteria due to current medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Tic disorder is the most problematic psychiatric disorder and the primary reason for&#xD;
             seeking treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have a current total tic severity score of &gt;13 (or &gt;9 if CTD) on the Yale Global Tic&#xD;
             Severity Score (YGTSS), and a current total impairment score of &gt;19 on the YGTSS&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Be male or female and between 10-17 years of age at the start of the treatment,&#xD;
             inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Be able to communicate meaningfully with the investigators and be competent to provide&#xD;
             written assent; both parental informed consent and adolescent assent must be obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Be English speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Comorbid psychiatric diagnoses including: alcohol or substance abuse or dependence&#xD;
             within the past 3 months, psychosis, organic mental disorder, current mania,&#xD;
             developmental delay, estimated IQ &lt;80 on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of&#xD;
             Intelligence (WASI), other cognitive impairment that would interfere with ability to&#xD;
             engage in CBT, or other developmental/cognitive impairment that precludes the&#xD;
             participant from being able to communicate meaningfully with the treater&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Those deemed to pose a serious suicidal or homicidal threat (e.g., suicide attempt&#xD;
             within past 6 months and/or endorsement of &quot;I want to kill myself&quot; on the Children's&#xD;
             Depression Inventory (CDI)).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current illness (tics or otherwise) so severe that an immediate psychopharmacological&#xD;
             evaluation is warranted&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any clinical features requiring a higher level of care than outpatient (as determined&#xD;
             by evaluator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Intent to travel for a period longer than two weeks (such that three sessions would be&#xD;
             missed) during the proposed time-frame of the study. However, this criterion may be&#xD;
             waived as per the discretion of the Principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. In general, the participant cannot be engaged in concurrent psychotherapy - if they&#xD;
             are, they would need to stop (no lag time required between stopping current therapy&#xD;
             and beginning this intervention). Decisions can be made on a case by case basis if the&#xD;
             therapy is for a concern/disorder separate from mood, anxiety or OCD-spectrum&#xD;
             disorders (e.g. gender dysphoria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Four or more sessions of previous CBT treatment similar to the current treatment (CBIT&#xD;
             and/or CBT for ADHD) within the last five years&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participants can be receiving psychotropic medication, but they must be on a stable&#xD;
             dose for four weeks prior to the study baseline assessment and maintain this dosage&#xD;
             throughout the course of the study. If a potential participant is taking psychotropic&#xD;
             medication at the time of the phone evaluation or the first in-person study assessment&#xD;
             and wishes to discontinue this medication to enter the trial, the participant will be&#xD;
             asked to discuss this option with their prescribing physician to determine whether&#xD;
             medication discontinuation would be safe and in the participant's best interest. We&#xD;
             will not influence the decision or procedures participants choose with their&#xD;
             prescribing physician. If the participant decides to discontinue treatment with the&#xD;
             psychotropic medication, he/she must wait for four weeks before receiving a baseline&#xD;
             assessment.&#xD;
