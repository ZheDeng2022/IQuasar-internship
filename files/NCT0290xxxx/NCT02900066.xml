  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is part of a larger prospective cohort study (JOKA), designed to study febrile&#xD;
      illness occurring during a travel to the tropics, as well as the evaluation of the clinical&#xD;
      use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) by travelers or their peers during travel, as a&#xD;
      decision aid for the management of febrile illness in the tropics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Filter paper blood spots and paired serology are used in addition to routine post-travel&#xD;
      evaluation, to study the incidence and etiological spectrum of febrile illness occurring&#xD;
      during travel to the tropics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will yield valuable and prospective data of incidence rate, the clinical and&#xD;
      etiological spectrum, clinical course and outcome of febrile illness during (and post-)travel&#xD;
      in a prospective cohorts of travelers. This knowledge may lead to better pre-travel advice.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the incidence etiological spectrum of febrile illness occurring during a travel to&#xD;
      the tropics, as well as clinical course, care, treatment and outcome of these febrile illness&#xD;
      episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective cohort study of febrile illness in international travelers Population:&#xD;
      Travelers who are going to destinations in the tropics (South-East Asia (SEA), Sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa (SSA) and South America (SCA)) for 3 weeks or longer will be invited to participate&#xD;
      and, after obtaining informed consent, recruited in the study protocol(s) at the time of&#xD;
      planning departure (directly at the ITM or through travel/ humanitarian relief&#xD;
      organizations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be offered pre-, per- and post-travel consultation as explained below&#xD;
      (Inclusion through ITM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Pre-travel consultation at a certified travel clinic will systematically be recommended;&#xD;
      this consultation will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. routine travel advice directed at travel destination, (including vaccinations and&#xD;
           prescription for anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis according to current recommendations,&#xD;
           details of which are published at www.reisgeneeskunde.be and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the following research-related activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Briefing sessions on the topic &quot;Fever in The Tropics&quot; by an ITM physician (during&#xD;
                this session the differences between fever at home and in the tropics will be&#xD;
                addressed and the importance of consulting a local doctor will be stressed).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collection and recording of demographic, clinical and travel data.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sampling of a baseline serum sample (for paired pre- and post-travel diagnostic&#xD;
                analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Training of travelers, peers and travel guides to blot capillary blood on a filter&#xD;
                paper (training is a prerequisite for study participation).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Provision of study materials (study diary/apps, malaria kits, thermometer, …) and&#xD;
                written instructions for use during travel if fever occurs (see below)&#xD;
&#xD;
                2. During travel&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In case of any illness (associated with fever or not), the traveler will record&#xD;
                symptoms in the study diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If fever is documented (axillary temperature ≥ 37.8°C - or in case a thermometer is&#xD;
                not immediately available, fever sensation in association with sweats or chills)-&#xD;
                blood from a finger prick will be collected for blotting onto filter paper (BFP) by&#xD;
                trained travelers or peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All febrile travelers are advised to seek medical attendance as they would do when&#xD;
                not participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The final decision to use standby emergency treatment malaria treatment (SBET) is&#xD;
                made by the study participant, in accordance with precise and written instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The study team (Tropical medicine experts at ITM) will be available for&#xD;
                teleconsultation by Email or Telephone, and will provide medical advice within 12&#xD;
                hours. Note: contacting the ITM study team is an option, but should not cause delay&#xD;
                in treating suspected malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study participants will collect all relevant data related to the (outcome of the)&#xD;
                illness episode (duration of symptoms, consultation of a health practitioner,&#xD;
                admission/duration of stay in a hospital, treatment received and timing,&#xD;
                repatriation)&#xD;
&#xD;
                3. Post-travel consultation will be scheduled for all study participants who&#xD;
                experience(d) any illness (febrile or not) within a week after travel- sooner if&#xD;
                the medical condition requires so- and for those who have no complaints but do seek&#xD;
                post-travel health evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A structured clinical evaluation will be performed by an expert in travel medicine&#xD;
                and will be recorded in the database. Laboratory evaluation will include&#xD;
                hematological, biochemical and microbiological/parasitological analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Used BFPs (i.e. in case of febrile illness during travel) will be collected for&#xD;
                confirmation of the test result by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). A diagnostic&#xD;
                protocol/ algorithm will be developed for use the BFPs as a source for post-travel&#xD;
                diagnosis of arboviral/ rickettsial infection by PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Data analysis : All data (demographic, geographic, clinical, laboratory and&#xD;
                     final diagnosis) will be recorded in an encoded database. Descriptive and&#xD;
                     inferential statistics as appropriate, STATA 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Sample size: n= 350 fever cases; at an incidence of fever of 8% a cohort of&#xD;
                     4400 (healthy) travelers will be recruited over 30 months (Feb 2016 - Aug&#xD;
                     2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incidence rates for malaria and arboviral/ rickettsial infections (by paired&#xD;
                serology and post-travel PCR on BFP) per travel destination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical course and outcomes of (self-)management of febrile illness during travel.&#xD;
                (Clinical spectrum of disease, incidence rates of febrile illnesses; duration of&#xD;
                fever and other symptoms, management (self-treatment, consultation, admission),&#xD;
                type of treatment (symptomatic/empiric/targeted if RDT malaria positive), final&#xD;
                outcome (change of travel plans, repatriation, hospitalization as a result of&#xD;
                illness during travel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and relevance: The study will yield valuable and prospective data of&#xD;
      incidence rate, the clinical and etiological spectrum, clinical course and outcome of febrile&#xD;
      illness during (and post-)travel in a prospective cohorts of travelers. This knowledge may&#xD;
      lead to better pre-travel advice.&#xD;
