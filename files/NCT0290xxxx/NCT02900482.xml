      The main objective is to identify the genes involved in congenital dislocation of the hip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to measure the association between mechanical risk factors and&#xD;
      congenital dislocation of hip and study the interactions between these factors and genetic&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Congenital hip dislocation (CHD) is one of the most frequent skeleton abnormalities in the&#xD;
      Caucasian population (incidence: 2-10 / 1000). This disease results from an abnormality of&#xD;
      the reports of the femoral head with the acetabulum, generated by a morphological defect of&#xD;
      the cavity and / or joint hypermobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This condition is now defined as a multifactorial disease involving in the one hand,&#xD;
      mechanical factors related to the conditions of pregnancy and childbirth, and secondly,&#xD;
      genetic factors suggested by ethnic predisposition and familial aggregation observed. Despite&#xD;
      the neonatal screening, CHD remains a public health problem because of its high frequency,&#xD;
      because of the functional handicap which it leads in case of late diagnosis and of its&#xD;
      natural evolution to coxarthrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHD was the object of a significant number of publications on the difficult aspects of its&#xD;
      screening and treatment but, at the moment, few data are available on the genetic factors&#xD;
      involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genetic studies led on the CHD based on studies of case-control associations, focused on&#xD;
      candidate genes, and genetic linkage analysis, two strategies classically used in genetic&#xD;
      epidemiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, these strategies did not allow to elucidate the genetic determinism of the&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The considerable progress made in recent years both in the field of knowledge of the human&#xD;
      genome and its variability, in the development of methodological and technological tools&#xD;
      allow to better understand the genetic determinism of complex diseases such as CHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of the techniques of broadband sequencing, new generation said sequencing&#xD;
      (NGS for Next Generation Sequencing) makes indeed accessible the sequencing of the whole&#xD;
      genome or of the set of its coding regions (exome) and now allows identify rare variants,&#xD;
      that is to say variants having a minor allele frequency of less than 1%. These variants were&#xD;
      previously not recognizable by the strategies traditionally used in genetic epidemiology,&#xD;
      which are based on the study of common variants (minor allele frequency of ≥ 5%) listed in&#xD;
      the public databases of the human genome .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NGS sequencing technique makes it possible to address the problem of the study of complex&#xD;
      diseases in a new light and it appears necessary to apply this strategy to the CHD to search&#xD;
      for genetic factors involved in the pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genetic analysis strategy initially envisaged consisted of a genome wide association&#xD;
      study (GWAS), which aims to genotype millions of frequent genetic markers scattered along the&#xD;
      genome and to test their association with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technological advances made in the field of molecular genetics since the implementation&#xD;
      of the GENETHIP protocol have made it possible to envisage new strategies to identify the&#xD;
      genetic factors involved in a complex disease such as CHD. These strategies include&#xD;
      high-throughput sequencing - Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) - which now makes sequencing of&#xD;
      all coding regions of the genome (exome) possible. Beyond the frequent variants, this&#xD;
      technique also makes it possible to identify rare variants (frequency of the minor allele&#xD;
      &lt;1%), not analyzed by the strategy initially envisaged in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was therefore decided to adopt this new strategy in the GENETHIP study. The sample size&#xD;
      could be reduced as the average frequency of the minor allele is lower with this type of&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new genetic strategy adopted nevertheless requires the inclusion of selected phenotypes,&#xD;
      which leads to recruiting exclusively patients with a family history of congenital hip&#xD;
      disorders and excluding those who have had a presentation by the seat (main mechanical risk&#xD;
      factor of the CHD). This is intended to better target the genetic character of the pathology.&#xD;
