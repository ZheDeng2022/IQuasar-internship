      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the CURVE Low-Level&#xD;
      Laser Therapy for circumference reduction of the waistline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involves research to obtain information on the CURVE. In recent years Low Level&#xD;
      Laser therapy devices have grown in popularity due to increased scientific understanding of&#xD;
      their mechanism of action, published research, and patients demand for more non-invasive&#xD;
      procedures in body contour and fat reduction. LLL are widely used in health clinics, medical&#xD;
      spas and in aesthetic medicine in the treatment of cellulite and for inflammatory conditions&#xD;
      such as carpal tunnel syndrome. This study will further evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      low-level laser treatments without the extraction of adipose tissue using liposuction or in&#xD;
      combination with other treatment modalities.&#xD;

    <description>Up to 20 subjects assigned to the sham group will be treated with a device that is designed to have the same physical appearance as the treatment group, except that the interlock fuse (grey fuse holder back of device) will be removed prior to treatment. The laser screen will still be active and show to the subject that the treatment time will still be counting down, but will not activate lasers in the treatment paddles</description>
