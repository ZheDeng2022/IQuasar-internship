  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial Diseases are rare, progressive, multi-system, often-early fatal disorders&#xD;
      affecting both children and adults. KH176 is a novel chemical entity currently under&#xD;
      development for the treatment of inherited mitochondrial diseases, including MELAS&#xD;
      (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes), MIDD&#xD;
      (Maternally Inherited Diabetes and Deafness), Leigh's Disease and LHON (Leber's Hereditary&#xD;
      Optic Neuropathy). The current Proof of Concept study aims to explore the effects of&#xD;
      treatment with KH176 for 4 weeks on clinical signs and symptoms and biomarkers of&#xD;
      mitochondrial disease and to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of KH176 in patients&#xD;
      with m.3242A&gt;G related mitochondrial disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-centre, two-way&#xD;
      cross-over trial. Twenty patients, with a confirmed mitochondrial DNA tRNALeu(UUR) m.3243A&gt;G&#xD;
      mutation and with clinical signs of mitochondrial disease, will be randomized over 2 groups&#xD;
      (active or placebo first). After a screening period and a training session, each group will&#xD;
      have 2 dosing periods of 28 days, with a washout period of at least 28 days in between. On&#xD;
      these occasions, patients will receive 100 mg KH176 twice daily (treatment A) or a matching&#xD;
      placebo (treatment B) twice daily for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessments will be performed once in a training session prior to baseline, at&#xD;
      baseline and in week 4 post dosing during each treatment phase (A and B). Testing conditions&#xD;
      and circumstances, with respect to timing of the assessments, hospitalization and meals, will&#xD;
      be standardized for each assessement period. Furthermore, assessments of biomarkers for&#xD;
      mitochondrial functioning, pharmacokinetics and specific safety assessments will be performed&#xD;
      weekly.&#xD;
