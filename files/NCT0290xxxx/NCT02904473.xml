  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      the GROWell diet intervention. The objective of this study is to determine whether the&#xD;
      GROWell intervention can help transition women from consuming a Western diet to consuming a&#xD;
      prudent diet (characterized by consumption of primarily fruits, vegetables, healthy fats,&#xD;
      lean proteins, and whole grains) during pregnancy. Efficacy will be measured as change in&#xD;
      dietary components, using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline and at a follow up&#xD;
      visit at 37 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GROWell intervention is a mobile health technology that uses interactive text messaging&#xD;
      and dietician coaching calls, and may be effective in transitioning pregnant women from a&#xD;
      Western to a prudent diet during an approximately 6 month intervention period. GROWell&#xD;
      results will be measured against an Attention Support Control (ASC) arm, where participants&#xD;
      will receive messaging that is pregnancy rather than diet focused, and a Usual Care (USC)&#xD;
      arm, where participants will not receive text messages or study coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will be used to support a grant submission for a larger study, aiming&#xD;
      to investigate the GROWell intervention and prudent diet consumption as preventatives against&#xD;
      postpartum depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GROWell intervention is a mobile health technology, including diet tracking, skills&#xD;
      training and tailored feedback based on digital and human support strategies. Its structure&#xD;
      is based on the iOTA (interactive obesity treatment approach), designed for dietary change,&#xD;
      obesity, and chronic disease management, with message content modified for healthy diet&#xD;
      change during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROWell incorporates 4 elements: phone coaching, goal setting, self-monitoring of behavior&#xD;
      and skills training. These interactions take place on a study subject's cell phone, through&#xD;
      text messaging, and phone calls with a dietician coach. At the initiation of the&#xD;
      intervention, the subject takes a short survey, after which the intervention algorithm&#xD;
      assigns up to 4 tailored behavior change goals from the GROWell library. Examples of goals&#xD;
      would be to eliminate fast food from the diet, or to limit red meat. Goals are tailored to&#xD;
      the subject's needs as indicated by the initial survey, so if for example the subject doesn't&#xD;
      eat fast food, that goal is not assigned. The algorithm prioritizes behaviors in highest need&#xD;
      of change, and those for which participant has high self-efficacy and readiness based on the&#xD;
      survey responses. Subjects self-monitor adherence weekly via text, responding to prompts from&#xD;
      the system regarding their level of success with a given goal. Via text they receive&#xD;
      immediate tailored feedback regarding their current adherence and long-term progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback includes showing progress trends, reinforcing success, and offering motivational&#xD;
      strategies to support behavior change based on the self-monitoring data. To support the next&#xD;
      week's efforts, the algorithm tailors feedback, selecting content from a skills training&#xD;
      library and sending materials to assist behavior change efforts. Skills training materials&#xD;
      include online handouts, featuring content that discusses the adoption of healthy dietary&#xD;
      changes in pregnancy. A set of skills training materials exists for each goal in the library.&#xD;
      When a subject is assigned a goal, they receive a link to the training materials for that&#xD;
      goal over the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human support component of the intervention relies in part on the GROWell platform's&#xD;
      interface, which allows diet coaches to view participant data. This information is then used&#xD;
      to inform feedback during coaching calls. These 15-minute conversations will be guided by&#xD;
      principles of motivational interviewing (MI). In each session, the dietician coach and the&#xD;
      subject will discuss self-monitoring data and reinforce its importance, discuss barrier&#xD;
      reduction strategies and skills training content, and engaging community resources. The&#xD;
      GROWell study will implement a series of dietician coaching calls starting weekly for the&#xD;
      first month and decreasing in frequency to biweekly during the study period, totaling&#xD;
      approximately 12 calls depending on delivery date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ASC control arm of the study involves more limited intervention. There will be one&#xD;
      coaching call at baseline, regarding prenatal diet. Weekly text or IVR messages will focus on&#xD;
      pregnancy, labor, delivery, and early infancy education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The USC will receive no intervention. They will simply complete baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants on all arms may opt to have blood drawn at the baseline visit and the follow up&#xD;
      visit for an optional biomarker study.&#xD;
