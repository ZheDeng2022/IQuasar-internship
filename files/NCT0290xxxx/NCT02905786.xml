  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) imposes a burden for patients and health economics. Although guidelines&#xD;
      exist, they are not implemented as such in the Belgian health care system. General&#xD;
      practitioners (GPs) are confronted with the broadest range of HF management. Therefore, a&#xD;
      multifaceted intervention will be implemented in Belgian general practice to support GPs in&#xD;
      the implementation of evidence-based HF guidelines. This multifaceted intervention will&#xD;
      consist of audit and feedback as a method to detect unrecognized HF patients and increase&#xD;
      awareness for proactive HF management. Additionally, a NT-proBNP point-of-care test will be&#xD;
      offered to every practice to improve detection and adequate diagnosis of HF patients.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a specialist HF nurse will assist GPs in education of patients, optimization of&#xD;
      treatment and transition of care. The investigators' aim is evaluating the feasibility of the&#xD;
      implementation of this multifaceted intervention in general practice and the evolution in&#xD;
      predefined quality indicators.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of a multifaceted intervention&#xD;
      to optimize care for HF patients in Belgian general practice. It is not a primary objective&#xD;
      to study the effectiveness of the intervention on the defined outcomes, since follow-up might&#xD;
      be too short, however the evolution in quality will be evaluated. Specific research questions&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do general practitioners use the NT-proBNP POC test and how does it influence practice?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do general practitioners use the assistance of the HF nurse and how does it influence&#xD;
           practice?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does this intervention improve quality of care for HF patients in primary care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does this intervention improve quality of life for HF patients in primary care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Is this intervention/data collection method feasible? How do participating GPs and&#xD;
           investigators experience the interventions?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements at baseline and after 6 months of follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline demographic data on patient age, gender, years since the diagnosis of HF,&#xD;
           cardiovascular comorbidities (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, valvular heart&#xD;
           disease, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease),&#xD;
           non-cardiovascular comorbidities (diabetes, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
           disease, dementia), the last two blood pressure measurements, last 2 creatinine&#xD;
           measurements and the last two values of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR),&#xD;
           last date of GP consultation, involvement of cardiologist (yes/no), last date of&#xD;
           cardiologist appointment, echocardiography (yes/no), last date of echocardiography&#xD;
           report, ejection fraction (EF), diastolic dysfunction (yes/no), clinically relevant&#xD;
           valvular dysfunction (yes/no), left ventricular hypertrophy (yes/no), left atrial&#xD;
           enlargement (yes/no) and heart failure treatment with dosage (diuretics, ACE-I, ARB,&#xD;
           B-blockers, MRA, digoxin) will be collected. Additionally, the number of chronic&#xD;
           medications and the number of chronic comorbidities will be collected. Furthermore, the&#xD;
           MLHF-Q will be collected to evaluate patients' quality of life and grip strength (only&#xD;
           at baseline) as a predictor of functional decline, disability and mortality. At&#xD;
           baseline, HF hospitalization during the last three years will be registered based on&#xD;
           discharge letters in the EHR. All hospitalizations and mortality will be collected at&#xD;
           practice level during the study course. Data on physician age, gender, years of&#xD;
           experience and practice organization (group/single-handed/number of practitioners/EMHS)&#xD;
           will be requested as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be extracted from the EHR of the general practitioner for all patients who&#xD;
      satisfy the eligibility criteria. Data will be extracted at baseline and after 6 months.&#xD;
      First, at baseline and after 6 months, all patients with a registered diagnosis of HF will be&#xD;
      identified in the EMHS. Demographic data can be extracted with an automated search; other&#xD;
      data will need to be collected by manual chart review. Additionally, all identified HF&#xD;
      patients will be visited by the HF nurse at baseline and after 6 months and will be asked to&#xD;
      fill in the MLHF-Q. At this occasion grip strength will be measured in the dominant hand&#xD;
      using a JAMARÂ® Plus digital hand-held dynamometer. Three attempts at maximal squeeze will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPs will be asked to fill in a study registration form about the indication and results of&#xD;
      their NT-proBNP POC test use and how it influenced their decision-making. The HF nurse will&#xD;
      keep a log of all actions. Consequence of these actions will be collected from the patients'&#xD;
      medical record. GPs will be asked to take note of the HF nurse advice in the EHR and indicate&#xD;
      if it influenced decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiences of GPs and investigators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feedback meeting at 6 months will be organized as a focus group in each GP practice to&#xD;
      get more insight in the experiences of the participating physicians and investigators. The&#xD;
      meetings will be audiotaped and typed out. Any harm as a result of the trial will be&#xD;
      explicitly collected and reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practice level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of the intervention on hospitalizations and mortality cannot be studied in this pilot&#xD;
      trial, however, in a later stage this would be the outcome in the larger cluster-randomized&#xD;
      trial, therefore, the feasibility of collecting data on hospitalizations and mortality will&#xD;
      be tested. These outcomes will be measured at practice level in all patients aged 40 years or&#xD;
      older, enlisted in one of the participating GP practices. GPs will be asked to register date&#xD;
      of death and cause of death in the EHR of all patients who die during the study course. A&#xD;
      list of hospitalized patients of each participating GP will be collected in all the&#xD;
      surrounding hospitals (ZOL Genk, AZ Vesalius, Jessa Hasselt) and handed over to the GPs.&#xD;
      Cause of hospitalization will be deducted from the discharge letter in the EHR by the GP in a&#xD;
      standardized manner (trained by principal investigator (PI)). The anonymized data will be&#xD;
      handed over to the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and data entries will be done by the PI and an assisting data manager. All&#xD;
      patient data will be coded and anonymized. All other authors will have full access to the&#xD;
      coded data (including statistical reports and tables) in the study and will be able to take&#xD;
      responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be provided regarding baseline variables of the HF patients and&#xD;
      general practitioners/general practices. Outcomes measured before and after the study&#xD;
      intervention will be compared with a chi-squared test. Experiences of participating GPs and&#xD;
      investigators will be analyzed qualitatively using thematic analysis as method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study start the investigators will present the participating physicians with an&#xD;
      informed consent that outlines the intervention and the purpose of the trial. Additionally,&#xD;
      all identified HF patients will be visited by the HF nurse before the start of the study. On&#xD;
      that occasion the HF nurse will inform all HF patients about the study outline and purpose&#xD;
      and ask informed consent. Furthermore, patients eligible for a NT-proBNP POC test will be&#xD;
      informed by their GPs about the study outline and purpose and asked informed consent.&#xD;
      However, informed consent cannot be sought for all patients on practice level&#xD;
      (hospitalizations/mortality). Therefore, information about the study intervention and purpose&#xD;
      of the trial will be presented on a poster in each practice, visible for all patients, who&#xD;
      can opt-out if they object to study participation.&#xD;
