      The purpose of this pilot project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a behavioral economic&#xD;
      intervention to increase use of continuous glucose monitors (CGM) in adolescents and young&#xD;
      adults with T1D. This study will be done in conjunction with Nancy Petry, PhD and her&#xD;
      research team at University of Connecticut School of Medicine (UConn Health). The&#xD;
      intervention will reinforce patients for wearing CGM and for uploading it and reviewing its&#xD;
      data. A 6-month pilot trial will be conducted with up to 20 patients receiving the&#xD;
      intervention. The specific aims are:&#xD;

      The purpose of this pilot project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a behavioral economic&#xD;
      intervention to increase use of continuous glucose monitors (CGM) in adolescents and young&#xD;
      adults with T1D. This study will be done in conjunction with Nancy Petry, PhD and her&#xD;
      research team at University of Connecticut School of Medicine (UConn Health). The&#xD;
      intervention will reinforce patients for wearing CGM and for uploading it and reviewing its&#xD;
      data. A 6-month pilot trial will be conducted with up to 20 patients receiving the&#xD;
      intervention. The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate how well a reinforcement intervention increases usage of CGM. The proportion&#xD;
           of days on which participants wear the CGM will be determined as well as the number of&#xD;
           weeks during which CGM is worn at least 5 days. We will compare usage rates in the pilot&#xD;
           trial to historical control data of patients initiating CGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the association between CGM usage and A1c. We expect A1c will decrease over&#xD;
           time in patients who receive the reinforcement intervention. Patients who continue using&#xD;
           the CGM are expected to have greater decreases in A1c than patients who discontinue its&#xD;
           usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations will be conducted at time of CGM initiation, and 6, 13, 19, 26, and 39 weeks&#xD;
      after treatment initiation to assess effects of the intervention and estimate effect sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the primary aims, secondary outcomes will also be evaluated. Continued use of&#xD;
      CGM is expected to improve aspects of diabetes management and daily functioning. Predictors&#xD;
      of continued CGM usage and improvements in A1c will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this pilot study will be instrumental for guiding a subsequent, larger and&#xD;
      longer term randomized study for evaluating reinforcement interventions for improving uptake&#xD;
      of CGM, other diabetes-related adherence behaviors, and long-term outcomes.&#xD;
