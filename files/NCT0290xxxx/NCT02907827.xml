      Patients with locally advanced melanoma are at high risk for recurrence following surgical&#xD;
      treatment. More patients with stage IV melanoma remain in complete remission following&#xD;
      systemic therapy. No standards have been established for the surveillance of patients at high&#xD;
      risk for recurrence. Whole-body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and cfDNA&#xD;
      analysis of blood are innovative imaging and laboratory investigations that may be of benefit&#xD;
      for early detection of recurrence in this patient population.&#xD;

      Cutaneous melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Melanoma is the malignant&#xD;
      cancer that originates from the melanocytes of the body (= pigmented cells of the body).&#xD;
      Melanoma can originate from the melanocytes that are present in the skin, mucosa, or the uvea&#xD;
      of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of melanoma is continuing to rise at a rate exceeding all other cancers. Every&#xD;
      year approximately 132,000 and 1,000 people will be diagnosed with melanoma and 37,000 and&#xD;
      250 people are expected to die of the disease respectively worldwide and in Belgium. Surgical&#xD;
      resection is curative for most cases of early identified and localized melanoma (90% long&#xD;
      term survival for stage I disease) . Patients with stage II/III disease are at high risk of&#xD;
      relapse after surgery, even when followed by radiotherapy and adjuvant IFN alfa-2b therapy&#xD;
      (the risk of recurrence for these patients is 60% to 75%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2010 Romano et al. published a study evaluating the time to relapse and the site of&#xD;
      relapse in 340 patients (Figure 1: relapse free survival of all 340 patients with substages&#xD;
      IIIA,IIIB and IIIc). Patients and/or family members discovered 62% of local and in-transit&#xD;
      recurrences and 49% of nodal recurrences. Only 37% of patients whose first recurrence was&#xD;
      systemic detected the recurrence themselves, either by noticing a new tumor or other symptoms&#xD;
      that led to further evaluation. Physical examination by a physician accounted for the&#xD;
      detection of 36% of the local and in-transit recurrences, Twenty-six percent of nodal&#xD;
      recurrences were detected by physicians however only in 9% systemic recurrences did they&#xD;
      discover systemic recurrence. In the remaining 63% of patients whose first detectable relapse&#xD;
      was systemic, the relapse was asymptomatic. Radiographic tests, largely CT scans (72%),&#xD;
      detected asymptomatic systemic relapses in 53% (n_87) of these patients. This study also&#xD;
      demonstrated the benefit of identifying early relaps, since symptomatic relapses, as opposed&#xD;
      to relapses discovered by physical examination or radiographic imaging, were associated with&#xD;
      shorter survival. And confirming that a recurrence that could be completely resected was&#xD;
      associated with longer survival (relative risk_2.31; 95% CI, 1.68 to 3.18; P_.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last several years the therapeutic landscape of melanoma has changed. The introduction&#xD;
      of immunotherapy has increased the life expectancy for melanoma stage IV patients and even&#xD;
      has the possibility for cure of the disease. This changes the need in screening. Since no&#xD;
      therapeutic options were available, there was no need for a strict follow-up. The primary&#xD;
      objective of follow-up in these patients with melanoma was to identify potentially curable&#xD;
      locoregional recurrences and second primary cancers. Optimal follow-up strategies and&#xD;
      intervals have not been determined, and there is no consensus. At a minimum, patients should&#xD;
      undergo an annual routine physical examination, including a full skin assessment and&#xD;
      palpation of the regional lymph nodes. The role of imaging in the follow-up of high risk&#xD;
      patients is not clear. Since the introduction of newer therapies, the need for a more closer&#xD;
      follow-up has emerged as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of patients with stage IV disease is grim with less than 50% of patients&#xD;
      surviving for more than 12 months. Short-lived tumor responses are obtained in about 10-20%&#xD;
      of patients treated with DTIC chemotherapy but no randomized trial could demonstrate a&#xD;
      survival benefit for more complex chemotherapy regimens or so-called bio-chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens despite higher response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In march 2011 a CTLA-4 inhibitor, Ipilimumab (Yervoy), was aproved by the FDA. It was the&#xD;
      first treatment to prove a survival benefit in melanoma patients. An interesting aspect about&#xD;
      the treatment with Ipilimumab is the plateau seen after 2 years.This plateau represents&#xD;
      patient with a long term survival benefit of Ipilimumab and even the possibility of 'cure'.&#xD;
      The patients in this population now undergo repeated imaging with PET CT and/or CT. This&#xD;
      leads to a high radiation burden for this patients. The DW-MRI could in this population have&#xD;
      a benefit.&#xD;
