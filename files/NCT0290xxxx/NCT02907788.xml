      Airway disease, featuring intense inflammation, is the main cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      in cystic fibrosis (CF). Mechanisms of CF airway inflammation remain unclear, hampering&#xD;
      development of better treatments.This time-sensitive ancillary study leverages a unique&#xD;
      longitudinal cohort of CF infants, assessing the early phase of airway disease. Through the&#xD;
      use of innovative cell and fluid based tools for in vivo profiling and in vitro testing of&#xD;
      BALF samples, this translational effort will yield unprecedented insights into mechanisms of&#xD;
      PMN dysfunction in CF, and assess new paths for early intervention.&#xD;

      Rationale: Airway disease, featuring early and intense inflammation and leading to&#xD;
      progressive lung damage, is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      (CF). Mechanisms of CF airway inflammation remain unclear, hampering development of better&#xD;
      treatments. Recent introduction of heel-prick screening for CF provides a unique longitudinal&#xD;
      cohort of CF infants, in which the early phase of airway disease can be assessed. In our&#xD;
      hospital the investigators set up a clinical protocol for monitoring these infants in a&#xD;
      structured way, using chest computed tomography (CT) and bronchoscopies with collection of&#xD;
      broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) to assess early lung damage. Our protocol is designed&#xD;
      according to the protocol used by the Australian AREST-CF consortium. Preliminary data show&#xD;
      that lipid profiles differ in BALF from CF infants with a high score for lung damage,&#xD;
      compared with a low score (minimal lung damage). Some of these lipids are products of&#xD;
      activated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN's). Others are receptor-activating molecules&#xD;
      involved in the resolution of inflammation and tissue injury. Also, in a pilot study, it was&#xD;
      shown that CF airway PMNs are differently programmed than in normal airways, which leads to&#xD;
      increased release of inflammatory factors and toxic enzymes. The hypothesize is that CFTR&#xD;
      deficiency causes abnormal inflammatory signaling in the lung of CF infants, resulting in&#xD;
      abnormal programming of infiltrating PMNs, and subsequently excessive and chronic lung&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To better understand the progression of early CF lung disease the investigators&#xD;
      aim to study lipid profiles and PMN dysfunction in relation to the severity of early lung&#xD;
      disease in infants with CF, using BALF samples and peripheral blood. To optimally study these&#xD;
      very precious samples, the investigators will make use of state-of-the-art technologies for&#xD;
      in vivo profiling and in vitro testing of PMN function, including lipidomics and innovative&#xD;
      cell- and fluid-based tools. Understanding the mechanisms at play in CF airway inflammation&#xD;
      as it occurs in infants may lead to new paths for early intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Observational, exploratory in vitro study in BALF and peripheral blood from&#xD;
      infants with CF, correlated with clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Children with CF diagnosed by heel-prick screening, who have a bronchoscopy&#xD;
      and chest-CT for their annual check-up, at age 3 months (Utrecht),1, 3 or 5 years are&#xD;
      eligible. Informed consent will be obtained from the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The bronchoscopy done to collect BALF is part of the routine clinical&#xD;
      monitoring program. For this study, BALF that is not used for clinical testing will be used.&#xD;
      Furthermore, venous puncture is performed for clinical routine blood tests, and one extra&#xD;
      vial of EDTA blood will be drawn.&#xD;
