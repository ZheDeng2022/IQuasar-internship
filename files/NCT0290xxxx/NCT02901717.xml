    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, open-label, assess-blind study to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of MLT, a novel antibiotic lock therapy that combines minocycline with&#xD;
      edetate disodium in 25% ethanol solution as an adjuctive therapy for the treatment of&#xD;
      catheter-related or central line associated bloodstream infection (CRBSI/CLABSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 144 subjects who have been diagnosed with CRBSI/CLABSI and who meet all&#xD;
      necessary criteria for the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MLT Arm: Mino-Lok therapy; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control Arm: Antibiotic lock (±heparin). The antibiotic lock (ALT) should be comprised&#xD;
           of the best available therapy at the sites based on standard institutional practices or&#xD;
           recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind study to determine the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of MLT, a novel antibiotic lock therapy that combines minocycline with edetate&#xD;
      disodium in 25% ethanol solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mino-Lok Therapy is being developed as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of&#xD;
      catheter-related or central line associated bloodstream infection (CRBSI/CLABSI) in&#xD;
      combination with appropriate systemic antibiotic(s), to preserve central venous access and to&#xD;
      avoid the complications and morbidities associated with catheter removal and reinsertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 144 subjects who have been diagnosed with CRBSI/CLABSI and who meet all&#xD;
      necessary criteria for the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MLT Arm: MLT + SOC intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control Arm (subjects randomized to the Control Arm will receive treatment based on the&#xD;
           type and virulence of the infecting organism as documented by the Investigator prior to&#xD;
           randomization): The antibiotic lock should be comprised of the best available therapy at&#xD;
           the sites. Prior to randomization, the Investigator at each site will determine the&#xD;
           antibiotic used in the lock, the dose, the dwell time, and the number of days of&#xD;
           administration (minimum of 7 days) based on standard institutional practices or&#xD;
           recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. In&#xD;
           the event that the subject is being treated with more than 1 systemic SOC IV antibiotic,&#xD;
           the Investigator will specify a single antibiotic that should be used for the antibiotic&#xD;
           lock. It is acceptable for the SOC antibiotic lock to differ from the SOC IV&#xD;
           antibiotics, as necessary per local SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All infecting organism types are permitted (eg, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Candida spp.,&#xD;
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Randomization will be stratified by type of CVC, presence of&#xD;
      neutropenia, and by virulence of the infecting organism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for this study is the time (in days following randomization) to a&#xD;
      catheter failure event between randomization and TOC (Week 6) in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT)&#xD;
      Population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A catheter failure event is ANY of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All-cause mortality at TOC (Week 6). The event time is the day of death;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catheter removal for any infection-related reasons (including worsening of symptoms or&#xD;
           failure to eradicate the infection). The event time is the day the catheter is removed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inability to administer study drug. The event time is the day the Investigator&#xD;
           determines the catheter is no longer functional;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Worsening of systemic signs and symptoms of infection that result in change in systemic&#xD;
           anti infective treatment. Note that changes in treatment based on susceptibility data&#xD;
           will be permitted. The event time is the day the treatment is changed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstration that the baseline pathogen is not eradicated from the blood culture&#xD;
           collected within 72 hours following randomization despite 72 hours of antibiotic therapy&#xD;
           to which the infecting organism is susceptible. Best clinical practice and subject&#xD;
           safety may dictate changes in treatment prior to 72 hours. The event time is the day of&#xD;
           the positive culture;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstration that the baseline pathogen has recurred based on blood culture results by&#xD;
           Week 6 of the study. The event time is the day of the positive blood culture documenting&#xD;
           the recurrence. If a subject does not show any signs and symptoms of an infection and&#xD;
           there is a negative blood culture prior to Week 6, then a blood culture does not have to&#xD;
           be performed at Week 6. Subjects whose catheter was removed for reasons not related to&#xD;
           the baseline infection also do not need to have a blood culture at Week 6; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstration that the baseline pathogen is part of a newly diagnosed deep-seated&#xD;
           infection by Week 6 of the study. The event time is the day of the new diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of the CVC prior to TOC because the catheter is no longer needed will not be&#xD;
      considered a catheter failure and these subjects will be censored at the time of catheter&#xD;
      removal.&#xD;

&#xD;
             NOTE: Subjects may be enrolled and randomized while awaiting results of standard blood&#xD;
             cultures from the local laboratory:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If an organism has been identified from blood specimen testing using an&#xD;
                  FDA-cleared rapid diagnostic test (eg, T2MR®); or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a positive blood culture specimen shows an organism by 1 of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Gram stain; or An FDA-cleared molecular rapid diagnostic test (eg, FilmArray® BCID or&#xD;
             Verigene®); If the pending blood culture does not confirm a qualifying organism by&#xD;
             standard methods and an isolate is not available for testing at the central&#xD;
             laboratory, the subject will be withdrawn from study drug treatment and managed at the&#xD;
             Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: Subjects with a positive blood culture identified up to 120 hours prior to&#xD;
             enrollment and in whom the baseline pathogen is still available for analysis at the&#xD;

             pregnancy test within 5 days prior to randomization;&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: The following are considered women who are NOT of childbearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Postmenopausal (defined as no menses for at least 12 consecutive months); or&#xD;

             sterility, or abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male subjects must agree to refrain from sperm donation throughout the duration of the&#xD;
             study and for 90 days following the last dose of study drug; and&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject must be willing to comply with all study procedures, whether inpatient or&#xD;
             outpatient, for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             resuscitation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects taking disulfiram at the time of randomization or who are expected to take&#xD;
             disulfiram at any time during treatment with study drug;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with prosthetic cardiac valves, vascular grafts, pacers, automatic&#xD;
             implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or other non-removable vascular foreign body,&#xD;
             with the exception of coronary stents and peripheral stents;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with the presence of a deep-seated intravascular source of infection (eg,&#xD;
             endocarditis [as evidenced by vegetations on an echocardiogram or clinical suspicion]&#xD;
             or septic thrombosis);&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with bacteremia with documented microbiological evidence of another source of&#xD;
             infection (eg, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, skin infection, urinary tract infection,&#xD;
             joint infection, or abdominal infection) known to be due to the same organism cultured&#xD;
             from the blood;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with polymicrobial CRBSI/CLABSI caused by pathogens that would require&#xD;
             multiple antibiotics to be used for adequate lock therapy treatment. For example, a&#xD;
             subject with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli&#xD;
             requiring treatment with vancomycin and meropenem would be excluded from the study. A&#xD;
             subject with S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, where both are identified as&#xD;
             pathogens and where both could be treated with vancomycin, would be eligible; NOTE: If&#xD;
             more than 1 organism is isolated, the Investigator should decide which of the&#xD;
             organisms are pathogens and require therapy. Isolates of all organisms should be sent&#xD;
             to the central laboratory. In the event that the subject is being treated with more&#xD;
             than 1 systemic standard of care (SOC) anti-infective, the Investigator will specify a&#xD;
             single antibiotic that should be used for the antibiotic lock. It is acceptable for&#xD;
             the SOC antibiotic lock to differ from the SOC anti infectives, as necessary per local&#xD;
             SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with the presence of a tunnel or catheter exit site infection or an infusion&#xD;
             port pocket abscess as manifested by purulence at the exit site, or inflammation with&#xD;
             erythema, or induration of at least 1 cm in diameter;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects who have been previously randomized into the present study;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with proven or suspected persistent bacteremia or fungemia despite 72 hours&#xD;
             of both systemic anti-infective therapy and lock therapy to which the infecting&#xD;
             organism is susceptible;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects with short-term CVCs indwelling at least 5 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects with a central line-related mycobacterial infection or fungi other than&#xD;
             Candida; or&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have a high probability of death&#xD;
             within 3 months of randomization due to a disease process other than the CRBSI/CLABSI.&#xD;
