  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of a diet free from animal-sourced nutrients on a variety of risk factors for&#xD;
      chronic non-communicable diseases in weight reduction programs is not well established. In&#xD;
      this non-randomised interventional study, the investigators will document the effects of a&#xD;
      low-fat, plant-based diet supplemented with two daily plant-based meal replacements on serum&#xD;
      LDL cholesterol as a primary end-point and total cholesterol, triglycerides, serum fasting&#xD;
      glucose, serum urate, serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and body fat mass as&#xD;
      secondary end-points. These end-points will be measured at baseline, after 10 weeks and after&#xD;
      36 weeks of intervention. Participants will be enrolled in the interventional arm with&#xD;
      prescribed low fat plant-based diet from the group of all applicants to a free living&#xD;
      population-based diet optimising program. The choice to participate in the study will be made&#xD;
      by participants themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that low-fat plant based diet supplemented with plant-based&#xD;
      meal replacements eaten ad libitum allows a significant reduction of serum LDL cholesterol&#xD;
      concentration.&#xD;

      This study is designed as a non-randomized, interventional 36 week trial. The dietary&#xD;
      intervention is executed in free living conditions with participants engaging in their&#xD;
      regular daily work and social activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietary intervention was executed in free-living conditions with participants engaging in&#xD;
      their regular daily work and social activities. The plant-based dietary plan included 2&#xD;
      plant-based meal replacement and 3 conventional meals based on starch nutrients (potatoes,&#xD;
      sweet potatoes, rice, oatmeal, whole-grain pasta, beans, peas, lentils, and similar ones),&#xD;
      fruits (seasonal fruits and various berries), and nonstarch vegetables (color and leafy&#xD;
      vegetables). Spices and tomato sauce (without oil) and one regular-sized spoon of flaxseed&#xD;
      were recommended as well. The participants were recommended to consume no more than 5-6 grams&#xD;
      of salt per day. All milk and dairy products, vegetable oils, and fats were excluded from the&#xD;
      diet. Meat was allowed (but not recommended) once weekly to relieve social pressures on&#xD;
      participants which they often encountered from their circle of influence (i.e., family,&#xD;
      friends, and coworkers) when changing the diet to plant-based sources. The total&#xD;
      macronutrient composition of the intervention diet was approximated to 15% protein, 70%&#xD;
      carbohydrates, and 15% fat. No soybean was included in first 10 weeks of intervention.&#xD;
      Dietary fiber content was approximated to 40-45 g per day. Both meal replacements and&#xD;
      conventional meals were allowed to be consumed ad libitum (to full satiety). No calorie count&#xD;
      or limits were instituted. Additionally, two herbal drinks daily containing black, green and&#xD;
      hibiscus tea extracts were added to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 10 weeks, we have added to the interventional diet EPA and DHA omega 3 fatty acids&#xD;
      (once per day 3 tbl or 567 mg per 1 tbl), vitamin B12 - methylcobalamin (1000 mcg twice a&#xD;
      week) and additional intake of dietary fiber supplement powder (three times a day of 5 g) on&#xD;
      supplement side and a larger selection of moderate amount of high fat whole plant-based foods&#xD;
      (e.g. avocado, soybean tofu, sesame seeds, almonds) at the conventional side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No calorie count or limits are instituted to test the hypothesis that ad libitum intake of&#xD;
      interventional diet allows significant body fat reduction and improvement variety of risk&#xD;
      factors for chronic non-communicable diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be followed at weekly intervals for body composition indices and at 10&#xD;
      and 36 weeks for serum biochemical end-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of dietary diaries and meal photographs will be used to correct and adjust&#xD;
      deviations from the targeted dietary plan and to help participants prepare the meals&#xD;
      according to the dietary plan.&#xD;
