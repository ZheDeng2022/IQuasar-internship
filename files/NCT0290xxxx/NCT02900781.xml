  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partial or Total Knee Arthroplasty are procedures commonly used in severe degeneration of the&#xD;
      knee joint due to osteoarthritis. With an increasing number of Partial or Total Knee&#xD;
      Arthroplasty performed in a population that is aging during a time where the amount of&#xD;
      healthcare dollars allotted to rehabilitation is declining, there is a need to develop remote&#xD;
      monitoring of rehabilitation and to engage and optimize self-management of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current management of Partial or Total Knee Arthroplasty recovery is typically performed in&#xD;
      the out-patient setting and is highly protocol driven. A typical case might be seen by the&#xD;
      physical therapist 2-3x/week for 8-10 weeks to perform specific exercises and to monitor&#xD;
      progress (i.e. compliance with ROM and strengthening exercises). One recent study suggested&#xD;
      that variation in patients' independent exercise and activity after arthroplasty surgery may&#xD;
      contribute to variable functional gains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are proposing that the StepRite device developed by MedHab, (a shoe insert&#xD;
      that collects functional data) will reduce cost and improve the efficacy of rehabilitation in&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty patients&#xD;

      Significance of this study The significance of the proposed study includes the projected&#xD;
      benefit to the patients in terms of attaining clinical outcomes quicker and to the medical&#xD;
      system in terms of managing cost for the provision of services. Subjects are expected to&#xD;
      demonstrate improved compliance to patient tailored rehabilitation protocols which will lead&#xD;
      to more rapid attainment of clinical outcomes versus present traditional rehabilitation&#xD;
      methodologies. The expected level of, and rate of, attainment of clinical outcomes will&#xD;
      translate to an overall reduction of cost to the medical system by reducing the need to&#xD;
      engage in additional processes or the need to protract the time required to attain clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, where either or both in combination can increase rehabilitation expenditures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To compare the efficacy of StepRite in a prescribed physical therapy program&#xD;
      verses traditional in-facility physical therapy program after partial or total knee&#xD;
      replacement surgery using validated survey tools to evaluate patient progress, including&#xD;
      patient self -reporting of progress and surgeon appraisal of patient performance&#xD;
      post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the overall cost of post-operative rehabilitation of patients involved in&#xD;
      traditionally employed regimens versus those using the StepRite device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and specific aims The aim of this study is to evaluate whether improved clinical&#xD;
      outcomes as well as reduction in cost in provision of care can be better affected through the&#xD;
      use of the Steprite device as compared to the use of traditional rehabilitation modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will seek to reject the null hypotheses that 1) there is no difference&#xD;
      between clinical outcomes attained between patients using the Steprite device and those using&#xD;
      traditional rehabilitation modalities and that 2) there is no reduction in cost to the&#xD;
      medical system when patients use Steprite versus other conventional methods of&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By rejecting the null hypothesis the investigators will accept the alternate hypothesis that,&#xD;
      through the use of the Steprite device, not only will patients achieve overall clinical&#xD;
      outcomes faster but there will be an associated decrease in cost burden to the medical system&#xD;
      and the differences observed will be statistically significant as compared to rehabilitation&#xD;
      of patients not using the Steprite device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who use the device post-surgery will demonstrate superior short-term improvements&#xD;
      (i.e. 3 months post surgery) with respect to self-reported functional outcomes and gait&#xD;
      parameters, compared to a control group not using the device. The patients will self-report&#xD;
      through the use of validated survey instruments including the KOOS survey (knee injury and&#xD;
      osteoarthritis outcome score), LEFS (lower extremity functional scale) and/or KSS (knee&#xD;
      society score), the latter of which includes a section for surgeon evaluation of patient&#xD;
      functionality post operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methods This is a point of care clinical trial; a trial that functions to&#xD;
      integrate research within a clinical setting that has the ability to readily deliver either&#xD;
      modality of the proposal. This type of study design relies on provider referral of patients&#xD;
      to be approached for consent, after which randomization to one of two treatment groups is&#xD;
      facilitated; a control group of 15 patients participating in conventional rehabilitation&#xD;
      regimens and an experimental group of 15 patients who will participate in the same&#xD;
      rehabilitation regimen but facilitated through the use of Steprite. Importantly, care for&#xD;
      patients is delivered as part of current adopted standards utilizing outcome measurements,&#xD;
      the use of which and the interpretation of which is already built into care provided by the&#xD;
      clinical facility, thereby negating the need to develop additional outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of 30 patients will come from the investigators' normal patient population, among&#xD;
      patients who are scheduled for partial or total knee arthroplasty. As there is no change in&#xD;
      post op care for these patients from the investigators standard protocols other than&#xD;
      monitoring and enforcement of home protocols, the same therapists involved in investigators'&#xD;
      normal patient care will be involved with both arms of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, 30 patients represents a sample size deemed acceptable as a starting point.&#xD;
      There are no other published studies using Steprite in comparative design trials.&#xD;
      Determinations of sample size needed for this study, using 80% power and significance of&#xD;
      0.05, incorporate the use of a time frame in days or weeks for completion of the&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocols that would allow for the detection of clinically significant&#xD;
      differences between the group using Steprite and those using conventional therapies only.&#xD;
      Given that conventional therapies can include skilled nursing, home health and outpatient&#xD;
      visits and given that the need for each of these is highly variable dependent on the patient,&#xD;
      it is difficult to assign a time value for determinations of sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With that, a sample size of 30 participants divided into two groups represents an initial&#xD;
      starting point, with the potential of incremental addition of more patients in order to&#xD;
      achieve significance between the two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical significance will be evaluated utilizing a standard t-test for two group&#xD;
      comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for the study, MedHab Inc. will at their expense train all involved&#xD;
      investigators and therapists in the fitting and use of the StepRite device. Medhab will also&#xD;
      train a lead therapist designated by the lead investigator to be in charge of overseeing and&#xD;
      monitoring, ensuring proper use of the device. There is no cost to the patient, hospital or&#xD;
      other funding entity for participation in this study. Medhab LLC will assume all costs&#xD;
      associated with the training, application, device and use of the StepRite product for the&#xD;
      full course of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects for this study will be recruited from the patient population seen by the&#xD;
      investigator's during the normal course of business. There will be no outside recruitment of&#xD;
      individuals or advertising as to the presence or use of the monitoring device to entice new&#xD;
      patient referral. Prospective candidates will be asked by the investigator at the time they&#xD;
      are designated surgical candidates. All documentation related to the study will be reviewed&#xD;
      with the patient by the lead physician or his designee who is appropriately trained in&#xD;
      discussing patient recruitment. Final decision and randomization to control or StepRite use&#xD;
      will be done as part of the preoperative checkup just prior to surgery where both operative&#xD;
      consent and study consent are discussed and signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient agrees to the study they would be sequentially randomized into whether or not&#xD;
      they receive StepRite. The patients will be randomized to every other eligible patient gets&#xD;
      the intervention. (ie: 1,3,5,7,9… will get StepRite ; 2,4,6,8 will not get StepRite) 15&#xD;
      Intervention subjects will be recruited and 15 control subjects will be recruited with an&#xD;
      extra 5 patients to account for attrition and withdrawals.&#xD;
