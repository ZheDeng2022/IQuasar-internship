    <textblock>
      This pilot study consists in testing the efficacy of hypnosis as an adjuvant treatment for&#xD;
      patients suffering from chronic lumbar pain and for whom a facet block is indicated by a&#xD;
      doctor in the Centre d'antalgie of CHUV (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois), where&#xD;
      this study will take place. 5 to 8 patients will be included in this study. The goals of this&#xD;
      study are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the feasibility of such a protocol with more patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the number of patients necessary to obtain a significant result&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Search for possible side effects of the combination of both treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient in this pilot study will undergo 4 hypnosis sessions within 2 weeks before the&#xD;
      facet block. These sessions will be done with an hypnotherapist formed for this kind of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three times during this study, each patient will have a discussion with the co-investigator&#xD;
      :Â¨&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1st discussion : just before the first hypnosis session&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2nd discussion : after the 4 hypnosis sessions and just before the facet block,&#xD;
           approximately 3 to 4 weeks after the 1st discussion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3rd discussion : 2 to 4 weeks after the facet block&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will allow to obtain several data :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain assessment : intensity, localization, variability, characteristics, effects on&#xD;
           daily life activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxiety and depression assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expectations assessment : about both treatments and their combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy assessment : about both treatments for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about the perceptions of the treatments (prejudice, ...) et possible side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will then be analysed (quantitative and qualitative analysis, depending on the&#xD;
      question type) to fulfill the objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      will include 5 to 8 people suffering from chronic lumbar pain. The procedure consists in two&#xD;
      steps :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 4 hypnosis sessions as an adjuvant treatment for number 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a facet block, which is the standard procedure in the Centre d'antalgie in CHUV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no control group, so every patient will participate to the hypnosis sessions&#xD;
      and undergo the facet block. All the procedure of the facet block (including&#xD;
      contraindications and side effects) are not considered to be part of this study because all&#xD;
      patients in this study would have had a facet block if they would not participate in it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only data that will be collected are questionnaires about several items (pain, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, ...). These questionnaires are filled with the patient at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study (day 0), before the facet block (between day 14 and day 21) and 2-4 weeks after it&#xD;
      (between day 28 and day 49). There are quantitative and qualitative questions.&#xD;
