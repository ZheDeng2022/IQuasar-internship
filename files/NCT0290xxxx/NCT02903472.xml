  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Changes in the GI microbiota and/or metabolomics have been linked to evolving transformations&#xD;
      in immune system function and infection rates in experimental SCI in animal models. A recent&#xD;
      study involving chronic survivors of SCI show distinct GI microbiome changes in comparison to&#xD;
      healthy controls. GI microbial metabolism of dietary components has been causally linked to&#xD;
      various health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, infections, which is an ongoing&#xD;
      concern for chronic SCI survivors. It is probable that alterations of GI microbiota are&#xD;
      established acutely after SCI and could subsequently alter medical care and impact health&#xD;
      outcomes for people living with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a pilot study to describe any changes in the GI and urinary tract microbiota&#xD;
      as they appear over the first year after SCI. When available, data on factors, other than&#xD;
      SCI, that may impact change in the gut microbiome after SCI will also be noted, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the level and severity of SCI,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the time since SCI,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the person's immune profile,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the antibiotic regimen of the individual and time since antibiotic administration,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the incidence and type of infections after SCI and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the person's diet or activities after SCI&#xD;

      Study 1 - Acute to first year after SCI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to recruit 4 types of SCI participants (~8 tetraplegic motor complete&#xD;
      SCI participants, ~8 tetraplegic motor incomplete SCI, ~8 paraplegic motor complete SCI and&#xD;
      ~8 paraplegic motor incomplete SCI). This totals 32 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will non-invasively collect small (&lt;1 gram) stool and urine (&lt;1 ml) samples&#xD;
      from people who have suffered an acute SCI and have been admitted to their hospital for care&#xD;
      and treatment of their injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will track changes in the microbiota, microbiome and metabolome within the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract of people after acute spinal cord injury (SCI) through the&#xD;
      non-invasive collection of a small stool sample during normal bowel routines at baseline&#xD;
      (within the first week after SCI). Subsequent samples would be obtained in the same&#xD;
      non-invasive nature at approximately 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after SCI, as part of any daily&#xD;
      (in-patient or at home, outpatient) bowel routine. The stool samples will be processed for&#xD;
      genomic analysis to identify GI bacterial species and any changes in an individual's GI&#xD;
      microbiota and/or dysbiosis during the first year after SCI. As SCI increases the incidence&#xD;
      and prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTIs), the investigators will track alteration&#xD;
      within the microbiota of the urinary tract to ascertain whether there are links in the&#xD;
      bacterial taxa between the GI system and urinary tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 - Chronic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will attempt to recruit ~ 20 chronic SCI participants with or without recurrent&#xD;
      infections (e.g. UTI, skin or systemic) to ascertain whether there is a correlation between a&#xD;
      dysbiotic microbiota presentation and recurrent infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small stool or urine sample will be obtained at home by participants and subsequently&#xD;
      collected for genomic analysis during a person's routine outpatient clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All replicate data (3 samples per individual at 3 different time points - 1, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      post baseline visit) from chronic participants would be matched as much as possible for age,&#xD;
      gender, diet, type of SCI, time since SCI, activity, and should only differ in terms of&#xD;
      recurrent infections and antibiotic prescriptions. The goal here would be to characterize any&#xD;
      gut microbiota differences between the two disparate groups. The data may guide the&#xD;
      development of future studies to investigate treatment options. During chronic SCI, many&#xD;
      recurrent infections are UTIs; thus, the investigators will also monitor differences between&#xD;
      the two group in the microbiota and metabolomics of the urinary tract.&#xD;
