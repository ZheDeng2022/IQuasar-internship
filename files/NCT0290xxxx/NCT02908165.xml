  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a single-center, randomized Phase II study of conventional TACE in&#xD;
      combination with sorafenib, given either continuously or sequentially, in patients with&#xD;
      unresectable HCC. The primary variables will be tumor response (by MR Imaging) and plasma&#xD;
      VEGF levels, prior to and after cTACE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most widely performed procedure for&#xD;
      patients with unresectable HCC. Although TACE can induce tumor necrosis, tumor recurrence and&#xD;
      metastasis is not uncommon and likely due to stimulation of angiogenesis immediately after&#xD;
      TACE. Plasma VEGF levels are significantly elevated following TACE procedures, usually&#xD;
      peaking 24 to 48 hours after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, has been shown to increase survival in patients with&#xD;
      advanced HCC, presumably due to its predominant and strong antiangiogenic activities thereby&#xD;
      preventing tumor growth. However, despite its targeted approach, sorafenib is not without&#xD;
      toxicities; consequently most patients are unable to remain on full dose throughout the&#xD;
      course of their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of sorafenib's antiangiogenic properties, it has been suggested that sorafenib could&#xD;
      be used in combination with TACE to counteract the post-TACE angiogenic release and therefore&#xD;
      prevent or minimize the risk of tumor recurrence. The possible synergy between TACE and&#xD;
      sorafenib has been tested in numerous clinical studies. Although the safety profile has been&#xD;
      clearly established, the efficacy of this combination therapy has yet to be demonstrated.&#xD;
      Several combination methods have been tested, i.e., continuously where sorafenib is&#xD;
      administered before the first TACE and then continuously throughout the planned TACE&#xD;
      treatments, or sequentially where sorafenib is administered after the completion of TACE&#xD;
      (usually 4 days after). Here, the investigators postulate that the sequence of the&#xD;
      combination could have a significant impact on patient outcomes. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the continuous method is superior to that of the sequential&#xD;
      protocol because the presence of sorafenib before the first TACE will preempt the peak of&#xD;
      angiogenesis from TACE. To that end, the investigators propose to measure VEGF levels&#xD;
      serially in order to detect differences between the two methods.&#xD;
