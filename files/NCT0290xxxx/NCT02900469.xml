  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether one dose of denosumab can lead to changes&#xD;
      in the tumor, which may decrease the ability of tumor to spread.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, affecting one in eight women, and is the&#xD;
      second leading cause of mortality from cancer. Bone metastases are a frequent complication of&#xD;
      breast cancer, and the mechanism of breast cancer metastases to bone is an ongoing area of&#xD;
      research.. Receptor activator of NF-kB (RANK) and its ligand (RANKL) have been identified and&#xD;
      characterized for its role in bone remodeling. RANKL is a member of the tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      (TNF) family of cytokines that binds to its receptor RANK to control osteoclast&#xD;
      differentiation, activation, and survival. RANK protein expression is not only found on&#xD;
      osteoclasts and dendritic cells but also on T cells and mammary epithelial cells. RANK and&#xD;
      RANKL is important for lymph node and thymus formation as well as lactating mammary gland&#xD;
      development during pregnancy. Furthermore, the RANK/RANKL axis has been linked to progestin&#xD;
      driven breast carcinomas and bone metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANK is expressed in 6-57% of invasive human breast cancers (depending upon the parameters&#xD;
      for defining positivity and antibodies utilized for immunohistochemistry (IHC)), and RANKL&#xD;
      driven hormone (progesterone -dependent proliferation, survival, and nonproliferative&#xD;
      expansion of mammary stem cells may contribute to breast cancer initiation, progression, and&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that denosumab can inhibit RANKL signaling in early breast tumors which&#xD;
      express RANK, inhibiting pro-metastatic mechanisms and reducing immunosuppression in the&#xD;
      tumor microenvironment. This will be tested in a pre-surgical clinical trial (Phase 0) to&#xD;
      evaluate and select the pharmacodynamics markers of RANKL inhibition in breast cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer (stages I-III) who&#xD;
             have undergone core needle biopsy (clinically or radiographically at least T1c to&#xD;
             allow adequate residual cancer tissue at surgery) and will be scheduled for surgical&#xD;
             resection (i.e. segmental excision or mastectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Archival tissue freshly cut from core biopsy must be available; patients who had a&#xD;
             diagnostic core biopsy at an outside institution are eligible as long as it is&#xD;
             confirmed that tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (preferred) or ≥ 25 unstained&#xD;
             slides, with an associated pathology report, are available.&#xD;
