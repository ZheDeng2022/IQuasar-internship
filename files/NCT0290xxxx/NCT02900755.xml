  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perampanel, a novel AED, has been recently authorized in Korea and worldwide as a treatment&#xD;
      of refractory partial-onset seizures with a new anti-epileptic mechanism of a selective&#xD;
      non-competitive antagonist of AMPA receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating adverse effects during the introduction of new AED is often difficult since the&#xD;
      complaints are subjective and objective assessment is complicated due to the polytherapy.&#xD;
      Majority of previous studies are focused on quantitative analysis of EEG for taking new AEDs&#xD;
      because of the correlation of EEG analysis results and side effects of AED such as cognitive&#xD;
      slowing. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of perampanel on EEG in terms&#xD;
      of EEG background spectra and to evaluate perampanel effects by using subjective&#xD;
      questionnaires assessing depression, anxiety, sleep quality and fatigue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perampanel is a selective antagonist of the Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic&#xD;
      acid (AMPA) receptor and is used to treat partial-onset seizures with or without secondary&#xD;
      generalization. This antiepileptic drug (AED) is usually prescribed as adjunctive treatment&#xD;
      and is also used primarily in generalized tonic-clonic seizures Cognitive dysfunction is a&#xD;
      major comorbidity in many patients with epilepsy and could be the result of chronic use of&#xD;
      AEDs. Since cognitive decline has a tremendous impact on the quality of life, the effect of a&#xD;
      large number of AEDs on cognition has been actively studied. It has been reported that AEDs&#xD;
      such as gabapentin, carbamazepine, and topiramate induce cognitive decline, while&#xD;
      lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and oxcarbazepine show much less negative effect on cognitive&#xD;
      function compared with the older AEDs. Perampanel has also been studied for its effects on&#xD;
      cognition in adolescent patients with epilepsy aged 12-18 years. However, the effects of&#xD;
      perampanel on cognitive function have not yet been studied in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analysis or quantitative EEG (QEEG) is a method of&#xD;
      quantifying the different frequencies in EEG signals. Spectral analysis of EEG frequency can&#xD;
      reflect the functional state of the brain. Thus, it has proved to be a useful tool for&#xD;
      assessing the pharmacological effects of central nervous system (CNS) drugs.&#xD;
      Electrophysiologic changes due to AEDs can manifest as either a generalized slowing of or an&#xD;
      increased beta frequency on EEG in general. Changes in background EEG may be correlated with&#xD;
      clinical cognitive function. Since EEG changes in the spectral analysis are only intended to&#xD;
      assess brain activity and do not directly reflect clinical changes in patients,&#xD;
      neuropsychological (NP) tests are necessary for evaluating clinical cognitive function. Our&#xD;
      objective was to determine how perampanel affects cognition and the EEG signal in adult&#xD;
      patients with epilepsy. Correlation of these effects was also analyzed with the serum&#xD;
      concentration of perampanel.&#xD;
