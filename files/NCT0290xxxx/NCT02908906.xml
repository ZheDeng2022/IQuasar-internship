    <textblock>
      The Primary purpose of this study is to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose [RP2D(s)] for&#xD;
      JNJ-63723283 in Part 1, to assess the anti-tumor activity of JNJ-63723283 at the RP2D(s) in&#xD;
      participants with selected advanced cancers including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC),&#xD;
      melanoma, renal, bladder, small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), gastric/esophageal cancer, and&#xD;
      high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (CRC) in Part 2 and to determine one or more additional RP2Ds (Part 3 and Part 4).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a First in Human (FIH), open-label (all people involved know the identity of the&#xD;
      intervention), multicenter (more than 1 study site) study in participants with advanced&#xD;
      cancers to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D[s]) with IV administration for&#xD;
      JNJ-63723283 in Part 1, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the IV RP2D(s) in Part 2 and&#xD;
      to determine one or more additional RP2Ds in Parts 3 and 4. Participant participation will&#xD;
      include a Screening Phase (28 Days) during which participant eligibility will be reviewed&#xD;
      prior to administration of the first dose of JNJ-63723283; a Treatment Phase that will start&#xD;
      at the first dose and continue until treatment is discontinued; and a Survival Follow-up&#xD;
      Phase (applicable for Part 1 and 2) starting upon completion of the End-of-Treatment Visit&#xD;
      and ends when the participant completes or withdraws from the study. The end of the study is&#xD;
      defined as last study assessment for the last participant on study or if the sponsor&#xD;
      terminates the study, whichever comes first. Participants safety will be monitored throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

    <description>In Part 1, the first cohort will receive JNJ-63723283 at a starting dose of 80 milligram (mg), IV every 2 weeks. JNJ-63723283 doses will be escalated following a modified Continual Reassessment Method (mCRM). Multiple doses, dose administration routes (subcutaneous [SC] or IV), and dose schedules may be explored. In Part 2, participants will receive JNJ-63723283 at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined in Part 1. In Part 3, participants will receive JNJ-63723283 to evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and safety. In Part 4, participants will receive JNJ-63723283 at the dose level determined in Part 3. Additional cohorts may be enrolled in Part 4 to evaluate additional doses.</description>
