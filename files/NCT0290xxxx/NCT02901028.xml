  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Significant morbidity, mortality, and related costs are caused by traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (TBI). A simple, effective, and lightweight device worn by athletes or war fighters in the&#xD;
      field, designed to mitigate TBI resulting from blast trauma or concussive events, would save&#xD;
      lives, and the huge costs currently being experienced for life-treatment of surviving&#xD;
      victims. An externally-worn medical device that applies mild jugular compression according to&#xD;
      the principle of the Queckenstedt Maneuver. PURPOSE: To monitor changes in vital signs, blood&#xD;
      physiologies, oxygen consumption, biomechanics, strength, neurological capabilities, and&#xD;
      balance in a population of athletes wearing the Device. Secondly, to determine the tolerance&#xD;
      and acceptance of the Device while undergoing exertion.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Device has the promise of providing a novel mechanism for reducing or preventing the&#xD;
      likelihood of TBI, and may be used in conjunction with other protective equipment. TBI is the&#xD;
      leading cause of death in individuals under age 45. The cost of TBI in the U.S. is estimated&#xD;
      at anywhere from $50 to $150 billion, annually. The January, 2008 New England Journal of&#xD;
      Medicine reports, &quot;Head and neck injuries, including severe brain trauma, have been reported&#xD;
      in one quarter of service members who have been evacuated from Iraq and Afghanistan&quot;[1-3].&#xD;
      The vast majority of these injuries have resulted from exposure to improvised explosive&#xD;
      device (IED) blast waves. Head injuries, concussions and the resulting trauma have been in&#xD;
      public discussion recently as the National Football League (NFL) deals with a lawsuit&#xD;
      regarding head injuries by about one-third of living former NFL players and are also a&#xD;
      concern for athletes who participate in a wide range of sports, including hockey, rugby and&#xD;
      soccer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to NASA, &quot;The oscillation of a fluid caused by external force, called sloshing,&#xD;
      occurs in moving vehicles containing liquid masses, such as trucks, etc.&quot; This oscillation&#xD;
      occurs when a vessel is only partially filled. Similarly, the brain faces slosh peril during&#xD;
      external force impartation. Slosh permits external energies to be absorbed by the contents of&#xD;
      a partially filled vessel or container by means of inelastic collisions. Tissues of differing&#xD;
      densities can decelerate at different rates creating shear and cavitation. If the collisions&#xD;
      between objects or molecules are elastic, the transfer of energies to those objects&#xD;
      diminishes, minimizing the energies imparted by slosh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Woodpeckers, head ramming sheep and all mammals (including mankind) have small, little known&#xD;
      and misunderstood muscles in their necks called the omo-hyoid muscles. Highly G-tolerant&#xD;
      creatures of the forest have utilized these muscles to gently restrict outflow of the&#xD;
      internal jugular veins thereby &quot;taking up&quot; the excess compliance of the cranial space and&#xD;
      ultimately protecting themselves from TBI like tiny &quot;airbags&quot; in a motor vehicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study utilizes a randomized cross over study design. Subjects will visit the Human&#xD;
      Performance Laboratory on two separate occasions to perform the testing procedures listed in&#xD;
      the table below. During one testing session, the subject will perform the testing procedures&#xD;
      while wearing the Device under investigation while the other testing session will be&#xD;
      completed while the subject is wearing a sham arm device, which will be placed on the upper&#xD;
      arm and not cause venous engorgement. The order of the testing sessions will be randomized&#xD;
      prior to the subject's arrival for the first session. The Device is a standard hockey neck&#xD;
      guard, adapted for the purposes of this study. The Device incorporates two bulges localized&#xD;
      over the site of the internal jugular veins bilaterally. Experiments performed with jugular&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasound demonstrate that while wearing the Device, flows within the jugular veins&#xD;
      are reduced, while flow within the carotid arteries and all portions of the cerebrum are&#xD;
      preserved (JA Fisher, unpublished data). Thus, application of the Device to the subject will&#xD;
      not cause any untoward health risks. The pressure exerted by the Device on the region of the&#xD;
      neck superficial to the internal jugular vein is akin to the pressure felt when a person&#xD;
      yawns or wears a snugly fitting necktie.&#xD;
