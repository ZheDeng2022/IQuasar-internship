  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The therapeutic education of patients and their close relations is, as yet, poorly developed&#xD;
      in France in the field of oncology, in particular for cancers of the upper aerodigestive&#xD;
      tract. In the case of pharyngeal and laryngeal cancer, total laryngectomy associated with&#xD;
      radiotherapy remains a reference treatment for advanced stage cancers. This mutilating&#xD;
      surgical procedure has a major impact on the patient's life, due to its physical and&#xD;
      functional sequelae. Its psychosocial consequences are also important, owing to the&#xD;
      biographical disruption and the identity-related metamorphoses associated with illness and&#xD;
      its treatment, which alter the quality of life not only of patients, but also of their close&#xD;
      relations. Currently, care for laryngectomised patients consists essentially in informing and&#xD;
      educating them on certain technical procedures during hospital admission. New voice education&#xD;
      can be a long process and often involves the intervention of a speech therapist, who serves&#xD;
      as the link between the patient and the hospital care team. These healthcare modalities often&#xD;
      insufficiently account for the social, environmental and personal factors that interact in&#xD;
      health-related problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to design, implement and evaluate a patient therapeutic education (PTE) programme,&#xD;
      for laryngectomised patients and their close relations, aimed at improving their quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be conducted over three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase, referred to as the &quot;pilot&quot; phase, will include exploratory, observational&#xD;
      and retrospective analysis aimed at developing knowledge on the consequences of laryngectomy&#xD;
      on the quality of life of patients and their close relations, the strengths and weaknesses of&#xD;
      current practice in patient support and the needs expressed by the players involved&#xD;
      (patients, relations, professional carers). This analysis will be conducted via interviews&#xD;
      with patients and their close relations and focus groups with the healthcare professionals&#xD;
      involved in patient care and support (hospital and independent). This first phase will enable&#xD;
      the pluridisciplinary design of a therapeutic education programme for laryngectomised&#xD;
      patients and their close relations which will be tested in the study's principle coordinating&#xD;
      centre. The method defined thus is in keeping with quality criteria set by the HAS specifying&#xD;
      that the PTE should focus on the patient, be scientifically justified, and be developed by a&#xD;
      pluridisciplinary group reuniting representatives of patients or patient associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase, referred to as the prospective intervention &quot;replication&quot; phase, aims at&#xD;
      evaluating the programme's transferability and quality in three centres. The centres&#xD;
      participating in this second phase already have experience in the development of PTE&#xD;
      programmes and will be involved in the workgroup entrusted with the design of the PETAL&#xD;
      programme during phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third phase, referred to as the &quot;randomised&quot; multicentric comparative intervention phase,&#xD;
      should enable us to assess the benefits of the developed PTE programme on the quality of life&#xD;
      of patients and their close relations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pluridisciplinary study via which we hope to improve the quality of life of&#xD;
      laryngectomised patients and their close relations through the design and the sustainable&#xD;
      deployment of an innovative PTE programme in France and Belgium. This project also aims at&#xD;
      reinforcing town-hospital links to improve help, follow-up and support for patients and their&#xD;
      close relations, as well as dialogue between healthcare professionals.&#xD;
