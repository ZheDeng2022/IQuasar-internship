      Background: Children in industrialized and developing countries have a higher tendency to&#xD;
      present earlier signs of puberty. One hypothesis includes the hormonal effects of&#xD;
      phytoestrogens found in soy products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to examine the association between consumption of soy-based food in early infancy&#xD;
      and childhood and the incidence of early or precocious puberty and overweight in school-aged&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: the study population for this case control study is randomized from a prospectively&#xD;
      followed cohort of all babies born at Assaf Haroffeh medical center and followed for milk&#xD;
      allergy signs and food intake until the age of 3 years (A nested cohort). It is divided to&#xD;
      those who were allergic to milk, and thus consumed only soy based formula and food during&#xD;
      infancy and childhood (soy group) and a randomized control group who consumed non-soy based&#xD;
      intake. For both groups data are available of food habits during infancy and collected from 3&#xD;
      days food diaries during the current study. Physical examination, including weight , height,&#xD;
      blood pressure and Tanner Pubertal Staging will performed annually.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Soy and soy-based products are widely used in modern day nutrition. It is widely consumed&#xD;
      among all populations, especially among vegetarians, vegans, those with milk allergy, and in&#xD;
      the general population who consume processed foods .Soy-based infant formula is commonly&#xD;
      used, and may account for nearly 25 % of the infant formula sold . Soy products contain&#xD;
      phytoestrogens (isoflavones) that were suggested to function as weak hormonal disruptors due&#xD;
      to their functional similarity to mammalian estrogens and their active metabolites. Studies&#xD;
      regarding the effects of soy consumption on pediatric growth and body mass have been&#xD;
      inconclusive. Infants who are fed soy-based formulas have higher isoflavones blood&#xD;
      concentration compared to breast-fed and milk-based formulas fed babies . Several studies&#xD;
      discuss its effect on infantile physiologic telarche . Several retrospective, case-control&#xD;
      and case studies were reported trying to elucidate the possible clinical association between&#xD;
      consumption of soy products during infancy and childhood and pubertal and menarchal timing.&#xD;
      However, there results are contradictory and inconclusive .Furthermore, in some of the&#xD;
      studies there is no discussion of the association or confounding effect of overweight which&#xD;
      is also associated with pubertal timing. Despite the importance of the topic, there is&#xD;
      paucity of prospective data regarding the impact of soy based products consumption on puberty&#xD;
      and body mass index (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this prospective study will examine the relationship between the consumption of soy-&#xD;
      based formulas in early infancy with the development of early puberty and changes in&#xD;
      anthropometric measures in school-aged children. The goal of this study is to test the&#xD;
      association between early consumption of soy based formula and the timing of onset of&#xD;
      secondary sexual characteristics in a prospective mannor and with consideration of current&#xD;
      dietary intake and confounding factors as BMI and familial trends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Population The study population is based on a large cohort study&#xD;
      initiated and performed during 2004-2006 by Katz Y et al ,which followed prospectively all&#xD;
      newborns born during this time period at Assaf Haroffeh Medical Center, Zerifin, Israel.The&#xD;
      study looked into their nutritional intake, development of sensitivity to milk and milk&#xD;
      allergies. The population included a total of 13019 children, out of which 66 developed an&#xD;
      IgE-mediated Cow Milk Allergy (CMA), 71 developed milk-sensitivity, and 12638 were healthy.&#xD;
      Our study population includes all CMA group and a randomized group from the healthy&#xD;
      population (nested cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria : all participants from initial study . Exclusion criteria:lack of data&#xD;
      regarding food intake during infancy in both groups. In the non-allergic children, from the&#xD;
      non soy based group those who consumed soy - based formula for religious or ideological&#xD;
      reasons will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a case-control study, including a specific sub-population from a large&#xD;
      cohort population including prospectively collected data on infantile food consumption. All&#xD;
      original cohort participants, who fulfill the inclusion criteria will be approached for&#xD;
      participation in the current study. The current study will include demographic and clinical&#xD;
      data collection, an interview and 3 days of food diary preparation and dietician analysis and&#xD;
      a physical examination by a pediatric Endocrinologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical data Collection Data will include the information from the initial&#xD;
      prospective follow up at infancy including birth weight, birth week, parental origin,&#xD;
      infantile food habits, maternal age and allergy classification. Data collected at the current&#xD;
      session: family health history including obesity, early or delayed puberty, ,age of maternal&#xD;
      menarche and age of paternal shaving, parental height. The child physical activity levels and&#xD;
      nutritional habits, illnesses, medications . Height and weight were measured and body mass&#xD;
      index [BMI] will calculated and reported as BMI-SDS . Tanner score was used to characterize&#xD;
      sexual maturation. The pre-pubertal state was defined as Tanner stage 1 genitalia and&#xD;
      testicular volume â‰¤3 ml in boys and absence of breast development in girls. A specific&#xD;
      description of axillary odor and axillary hair and pubertal hair will be performed for&#xD;
      adrenarche signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intake analysis All participants will fill a detailed 3 days food diary (two weekdays&#xD;
      and one weekend day) according to guidance by the study dietician. The nutritional data from&#xD;
      the food records will be analyzed using the Tzameret Program (or A computer program, based on&#xD;
      local food tables, developed by Israeli ministry of Health) ).Results of the analysis will be&#xD;
      reported as percent-Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI).&#xD;
