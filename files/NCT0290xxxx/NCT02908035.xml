      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, dose escalation study to document the&#xD;
      effects of adventitial delivery of temsirolimus (Torisel) after revascularization of lesions&#xD;
      below the knee in symptomatic patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Up to 60 patients&#xD;
      (20 low-dose, 20 high-dose and 20 control) at up to 15 sites in the United States. This study&#xD;
      will assess the safety and effectiveness of Bullfrog Micro-Infusion Device adventitial&#xD;
      deposition of temsirolimus in reducing intimal hyperplasia, inflammatory markers and&#xD;
      composite safety endpoints in patients with clinical evidence of chronic critical limb&#xD;
      ischemia after revascularization of one or more angiographically significant lesion(s) in&#xD;
      below-knee popliteal or tibial vessels.&#xD;

             successfully treat and obtain a &lt;30% residual stenosis post-revascularization, with&#xD;
             bailout stenting as needed (in-flow lesions should be treated prior to treating the&#xD;
