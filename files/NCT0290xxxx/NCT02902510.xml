      This is a single blind, randomized, wait-list controlled, phase II exploratory pilot study&#xD;
      utilizing an after-trial embedded mixed methods approach that will examine the efficacy of&#xD;
      therapeutic yoga as a rehabilitation strategy for individuals with PD to improve balance and&#xD;
      reduce fear of falling (FoF). Potential participants will have a FoF in order to enter the&#xD;
      study. An after-trial embedded mixed methods design will be employed in this study and will&#xD;
      include the collection of qualitative data to assist in the overall interpretation of the&#xD;
      more heavily weighted quantitative trial data. Adding qualitative methods will serve as a&#xD;
      post-hoc analysis capturing participant perceptions of the relationships between the yoga&#xD;
      intervention and various outcomes. More specifically, the qualitative data will aide in&#xD;
      explaining the link between the various yoga techniques and mechanisms that participants&#xD;
      attribute to improved balance, reduced FoF, and other bio-psychosocial outcomes and&#xD;
      experiences. Qualitative data will be collected using focus group interviews with&#xD;
      participants in the yoga group at the end of the class in week 8.&#xD;
