    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of one algorithm for Major Depression Disorder (MDD) using&#xD;
      medications available in the Brazilian Public Healthcare System (SUS), and assessment of the&#xD;
      quality of life of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized pragmatic trial was conducted. An algorithm was developed for the treatment of&#xD;
      episodes of unipolar depression episodes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design was that of a pragmatic randomized clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatments for mood disorders in a public healthcare context in the city of&#xD;
      Porto Alegre, in southern Brazil. The algorithm was originally developed for the treatment of&#xD;
      major depression by a Delphi panel of experts from psychiatric associations in Brazil. All&#xD;
      subjects provided an informed consent form, in writing, in order to participate in the study&#xD;
      protocol, which was approved by the institutional ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures and measurements of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects under evaluation were selected and they followed the stages defined by the&#xD;
      treatment protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample selection by being referred from the primary healthcare clinics in the&#xD;
           municipality;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Informative talk about mood disorders and the research, with the informed consent forms&#xD;
           being provided to the subjects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Screening for unipolar depression episodes with the use of the Patient Health&#xD;
           Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Hypomanic Symptoms Checklist Brazilian Version (HCL -32-BV);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Diagnostic evaluation through the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)&#xD;
           and clinical interview for individuals with positive results in the screening&#xD;
           instruments;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Baseline and demographic assessments using standardized semi-structured interviews in&#xD;
           the first and second visits;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. In each clinic visit, the severity of the symptoms were evealuated using the Clinical&#xD;
           Global Impression Scale (CGI), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), and Young&#xD;
           Manic Rating Scale (YMRS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Biweekly follow-up, changed to monthly after stabilization - with a maximum follow-up&#xD;
           period of 52 weeks.&#xD;
