      Spectral cardiac CT scan performed in an emergency setting in patients with suspected acute&#xD;
      myocarditis and presenting one selves with an acute chest pain, allows the non-invasive&#xD;
      assessment of both the coronary arteries and the myocardium. Delayed iodine contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      CT imaging should show the inflamed area with an increased uptake of iodine contrast agent in&#xD;
      the interstitial space, such as the well-known hypersignal seen on the myocardial delayed&#xD;
      enhancement sequence with MRI (corresponding of an uptake of gadolinium contrast agent in the&#xD;
      abnormal myocardium).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique has the potential to replace MRI, thus allowing the diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      myocarditis with a rapid and easily accessible technique. Moreover, it has the additional&#xD;
      benefit of avoiding invasive coronary angiography in the specific population of patients&#xD;
      without any significant risk factors of atheromatous disease.&#xD;

      Introduction: diagnosis of acute myocarditis is challenging in the specific population of&#xD;
      patients without any significant risk factors of atheromatous disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both cardiac MRI and coronary angiography (cardiac CT, invasive coronary angiography) are&#xD;
      usually performed for the definitive diagnosis of myocarditis and for ruling out a coronary&#xD;
      artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spectral cardiac CT could be particularly useful in suspected myocarditis in the setting of&#xD;
      acute chest pain in this specific population of patients with low cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors. Indeed, both coronary arteries and myocardial tissue can be assessed on the same&#xD;
      technique (cardiac CT scan) which offers the advantages of being non-invasive, more available&#xD;
      and more easily used than MRI in emergency situations. Cardiac CT allows the detection of&#xD;
      abnormal myocardial territories by showing subepicardial iodinated contrast enhancement with&#xD;
      the spectral mode imaging. It also allows the direct visualization of coronary arteries, thus&#xD;
      preventing the necessity of performing coronary angiography in a significant number of&#xD;
      patients with suspected myocarditis in the setting of acute chest pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of spectral cardiac CT imaging for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of acute myocarditis using cardiac MRI as the gold standard, in patients with&#xD;
      suspected myocarditis in the setting of acute chest pain. The diagnosis of acute myocarditis&#xD;
      using spectral cardiac CT scan will be based on the presence of late subepicardial contrast&#xD;
      enhancement detected using iodine imaging obtained after subtraction of water imaging. The&#xD;
      gold standard will be the diagnosis of acute myocarditis based on the state-of-the-art MRI&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: to assess the radiation dose delivered in spectral cardiac CT scan using&#xD;
      the latest generation of machines from different manufacturers (such as GE Healthcare and&#xD;
      Siemens).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental plan: Multicenter diagnostic accuracy study, conducted within the scope of&#xD;
      routine care of patients admitted for suspected acute myocarditis, conducted according to the&#xD;
      Standards for the Reporting of Diagnostic (STARD) guidelines. Clinical, laboratory, cardiac&#xD;
      MRI, and invasive coronary angiography are performed in routine care. Cardiac MRI serves as&#xD;
      the reference standard for the definitive diagnosis of acute myocarditis. Cardiac CT is also&#xD;
      performed in routine care in order to rule out a coronary disease. The investigators will add&#xD;
      a second acquisition using the spectral mode imaging in order to identify inflammatory areas&#xD;
      of the myocardium on the iodine map imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo both cardiac CT scan with spectral mode acquisition and cardiac MRI&#xD;
      to avoid work-up bias. Spectral CT imaging and cardiac MRI will be performed within 72 hours.&#xD;
