      The purpose of this study is to identify changes in salivary ribosomal nucleic acid (RNA)&#xD;
      expression that are predictive of symptom duration and character following mild traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury (mTBI) in children.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to characterize longitudinal salivary RNA expression in 600&#xD;
      children with mTBI and identify RNA patterns that predict length and characterof concussive&#xD;
      symptoms, as well as the response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Specific RNAs will be differentially regulated in children with prolonged mTBI&#xD;
      symptoms across the acute and sub-acute time periods. The investigators predict that a set of&#xD;
      RNAs with differential expression in children with mTBI will be statistically associated with&#xD;
      functional measures of mTBI symptoms as well as the duration of concussive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Preliminary studies show that miRNA is altered in adults with varying degrees of&#xD;
      TBI and that salivary RNA is altered by disorders of the CNS. These studies indicate that&#xD;
      serum-based miRNA may be used as an accurate biomarker for differentiating adults with and&#xD;
      without TBI. Whether similar patterns can seen in the saliva of children following mTBI&#xD;
      remains to be seen. Furthermore, the influence of confounding variables such as gender,&#xD;
      mechanism of injury, and previous mTBIs on RNA profiles has not been explored. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to investigate these questions by examining salivary RNA from 600&#xD;
      children (ages five to twenty-one years) with a clinical diagnosis of mTBI (as well as 100&#xD;
      age-and gender-matched controls, recruited from the Penn State Pediatric Concussion Clinic,&#xD;
      Emergency Department, and the affiliated primary care clinics). The investigators plan to&#xD;
      prospectively follow 600 children with mTBI for 1-month post-concussion, tracking subjective&#xD;
      symptoms with the Child Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT-5), and objective symptoms of&#xD;
      balance and cognition. Saliva will be collected via swab at three time-points (at initial&#xD;
      clinical presentation, 1-2 weeks, and 4-weeks after the date of initial mTBI). Expression of&#xD;
      salivary RNA taken at initial presentation will be compared against symptom duration (where&#xD;
      prolonged post-concussive symptoms are defined as those lasting &gt;4 weeks) and character (as&#xD;
      measured numerically by Post-concussion symptom inventory self-report and ClearEdge scoring).&#xD;
      The investigators plan to identify a set of salivary RNAs that can easily be used to predict&#xD;
      clinical course for pediatric patients following a diagnosis of mTBI.&#xD;
