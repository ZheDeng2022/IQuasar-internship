      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability&#xD;
      of an antituberculosis drug, bedaquiline (BDQ), when used to treat multidrug-resistant&#xD;
      tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected infants, children, and adolescents.&#xD;

      This purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability&#xD;
      of bedaquiline (BDQ) in combination with an optimized background multidrug-resistant&#xD;
      tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment regimen in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected infants, children,&#xD;
      and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children 0 to 18 years of age treated&#xD;
      for clinically diagnosed or confirmed intrathoracic (pulmonary) MDR-TB and certain types of&#xD;
      extrathoracic MDR-TB. Participants will be assigned to cohorts based on age. Cohort 1 will&#xD;
      include children 6 years of age or older but less than 18 years of age; Cohort 2 will include&#xD;
      children 2 years of age or older but less than 6 years of age; and Cohort 3 will include&#xD;
      children 0 months of age and older but less than 2 years of age. Cohort 1 will be divided&#xD;
      into two weight bands, one for participants weighing 15 kg or more but less than 30 kg and&#xD;
      one for participants weighing 30 kg or more. Cohorts 2 and 3 will include participants&#xD;
      weighing 3 to 30 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at enrollment (Day 0) and at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32,&#xD;
      40, 48, 60, 72, 96, and 120. Participants in each cohort will take BDQ once a day during the&#xD;
      first 2 weeks. For the next 22 weeks, BDQ will be taken three times a week. Dosing for&#xD;
      Cohorts 2 and 3 is based on data from Cohort 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits may include physical examinations, blood and urine collection, an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), medical history reviews, and other assessments.&#xD;
