      All included patients will have their fetal heart rate recording performed with an EDAN F3&#xD;
      fetal monitor that allowed the back up recording of the fetal heart rate beat to beat&#xD;
      detection. Fetal heart rate variability analysis will be performed using Matalb® software.&#xD;

      Preterm Premature Rupture Of Membranes (pPROM) complicates 2-3% of all pregnancies and is&#xD;
      responsible for one-third of preterm birth. Since the membranes generally form a barrier to&#xD;
      ascending infection, the second major complication (10-36%) of pPROM is the development of&#xD;
      intrauterine infection, called chorioamnionitis. It involves infection/inflammation of the&#xD;
      fetus and increases neonatal morbidity and mortality. Indeed, histological chorioamnionitis&#xD;
      (microscopic evidence of polynuclear neutrophils on examination of the placenta), regardless&#xD;
      the prematurity, creates an inflammatory fetal syndrome which is responsible for an increase&#xD;
      rate of cerebral palsy, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, pneumonia, respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome and necrotizing enterocolitis at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During hospitalization, management of women who develop pPROM requires an individual&#xD;
      assessment of the benefits and risks of continuing pregnancy versus immediate delivery to&#xD;
      avoid chorioamnionitis. Numerous studies in recent years have failed to identify a&#xD;
      satisfactory prenatal marker of infection to predict chorioamnionitis. It is now clearly&#xD;
      recognized that new markers are needed to improve prediction of infection in cases of pPROM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective study (under submission) based on 23 pregnant women with pPROM was performed&#xD;
      in the University Hospital of Rennes between 2007 and 2012. For all the patients included, a&#xD;
      computerized analysis of the fetal heart rate (Sonicaïd FetalCare Oxford 8002®) has been&#xD;
      performed daily during the last six days before delivery and the last recording was made less&#xD;
      than 24 hours before the delivery. This study found significant differences of fetal heart&#xD;
      rate patterns from pPROM complicated by histological chorioamnionitis compared with pPROM&#xD;
      without histological chorioamnionitis. Short term variation (p=0,003) and high variation&#xD;
      episodes (p&lt;0,001) decreased significantly in pPROM complicated by histological&#xD;
      chorioamnionitis. An index based on the high variations episodes was performed and seems a&#xD;
      promising tool for the early detection of chorioamnionitis during pPROM (sensitivity 90%,&#xD;
      specificity 84.6%, positive predictive value 71.5%, negative predictive value 95.2%, AUC =&#xD;
      0.88, IC 95% 0.73 to 100).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data are consistent with those observed in neonatology for the assessment of&#xD;
      early-onset sepsis and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms (decreased fetal heart&#xD;
      rate variability and adaptability in response to the placental infection/inflammation).&#xD;
      Therefore, fetal heart rate (FHR) characteristics could be a potential way of research still&#xD;
      unexploited for the early detection of chorioamnionitis in cases of pPROM.&#xD;
