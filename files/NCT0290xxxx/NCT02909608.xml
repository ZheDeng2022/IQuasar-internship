  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is an important factor in understanding how diseases can affect a child.&#xD;
      Decreases in physical activity are sometimes the first thing that happens before a child is&#xD;
      diagnosed with a disease. When a child sees their doctor, that visit reflects a single point&#xD;
      in time. It does not capture how a child feels during the days in between visits to their&#xD;
      doctor. This study plans to use special monitors called actigraphs to collect information&#xD;
      about physical activity in children with a type of disease called pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
      This study will measure how active these children are and compare their activity to clinical&#xD;
      information and to actigraphy measurements in children without pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (roughly 1-5 cases per 1 million children) is&#xD;
      a severe disorder with high mortality and morbidity, but limited treatment options. Pediatric&#xD;
      PAH is defined the same as that in adults, which is the presence of abnormally high pulmonary&#xD;
      artery pressure. In comparison with adults, pediatric PAH is likely a more severe disorder&#xD;
      with higher mortality and morbidity without treatment. Except for INOmax for persistent&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, no drug is currently approved in the US to treat&#xD;
      pediatric PAH patients 1-17 years of age. Drug development to treat pediatric PAH is an unmet&#xD;
      public health need for children and a priority for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
      However, studies that address the safety and efficacy of PAH therapies are rare, in part due&#xD;
      to the lack of suitable clinical endpoints and quantitative and qualitative measures of&#xD;
      disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major limitation towards enhancing outcomes of children with PAH is the lack of pediatric&#xD;
      efficacy endpoints or surrogate measures that are capable of reproducibly and reliably&#xD;
      reflecting changes in pulmonary arterial pressure in response to a therapeutic intervention&#xD;
      that is being assessed in a pediatric clinical trial. Children are often too young and&#xD;
      developmentally unable to perform standard cardiopulmonary exercise testing and the use of&#xD;
      several metrics are not as accurate for reflecting clinical status in children as in adults,&#xD;
      such as 6 minute walking distance. Additionally, the use of cardiac catheterization to&#xD;
      directly measure pulmonary vascular resistance is invasive, requires anesthesia, and has&#xD;
      additional risks for complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, to address this critical and unmet medical need in children with PAH, we propose&#xD;
      to begin develop a novel, developmentally-appropriate non-invasive endpoint in children&#xD;
      through the use of actigraphy. Actigraphy is a mobile device that directly, reproducibly and&#xD;
      non-invasively measures physical activity, which can be readily assessed in the ambulatory&#xD;
      setting, and may provide a novel, simple and inexpensive approach. Impaired exercise&#xD;
      tolerance is a prominent feature of PAH and contributes significantly to reduced quality of&#xD;
      life. Assessing exercise capacity is an integral part of the clinical evaluation of PAH in&#xD;
      adults and the use of the 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) is the most common primary endpoint&#xD;
      in adult PAH clinical trials. Importantly, the 6MWD test and other existing exercise&#xD;
      performance tests that are readily applied in adult studies are not reliable and applicable&#xD;
      for young children and infants. We propose that actigraphy may provide a novel endpoint for&#xD;
      assessing drug efficacy in children if proven to be strongly predictive and reflect clinical&#xD;
      course and outcomes of children with PAH. If successful, this early study has great potential&#xD;
      for having a significant regulatory impact that will advance the public health mission, as&#xD;
      actigraphy could possibly become an endpoint that would be accepted in pediatrics as a&#xD;
      regulatory standard for PAH clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to describe the use of actigraphy in children with PAH&#xD;
      and to determine if correlations exist between actigraphy data and clinical data in children&#xD;
      with PAH.&#xD;
