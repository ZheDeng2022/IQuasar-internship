  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 300 patients with pathologically confirmed Locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      carcinoma were enrolled. Patients were randomly divided into two groups, with 150 patients in&#xD;
      each group. One group was treated with Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy combined with Endostar&#xD;
      and the other group was treated with Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy. The short term efficacy&#xD;
      and the toxic and side effects of these treatments were evaluated. The 1-year, 3-year, 5-year&#xD;
      overall survival and progression-free survival of patients were analyzed. The investigators&#xD;
      data may provide an alternative option for the treatment of Locoregionally advanced&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma with high efficacy and low toxicity.&#xD;

      This study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. A set of&#xD;
      unified standards were used, including the clinical research program, inclusion criteria,&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, chemoradiotherapy regimen and evaluation criteria. Five medical centers&#xD;
      participated in this study and 300 patients with pathologically confirmed Locoregionally&#xD;
      advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma were enrolled. These patients were stratified according to&#xD;
      clinical stage and participating center, and were randomly divided into two groups:&#xD;
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with Endostar group ( IMRT 70-74Gy, Endostar 7.5mg /&#xD;
      m2, 3 cycles of intravenous infusion, and 2 cycles of maintenance therapy after radiotherapy)&#xD;
      and concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ( IMRT 70-74Gy, DDP 100mg / m2, intravenous infusion&#xD;
      over 2 hours , for 2-3 cycles). After treatment, follow-up was performed every 3 months. The&#xD;
      treatment toxicity, local control rate, distant metastasis-free survival, overall survival,&#xD;
      progression-free survival were observed and assessed.&#xD;

Group A: concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with Endostar，including 3 cycles of intravenous infusion, and 2 cycles of maintenance therapy after radiotherapy，and Group B: concurrent chemoradiotherapy, concurrent chemotherapy for 2 or 3 cycles. After treatment, the subjects go into observation period. MRI will be used for evaluating the carcinoma status. During 3 years, any relapse or death will be recorded.</description>
