    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of the novel oral hormonal agents (abiraterone acetate or&#xD;
      enzalutamide) among elderly metastatic prostate cancer patients. This study will assess the&#xD;
      influence of treatments on patients' cognitive functions on a longitudinal basis and evaluate&#xD;
      the quality of life and the adherence of patients who had or develop cognitive disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this new area of multiples new treatments in advanced PCa that could be proposed to&#xD;
      elderly patients, evaluating, understanding and analysing the incidence, severity of&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunctions and their impact on quality of life, autonomy and adherence among this&#xD;
      group of vulnerable patients with advanced disease is a challenge and is essential to help&#xD;
      clinicians taking care of their patients. As the deficits may be subtle and not always&#xD;
      related with complaints, cognitive functions need to be assessed by objective sensitive&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests and by patient-perceived cognitive self-report questionnaire. In&#xD;
      addition to the treatments,there is a range of potential confounders that can contribute to&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, such as co-medications, psychological factors (e.g. anxiety or&#xD;
      depression), fatigue, or cognitive reserve (i.e. patients with higher education, more&#xD;
      occupational attainment, or participation in leisure activities report less clinical or&#xD;
      cognitive changes with aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation and the comprehension of the cognitive decline in patients treated for a&#xD;
      cancer are complex and need a multidisciplinary approach in human sciences in strong link to&#xD;
      clinicians and biologist researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study propose an original unique comprehensive interdisciplinary approach at&#xD;
      the interface between public health, clinical research, psychology and biology which would&#xD;
      have a direct impact on cancer patient care, including a consortium of neuropsychologists,&#xD;
      oncologists and biologist researchers who are working together within the North West&#xD;
      canceropole &quot;cognition and cancer&quot; program. In evaluating cognitive functions, mood, quality&#xD;
      of life and adherence to treatments, fully in the scope of the proposal, will help to improve&#xD;
      our knowledge in this new field of research in human health among cancer patients with a&#xD;
      direct impact for the physicians and the patients. The strength of this project is to propose&#xD;
      (in complement to the study conducted among patients) a comprehensive approach including an&#xD;
      animal model with behavioural tasks as recommended by the ICCTF (International Cognition and&#xD;
      Cancer Task Force).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first one to address the question of the impact of the novel oral&#xD;
      hormonal agents among elderly metastatic prostate cancer patients. This study will assess the&#xD;
      influence of treatments on patients' cognitive functions on a longitudinal basis and evaluate&#xD;
      the quality of life and the adherence of patients who had or develop cognitive disorders.&#xD;
