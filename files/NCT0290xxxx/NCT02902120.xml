  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients treated for chronic hepatitis C&#xD;
      (HCV) with zepatier (grazoprevir/elbasvir) prior to kidney transplant will have a stronger&#xD;
      immune response compared to patients treated after kidney transplant. 25 patients with&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and HCV will be treated with zepatier and 25 kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients with chronic kidney disease will be treated with zepatier. Blood markers of immune&#xD;
      function will be monitored in both groups to determine their response to therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a pilot, prospective, single-center, open-label, non-randomized,&#xD;
      non-controlled, parallel clinical trial. 25 HCV genotype 1 infected patients post transplant&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study. Recruitment will be conducted through the renal transplant and&#xD;
      nephrology outpatient clinics at the University of Maryland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-transplant cohort will include renal transplant recipients of both living donor and&#xD;
      deceased donor organs infected with HCV prior to their transplantation with GFRs &lt;50 with&#xD;
      active HCV viremia. These patients will be recruited from the University of Maryland's&#xD;
      multidisciplinary transplant nephrology clinic or infectious disease clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening All patients will be screened at the Institute of Human Virology (IHV) Clinical&#xD;
      Research Unit. At this visit, all patients will have screening labs drawn and a history and&#xD;
      physical examination performed. Additional requirements will be genotype testing prior to&#xD;
      enrollment, but after transplant and disease staging within 12 months of enrollment by liver&#xD;
      biopsy, elastography, or biochemical testing. For those who do not have a genotype or disease&#xD;
      staging within the specified time frame, genotyping and elastography will be repeated as part&#xD;
      of the study screening work up. Eligibility will be determined based upon these results&#xD;
      within 6 weeks of starting the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the reduced efficacy of this regimen in patients with genotype 1a with the presence of&#xD;
      baseline NS5A resistance-associated variants (RAVs), the investigators will screen patients&#xD;
      for RAVs in patients with HCV genotype 1a at the time of enrollment. Any patient with&#xD;
      genotype 1a HCV found to have NS5A RAVs will undergo 16 weeks of therapy according to current&#xD;
      treatment guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting therapy Study drugs will be administered starting on day 0 after a history and&#xD;
      physical examination is performed and safety labs are checked. All patients will sign an&#xD;
      informed consent as approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to administration&#xD;
      of study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits during treatment Patients will be followed every 4 weeks while they are&#xD;
      receiving study drugs. HCV viral load (VL), safety labs and hepatic panel will be performed&#xD;
      at each of these visits. Patients will also be advised about study adherence and monitored&#xD;
      for adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and adverse event monitoring At each study visit, research nurses will inquire about&#xD;
      adverse events that may or may not be related to study drugs. Any unfavorable medical&#xD;
      occurrences will be recorded, whether or not considered related to the patient's&#xD;
      participation in the research, temporally associated with the patient's participation in the&#xD;
      research. Adverse events (AEs) classified as grade 3 or higher will be reported to the IRB&#xD;
      and principal investigator. Any grade 3 or 4 AEs and all serious adverse events (SAEs) will&#xD;
      be reviewed as they occur by the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety labs will also be drawn at these visits. Levels of immunosuppressive agents will also&#xD;
      be determined at these visits as appropriate. The need for dose modification of the patient's&#xD;
      immunosuppression in the time between visits will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of treatment visit Patients will be seen 12 weeks after starting study drugs (or 16 weeks&#xD;
      in the case of genotype 1a patients with baseline NS5A RAVs) for an end of study visit. HCV&#xD;
      VL, safety labs and hepatic panel will be performed at this visit. Patients will also be&#xD;
      counseled about study adherence and the investigators will inquire about adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post treatment follow up visits Patients will be followed every 4 weeks for 12 weeks after&#xD;
      they complete treatment. HCV VL, safety labs and a hepatic panel will be performed at these&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
