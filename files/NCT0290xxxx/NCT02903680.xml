    <textblock>
      Background: Headaches is one of the most common complaints of children in the ED and the&#xD;
      treatment of pediatric migraine is largely based on extrapolation data from adult studies,&#xD;
      limited pediatric trials, clinical experience and expert consensus. Despite the fact that&#xD;
      dexamethasone has already been proven effective to reduce recurrence and is currently used in&#xD;
      treating adults with migraine, no studies have looked at its use in the treatment of&#xD;
      childhood migraine where relapse rate of about 50% are described in the 48h following&#xD;
      successful treatment in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To examine the effectiveness of parenteral dexamethasone at preventing migraine&#xD;
      recurrence in children and to study the risk factors for migraine relapse after discharge&#xD;
      from the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial among all&#xD;
      children 8 to 17 years of age with a presumptive diagnosis of acute migraine and treated with&#xD;
      a standardized protocol in the ED of the CHU Ste-Justine, a tertiary care pediatric hospital.&#xD;
      After the parenteral administration of prochlorperazine or metoclopramide and&#xD;
      diphenhydramine, the patients were randomised to receive either dexamethasone or a placebo.&#xD;
      They were excluded from the intervention if they had a known allergy or absolute&#xD;
      contraindications to receiving parenteral corticosteroids, if they were already on a&#xD;
      corticosteroid regimen or if they did not respond to the initial abortive migraine therapy.&#xD;
      All included patients were discharged on a 48-hour course of naproxen and with a headache&#xD;
      diary to fill out and return. The primary outcome was the incidence of relapse in the 24-48h&#xD;
      following discharge from ED. The secondary outcomes evaluated were the mean level of pain,&#xD;
      the use of rescue medication after ED discharge, the return rate to the ED or the visit to a&#xD;
      health care professional within 7 days including hospitalisation. The associated symptoms,&#xD;
      the adverse events after parenteral corticosteroids and the risk factors for migraine relapse&#xD;
      were also evaluated. A telephone follow-up was made to ensure the headache diary was&#xD;
      completed and returned.&#xD;

      Study design This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial among&#xD;
      children with a presumptive diagnosis of acute migraine in the ED. The study was approved by&#xD;
      the institutional IRB and written informed assent and consent were obtained by the patient&#xD;
      and a parent respectively, prior to enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting All patients were treated in the ED of the CHU Ste-Justine, a tertiary care&#xD;
      pediatric hospital with approximately 70 000 visits annually. For over 10 years, the members&#xD;
      of this ED have been using a standardized protocol for the treatment of migraine. (7) This&#xD;
      protocol suggests the administration of prochlorperazine and diphenhydramine, to decrease the&#xD;
      rate of akathisia, if the patient is 8 years of age or more and presents with severe migraine&#xD;
      (unable to perform normal activities) or status migrainosus (migraine that last more than 72&#xD;
      hours) to be followed by a few day-course of naproxen. Unfortunately, there was a shortage of&#xD;
      prochlorperazine at the moment of the study, so a decision was made to use metoclopramide&#xD;
      instead, another dopamine (D2) receptor antagonist known to be effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      migraine in adults. (15) To minimize the impact of this research on the clinical management&#xD;
      of patients, it was decided that migraine would be treated according to the standardized&#xD;
      local protocol depending on the availability or not of prochlorperazine. This means that the&#xD;
      treating physician did use the prochlorperazine protocol when possible and metoclopramide if&#xD;
      not. This was accounted for in the randomization to insure balance distribution between&#xD;
      groups. While using dual intervention decreased the homogeneity of the participants, it&#xD;
      improved drastically our external validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Inclusion criteria Patients were eligible if they were between 8 and 17 years of&#xD;
      age and if they were presenting a diagnosis of acute migraine requiring treatment with an&#xD;
      intravenous rescue therapy (either metoclopramide or prochlorperazine) because of the&#xD;
      severity of the migraine according to the treating physician. In a prior study, the same&#xD;
      group of pediatric emergency physicians had their migraine diagnosis confirmed by a pediatric&#xD;
      neurologist in 64 of 68 patients.(16) Exclusion criteria Patients were excluded if they had a&#xD;
      known allergy to any study drugs or a component or absolute contraindication to receiving&#xD;
      corticosteroids such as: active untreated infections, systemic fungal infections, cerebral&#xD;
      malaria, respiratory tuberculosis, hypertension, heart failure, renal or hepatic impairment,&#xD;
      GI diseases, myasthenia gravis, diabetes, cataracts, glaucoma, seizure disorder, thyroid&#xD;
      dysfunction, and thromboembolic tendencies. Also, patients who were already on&#xD;
      corticosteroids were not eligible. Finally, patients who were initially recruited but who did&#xD;
      not respond to the abortive migraine therapy (no modification in the pain level) were not&#xD;
      randomized to receive the intervention or placebo. Information about these patients was kept&#xD;
      but it was not included in the primary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention/procedure As mentioned, all participants received a standardized treatment&#xD;
      consisting of metoclopramide (0.5 mg/kg IV, maximum 10 mg, q 1h prn, maximum of 3 doses) or&#xD;
      prochlorperazine (0.15 mg/kg IV over 2-3 minutes, maximum 10 mg) and diphenhydramine (0.5&#xD;
      mg/kg IV, maximum 25 mg). The intervention of interest was the administration of&#xD;
      dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg IV (max 24 mg) before departure from the ED. The control group&#xD;
      received a similar looking placebo (NaCl 0,9% IV) with the same volume. All patients received&#xD;
      a perfusion of D5% NaCl 0.9% at basal requirements during their stay in the ED and were&#xD;
      discharged on a 48-hour course of naproxen (NaprosynÂ® 5 mg/kg/dose BID, max 500 mg) provided&#xD;
      by our pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome The primary outcome was the incidence of relapse following discharge from the&#xD;
      ED and up to 48 hours after metoclopramide or prochlorperazine initial administration.&#xD;
      Relapse was defined as either occurrence of any headache pain, regardless of its severity,&#xD;
      after a pain free status, or any increase in the pain intensity in participants who left the&#xD;
      ED with residual pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome The secondary outcomes was the mean level of pain using the VAS at 24 and&#xD;
      48 hours following the initial administration of metoclopramide or prochlorperazine, the use&#xD;
      of any rescue medication after ED discharge, the return rate to the ED, or the visit to a&#xD;
      health care professional within 7 days including hospitalization. Also, the associated&#xD;
      symptoms (i.e. nausea, vomiting, photophobia and sonophobia), the adverse events after&#xD;
      parenteral corticosteroids (heartburns, constipation, personality changes such as&#xD;
      irritability, and sleeping problem) and the following risk factors for migraine relapse were&#xD;
      evaluated: headache duration, past history of headache, presence of familial history of&#xD;
      migraine, age, sex, rescue medication at home prior to ED visit, prophylaxis at home prior to&#xD;
      ED visit, past history of neurology consultation, past history of CT scan, maximal pain&#xD;
      intensity, pain intensity on arrival to ED and at discharge, duration of sleep in ED, quality&#xD;
      of sleep in ED, treatment in ED, treatment at discharge, compliance with medication after&#xD;
      discharge, time to return to school, time to return to normal activities, number of hour of&#xD;
      sleep after discharge of ED, and quality of sleep at home after ED discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol All eligible children for whom the treating physician prescribed the migraine&#xD;
      protocol in the study setting were invited to participate in the study before administration&#xD;
      of the first medication (either metoclopramide or prochlorperazine). Baseline demographic&#xD;
      data, vital signs, characteristics and duration of the headache were recorded on a standard&#xD;
      data form. Patients were asked to complete a standardized questionnaire during the ED stay&#xD;
      with the help of their parents if needed. At time 0, prior to any treatment, patients rated&#xD;
      their headache severity on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), on a 0 to 10 verbal numeric&#xD;
      scale (VNS) and on a 4-point verbal numeric scale (VNS) as 0=no headache, 1=mild headache,&#xD;
      2=moderate headache or 3=severe headache. The participants were also asked to rate their&#xD;
      headache on a 4-point functional disability scale as 0=no disability (i.e. able to function&#xD;
      normally); 1=mild disability (i.e. able to perform all activities of daily living but with&#xD;
      some difficulty); 2= moderate disability (i.e. unable to perform certain activities of daily&#xD;
      living); 3= severe disability (i.e. unable to perform most to all activities of daily living,&#xD;
      or requiring bed rest). The participants then received the standard abortive migraine therapy&#xD;
      previously detailed. Patients rated their headache severity on the three scales previously&#xD;
      mentioned 2 hours after the abortive medication was given or as soon as they woke up (if they&#xD;
      fell asleep) and they were asked to report any associated symptoms (i.e. nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      photophobia and sonophobia) and adverse effects (severity, seriousness, time of onset and&#xD;
      resolution). The same assessment was repeated at discharge. Patients were discharged&#xD;
      according to the clinical decision of the ED physician. In the uncommon situation where a&#xD;
      participant was hospitalized because he did not respond adequately to the abortive&#xD;
      intervention, this patient was excluded from the study and was not offered the intervention.&#xD;
      The rationale behind this procedure was that dexamethasone was given to decrease migraine&#xD;
      recurrence but it could not be effective if the migraine did not regressed. Just before&#xD;
      discharge and the removal of the intravenous access, the research nurse took the next&#xD;
      available study package according to the status of the patient (absence or presence of&#xD;
      residual pain at discharge and abortive medication used) and administered the intervention,&#xD;
      either the study drug or the placebo. All patients were discharged on a 48-hour course of&#xD;
      naproxen provided by our pharmacy to facilitate compliance at a dosage of 5 mg/kg twice a day&#xD;
      for 48 hours. The participants were also given a headache diary to fill out and a stamped&#xD;
      envelop with the standardized questionnaire used by the research assistant for follow up in&#xD;
      case the phone interview would not happen. The participants were instructed to answer the&#xD;
      questions of the diary once a day for the first 48 hours after discharge and then on day 4&#xD;
      and 7 and to then return the diary in the stamped envelop. To facilitate compliance with the&#xD;
      headache diary, patients were contacted by telephone at 24-48 hours and one week later to&#xD;
      remind them to complete and return the diary and they were also asked the same questions by&#xD;
      the research assistant on the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding The hospital pharmacist created the randomization table using&#xD;
      computer generated sequence using block randomization of variable sizes. Stratification was&#xD;
      performed according to the absence or presence of pain at discharge and also depending on the&#xD;
      abortive medication used (prochlorperazine or metochlopramide). The pharmacist coded the&#xD;
      study medications in advance. Either dexamethasone (10 mg/mL) or normal saline (placebo) was&#xD;
      placed into each respective syringe and labeled with a code number. Once consent for study&#xD;
      enrolment was obtained, the next consecutive study package was used. Blinding was assured by&#xD;
      dexamethasone and placebo having the same appearance and being administered in the same&#xD;
      volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance and quality control Because the intervention was limited to a single dose of&#xD;
      intravenous medication, compliance was almost perfect. However, we did ensure that the dose&#xD;
      was effectively given to the participants according to their charts. Several precautions were&#xD;
      taken in order to minimize potential biases. A screening log was maintained to record the&#xD;
      number of patients screened, excluded, missed, or not randomized for any other reason. The&#xD;
      diagnosis and reason for exclusion (ineligible or refused patients) was recorded in order to&#xD;
      help us in detecting any selection bias. We also implemented a number of study manoeuvres&#xD;
      aimed at minimizing measurement biases, including (a) designation of a research pharmacist&#xD;
      (not a team member) to prepare the medications according to the randomization list, and (b)&#xD;
      documenting the use of any major co-intervention, such as the use of other analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis All data were entered in an Excel database (Microsoft Inc., Richmond,&#xD;
      WA) and analyzed with SPSS v17 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). To assess balance&#xD;
      across arms, baseline demographic (i.e. gender, age) and clinical data of patients were&#xD;
      compared between arms. In the very unlikely event that a substantial imbalance is found,&#xD;
      additional analyses, in addition to the one proposed below, were carried out to assess the&#xD;
      potential confounding effects of this imbalance. The primary analysis was performed among all&#xD;
      study participants who received the study medication using an intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
      This was the comparison of the proportion of relapse in the 48 hours following intervention&#xD;
      between the 2 groups using chi-square analysis. A secondary analysis compared relapse&#xD;
      proportion at one week. Another secondary analysis used a student t-test to compare mean VAS&#xD;
      for pain at 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days following intervention. Finally, use of rescue&#xD;
      medication, unplanned visit to a healthcare setting and side effects were compared using a&#xD;
      chi-square statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size requirement A previous study done in a pediatric emergency department had&#xD;
      reported that approximately 50% of children successfully treated for migraine in our study&#xD;
      setting had a relapse in the following 48 hours.(7) Based on this, the minimal clinically&#xD;
      significant difference was defined a-priori by our group of pediatric emergency physicians to&#xD;
      be a decrease of that relapse rate to 25%. Assuming these numbers, a total of 58 patients&#xD;
      were required in each group for a power of 0.80 with an alpha of 0.05.&#xD;
