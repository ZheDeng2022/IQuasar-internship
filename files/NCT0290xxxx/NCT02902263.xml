      Early thrombolysis is essential in treating ischemic strokes. The time window for&#xD;
      thrombolysis is limited to 4,5 hours after symptoms onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the French region of Franche Comté, in order to reduce the thrombolytic delay, a&#xD;
      telemedicine network was developed between the neurovascular reference unit (NVU) localised&#xD;
      in the University Hospital of Besançon and the peripheral hospital centres. Patients may then&#xD;
      be transported to the NVU immediately after the thrombolysis initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study was to assess the relevance of a systematic medicalization of transfer&#xD;
      to the NVU of patients with stroke who were telethrombolyzed before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was a retrospective, monocentric and observational study conducted over 24 months, in&#xD;
      Franche-Comte (France).&#xD;

      Stroke is a major health problem with increasing incidence. It represents the leading cause&#xD;
      of disability and the third cause of death in France. There are two main types of stroke:&#xD;
      ischemic (80%) or hemorrhagic (20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early thrombolysis is essential in treating ischemic strokes. The time window for&#xD;
      thrombolysis is limited to 4,5 hours after symptoms onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the French region of Franche Comté, in order to reduce the thrombolytic delay, a&#xD;
      telemedicine network was developed between the neurovascular reference unit (NVU) localised&#xD;
      in the University Hospital of Besançon and the peripheral hospital centres. Patients may then&#xD;
      be transported to the NVU immediately after the thrombolysis initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study was to assess the relevance of a systematic medicalization of transfer&#xD;
      to the NVU of patients with stroke who were telethrombolyzed before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was a retrospective, monocentric and observational study conducted over 24 months, in&#xD;
      Franche-Comte (France). Evaluation of neurological status was made with the Glasgow score&#xD;
      (GCS) and National Institute of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS). The respiratory (SpO2; needs O2)&#xD;
      and hemodynamic status (arterial blood pressure, heart rate) were assessed as well as the&#xD;
      need for medical resuscitation at different times of the transport (thrombolysis, transfer,&#xD;
      arrival at the Regional University Hospital Centre).&#xD;
