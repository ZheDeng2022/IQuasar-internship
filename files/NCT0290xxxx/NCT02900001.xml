  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a routinely deferred invasive strategy&#xD;
      in comparison with an early invasive strategy in Chinese elderly patients of 75 years or&#xD;
      older with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, aiming to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      routinely deferred invasive strategy is not inferior to early invasive strategy in such an&#xD;
      elderly group of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to enroll 696 elderly patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (NSTEMI) from 20 hospitals throughout mainland China.. Consective patients of 75 years or&#xD;
      older with a diagnosis of NSTEMI will be suitable for enrollment. Written informed consent&#xD;
      form will be obtained from every patients. Initially stabilized patients with an ischemic&#xD;
      episode within 24 hours before admission will be randomized and others will be registered.&#xD;
      For randomization, the patients' brief information will be entered in a central randomization&#xD;
      system to generate a random number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the random number, each patient will be randomly assigned to early invasive&#xD;
      therapy versus routinely deferred invasive strategy. All patients will initiate dual&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy (aspirin+P2Y12 inhibitor) and continued till the end of follow-up at one&#xD;
      year. For patients assigned to early invasive group, a loading dose of antiplatelet agent&#xD;
      should be given, unless contraindicated. Anticoagulation, anti-ischemic agents, statin and&#xD;
      other guideline recommended medicine will be given according to physician in charge according&#xD;
      to guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to early invasive strategy will undergo coronary angiography within 24&#xD;
      hours after admission and have percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      grafting as soon as possible during the index hospitalization if appropriate. Patients&#xD;
      assigned to deferred invasive strategy will undergo coronary angiography and subsequent&#xD;
      revascularization after at lest 72 hours after admission and in the index hospitalization.&#xD;
      Patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention can receive a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa&#xD;
      inhibitor if indicated and upfront use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors is discouraged.&#xD;
      The choice of intervention or surgery and the choice of complete or staged revascularization&#xD;
      will be determined by the operator according to coronary anatomy and consistent with current&#xD;
      practice guidelines. Patients assigned to deferred strategy should undergo urgent coronary&#xD;
      angiography and revascularization accordingly if indicated during the period of time waiting&#xD;
      for catheterization. Such procedure will be adjudicated as an endpoint. Elective percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention on non-culprit vessels, in either study arm, can take place sometime&#xD;
      after the index procedure with the goal to achieve complete revascularization. Such staged&#xD;
      procedures will not be deemed as an adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific data for acquisition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research demographics: age, height, weight, body mass index, medications at randomization,&#xD;
      pertinent medical/family/social history, i.e., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, current tobacco use, history of prior myocardial infarction, PCI or CABG. This data&#xD;
      will be gathered by research coordinator through interviewing patient and checking patient's&#xD;
      medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedural: Exact time of onset of ischemic symptoms, of admission, of randomization, and of&#xD;
      undertake coronary angiography will be noted by a supplemental chart, along with important&#xD;
      information like the evidence of occurrence of an endpoint. Blood concentration of&#xD;
      hemoglobin, BNP/NT-proBNP, creatinine, cardiac troponin and C-reaction protein will be tested&#xD;
      at admission. First electrocardiography and echocardiography will be recorded. Thrombolysis&#xD;
      In Myocardial Infarction flow will be recorded before and after PCI procedure, and the images&#xD;
      will be copied to calculate the SYNTAX score afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After hospital discharge, the research coordinator will contact the patient at specified&#xD;
      intervals （30 days after discharge, 180 days and 365 days after randomization） to determine&#xD;
      if an endpoint has been met.&#xD;
