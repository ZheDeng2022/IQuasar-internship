    <textblock>
      This is a two cohort, open-label, pilot study to describe the efficacy of administration&#xD;
      timing of tocilizumab on CART19 (CTL019) associated cytokine release syndrome safety events&#xD;
      in pediatric patients with CD19 expressing relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
      leukemia with high versus low pre-infusion tumor burden following redirected autologous T&#xD;
      cells transduced with the anti-CD19 lentiviral vector (CART19/CTL019).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The duration of active protocol intervention is approximately 12-15 months from the screening&#xD;
      visit. The protocol will require approximately 12-18 months to complete&#xD;
      enrollment.Approximately 39 enrolled patients to reach at least 35 infused patients, with the&#xD;
      ultimate goal of 15 patients in the high tumor burden cohort (Cohort A). Inclusion criteria&#xD;
      are designed to include pediatric patients aged 1-24 years with CD19 expressing&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).Tocilizumab will be given once&#xD;
      to high disease burden patients, and then the patients will be managed for CRS as per the&#xD;
      standard algorithm (including subsequent tocilizumab, if needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two cohorts are defined based upon pre-infusion high versus low tumor burden; with the high&#xD;
      tumor burden cohort (high risk of severe CRS) to receive earlier administration of&#xD;
      tocilizumab for CRS management and the low tumor burden cohort (low risk of severe CRS) to&#xD;
      receive standard timing of tocilizumab for CRS&#xD;
