  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore whether the use of ultrasound guided phrenic nerve block&#xD;
      can reduce the postoperative pain in the shoulder after liver resection. The intervention is&#xD;
      directed postoperative to the patients experiencing novel right sided shoulder pain.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing both laparoscopic and open hepatic surgery often experience shoulder pain&#xD;
      in the postoperative period, mostly on the right side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism behind referral of pain from surgical sites to the ipsilateral (same side)&#xD;
      shoulder is not fully understood. It has been stated, that the sharing of cervical sensory&#xD;
      roots, leads the brain to an interpretation that the pain as originating from the ipsilateral&#xD;
      shoulder, when the phrenic nerve is stimulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phrenic nerve provides both sensory and motor nerves to the diaphragm, and sensory fibers&#xD;
      to parts of the pleura and peritoneum. Furthermore, one anatomical study indicate, that the&#xD;
      phrenic nerve on the right side supply the liver capsule with thin sensory nerves. This could&#xD;
      also, in part, explain the shoulder pain after liver surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies assessing the effect of phrenic block on shoulder pain by surgically applied&#xD;
      intrathoracic block of the phrenic nerve, have found a pain reduction, without significant&#xD;
      side effects. There are no available studies on the effect of phrenic nerve block after&#xD;
      hepatic surgery. Blocking the nerve intraoperatively, as described in thoracic surgery, is&#xD;
      not possible during these operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study of the incidence: A recent survey at Rigshospitalet, Denmark, revealed, that 19&#xD;
      out of 60 patients undergoing various types of hepatic surgery, experienced moderate to&#xD;
      severe right sided shoulder pain in the post operative care unit. The only semi-effective&#xD;
      treatment, has been opioids (morphine), often leading to significant side effects (nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting , dizziness) with a potential for an increase in postoperative morbidity.&#xD;
      Furthermore, referred shoulder pain affects the respiratory capacity postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a method for applying ultrasound-guided block at the lateral&#xD;
      side of the neck, directly at the phrenic nerve where it crosses over the scaleni anterior&#xD;
      muscle. The block is done with low volume of local anesthetic (only 3 ml very close to the&#xD;
      nerve) aiming to avoid affection of the brachial plexus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phrenic nerve block have been performed at right sided shoulder pain in the postoperative&#xD;
      care unit with marked effect within a few minutes (small nerve with little perineural&#xD;
      insulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The idea of the study is to perform a precise, low volume, ultrasound guided nerve block in&#xD;
      the patients who experience a severe right sided shoulder pain (NRS &gt;5 on a 0-10 scale) after&#xD;
      liver surgery and evaluate the effect of active substance vs. placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore the investigators wish to stablish an evaluation of the duration of the phrenic&#xD;
      nerve block when it comes to pain intensity, incidence of referred shoulder pain after liver&#xD;
      surgery, and need for opioid and to evaluate the effect of the block on the lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study results will be described in a primary publication regarding the primary outcome,&#xD;
      and a secondary publication regarding the incidence of acute respiratory and ventilatory&#xD;
      affection observed in the PACU in patients undergoing open liver resection.&#xD;
