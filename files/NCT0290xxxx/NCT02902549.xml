  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgeons are nowadays unable to visualize and quantitatively evaluate microvascularisation in&#xD;
      real-time during surgery. Complications due to vascular compromise are a major problem,&#xD;
      especially in reconstructive surgery. Poor blood perfusion leads to ischemia and even tissue&#xD;
      necrosis. If, however, perfusion and ischemia could be monitored during surgery, then&#xD;
      surgeons could change their reconstructive design and the anaesthesiologists could improve&#xD;
      perfusion with fluids, inotropes or vasopressors, if necessary. Surgeons therefore need a&#xD;
      tool that is able to image in high resolution (microvascularisation), direct,&#xD;
      intra-operative, in 3D (to image thrombosis, luminal narrowing or distinct overlaying&#xD;
      vessels) and that produces quantitative data to objectify image interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical techniques, based on the interaction of light with tissue, are able to image tissue&#xD;
      at high resolution and in real-time. These techniques are FDA-approved and have emerged as&#xD;
      powerful diagnostic tools in different departments of medicine, such as ophthalmology for&#xD;
      visualizing retina vascularisation and dermatology for skin diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators hypothesize that four novel optical technologies: Fluorescence&#xD;
      Imaging, Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging, Optical Coherence Tomography and Sidestream&#xD;
      Darkfield Microscopy are able to quantitatively image perfusion in real-time during surgery.&#xD;

      Primary objective - Perfusion will be measured with all the techniques focussed on 4 areas;&#xD;
      from 'good' to 'decreased' perfusion (biologically)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescence Imaging (FI): Time to intensity measurements at four sides Laser Speckle&#xD;
      Contrast Imaging (LSCI): Perfusion Units Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): Vessel density &amp;&#xD;
      decorrelation time Sidestream Darkfield Microscopy (SDF): Total vessel density, proportion of&#xD;
      perfused vessels, perfused vessel density, max flow index, De Backer score, perfusion in&#xD;
      mm/sec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in parameters between the four sites will be statistically be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Relation of parameters to patient outcome in terms of adverse events.&#xD;
