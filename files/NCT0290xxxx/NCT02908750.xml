  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, 2-part study in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive (EGFRm+) non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC), who have progressed following prior therapy with an approved EGFR tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor (TKI) agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will assess the effect of osimertinib on the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of&#xD;
      fexofenadine, following single and multiple oral dosing of osimertinib in a fasted state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous Access will allow patients further access to osimertinib after the PK phase (Part&#xD;
      A). All patients from Part A who completed treatment may continue to receive osimertinib 80&#xD;
      mg once daily until: they are no longer deriving clinical benefit; or any other reason&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, non-randomised, two-part study in patients with EGFRm+ NSCLC&#xD;
      who have progressed on an EGFR-TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PK phase will assess the effect of osimertinib on the PK parameters of fexofenadine&#xD;
      following both single and multiple oral dosing of osimertinib. Continued access will provide&#xD;
      patients with further access to osimertinib after the PK phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at approximately 10 sites across Asia and Western Europe, with&#xD;
      approximately 24 patients enrolled in order to achieve at least 18 evaluable patients.&#xD;
      Additional patients may be dosed to ensure the minimum number of evaluable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK phase The PK phase is a non-randomised, open-label, 2-period design. Treatment Period 1&#xD;
      and Treatment Period 2 are separated by a 3 to 7 day washout period between doses. A study&#xD;
      flow chart for the PK phase is presented in Figure 1. Patients will receive osimertinib 80 mg&#xD;
      as a single dose on Day 1 of Treatment Period 2, then 80 mg once daily for 38 days (from Day&#xD;
      4 to Day 41 in Treatment Period 2). Patients will also receive a single oral dose of&#xD;
      fexofenadine on Day 1 in Treatment Period 1, and on Days 1 and 39 in Treatment Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continued access On completion of the PK phase (ie, following collection of the 72-hour&#xD;
      fexofenadine sample on Day 42), patients may continue to take osimertinib tablets (80 mg once&#xD;
      daily) as a single agent in continued access if they and the Investigator agree that this is&#xD;
      appropriate. This will continue until the Investigator believes they are no longer deriving&#xD;
      clinical benefit, or they stop taking osimertinib for any other reason. No clinical data will&#xD;
      be collected during this phase other than sudden death of unknown reason, serious adverse&#xD;
      events (SAEs) that may be related to osimertinib, outcomes of pregnancy and drug&#xD;
      dispensing/accountability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient discontinues treatment during the PK phase, they will return to the clinic for&#xD;
      follow-up assessments 30 days (±7 days) after their last dose of treatment in the PK phase.&#xD;
      If the patient's last dose of osimertinib is in continued access, the patient should be&#xD;
      contacted 30 days after their last dose of osimertinib to follow-up any existing SAEs,&#xD;
      monitor for new SAEs that may be related to the IP, and record any sudden deaths of unknown&#xD;
      cause.&#xD;
