    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to better understand (1) why people gain weight when&#xD;
      they quit smoking and (2) whether certain types of smoking cessation (i.e. quit smoking)&#xD;
      counseling combined with the nicotine patch help people quit smoking and gain less weight.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial of the efficacy of a behavioral activation intervention&#xD;
      to smoking cessation and to post-cessation weight gain (BAS+) plus transdermal nicotine (TN)&#xD;
      compared to standard smoking cessation counseling (SC) plus TN in treatment-seeking smokers.&#xD;
      After completing an Intake Visit (~week -3), eligible smokers will be randomized (stratified&#xD;
      by nicotine dependence, BMI and gender) to participate in 8 individual sessions of BAS+ or SC&#xD;
      over a 10-week treatment period with two sessions prior to the target quit date (weeks -2,&#xD;
      -1) and six sessions post-target quit date (TQD [week 0] and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8).&#xD;
      Standard, 8-week; open-label TN will begin on the TQD. Moderators will be assessed&#xD;
      pre-treatment. Mediating mechanisms will be assessed before, during, and at the end of&#xD;
      treatment (EOT, week 8). Smoking will be assessed by self-report and biochemically confirmed&#xD;
      (Carbon Monoxide [CO] &lt; 5) at all in-center visits after quitting, at EOT (week 8), and at&#xD;
      the 12- and 26-week follow-ups. Weight will be assessed at these same time points. Food&#xD;
      intake will be measured by three consecutive days of 24-hour food recalls at Baseline [week&#xD;
      -2] and 4-, 8-, and 12- and 26-weeks post-TQD. Smoking cessation and post-cessation weight&#xD;
      gain (PCWG) are the primary outcomes and food intake is a secondary outcome at 26-weeks&#xD;
      post-TQD. Consistent with intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses, the investigators will measure&#xD;
      smoking cessation and weight gain in the full sample at the 26-week follow-up, evaluating a&#xD;
      smoking status by treatment interaction for the PCWG analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Weight will be measured by a physician's scale (pounds) at the beginning of every in-person visit through study completion. Participants will be wearing light clothing without shoes. Pre-cessation weight will be computed as the average of weights at the Intake and Baseline Visits prior to any change in smoking behavior. Weight change from Baseline to the 26-week follow-up will serve as a primary weight outcome variable.</description>

    <description>Smoking abstinence (primary outcome) will be assessed and biochemically verified at the End of Treatment Visit (week 8), at 12 and 26 weeks after the target quit date. The primary smoking outcome variable will be 7-day point prevalence abstinence (no smoking, not even a puff, for at least 7 days prior to the assessment) biochemically verified by CO &lt; 5 ppm at End of Treatment (week 8), and by saliva cotinine &lt; 15ng/ml at the 12- and 26-week follow-up.</description>

A trained member of the research staff will use a multi-pass method with an interactive computerized software program, the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Recall (ASA24Â®), to determine total kcal/day (outcome variable).</description>

    <description>The goal of the BAS+ is to maintain a level of overall reward after cessation by structuring and enhancing opportunities for reinforcement to: (1) ensure that not smoking is as reinforcing as smoking; and (2) prevent an over-reliance on food as a substitute reinforcer for smoking so that PCWG does not precipitate smoking relapse.</description>

    <description>Overeating and weight gain are common concerns reported during smoking cessation treatment. Per convention, SC will address these concerns through standard recommendations to consume low-calorie snack foods, drink water, eat nutritious meals, and exercise, but will not include skills to shape the use of these suggestions.</description>
