      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a standardized&#xD;
      skin care regimen using a milk lotion once daily and a bathing addendum as needed during the&#xD;
      first 52 weeks of life on the development of atopic Dermatitis (AD) compared to no structured&#xD;
      skin care regimen in infants with atopic predisposition. Secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      investigate the influence of a structured skin care regimen on the development of AD in the&#xD;
      second year of life and the skin barrier function up to the infants' age of 2 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is the most common cutaneous disease in childhood. First manifestations of&#xD;
      AD usually appear early in life after the 3rd month of life and often precede other allergic&#xD;
      diseases such as asthma or allergic rhinitis. AD affects over 15% of children up to school&#xD;
      age in Germany and has a substantial impact on the lives and life quality of both the child&#xD;
      and its family. Taking into account the burden on health-care resources, the impact on the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients and their caregivers, together with increasing evidence that AD&#xD;
      may progress to other allergic phenotypes, there is a clear need to improve disease&#xD;
      prevention. Due to the childhood prevalence of the disease, prevention is focused on the&#xD;
      postnatal period. It is recognized that prevention should start as soon as possible. Current&#xD;
      studies suggest that epidermal barrier impairment is an important factor for the development&#xD;
      of AD and other allergic diseases, with the gene encoding the filament-binding protein&#xD;
      filaggrin (FLG) being the most widely replicated and most significant gene to influence&#xD;
      atopic diseases. Currently, no standardized recommendations for preventive therapies exist&#xD;
      for AD. Pilot studies have focused on interventions to enhance skin barrier function. Daily&#xD;
      skin care with an emollient early after birth is considered to reduce the risk of atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided in 2 parts: The main study (Interventional period) lasts up to the&#xD;
      childÂ´s age of one year (52 weeks of life) and the follow-up period up to the second&#xD;
      birthday.&#xD;
