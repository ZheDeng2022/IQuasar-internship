    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this protocol is to test if Gulf War Illness (GWI) involves chronic&#xD;
      inflammation that cannot be measured with typical techniques. The investigators will be&#xD;
      observing the effects of nine different botanical compounds (supplements) that are known to&#xD;
      suppress inflammation. If one of those supplements helps the symptoms of GWI, it will give&#xD;
      the investigators information about what is wrong in people with GWI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is still a poor understanding of the pain, fatigue, and other symptoms that affect&#xD;
      approximately 250,000 veterans. The precise mechanism of Gulf War Illness (GWI) is not&#xD;
      understood, and there is no targeted treatment for the condition. A current model for GWI&#xD;
      points to the central nervous system, immune cells, called microglia that may be hyperactive&#xD;
      in patients with GWI. Discovering effective treatments for this disorder is a top priority of&#xD;
      GWI research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the investigator's preliminary data, it is suspected that GWI is a form of low-level&#xD;
      neuroinflammation that involves hypersensitivity of receptors on microglia. In order to help&#xD;
      test that hypothesis, the investigators will be administering supplements that have been&#xD;
      shown in vitro or animal in vivo to suppress microglia function in a way that is&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective. If any of these agents suppress symptoms in GWI, it&#xD;
      will give the investigators important information about the disease that may allow for&#xD;
      creation of better diagnostic tools and treatments in future research studies. Observing the&#xD;
      effects of the selected nine anti-inflammatory botanical compounds, in this clinical study,&#xD;
      is a strong compliment to the ongoing mechanistic GWI research.&#xD;
