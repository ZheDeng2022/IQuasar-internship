      Statins are a class of drugs that are the most commonly prescribed medications in developing&#xD;
      countries. Statins act on the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase to inhibit its conversion to&#xD;
      mevalonate, a precursor for cholesterol synthesis. Subsequently statins are prescribed to&#xD;
      patients with relatively high blood cholesterol levels. However, taking statins does not come&#xD;
      without side effects. Most notably, the effects of statins on muscle wasting have been&#xD;
      studied extensively. This includes up-regulation of the ubiquitin proteasome system, muscle&#xD;
      cell damage and rhabdomyolysis, elevated creatine kinase, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Due&#xD;
      to the negative side effects of statin therapy, additional therapies are warranted to help&#xD;
      offset the effects on muscle wasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loss of muscle mass is a significant concern as it is associated with a reduction in muscle&#xD;
      strength and power (Ferrando et al., 1996; Creditor, 1993). This condition is observed in&#xD;
      aging, disease states, and long periods of unloading such as hospital admission and can lead&#xD;
      to disability, increased falls, loss of independence, and mortality. Subsequently, there is a&#xD;
      critical need to develop interventions to counteract this loss of muscle mass and strength.&#xD;
      Exercise is one such intervention, however, in some cases may not be a feasible option. For&#xD;
      instance, exercise has been demonstrated to exacerbate the muscle side of effects of statins.&#xD;
      Subjects complain of increased muscle soreness and have elevated creatine kinase levels and&#xD;
      they also do not want to take statins anymore (Kearns et al., 2008; Parker et al., 2012;&#xD;
      Sinzinger et al., 2004). Because of this limitation, there is a critical need to develop&#xD;
      other interventions that can prevent the loss of muscle mass during statin use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of nutritional interventions have gained much attention and are being explored for&#xD;
      their ability to increase muscle mass and/or attenuate loss of muscle mass. Leucine,&#xD;
      isoleucine, and valine are branched chain amino acids that have been studied extensively and&#xD;
      have been shown to stimulate muscle anabolism. Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), a&#xD;
      metabolite of leucine, has been suggested to play a significant role in preserving muscle&#xD;
      mass in situations that favor muscle mass loss. This is thought to occur through stabilizing&#xD;
      sarcolemma integrity, reduced proteasome activity and expression of the proteasome 20S&#xD;
      subunit, inhibition of apoptosis, and by activation of skeletal muscle satellite cells.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in a catabolic-induced myotube and a murine adenocarcinoma cell line, HMB (50ÂµM)&#xD;
      was more potent in reversing the increased protein degradation and decreased protein&#xD;
      synthesis compared to a higher dose of leucine (1mM). Similar findings were reported in a&#xD;
      rodent cancer model. These data suggests that HMB plays a significant role in preventing&#xD;
      muscle wasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the metabolic fate of HMB is crucial to developing strategies to increase HMB&#xD;
      concentrations in populations that are subjected to muscle wasting. The objective of this&#xD;
      application is to determine if a cholesterol lowering statin alters HMB metabolism in healthy&#xD;
      adults. The Researchers will test the hypotheses that with statin administration, HMB&#xD;
      metabolism and urinary excretion is affected and that this will have an unknown effect on the&#xD;
      production of HMB and the response to intake of HMB precursors like leucine.&#xD;
