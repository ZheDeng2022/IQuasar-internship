  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite maximal safe surgery followed by combined chemo-radiation therapy, the outcome of&#xD;
      patients suffering from glioblastoma (GBM) remains extremely poor with a median survival of&#xD;
      15 months. Hence, new avenues have to be taken to improve outcome in this devastating&#xD;
      disease. Given their intracerebral localization and their highly invasive features, GBM pose&#xD;
      some specific challenges for the development of adequate tumor models. Orthotopic xenograft&#xD;
      models directly derived from the tumor of a patient might represent an attractive perspective&#xD;
      to develop patient-specific targeted therapies. This approach remains however to be validated&#xD;
      for GBM as it offers specific challenges, including the demonstration that the properties of&#xD;
      xenograft models validly represent treatment relevant features of the respective human&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this innovative project the investigators aim to compare and validate an approach of&#xD;
      paired human GBM and respective derived orthotopic xenografts in the mouse brain on the&#xD;
      levels of radiological behavior and metabolism of the tumors, as determined by high&#xD;
      resolution MRI of the patients (7T MRI) and the respective orthotopic mouse xenografts (14.1T&#xD;
      MRI), as well as on the level of the transcriptome, genome, and methylome of the original GBM&#xD;
      tissue and respective derived xenografts/glioma sphere lines. The data will be integrated in&#xD;
      multidimensional analyses and interrogated for similarities and associations with molecular&#xD;
      GBM subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot project will provide the basis for the crucial next steps, which will include drug&#xD;
      intervention studies. New promising drugs, tested pre-clinically in the mouse orthotopic&#xD;
      xenograft models established here using the radiologic/metabolic/molecular procedures&#xD;
      described for this project, will be taken into patients in phase 0 studies. GBM patients will&#xD;
      receive radiologic/metabolic follow-up using high resolution MRI under drug treatment,&#xD;
      followed by resection of the tumor and subsequent acquisition of molecular data.&#xD;

      The presented project will focus on the evaluation of a multimodal approach comparing human&#xD;
      GBM to paired samples of orthotopic xenografts using high resolution MRI and MRS and&#xD;
      multidimensional molecular profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients with a high probability for newly diagnosed GBM based on MRI-scan ( 3 Tesla (3T)&#xD;
      MRI, T1, T2, T1 gadolinium, DWI &amp; MRI Spectroscopy) will be identified in the CHUV prior to&#xD;
      undergoing neurosurgical resection. Patients will undergo extensive experimental radiological&#xD;
      examination using specific MRI sequences on the 7 Tesla (7T) MRI to identify specific&#xD;
      metabolic pathways (see below, section on imaging). Thereafter patients will undergo maximal&#xD;
      safe neurosurgical resection of their tumors. The portion of the tumor that is not used for&#xD;
      diagnostic purposes will be collected immediately for further use (see below, section on&#xD;
      molecular evaluations). Following resection, patients will undergo standard of care treatment&#xD;
      [usually combined radio-chemotherapy, or will be offered participation in a clinical trial.&#xD;
      The clinical parameters will be collected, including histopathological features and the&#xD;
      evolution and growth pattern of the residual tumor (if present), or the development of&#xD;
      recurrences will thereafter be compared to the parameters and evolution of the xenograft&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At high magnet field strength (7T), high signal-to-noise ratio and increased spectral&#xD;
      dispersion allow more reliable measurement of a large number of metabolites using Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Spectroscopy in comparison to clinical available field strengths (3T and below). In&#xD;
      addition, the authors have developed a full sensitivity short-echo-time single voxel&#xD;
      spectroscopy (SVS) sequence &quot;semi-adiabatic SPECIAL&quot;(2) which was implemented, validated at&#xD;
      7T and allows the quantification of 15 metabolites with high precision including&#xD;
      N-acetylaspartate(NAA), glutamine(Gln), glutamate(Glu), myo-inositol(Ins),&#xD;
      phosphorylethanolamine(PE), total choline(tCho), creatine, phosphocreatine,&#xD;
      N-acetylaspartylglutamate(NAAG), lactate(Lac), glutathione(GSH), aspartate (Asp),&#xD;
      taurine(Tau), scyllo-inositol and γ-aminobutyric acid(GABA). This localization technique was&#xD;
      further extended to a MR Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) technique at 7T, which allows mapping&#xD;
      of the spatial distributions of cerebral metabolites. Furthermore, glycine is a possible&#xD;
      marker for tumor malignancy and its detection in vivo has been established in our previous&#xD;
      study using TE=30ms with SPECIAL sequence at 7T. Therefore, in this study the aforementioned&#xD;
      techniques will be used to obtain the neurochemical information and its spatial distribution&#xD;
      in the glioblastoma of the patients. These data will be further compared with the&#xD;
      neurochemical information obtained in the orthotopic xenografts in the mouse brain derived&#xD;
      from the respective glioblastoma patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All MRS measurements of glioblastoma patients will be performed on a 7T MR scanner with a CP&#xD;
      Transmit / 32 channel receive array head coil. Based on the high resolution T1-weighted&#xD;
      images obtained using the MP2RAGE sequence, Volume of Interest (VOI) for spectroscopy will be&#xD;
      placed according to the location of the glioblastoma. Total acquisition time of MRS will be&#xD;
      within 30 min. In vivo MRS spectra will be post-processed and metabolite concentrations will&#xD;
      be quantified to create metabolite maps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular and functional investigations of paired samples of primary glioblastoma and&#xD;
      respective orthotopic xenografts in the mouse&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to determine the molecular, histopathological, and functional&#xD;
      properties, including growth patterns such as invasiveness, of the original GBM and the&#xD;
      respective derived orthotopic xenografts in the mouse, and link them to imaging/ metabolism&#xD;
      parameters obtained by high resolution MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBM samples from patients collected at surgery will be divided into 2 parts, (i) snap frozen&#xD;
      for molecular analyses, and (ii) cultivated under stem cell conditions for subsequent&#xD;
      stereotactic transplantation into male immune-compromised mice and establishment of sphere&#xD;
      lines.&#xD;
