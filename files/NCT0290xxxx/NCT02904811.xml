  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to determine whether early screening and treating young&#xD;
      women (&lt;25 years of age) for genital Chlamydia Trachomatis (Ct) infection reduces the&#xD;
      cumulative incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) over 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary objectives, the study aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the baseline prevalence and the incidence of Ct infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve knowledge on natural history of Ct infection in young women such as the rate&#xD;
           and timing of progression to PID (at the beginning of the infection, at the end,&#xD;
           throughout the course of infection), as well as the incidence of reinfections with Ct;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the relation between host immuno-genetic factors and the clearance,&#xD;
           persistence and development of late complications (PID) as an explanation for the&#xD;
           inter-individual heterogeneity in the susceptibility to and course of Ct infection.&#xD;

      In this research project, the study aims to assess a screening strategy (early screening and&#xD;
      treatment of Ct genital infection in young women to prevent complications) that may be&#xD;
      implemented in the future if proved efficient 7 centers are involved in the enrollment&#xD;
      (university health services), and 4 centers will participate in the study within the frame of&#xD;
      the follow-up and final visit (hospital gynaecology departments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants included will have to perform 4 self-taken vaginal samples linked to four online&#xD;
      corresponding questionnaires, at different timeframes 6-month apart to each other (M0, M6,&#xD;
      M12, M18). The first sampling (M0) will be performed at the university health service, this&#xD;
      self-taken sampling could also be performed at home later in case of menstruation; the others&#xD;
      (M6, M12, M18) will be performed at home (or at the university if problem of sampling kits&#xD;
      receiving at home).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two following arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in the non-intervention arm, participants will follow current guidelines of Ct screening&#xD;
           (i.e. opportunistic screening only in STI clinics for women aged less than 25 years&#xD;
           old), and their samples will be tested for Ct at M18 by the NRC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in the intervention arm, analyses for Ct will be carried out immediately by the NRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final visit with a hospital gynecologist is planned for all participants between M18 and&#xD;
      M24 and aims at providing an extensive clinical examination to seek for potential signs of&#xD;
      pelvic inflammatory disease and to treat participants if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on all data collected on the electronic platform through questionnaires from the&#xD;
      different visits, independent experts blinded on chlamydia status will assess PID status of&#xD;
      all participants (no PID, probable PID, confirmed PID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of enrollment is planned for 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of follow-up for each patient is 18 months to 24 months.&#xD;
