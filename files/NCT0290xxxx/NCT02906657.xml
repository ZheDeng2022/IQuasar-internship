      Context Adverse drug events (ADEs) may occur in hospitalized patients and may result from&#xD;
      discrepancies between patient's current medications and the drugs prescribed at admission&#xD;
      (omission, commission, dosing errors….). Consequences of these discrepancies may be mild&#xD;
      (e.g. isolated biological abnormalities), but may also lead to severe clinical outcomes.&#xD;
      Medication reconciliation is a process of creating the most accurate list of patient's&#xD;
      current medication in order to decrease discrepancies and eventually ADEs. Information&#xD;
      technology and electronic health records are of great interest in this process. In France,&#xD;
      medications dispensed in community pharmacies during the past 4 months are registered in&#xD;
      patient's electronic pharmaceutical record. The impact of this record together with a&#xD;
      pharmacist medication reconciliation will be tested in the CONCIPAGE study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The CONCIPAGE study is a national, multicenter, cluster-randomized, two-period&#xD;
      cross-over study. It will estimate the impact of a medication reconciliation, made by a&#xD;
      pharmacist, using patient pharmaceutical record, on the occurrence of ADEs during the&#xD;
      hospitalization of patients aged 65 years and over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen hospitals gathering 20 centers (8 geriatric departments, 8 internal medicine&#xD;
      departments, and 4 orthopedic surgery departments) will participate in the study. An&#xD;
      equilibrated randomization will be applied to the 20 centers. The recruiting period will last&#xD;
      for 24 months and will be divided into four 6-month consecutive periods (A, B, C, D). During&#xD;
      the first 6-month period (period A), 5 centers (1 to 5) will apply one strategy (intervention&#xD;
      or usual care) while 5 others (6 to 10) will apply the alternative strategy. Centers 11 to 20&#xD;
      will not recruit patients during period A. During the next period (period B), centers 11 to&#xD;
      15 and 16 to 20 will apply the intervention or the control strategy, while centers 1 to 10&#xD;
      will apply a 6-month wash-out period. During period C, centers 1 to 10 will apply the&#xD;
      alternative strategy as compared to that applied during period A (cross-over design), while&#xD;
      centers 11 to 20 will apply the 6-month wash-out period. During period D, centers 11 to 20&#xD;
      will apply the alternative strategy as compared to that applied during period B, while&#xD;
      centers 1 to 10 will not recruit patients during period D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the intervention During the control period, no intervention will be held. The&#xD;
      prior to admission medication list will be made as usual by the hospital physician: interview&#xD;
      of the patient and relatives, prescriptions brought by the patient, call to community&#xD;
      physicians and pharmacists, hospital medical records, etc. This process will result in a&#xD;
      medication prescription list at admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention period, a local hospital pharmacist will independently perform an&#xD;
      additional (i.e. to that made by the hospital physician) prior to admission medication list,&#xD;
      using the above-mentioned sources and in addition, with the help of the electronic&#xD;
      pharmaceutical record. The medical reconciliation in the intervention period consists in the&#xD;
      comparison of the pharmacist's and physician's prior to admission medication lists. Such a&#xD;
      reconciliation might lead to a modification of the medication prescription that was made by&#xD;
      the physician at admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up Patients will be included the day of admission and will be followed-up up&#xD;
      to 30 days. A study pharmacist will be enrolled and will be in charge of collecting follow-up&#xD;
      data for all patients. The study pharmacist will visit centers 2, 4, and 7 months after the&#xD;
      beginning of each period. He/she will study the record of each patient included in the study,&#xD;
      and will collect all potential biological or clinical abnormalities, prescriptions of&#xD;
      antidotes and diagnostic imaging, transfer to ICU, death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The primary objective of the study is to assess the impact of medication&#xD;
      reconciliation by a pharmacist using usual sources plus the electronic pharmaceutical record&#xD;
      on ADEs occurring in hospital settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess severity and preventability of ADEs in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the distribution of ADEs in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the 30-day mortality rates observed in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the intervention group only, to assess the rate of intentional (treatment&#xD;
           modification intended by the physician) and unintentional discrepancies between the&#xD;
           prior to admission medication list made by the pharmacist and the hospital physician's&#xD;
           prescription at admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the intervention group only, to assess the rate of discrepancies between the hospital&#xD;
           prescription at admission and the prescription after medical reconciliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;

      Context Adverse drug events (ADEs) may occur in community or hospitalized patients. A review&#xD;
      of the literature reports an incidence of ADEs varying from 0.1 to 61.4 %. This wide range&#xD;
      may be explained by different designs and case-mix in the studies. For instance, the&#xD;
      incidence of ADEs is higher in surgical wards or in the elderly, and increases with the&#xD;
      number of prescribed drugs. In the elderly, the risk of ADE has been reported as 2-fold&#xD;
      higher than that of a younger population. Some ADEs may not have been prevented, for example&#xD;
      when the event was associated with an intended or known effect (e.g. neutropenia after&#xD;
      cytotoxic drugs administration). However, some other ADEs might have been prevented whenever&#xD;
      they were related to medications errors (omission, commission, dosing errors, prescription&#xD;
      despite known allergies…). The proportion of preventable ADEs has been reported to range from&#xD;
      25% to 43% of total ADEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADE can lead to extra monitoring because of biological abnormalities but also in more serious&#xD;
      cases, to temporary or permanent harms, and even to death. Prolonged hospitalizations are&#xD;
      also attributed to ADE. Gastrointestinal tract events are the most common type of ADEs,&#xD;
      followed by electrolyte and renal events, hemorrhages, metabolic and endocrine events. Drugs&#xD;
      involved are cardiovascular drugs, followed by analgesics, antibiotics and anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discrepancies between patient's current medication and the drugs prescribed at hospital&#xD;
      admission hospital are frequent (27 to 54%) and have been reported in numerous studies.&#xD;
      Potential consequences of such discrepancies have been extensively studied but data dealing&#xD;
      with clinical outcomes are sparse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication reconciliation is a process aiming at the creation of the most appropriate list of&#xD;
      patient's medications, thus decreasing medication discrepancies and eventually ADE.&#xD;
      Medication reconciliation can be performed by physicians, nurses, pharmacists. Usual sources&#xD;
      of information for medication reconciliation are patient's prescriptions from the attending&#xD;
      physician, patient's interview, hospital records… Additionally, information technology and&#xD;
      electronic health records are of great help in this process. In France, drugs dispensed to a&#xD;
      patient in community pharmacies during the 4 past months are registered in his/her electronic&#xD;
      pharmaceutical record which is available to any pharmacist nationwide. This database is&#xD;
      protected and can be consulted after recognition of the patient's healthcare card. To date,&#xD;
      the contribution of this record to medication reconciliation has not been studied. The&#xD;
      CONCIPAGE study will estimate the impact of a medication reconciliation using patient&#xD;
      pharmaceutical record, on the occurrence of ADEs during the hospitalization of patients aged&#xD;
      65 years and over.&#xD;

      will apply a 6-month wash-out period. During period C, centers 1 to 10 will apply the&#xD;
      alternative strategy as compared to that applied during period A (cross-over design), while&#xD;
      centers 11 to 20 will apply the 6-month wash-out period. During period D, centers 11 to 20&#xD;

      data for all patients. The study pharmacist will visit centers 2, 4, and 7 months after the&#xD;

        -  In the intervention group only, to assess the rate of discrepancies between the hospital&#xD;
           prescription at admission and the prescription after medical reconciliation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis set. The primary analysis will be conducted according to the intent-to-treat&#xD;
      principle (ITT), at the individual level, considering every patient included irrespective of&#xD;
      the patient's follow-up and will take into account the clustering nature of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The calculation of number of patients takes into account the cluster cross-over&#xD;
      design and results in 44 patients per center and per period. This figure will be rounded to&#xD;
      50 patients per center and per period (to integrate lost to follow-up patients). We therefore&#xD;
      intend to include 2000 patients in the study. Once the required 50 inclusions will be reached&#xD;
      in a given center during a given period, the inclusions will be stopped in this center until&#xD;
      the end of this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods for main endpoint analysis. The proportion of patients with at least one ADE observed&#xD;
      in the intervention group will be compared to that observed in the control group. A&#xD;
      hierarchical logistic regression model will be developed for making this comparison, with the&#xD;
      period, the arm, and the cluster, handled as fixed effects, and the order of strategies, and&#xD;
      individual residual error handled as random effects. To assess the efficacy of the&#xD;
      intervention we will test if the slope of regression line is statistically different from 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods for secondary endpoint analyses. The analysis of secondary endpoints will be&#xD;
      performed using the same methodological framework taking into account the clustering and the&#xD;
      period effect but with linear models (for continuous variables) or Poisson (for rates),&#xD;
      depending on the type of outcome analyzed. Any comparison of baseline variables (considering&#xD;
      the cluster structure of the study) will be based on Mantel-Haenszel or Wilcoxon signed rank&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods for medico-economic analysis The analysis will be performed according to the payer's&#xD;
      perspective with a horizon time of 30 days, and will result in estimating the incremental&#xD;
      cost effectiveness of the intervention, expressed as a cost per ADE avoided: [hospital costs&#xD;
      (intervention) - hospital costs (control)] / [number of ADEs (intervention) - number of ADEs&#xD;
      (control)].&#xD;
