  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Refractory glaucoma often requires vision-sparing trabeculectomy. To increase surgical&#xD;
      success, adjunctive pharmacotherapy is utilized albeit the risk of adverse events. This&#xD;
      prospective trial randomizes adults with uncontrolled glaucoma to assess an emerging healing&#xD;
      modulatory strategy. Over a 1-year follow-up, trabeculectomy complemented with intracameral&#xD;
      delivery of anti-angiogenic bevacizumab (1.25 mg) is compared to standard trabeculectomy with&#xD;
      anti-fibrotic mitomycin-C (0.02%; applied for 2 minutes).&#xD;

      This is a prospective, parallel, randomized, comparative, interventional feasibility study.&#xD;
      Eyes of Caucasian patients with medically uncontrolled glaucoma or intolerance to glaucoma&#xD;
      medications, who are evaluated at the glaucoma service of the Athens Vision Eye Institute and&#xD;
      are scheduled for filtration surgery within one calendar year, are enrolled. If both eyes of&#xD;
      one patient are eligible one eye is randomly selected. Inclusion criteria include adult&#xD;
      patients with primary or secondary open angle or angle closure glaucoma with preoperative&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP) &gt; 21 mmHg on maximally tolerated medical therapy at least on 2&#xD;
      occasions prior to randomization with the ability to attend regular follow-up. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria include age (&lt; 18 years), pregnancy, severe ocular surface disease, need for&#xD;
      combined phacotrabeculectomy, uveitic or neovascular glaucoma, any prior intraocular surgery&#xD;
      except for uncomplicated phacoemulsification and a history of a systemic thromboembolic event&#xD;
      within 6 months before surgery. The research adheres to the tenets of the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki and is approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Athens Vision Eye&#xD;
      Institute. Informed consent will be granted from all patients preoperatively explaining&#xD;
      indications and risks of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are recruited by the principal investigator and surgeon (GK). The study is&#xD;
      unblinded to both patients and investigators. Eyes are randomly assigned to 2 treatment arms&#xD;
      by an online random number generator (www.random.org): the &quot;mitomycin C group&quot; that undergoes&#xD;
      standard guarded trabeculectomy supplemented with mitomycin C (Kyowa, Galabank Business Park,&#xD;
      UK); the &quot;bevacizumab group&quot; that undergoes guarded trabeculectomy with a single 1.25 mg&#xD;
      intracameral injection of bevacizumab (Roche, Welwyn Garden City, UK). The online random&#xD;
      number generator is accessed for each individual patient by the nursing staff (circulating&#xD;
      nurse), which is unaware of study design and patient's characteristics, immediately prior to&#xD;
      the surgical procedure. Sample size analysis (www.powerandsamplesize.com) reveals that for a&#xD;
      power of 80% assuming a 5% type I error, an average post-op intraocular pressure of 12mmHg&#xD;
      and a similar sampling ratio, 13 eyes in each group are necessary to detect a 3mmHg&#xD;
      difference in IOP at twelve months (superiority or non-inferiority design). Assuming a&#xD;
      dropout rate of 30% at 5 years the investigators aim for 20 eyes in each study group.&#xD;
      Furthermore, power analysis reveals that for a power of 80% assuming a 5% type I error, a&#xD;
      surgical success rate of 90% at 1 year and a similar sampling ratio, 20 eyes in each group&#xD;
      are necessary to detect a 24% difference in rate of surgical success at twelve months&#xD;
      (superiority or non-inferiority design).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery, all patients undergo a comprehensive eye examination including slit lamp&#xD;
      biomicroscopy, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) determination, intraocular pressure&#xD;
      measurement using Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) at least on 2 separate occasions&#xD;
      performed one week apart, gonioscopy and dilated fundus examination. All patients should have&#xD;
      at least one visual field test on file, performed not more than 6 months prior to&#xD;
      randomization. The Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer (HFA II-i, Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc, Dublin,&#xD;
      CA, USA) will be used and the 24/2 SITA-Standard protocol will be utilized in all instances.&#xD;
      Preoperative data collected from the medical record of individual patients include age, race,&#xD;
      sex, diagnosis, study eye, BCVA, number and type of glaucoma medications, intraocular&#xD;
      pressure, global visual field indices, central corneal thickness (CCT), cup to disc ratio,&#xD;
      number and type of previous intraocular surgeries and previous glaucoma laser procedures. All&#xD;
      pseudophakic eyes should have a history of primary open angle or exfoliation glaucoma, and&#xD;
      should have undergone uneventful cataract extraction with a posterior chamber intraocular&#xD;
      lens implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are examined on post-operative day one, day three, week one and every week&#xD;
      thereafter for the first month, and subsequently on post-operative months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12.&#xD;
      A window of + 1 week is allowed for the 1st and 3rd month post-operative visits, and a window&#xD;
      of + 2 weeks is allowed for the 6th, 9th and 12th month post-operative visits. During each&#xD;
      visit a comprehensive ophthalmic examination is carried out. This includes intraocular&#xD;
      pressure measurement, glaucoma medication requirement update, BCVA, review of early and late&#xD;
      complications related to surgery (i.e., blebitis, bleb leak) and additional surgical&#xD;
      interventions. These data are recorded in the patients' medical record and are extracted and&#xD;
      tabulated in Excel 2013 spreadsheets (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) by an individual who is not&#xD;
      participating in patient's management decisions and is blinded with respect to treatment&#xD;
      assignment. Subsequently, data are analyzed by a separate individual who reveals study group&#xD;
      assignment and calculates means, surgical success rates and complication rates. All patients'&#xD;
      data are dealt with confidentiality. Statistical comparisons are performed according to&#xD;
      initial treatment group assignment (intention to treat analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional post-operative visits and/or interventions at the slit lamp such as 5-fluorouracil&#xD;
      (5-FU) injections, bleb needlings and laser suture lyses are at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating ophthalmologist and do not qualify as failures. BCVA is recorded by certified&#xD;
      optometrists utilizing clear chart digital screens (Reichert, Depew, NY, USA) placed at 4 m.&#xD;
      All patients will undergo 24/2 Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA) Standard&#xD;
      Automated Perimetry (SAP) on an annual basis in the post-operative period. SAP will be&#xD;
      repeated typically within one month if unreliable.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Standard Guarded Trabeculectomy</intervention_name>
    <description>A fornix based conjunctival peritomy is performed. A partial thickness scleral flap is dissected. Then trabeculectomy is performed with a Kelly's punch. A surgical iridectomy is performed. The scleral flap is secured with two pre-placed 8-0 Vicryl sutures (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). The anterior chamber (AC) is inflated with balanced salt solution and suture tension is adjusted. Finally, conjunctiva is closed with 10-0 running Nylon sutures (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). Patients receive a subconjunctival injection of 0.4 ml dexamethasone (4 mg/ml) and of 0.4 ml gentamicin (40 mg/ml) at the end of the case. Adjuvant pharmacologic treatment to prevent episcleral fibrosis and failure of the procedure is applied according to treatment arm assignment.</description>
