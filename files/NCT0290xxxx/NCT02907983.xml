    <textblock>
      Hot flashes and night sweats (vasomotor symptoms, VMS) affect 80% of women during the&#xD;
      menopausal transition (MT). VMS are associated with decreased quality of life, increased&#xD;
      depressive and anxiety symptoms, memory complaints, sleep disturbance, and reduced work&#xD;
      productivity. Hormone therapy (HT) is highly effective in reducing VMS, but the use of HT&#xD;
      declined 75% to 80% in the U.S. after the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) raised safety&#xD;
      concerns about HT. In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved paroxetine, a&#xD;
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; 7.5 mg), as the first non-hormonal treatment&#xD;
      for VMS. SSRIs are an important treatment option for many women, but their use in treating&#xD;
      VMS is limited by lower effectiveness when compared to HT, side effects, and relapse of&#xD;
      symptoms following treatment discontinuation. Identifying safe and effective non-hormonal&#xD;
      treatments for VMS remains a priority in women's health research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stellate ganglion blockade (SGB), used for decades in pain management, is a potential new&#xD;
      approach to VMS treatment. Located in the cervical spine region, the stellate ganglia are&#xD;
      part of the sympathetic nervous system. Although SGB is commonly performed to treat&#xD;
      neuropathic pain, hyperhidrosis or vascular insufficiency, anatomic studies reveal&#xD;
      connections between this ganglion and thermoregulatory regions of the brain, specifically the&#xD;
      insular cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial, we aim to assess whether stellate ganglion block (SGB) with&#xD;
      bupivacaine, a local anesthetic, is an effective and safe non-hormonal intervention for women&#xD;
      seeking relief from vasomotor symptoms (VMS), and identify the physiologic mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying SGB effects. Outcomes will include frequency and intensity of hot flashes,&#xD;
      objectively-measured VMS, mood, quality of life, sleep, and memory performance in 160&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with 50 or more moderate to very severe hot flashes per week as measured&#xD;
      by self-report for six months. They will be reassessed at 3 and 6 months following the SGB or&#xD;
      a sham intervention for objective hot flashes and quality of life measures. Mechanistic&#xD;
      outcomes (neuroimaging) will be obtained at baseline and 3 months following the intervention.&#xD;
      Ambulatory monitoring of sympathetic nervous system function (SKNA) will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline before the procedure, during the procedure and 1 hour following the procedure. This&#xD;
      will be repeated at 2 and four weeks following the SGB or sham procedure for 1 hour&#xD;
      recordings.&#xD;

      Scope:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-menopausal women with moderate to severe VMS will be enrolled as participants in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Goals and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effect of SGB for reducing frequency and intensity of menopausal VMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1a. Seven-day mean frequency of VMS will be lower in women randomized to&#xD;
           active SGB compared to sham control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1b. Seven-day mean intensity of VMS will be lower in women randomized to&#xD;
           active SGB compared to sham control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1c. The VMS Intensity (Frequency*Severity), will be lower in women randomized&#xD;
           to active SGB compared to sham control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effect of SGB on VMS Intensity, objective VMS, mood, memory, and sleep&#xD;
           quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 2a The frequency of objectively measured VMS will be lower in women&#xD;
           randomized to active SGB compared to sham control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 2b. Depressive symptoms and memory, but not sleep quality, will improve more&#xD;
           in women randomized to active SGB compared to sham control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 2c. The magnitude of improvements in memory will relate to the magnitude of&#xD;
           reduction in VMS, even after controlling for sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To probe the mechanisms by which SGB improves VMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3a. In a nested sub study, neuroimaging assessments will reveal that compared to&#xD;
      sham control, active SGB is associated with a) decreased functional connectivity in the&#xD;
      default mode network during the resting state, particularly for networks supporting the&#xD;
      insula and hippocampus; b) reduced activation in the hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex, and anterior cingulate during a verbal memory task; and c) reduced activation in the&#xD;
      amygdala during an emotion processing task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3b. Compared to sham control, SGB will immediately diminish ipsilateral stellate&#xD;
      ganglion nerve activity and sympathetic tone as measured by skin sympathetic nerve monitoring&#xD;
      (SKNA) and these effects will be reassessed at 2 and 4 weeks after the intervention to assess&#xD;
      if effects of SGB on stellate ganglion activity are long lasting.&#xD;
