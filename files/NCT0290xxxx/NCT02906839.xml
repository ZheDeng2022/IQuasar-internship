      The main aim of this project is to assess the effect of Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) screening&#xD;
      (and treatment if SAS is moderate to severe, defined by an apnea hypopnea index &gt;15 / h) on&#xD;
      recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) over a twenty-four month follow-up period, in patients&#xD;
      on optimal medical treatment after AF ablation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is a common but often undiagnosed disorder associated with&#xD;
      substantial cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. SAS prevalence in atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      (AF) is 20% to 75%. SAS is associated with both myocardial fibrosis and electrical remodeling&#xD;
      which both favor recurrence of AF despite medical treatment or atrial ablation. Proportion of&#xD;
      patients with SAS are higher in patients with high-frequency paroxysmal AF and persistent AF&#xD;
      than those with low frequency paroxysmal AF. Furthermore, untreated SAS doubles the risk of&#xD;
      recurrence of AF after electrical cardioversion. Noteworthy, up to now, given the large&#xD;
      number of potential candidates, not all patients with AF are screened for SAS despite recent&#xD;
      international guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational studies suggest that treatment of SAS can prevent recurrence of AF episodes but&#xD;
      no randomised trial demonstrate this with an adequate level of evidence. In addition, SAS&#xD;
      treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has proven its efficacy on other&#xD;
      pathologies on cardiovascular outcomes as stroke and to a lesser extend hypertension. In&#xD;
      several countries including France, CPAP is reimbursed by national health services. However&#xD;
      there are few data on the cost effectiveness of SAS treatment from the standpoint of&#xD;
      cardiovascular health costs and no study in AF. Limits of small randomized studies and&#xD;
      observational cohorts are fairly illustrated by very recent results of a randomized trial,&#xD;
      the SERVE-HF study, which raised the question of central SAS treatment on mortality in&#xD;
      systolic heart failure patients. This multicentre randomized trial showed no difference in&#xD;
      global mortality between groups, with even an increased OR for cardiovascular death in&#xD;
      patients treated for central SAS. In this context, the need of a randomized trial in AF, with&#xD;
      a data safety and monitoring board, is even more important to confirm results of&#xD;
      observational studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that SAS screening (and SAS-treatment if screening is positive) in patients&#xD;
      presenting with recurrent AF will decrease the risk of recurrence of AF, therefore decreasing&#xD;
      associated health costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAS is largely under-diagnosed in AF patients and screening is recommended despite lack of&#xD;
      high level-evidences on efficacy of SAS treatment on AF recurrence, and still low resources&#xD;
      in terms of SAS screening and absence of cost-effectiveness analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a study design in which patients are randomized for SAS screening&#xD;
      in two groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the control group will receive usual care and follow-up of AF;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the intervention group will benefit of screening for SAS and treatment if relevant&#xD;
           (moderate to severe SAS defined by an apnea hypopnea index (AHI)&gt; 15/h), in addition to&#xD;
           usual treatment of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost-effectiveness of a systematic screening for SAS in AF has never been studied despite&#xD;
      the personal and economic burden of SAS treatment. The investigators will analyze the&#xD;
      consequences on direct medical costs of systematic SAS screening and treatment in the&#xD;
      patients with AF and whether SAS therapy would decrease healthcare resource utilization and&#xD;
      costs, via decreasing AF recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this project is to assess the effect of SAS screening (and treatment if SAS&#xD;
      is moderate to severe, defined by an apnea hypopnea index &gt;15 / h) on recurrence of AF over a&#xD;
      twenty-four month follow-up period, in patients on optimal medical treatment after AF&#xD;
      ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2 group parallel, randomized (1:1 ratio), Prospective Open Blinded Endpoint (PROBE),&#xD;
      multicentric controlled trial of superiority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive usual care and follow-up of AF. The intervention group will&#xD;
      benefit of screening of SAS and treatment if relevant, in addition to usual treatment of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize cross over from the control to the intervention group, patients of the control&#xD;
      group will performed a polygraph at the end of the 2 year follow up. Both groups will be&#xD;
      stratified by center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAS diagnosis will be performed by polygraphy scored using international criteria (American&#xD;
      Academy of Sleep Medicine 2012). If AHI &gt; 15/h, treatment will be started, with continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) or mandibular repositioning device (MRD) based on type and&#xD;
      severity of SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be followed over 24 months by the cardiologist, and by the somnologist /&#xD;
      pulmonologist for the patients treated for SAS.&#xD;
