    <textblock>
      The DONATE-Pilot is a prospective observational cohort study in organ donation (OD) that&#xD;
      observes the ICU management of consented deceased organ donors at 4 high volume centres over&#xD;
      a period of 12 months each. The pilot study will be followed by a 1-year prospective national&#xD;
      observational study a 15-20 ICUs across Canada.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational cohort pilot study enrols consented organ donors admitted to 4&#xD;
      high volume centres over a period of 12 months. Various clinical data on deceased donors are&#xD;
      collected prospectively from the time of consent for organ donation up to and including the&#xD;
      day of organ recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the DONATE-Pilot reflect the objectives of the national study which&#xD;
      correspond to the steps in developing a platform for future clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Form research teams at participating ICUs that will include an ICU physician-researcher,&#xD;
           a local organ donation champion, ICU research coordinators and (in a limited role) a&#xD;
           local coordinator from the provincial Organ Donation Organization (ODO);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Observe, record, and describe ICU practices in deceased donor care (e.g., donor&#xD;
           resuscitation, organ suitability assessments, death declaration) which are likely to&#xD;
           vary by site, region and province and will be very important to inform clinical care&#xD;
           protocols for future RCTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Engage and work with ODOs from each province to foster data sharing and develop&#xD;
           procedures to enhance efficiency in future RCTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigate the comparative effectiveness of various ICU interventions in deceased donor&#xD;
           care (e.g. the potential for hormonal therapies to improve transplant rates, the&#xD;
           potential of heparin therapy to improve peri-operative graft function);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Produce specific knowledge translation tools that will serve in the future as both&#xD;
           clinical tools to enhance ICU care and research tools to facilitate future RCTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the DONATE-Pilot we also aim to assess feasibility. Specifically the objectives&#xD;
      are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Refine data collection procedures for deceased donors in ICU;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Estimate time requirements for data collection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Develop efficient links to post-transplantation data and;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Share data as it accrues with clinicians.&#xD;
