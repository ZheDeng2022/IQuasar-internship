  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fall is one of the most common causes of ill health and morbidity in the older population. In&#xD;
      Sweden about 300 000 people/year seek emergency treatment due to falls and out of these 1600&#xD;
      dies. Poor balance control leads to a sedentary life with muscle weakness, fear of falling&#xD;
      and an increased risk for falls. Balance training and physical activity have positive effects&#xD;
      on fall prevention and balance, but long-term follow-ups are limited. There is also a gap&#xD;
      between what has been proven to be efficient in research and what is performed in communities&#xD;
      and clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies reports on the efficacy of certain treatment, method or training program, which&#xD;
      often may have taken years to develop, but few of these results are taken further into&#xD;
      clinical practice and it may take years for them to come into daily use. This delay means&#xD;
      that there is a gap between what is known and what is consistently done. It if of importance&#xD;
      implement methods that have been proven to have beneficial impact on health and physical&#xD;
      function in a clinical trial. Furthermore to evaluate which strategies for implementation&#xD;
      that are of significance. The aim of this study is to implement evidence based balance&#xD;
      training into clinical practice to prevent future falls and fall-related injuries in older&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program has been proven to be efficient, but not yet been implemented in the community&#xD;
      and clinical settings. Implementation outcomes will include effectiveness, acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility, fidelity, cost and sustainability. Outcome variables on individual level will be&#xD;
      fall-related concerns, balance performance, physical function and activity, health related&#xD;
      quality of life and number of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators foresee that this balance training for older adults will prevent future&#xD;
      falls and fall related injuries, increase physical activity level, health related quality of&#xD;
      life and provide the participants with a strategy to be able to have a physically active and&#xD;
      healthy life style.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project is a cluster-randomized study comparing different implementation strategies. The&#xD;
      study will comprise clinical settings in primary health care (PHC) and in senior residential&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating clinics will be recruited strategically with regard to catchment area and&#xD;
      population structure, to achieve such a large diverse participation as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant to the balance training will be recruited through the participating clinics, from&#xD;
      primary care facilities in the vicinity of the clinics involved and by advertisement in local&#xD;
      papers in the communities. Participants reporting their interest to partake in the study will&#xD;
      be telephone-interview and informed about the project and checked for eligibility.&#xD;
      Thereafter, they will be called to baseline testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to involve 30 different PHC and thereby 360-480 participants in&#xD;
      balance training (two groups with 6-8 participants per semester from each clinic during 2&#xD;
      semesters).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In two previous randomised controlled studies performed by the research group in Stockholm&#xD;
      county regarding group balance-training for older adults at risk of falling the investigators&#xD;
      received a large number of people reporting interest by announcement, i.e. approximately 500&#xD;
      subjects. However, most of them were excluded because they had not a verified diagnosis of&#xD;
      osteoporosis, which was one of the inclusion criteria's in those two studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group based balance-training program is well described in a published ´Rehabilitation in&#xD;
      practice´- article and was developed based on well-established principles of exercise and on&#xD;
      the knowledge that balance control relies on the interaction of several physiological&#xD;
      systems, as well as interaction with environmental factors and the performed task. It&#xD;
      includes exercise with dual- and multi task performance, i.e. performance when a person's&#xD;
      attention is divided between a motor and a cognitive task, as this is a natural component of&#xD;
      daily activities, but may increase the risk of falling especially in older adults. As&#xD;
      training adaptions are specific for the system trained, this program follows the principle of&#xD;
      specificity in that it is based on exercises targeting various systems for postural control&#xD;
      aiming to improve balance performance in specific situations that can occur in daily life,&#xD;
      such as regaining postural stability after perturbation or being able to suddenly avoid an&#xD;
      obstacle, with retained balance, while simultaneously walking and answering a question.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is progressive as the exercises can be performed at different levels (basic,&#xD;
      moderate, and advanced), making it progressively challenging for each individual throughout&#xD;
      the whole program. The training is conducted as an individually tailored group program. The&#xD;
      12-week balance training program will be performed two times per week for one hour each. The&#xD;
      training will be lead by physiotherapists or trained leaders. After the balance training the&#xD;
      participants will get recommendations for continued physical activity and training, i.e.&#xD;
      &quot;Physical activity on prescription&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the implementation a participatory approach will be used, where the different settings&#xD;
      will be engaged in an early phase. For evaluation the model by Proctor et al., will be&#xD;
      followed. The implementation strategies will include 1) a contract with each setting, 2)&#xD;
      meetings with the head of each setting, 3) discussion with physical therapists and leaders in&#xD;
      the setting, 4) education of the physical therapists and leaders who will be trainers and 5)&#xD;
      coaching of the trainers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation outcomes will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability of evidence-based treatments among health providers will be assessed by&#xD;
           investigating the attitudes towards the balance program with a questionnaire, focus&#xD;
           groups and interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility the extent to which a new treatment can be successfully used and carried out&#xD;
           in the clinical setting will be assessed by investigating how the balance program fits&#xD;
           in in clinical practice with focus groups and interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fidelity includes five dimensions, i.e. adherence to the program protocol, quality of&#xD;
           delivery, program component differentiation, exposure to the intervention and&#xD;
           participant responsiveness to the program will be investigated by observations,&#xD;
           check-lists and assessments on individual level (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost will be assessed by a health economic evaluation of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sustainability will be assessed using both quantitative and qualitative methods and&#xD;
           include measures on compliance/fidelity to the training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments on individual level will include fall-related concerns, health related quality of&#xD;
      life, balance performance, gait, physical activity, muscle strength for lower extremities and&#xD;
      number of falls and compliance to training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments on individual level will be performed at the PHC by the regular&#xD;
      physiotherapist. All participants will be assessed before and after the training period (3&#xD;
      months after inclusion) and at three to six, twelve eight-teen and twenty-four months, i.e.&#xD;
      two years after inclusion. During the follow-up period, i.e. three, six, twelve, eight-teen&#xD;
      and twenty-four months, the assessments will consists of sms-track system and by postal&#xD;
      survey with questionnaire regarding fall-related concerns, heath related quality of life,&#xD;
      physical activity and adherence to training regime.&#xD;
