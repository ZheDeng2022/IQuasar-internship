      Introduction: Patients with primary unresectable advanced head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinomas (HNSCC) have a poor prognosis with a median survival of 22 months (Hauswald H&#xD;
      Radiat Oncol 2011). They are usually treated with induction chemotherapy followed by&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy or platinum-based concomitant radiochemotherapy. Most patients achieve an&#xD;
      objective clinical response contrasting with a high rate of local recurrence and distant&#xD;
      metastases in the year following radiochemotherapy (Argiris A Ann Oncol 2011). Improvement of&#xD;
      the efficacy of chemotherapy remains therefore a major clinical goal for this group of&#xD;
      patients. During the past years, the investigators demonstrated that some conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapeutics (anthracycline, oxaliplatin…) induce a type of &quot;immunogenic&quot; cell death&#xD;
      (ICD) characterized by the exposure of calreticulin on the tumor cell surface, the secretion&#xD;
      of ATP and the release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) resulting in activation of tumor&#xD;
      immunity (Galluzzi L Nat Rev Drug Discov 2012). The investigators recently showed that the&#xD;
      Na/K-ATPase inhibitor, digoxin, favors ICD, when combined with cisplatin, a drug known not to&#xD;
      induce ICD. In preclinical models, a synergy between cisplatin and digoxin which led to a&#xD;
      significant therapeutic improvement (Menger L Sci Transl Med 2012) has been observed. This&#xD;
      effect seems to be mediated by the immune system as the combined therapy induced intratumor T&#xD;
      cell infiltration producing cytokines (Menger L Sci Transl Med 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Based on our preclinical data, the hypothesis is that adding digoxin to the&#xD;
      conventional cisplatin based induction chemotherapy regimen in unresectable advanced HNSCC&#xD;
      will increase the efficacy of this therapy via the induction of anti-tumor immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main: the primary objective is to assess the clinical and biological safety of the&#xD;
      combination of digoxin to cisplatin-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: The secondary objectives are to investigate biological markers of efficacy by&#xD;
      analyzing the recruitment of functional T cells in tumour biopsies after treatment with the&#xD;
      combination of digoxin and chemotherapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: grade 3 or 4 clinical or biological toxicity (Adverse Events graded by National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE version 4.0)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical/radiological efficacy monitored after 3 cycles of chemotherapy as assessed by&#xD;
           Positron Emission Tomography-Scan (PET-Scan), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),&#xD;
           (computerized tomography-Scan) CT-scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS) (months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological efficacy monitored by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Analysis of the T cells recruitment in biopsies from HNSCC patients after therapy.&#xD;
                The T cell recruitment will be considered as significant if T cells increase of at&#xD;
                least 25% in post-therapeutic compared to pre-therapeutic biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Analysis of subpopulations of T cells (CD8+T cells, regulatory T cells&#xD;
                (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ and gamma-delta T cells) in tumor biopsies by immunofluorescence&#xD;
                analysis to show a potential higher ratio of effector/regulatory T cells after&#xD;
                therapy as previously described (Badoual C et al Clin Cancer Res 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Expression of IFN and IL-17 assessed by quantitative RT-PCR assay (Taq Man) to look&#xD;
                for a production of Interferon gamma (IFNgamma) by CD4+ and CD8+T cells and the&#xD;
                presence of T cells producing IL-17 as observed in preclinical models, (Menger L&#xD;
                Sci Transl Med 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Pilot, single arm, open label, phase I/II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study conduct:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting all inclusion /exclusion criteria, will be given 3 cycles of the following&#xD;
      regimen: 1) digoxin (0.25 mg/day) for a 7-day period (digitalization time) from Day 1 to Day&#xD;
      7; 2) chemotherapy regimen TPF (Taxoter, Platin, 5-FU) protocol from Day 8 to D12 (continuous&#xD;
      perfusion of fluorouracil for 120h, Cisplatin at Day 10 and Docetaxel at Day 11) administered&#xD;
      in combination with digoxin 0.25 mg/day from Day 8 to Day 9; 3) a 15-day period off&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The digoxin dose will be adjusted to achieve a plasma concentration of 0.6-1.2 ng/ml&#xD;
      according to current recommendations in heart failure patients (doses adapted to renal&#xD;
      function, comorbidities, concomitant medications, age, and plasma concentration). The risk&#xD;
      related to digoxin treatment will be minimized in our study since the duration of exposure to&#xD;
      digoxin will be limited to 9 days every 3 weeks for 3 cycles (total duration of treatment 27&#xD;
      days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies will be performed before the first digoxin administration and at the end of the 3rd&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with unacceptable adverse events (e.g. patients with grade 3 or 4 toxicities not&#xD;
      improving to &lt; grade 1 despite drug hold for 2 weeks) will be withdrawn of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated by the MDRD formula) decreasing&#xD;
      below 60 ml/min/1.73m2 at any time after the TPF chemotherapy during the study will be&#xD;
      withdrawn of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be managed jointly by an oncologist and a cardiologist at the Clinical&#xD;
      Investigation Center or at the Oncology and safety and tolerability assessed at each cycle&#xD;
      by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination including neurological and hearing testing, body weight, WHO performance&#xD;
      status Cardiac status: echocardiogram at baseline and daily ECG at rest during each cycle of&#xD;
      chemotherapy (from Day 8 to Day 12) and at Day 1 of each cycle and at inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma digoxin concentration and plasma electrolytes and creatinine (at inclusion, at day 1&#xD;
      at cycles 2 and 3 and everyday during the TPF chemotherapy regimen of each cycle of&#xD;
      chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular reporting of adverse events (AEs) graded by NCI CTC version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Independent Safety Committee will receive information at the end of the treatment period&#xD;
      of each patient, and if a serious adverse event (SAE) occurs. A formal meeting will be held&#xD;
      every 3 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: none&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of participation for each patient: 18 weeks including the inclusion protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of the study: 28 months 1/2&#xD;
