  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is characterized by changes in eicosanoids metabolism, especially high production of&#xD;
      bronchoconstrictive cysteinyl leukotrienes (CystLTBs) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Recent&#xD;
      studies have also demonstrated a relative low production of lipoxin A4, an endogenous lipid&#xD;
      mediator resulting from lipo-oxygenase action, distinct from CystLTBs, with anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties, in bronchial epithelial cells and lung macrophages of severe asthma patients,&#xD;
      leading to imbalance between pro-resolving and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids production in&#xD;
      airways. Such data suggest that aspirin, that induces lipoxins production, could restore&#xD;
      lipoxins deficit in severe asthma. Interest for aspirin is also supported by data obtained in&#xD;
      asthma patients with aspirin intolerance (Aspirin induced asthma, AIA) : in this particular&#xD;
      group of patients, aspirin treatment significantly improves nasal symptoms, quality of life,&#xD;
      asthma and rhinitis scores, and reduces need for hospitalizations, nasal surgery and oral&#xD;
      steroids use. Potential effect of aspirin in patients with uncontrolled asthma without&#xD;
      aspirin intolerance, who presented changes in arachidonic acid pathway close to those&#xD;
      observed in AIA, is not established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess whether long term aspirin treatment could improve asthma&#xD;
      control, compared to placebo, in patients with uncontrolled disease and nasal polyposis,&#xD;
      whatever their aspirin tolerance level.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Asthma concerns about 7% of the French adult population. About 10% of them have uncontrolled&#xD;
      disease, despite high doses of inhaled steroids combined with long acting beta 2 agonists and&#xD;
      adequate management of aggravating factors. They account for considerable asthma morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality and costs. New treatments are needed for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is characterized by changes in eicosanoids metabolism, especially high production of&#xD;
      bronchoconstrictive cysteinyl leukotrienes and LTB4. Recent studies have also demonstrated a&#xD;
      relative low production of lipoxin A4, an endogenous lipid mediator resulting from&#xD;
      lipo-oxygenase action, distinct from CystLTBs, with anti-inflammatory properties, in&#xD;
      bronchial epithelial cells and lung macrophages of severe asthma patients, leading to&#xD;
      imbalance between pro-resolving and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids production in airways. Such&#xD;
      data suggest that aspirin, that induces lipoxins production, could restore lipoxins deficit&#xD;
      in severe asthma, as demonstrated in other models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interest for aspirin is also supported by data obtained in asthma patients with aspirin&#xD;
      intolerance (Aspirin induced asthma, AIA), who are characterized by a severe&#xD;
      difficult-to-treat respiratory disease frequently associated with nasal polyposis,&#xD;
      overproduction of leukotrienes and increased expression of leukotriene receptors. In this&#xD;
      particular group of patients, aspirin treatment significantly improves nasal symptoms,&#xD;
      quality of life, asthma and rhinitis scores, and reduces need for hospitalizations and nasal&#xD;
      surgery. A reduction in oral steroids use was observed in most series. In this group of&#xD;
      patients, aspirin also induced a decrease in interleukin 4 (IL-4) and Matrix metallopeptidase&#xD;
      9 (MMP-9) levels in sputum in asthma patients thus providing another explanation for anti&#xD;
      inflammatory effect of aspirin in asthma. Patients treated with higher doses of aspirin (650&#xD;
      mg BID) had more favorable courses than those treated with lower doses.Aspirin&#xD;
      desensitization is considered as a cost-effective therapeutic intervention in patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe AIA However, some of these studies, coming mostly from the same team, can&#xD;
      be criticized for methodological reasons, low evidence, small series, and weak asthma&#xD;
      characterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential effect of aspirin in patients with uncontrolled asthma without aspirin intolerance,&#xD;
      who presented changes in arachidonic acid pathway close to those observed in AIA, is not&#xD;
      established. Because similar changes in eicosanoid metabolism are described in nasal polyps&#xD;
      mucosa, a pathology frequently associated with asthma, we hypothesize that patients with&#xD;
      nasal polyps and asthma could be a specific target for aspirin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin is a cheap treatment, compared with biotherapies developed for severe asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The investigators propose to compare the effect aspirin (600 mg twice daily)&#xD;
      versus placebo, given during six months, on asthma control in patients with uncontrolled&#xD;
      asthma and nasal polyposis, whatever their aspirin level of tolerance, in a randomized,&#xD;
      double blind, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives Primary objective To assess whether long term aspirin treatment could&#xD;
      improve asthma control, compared to placebo, in patients with uncontrolled disease and nasal&#xD;
      polyposis, whatever their aspirin tolerance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of long term aspirin treatment compared to placebo, in patients with&#xD;
      uncontrolled disease and nasal polyposis, on the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lung function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of exacerbations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time to the first exacerbation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  oral and inhaled steroid use and doses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasal symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasal sinus symptoms severity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipoxin A4, cysteinyl leukotrienes (cystLT) and LTB4 levels in sputum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reactions during oral aspirin challenge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastro-intestinal and other bleedings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a multicentric, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded phase III&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;

The activity domain contains 5 'patient-specific' questions. This allows patients to select 5 activities in which they are most limited and these activities will be assessed at each follow-up. Patients are asked to think about how they have been during the previous two weeks and to respond to each of the 32 questions on a 7-point scale (7 = not impaired at all - 1 = severely impaired). The overall AQLQ score is the mean of all 32 responses and the individual domain scores are the means of the items in those domains.</description>
