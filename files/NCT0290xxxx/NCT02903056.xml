      Introduction: Rett Syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disease that primarily affects girls.&#xD;
      Clinically, patients are normal before six months to one and half years old, and then develop&#xD;
      progressive severe problems with communication, learning, co-ordination and neurodevelopment,&#xD;
      with loss of motor skills around the age of two. At the same time, stereotyped hand movement&#xD;
      typically appears. However, some of them will improve the abilities in speech and eye gaze,&#xD;
      and the repetitive hand movements may decrease after few years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background / hypothesis：Preliminary evidence suggests that there are many differences in&#xD;
      brain structure between Rett syndrome and normal people including cerebral volume reduction&#xD;
      in both white matter and gray matter, cerebral blood flow in the frontal area, and density of&#xD;
      receptors in basal ganglia. In MR imaging studies, decreases in parietal lobe gray matter&#xD;
      were found, and several reductions in cortical white matter were observed by DTI. However,&#xD;
      the visual related pathway- posterior corona radiata in Rett syndrome girls was normal to be&#xD;
      increased in FA values. The similar result was also discovered in the superior longitudinal&#xD;
      fasciculus, associated with speech, which equal to control subjects and patients with&#xD;
      preserved speech (phrases and sentences).Despite this, few studies mentioned comparison with&#xD;
      brain microstructure in the different stage, especially in adult patients. Therefore, our&#xD;
      prospective study will be planned to figure out the specific changing pattern of brain&#xD;
      structure in different stages of Rett syndrome. And the trajectory of microstructure in brain&#xD;
      is going to be in accordance with the functional improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators suppose that (1)there are different microstructural changes for patients&#xD;
      with/without preserved mobility, verbal ability and communication skill; (2)there are a few&#xD;
      specific brain microstructures changes in visual pathway; (3) there is a specific changing&#xD;
      pattern of brain microstructure in different aging of Rett syndrome. To acquire more specific&#xD;
      results, the investigators aim to apply conventional MRI, diffusion-spectrum imaging, and&#xD;
      some clinical assessment tools like Rett syndrome -related questionnaire, SSI, PDMS-2 and&#xD;
      six-minute walk test to investigate their correlation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study we proposed to use conventional MR imaging, diffusion spectrum imaging(DSI),&#xD;
      and susceptibility weighted imaging(SWI), to acquire the information of brain structure in&#xD;
      neural tissue and the volume of blood vessels. Conventional MR imaging with 3T MR unit will&#xD;
      consist of sagittal T1-weighted, axial T2 fast spin-echo, and thickness of transverse&#xD;
      sections in 2.5 mm are obtained parallel to the anterior and posterior commissure line.&#xD;
      Diffusion spectrum imaging(DSI), a more specific method to detects the fiber crossing of&#xD;
      white matter, quantified by GFA value to investigate the tract-specific abnormalities with&#xD;
      the growth trajectories and their correlations with clinical features in patients with&#xD;
      RTT.DSI scans were acquired using a Siemens Tim Trio 3T scanner at NTUH. Diffusion spectrum&#xD;
      imaging data were obtained in 32 channel head coil with following parameters: TE = 2.98 ms,&#xD;
      TR = 2000 ms, slice per slab=208, slice thickness = 1.0mm, FoV read = 256mm, voxel&#xD;
      size=2.5x2.5x2.5mm. Susceptibility weighted image(SWI), facilitated sensitivity to deposited&#xD;
      hemosiderin, has improved the recognition of cerebral micro bleeds (CMB). Therefore, we plan&#xD;
      to use the advancing techniques to gain the information about the multiple&#xD;
      cortico-subcortical blood vessels from our patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be recruited from OPD in NTU hospital, age range 2 to 30 years, 45&#xD;
      diagnosed rett patients and 45 controls. All of the scanning will complete in NTU hospital.&#xD;
      Before entering the scanning room, parents of patients will finish a questionnaire about the&#xD;
      physical development in Rett syndrome, including gross motor, fine motor skills and speech&#xD;
      ability. After then, DSI data are acquired at 3T MR unit and we will analysis the white&#xD;
      matter data by DSI studio (http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org ) and perform the whole brain&#xD;
      tracts in detail by TBAA which were reconstructed on the NTU-DSI-122 template. We will&#xD;
      process and analyze the gray matter by using FreeSurfer (http://freesurfer.net) and the&#xD;
      volume of cerebral micro bleeds by SWI data to find out the difference between Rett patients&#xD;
      and control group. In order to obtain the results with reliability and validity, Peabody&#xD;
      developmental motor scales (PDMS-2), a motor development program will be applied to assess&#xD;
      the gross motor and fine motor skills objectively. PDMS-2 consists of 6 subjects: reflexes,&#xD;
      stationary, locomotion, object manipulation, grasping, and visual-motor integration and can&#xD;
      be used in clinical assessment and training. Finally, the brain structure data will be&#xD;
      compared with the functional changes in Rett syndrome patients.&#xD;
