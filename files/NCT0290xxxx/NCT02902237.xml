    <textblock>
      In this phase I clinical trial cancer patients suffering from solid tumors or lymphomas,&#xD;
      recurring after and/or refractory against standard treatment are treated intravenously (iv)&#xD;
      with increasing doses of tTF-NGR(tTF= truncated tissue factor; NGR=Asn-Gly-Arg). The&#xD;
      objectives of this trial are to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of intravenously (iv) infused daily applications of tTF-NGR for&#xD;
      5 days every 3 weeks in patients with cancer, who had obtained all standard treatment known&#xD;
      for their disease entity prior to entry on study. Further objectives are to determine the&#xD;
      perfusion and vascular volume fraction of measurable tumor lesions versus normal reference&#xD;
      tissue before and after tTF-NGR application by MRI as a biological surrogate parameter for&#xD;
      biological activity of the investigational medicinal product (IMP), tTF-NGR, and to obtain&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data.&#xD;

      PHASE I STUDY OF tTF-NGR IN PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT OR REFRACTORY MALIGNANT TUMORS OR&#xD;
      LYMPHOMAS BEYOND ALL STANDARD TREATMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short Title: tTF-NGR Phase I Study Sponsor's Study Code: UKM12_0018&#xD;
&#xD;
      EudraCT-No.: 2016-003042-85 Sponsor: Universitätsklinikum Muenster Investigator: Prof. Dr.&#xD;
      Christoph Schliemann&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication: All solid tumors and lymphomas beyond standard therapy Study Design: Phase I&#xD;
      Study Investigational Medicinal Product: tTF-NGR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy: Phase I, open label, single arm, non-randomized prospective, monocenter study.&#xD;
      tTF-NGR will be given as 1-hour infusion via central venous access once daily for 5 days with&#xD;
      a subsequent rest period of 2 weeks and following cycles with dose escalation of 0.5 mg/m2&#xD;
      upon judgement of tolerability and therapeutic activity. Starting dose will be 1 mg/m2/day.&#xD;
      Patients within the dose-escalation part will be treated in sequence and not in parallel.&#xD;
      Individual patients can undergo a maximum of 8 dose-escalations. Dose-escalation is stopped&#xD;
      before the maximum number of 8 escalation steps if tumor response, tumor progression or a&#xD;
      Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is observed. In the case of stable disease (SD) and with good&#xD;
      tolerability these patients can obtain further cycles without dose-escalation until tumor&#xD;
      progression or Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and the next patient can start with&#xD;
      dose-escalation cycles on the highest tolerable dose for the previous patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of&#xD;
      intravenously (iv) infused daily applications of tTF-NGR for 5 days every 3 weeks in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory cancer, who had obtained all standard treatment known for their&#xD;
      disease entity prior to entry on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the perfusion and vascular volume fraction of measurable tumor lesions&#xD;
           versus normal reference tissue before and after tTF-NGR application as a biological&#xD;
           surrogate parameter for biological activity of the IMP in the patients treated within&#xD;
           the verification cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To obtain pharmacokinetic data of tTF-NGR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Safety Endpoint: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). MTD is the dose below the dose leading&#xD;
      to reproducible episodes of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in at least 2/6 patients. DLT will&#xD;
      be characterized by clinical, blood and serum monitoring at specified time points before and&#xD;
      during study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Occurrence and frequency of inhibition of tumor blood flow as measured by&#xD;
           contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the patients treated in the&#xD;
           verification cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Occurrence and frequency of tumor response defined as Complete Response (CR), Partial&#xD;
           Response (PR), or Stabile Disease (SD) as defined by RECIST criteria.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have treated 17 patients with advanced cancer beyond standard therapies with tTF-NGR&#xD;
      applied as a 1-hour infusion via central venous access for 5 consecutive days and rest&#xD;
      periods of 2 weeks before the next cycle. The study allowed for intraindividual dose&#xD;
      escalations from cycle to cycle and established MTD and DLT by verification cohorts of 6&#xD;
      patients. This was an investigator-initiated, monocenter, single-arm, open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients (planned and analysed):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients required to complete this study was determined by the occurrence of&#xD;
      DLT. Eventually, 24 patients had to be screened and 17 of them treated and analyzed in order&#xD;
      to evaluate the study.&#xD;

Starting dose will be 1 mg/m2/day. Dose-escalation is stopped before the maximum number of 8 escalation steps if tumor response, tumor progression or a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is observed.</description>
