  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the effectiveness of exposure therapy for fear of spiders as enhanced by the&#xD;
      use of antagonistic or opposite actions during treatment. The goal of the study is to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy threat-relevant opposite actions and threat-irrelevant opposite actions in&#xD;
      extinguishing fear.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study tests whether exposure therapy for fear of spiders can be enhanced with the use of&#xD;
      opposite actions, which are actions opposite to fear-related action tendencies. The&#xD;
      investigators will test two sub-types of opposite actions (a) threat-relevant opposite&#xD;
      actions, which are actions antagonistic to specific threats associated with spider phobia,&#xD;
      and (b) threat-irrelevant opposite actions, which are actions antagonistic to the fear&#xD;
      response, but unrelated to specific threats associated with spider phobia. This exposure&#xD;
      therapy enhanced with opposite actions will be compared with two control groups: standard&#xD;
      exposure therapy and non-specific anxiety treatment (biofeedback relaxation training).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals between the ages of 18-65 with elevated fear of spiders are randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of four treatment conditions (1) biofeedback relaxation training, (2) standard exposure&#xD;
      therapy, (3) exposure therapy with threat-relevant opposite actions, and (4) exposure therapy&#xD;
      with threat-irrelevant opposite actions. All participants undergo an online prescreen and a&#xD;
      face-to-face screening assessment to determine eligibility and baseline (pre-treatment)&#xD;
      symptom severity. Participants additionally complete assessments directly after treatment&#xD;
      (post-treatment), and approximately two weeks after treatment (follow-up). The pre-treatment&#xD;
      assessment occurs on the same day as treatment, the post-treatment assessment occurs during&#xD;
      the treatment visit as soon as the treatment procedure is complete, and the follow-up&#xD;
      assessment occurs within a window of 14-21 days after the completion of treatment.&#xD;
      Participants complete two behavioral approach tests (in the treatment context and in the&#xD;
      generalization context) at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up. Participants&#xD;
      complete a battery of self-report questionnaires at pre-treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
