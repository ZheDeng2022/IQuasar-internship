  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The median age of onset of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase PC is about 60&#xD;
      years. However CML affects all age groups including 18-25 year olds, called adult-young&#xD;
      adolescents (AJA). In France, there is no record of CML and especially not for this&#xD;
      particular population, only a European Register of CML in children up to 18 years has been&#xD;
      set up under the coordination of Professor &quot;Frederic Millot&quot;, pediatrics, CHU Poitiers.&#xD;
      Malignancies diagnosed in this population usually have characteristics, evolution,&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are a real therapeutic&#xD;
      revolution with an overall survival very significantly augmented but at present only a&#xD;
      minority of patients may one day consider a final judgment of treatment. AJA are the most&#xD;
      exposed patients to the complications, the socio-economic repercussions, professional and&#xD;
      personal of a very long-term treatment. But there is little data in the literature concerning&#xD;
      this population. Two studies show that diagnosis of CML presents with poor prognostic factors&#xD;
      (high skoal), the observed responses are poorer compared to older patients but it is&#xD;
      accompanied difference in survival in all cases with a decline of about 70 mois. However,&#xD;
      these studies have focused solely on the patients included in the study receiving optimized&#xD;
      treatment is not the standard treatment at the time. It is clearly demonstrated that the&#xD;
      inclusion in a study brings a benefit to the patient. However, the majority of AJA are not&#xD;
      included in a study. The investigators therefore want to describe the AYA population of CML&#xD;
      in France and compare the evolution of patients included or not in a protocol. The&#xD;
      investigators also want to investigate specific issues of the age of these patients as the&#xD;
      reproductive desire. Indeed, while it does not seem to be any risk of teratogenicity for men&#xD;
      treated with ITK, this risk is clearly established for women and requires specific supported.&#xD;
      Another important point is that of the quality of life. The state of physical and mental&#xD;
      health and his feelings, physical activity and its limitations and well-being was assessed by&#xD;
      the SF-3612 questionnaire. The results of this analysis were compared with those already&#xD;
      obtained for the general population (not representative of Italian adults with cancer sample)&#xD;
      and adjusted for sex, age, geographic region, marital status and education level . There&#xD;
      seems to be young people and women who express a feeling more pejorative. This does not only&#xD;
      covers the frequency of side effects but also on physical activity and well-being. the&#xD;
      affected population will be noted that that is particularly involved in the social,&#xD;
      professional and in the development of his personal life. The impact of treatment on quality&#xD;
      of life must be considered under penalty of seeing the difficulties of compliance. But&#xD;
      several studies have demonstrated the negative impact of poor adherence in response to&#xD;
      treatments .&#xD;
