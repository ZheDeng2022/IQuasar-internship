  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of adjuvanted R21 alone and in&#xD;
      combination with a viral-vectored vaccine regimen (constituting adjuvanted R21 + ChAd63 and&#xD;
      MVA encoding ME-TRAP) against malaria sporozoite challenge in healthy malaria-naive&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult volunteers will be recruited in London, Oxford and Southampton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All vaccinations will be administered intramuscularly. The study involves having either two,&#xD;
      three or five vaccinations and then undergoing challenge infection with malaria, or receiving&#xD;
      no vaccinations then undergoing challenge infection with malaria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaccination phases and challenge procedures have been staggered over the trial period into 2&#xD;
      parts, challenges A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Challenge A:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Groups 1-3 consist of volunteers receiving either R21 alone or R21 + ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP&#xD;
           followed by CHMI by sporozoite challenge (mosquito bite) at week 12. Twelve volunteers&#xD;
           will be recruited to each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4a will serve as infectivity controls, these volunteers will not be vaccinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Challenge B:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sterilely protected volunteers in groups 1 - 3 may be rechallenged to assess durability&#xD;
           of efficacy, 5-12 months after the initial challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Groups 5-7 will also be enrolled to participate in challenge B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 5 (8 volunteers) will test the efficacy of standard dose R21 with a fractional&#xD;
           third dose followed by CHMI at week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 6 will test the long-term efficacy of the standard dose R21 vaccination regimen&#xD;
           (volunteers in this group will have already received their vaccinations whilst enrolled&#xD;
           in the VAC053 malaria trial and will therefore not receive any additional vaccinations&#xD;
           before undergoing challenge).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 7 (8 volunteers) will test the efficacy of a two dose R21 vaccination regimen&#xD;
           followed by CHMI at week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4b will serve as infectivity controls for groups 5-7 and sterilely protected group&#xD;
           1-3 volunteers. Group 4c volunteers will be used as infectivity controls if any&#xD;
           volunteers from groups 5 and 7 are rechallenged.&#xD;
