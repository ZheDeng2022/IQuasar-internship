      This study aims at identifying predictors of suicidal behaviors in depressed subjects.&#xD;
      Investigators will first compare demographic, clinical, and biological features of depressed&#xD;
      recent suicide attempters (within one week) and depressed subjects without lifetime history&#xD;
      of suicide attempt. Baseline risk factors for suicide will be used to predict the risk of&#xD;
      attempting suicide during a one year follow-up. A thorough evaluation of these patients will&#xD;
      allow to identify the factors associated with suicidal risk and develop a simplified risk&#xD;
      score that could be used in clinical settings to improve our practice.&#xD;

      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suicidal behavior (SB) is a major health problem in France, with more than 10,000 suicides&#xD;
      (6th UE28) and 220 000 suicide attempts (SA) per year. A large percentage of men (6%) and&#xD;
      women (9%) in France have made at least one SA. Moreover, suicide is the second leading cause&#xD;
      of death among the youngest (15-44 years). The clinical model currently admitted for&#xD;
      understanding SB is a stress vulnerability model. But to date, scientists have not (yet) a&#xD;
      clinical application for the research on SB. The management of psychiatric patients,&#xD;
      including depressed subjects, faces the impossibility of detecting those at high risk of&#xD;
      occurrence of SB. Indeed, although many risk factors for SB are known, their predictive value&#xD;
      is very low. In addition, these risk factors are primarily derived from cross-sectional&#xD;
      studies. The identification of predictors, using a standardized evaluation would allow&#xD;
      clinicians to identify the subject at high risk of SB for which therapeutic interventions and&#xD;
      the organization of care should be particularly aggressive and intensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: To identify predictors (clinical, biological, environmental) of the&#xD;
      occurrence of SB during 12 months in a population of depressed suicide attempters and&#xD;
      lifetime non attempters to optimize a short standardized evaluation applicable to emergency&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: 1) To build a multidimensional score for predicting the risk of&#xD;
      recurrence of suicide attempt among suicide attempters ; 2) To evaluate the prospective&#xD;
      performance of this score to predict emergence of suicide attempt among depressed patients&#xD;
      without history of suicide attempt; 3) To identify predictors of suicidal spectrum (suicidal&#xD;
      thoughts, suicidal planification, suicide attempt and completed suicide) in depressed&#xD;
      subjects ; 4) To evaluate the feasibility of a multicenter network that will use standardized&#xD;
      assessments to evaluate suicidal risk through a secured website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2000 patients with major depressive episode will be recruited in the emergency departments&#xD;
      and post-acute care units of 14 French hospitals, and then will be followed for 12 months.&#xD;
      For every depressed patient admitted within 48 hours of a suicide attempt (case), a depressed&#xD;
      patient without lifetime personal history of SB (psychiatric control) will be included. Cases&#xD;
      will be mainly recruited in emergency settings; psychiatric controls will be mainly recruited&#xD;
      from the inpatient units (hospital stay &lt;7 days) and outpatient units to limit selection&#xD;
      bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At inclusion, at 3, 6 and 12 months, clinical and biological assessments will ne realized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Kaplan-Meier and Cox models adjusted for potential confounding factors, 2) Univariate and&#xD;
      multivariate analysis, 3) Establishment of a predictive score from multivariate analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-term perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Optimization of standardized assessment of suicidal risk in depressed patients applicable&#xD;
      in daily practice, and 2) Development of a network of clinical centers involved in&#xD;
      suicidology field to promote specific care and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Access to a computerized assessment tool via the Internet to improve the management of&#xD;
      depressed patients all over France 2) Understanding of the psychological and biological&#xD;
      factors underlying SB in the context of mood disorders, and 3) Development of preventive and&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches.&#xD;

Investigators will retrieve the results of biological assays routinely made as part of standard collect biological results routinely done for all depressed patient.&#xD;
At follow-up (3 months, 6 months, 12 months), they will assess thymic state, occurrence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt and environmental stressors. In case of non response, the general physician or the psychiatrist in charge of the patient will be contacted to assess the occurrence of SB during the year. In case of death or absence of clinical information, a request for cause of death certificate will be carried out through tne National Institute of Health and Medical research (INSERM) Unit 1018 / Epidemiological center on medical causes of death (CépiDc).</description>
