      SYNOPSIS The giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most frequent vasculitis in people over 50&#xD;
      years. Despite recent progress and physiopathogenic, corticosteroids remains the standard&#xD;
      treatment for decades with a very good initial clinical efficacy but a high relapse rate&#xD;
      (nearly 40% to 6,5 months) during its decay. This sensible population is particularly exposed&#xD;
      to the side effects of corticosteroids, leading to think about savings strategies. But the&#xD;
      association of immunosuppressive therapy and/or anti- TNFα has not demonstrated benefits in&#xD;
      terms of efficiency or long-term tolerance to cumulative doses of prednisone. The&#xD;
      responsibility of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL- 6 and IL-1 has been studied in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of GCA in temporal artery walls and in mouse models. The primary pathogenic&#xD;
      role of IL- 1 is based on the increase in serum or nuclear protein itself or that of its&#xD;
      mRNA. The study of temporal artery biopsies has shown increased local production of IL- 1β&#xD;
      mRNA, IL- 6 and TGFβ (indicative of macrophage activation ) and those of INFɣ and IL 2&#xD;
      (indicative of T lymphocyte activation). Recently, Ly et al (Ly KH JBS 2014) reported the&#xD;
      efficacy of anakinra, a recombinant molecule of IL- 1RA specifically blocking the IL- 1 α/β,&#xD;
      in three cases GCA refractory to conventional treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here investigators propose a randomized, multicenter, controlled, double-blind study of&#xD;
      anakinra against placebo in addition to corticosteroids in the treatment of GCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 70 patients randomized equally in both arms: reference treatment&#xD;
      (prednisone plus placebo) or the experimental treatment (prednisone + anakinra). Treatment&#xD;
      with prednisone will be identical in the two arms, namely a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day orally on&#xD;
      day 1, followed by a progressive decrease in the dose pattern depending on the weight. In the&#xD;
      experimental arm, dose of anakinra is the one usually used, ie 100 mg/day by subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection from day 1 until the end of week 16 (S16). In the reference arm of the treatment, a&#xD;
      placebo anakinra is associated with corticosteroid in the same packaging, duration and&#xD;
      respecting the double-blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators thus hypothesized that the addition of anakinra to corticosteroid compared to&#xD;
      placebo added to the latter, will show a significant decrease in GAC relapse rate. Indeed,&#xD;
      the challenge of corticosteroid therapy in this disease is not so much a problem of initial&#xD;
      effectiveness, than the adverse events related to relapses and steroid dependence.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Side assumptions investigators made are that the patients receiving anakinra in add-on&#xD;
      therapy will have: a time and a complete remission rate respectively shorter and higher,&#xD;
      fewer relapses and a decrease of the total consumption of prednisone over a 12- month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This controlled study is the first to assess the inhibition of the IL- 1 pathway in the GCA&#xD;
      with anakinra in add-on therapy with corticosteroids in patients newly diagnosed or on&#xD;
      relapse. The purpose of this work is to support the following proof of concept of the&#xD;
      addition of anakinra to corticosteroid therapy in the treatment of GCA: potential synergies&#xD;
      of this association and intrinsic therapeutic action of anakinra in patient newly diagnosed,&#xD;
      and this without loss of opportunity for patients that will benefit all of the reference&#xD;
      treatment. The other originality of this study is to demonstrate the steroid-sparing effect&#xD;
      of targeting interleukin -1, which is per se a therapeutic and nosologic innovation for this&#xD;
      disease. Finally, ancillary biological studies will clarify the mode of action of the&#xD;
      anti-cytokine therapy and identify markers of response to this biotherapy.&#xD;

        College of Rheumatology (ACR) that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Given a temporal artery biopsy compatible with a diagnosis of GCA (not necrotizing&#xD;
        arteritis, giant cell with a granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate, usually localized to&#xD;
        the intima-media junction, makes lymphocytes, macrophages and multinucleated giant cells;&#xD;
        or minimum detection of a chronic inflammatory infiltrate fact lymphocytes and some&#xD;

&#xD;
        Either abdominal thoracic aortitis diagnosed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Angio CT: circumferential thickening of the aortic wall more than 3 mm, in the absence&#xD;
             of adjacent plaque and active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MR angiography: wall thickening of the aortic wall with hyperintense on T1 weighted&#xD;
             and T2 weighted enhancement after gadolinium injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PET scanner: increased uptake of FDG by the aorta and its branches is not typical for&#xD;
             GCA and may be in the atheroma. The PET scanner is probably a very sensitive technique&#xD;
             but not specific enough to retain the diagnosis of GCA. We therefore consider the PET&#xD;
             CT as a diagnostic method of secondary aortite the GCA if there simultaneously on the&#xD;
             same exam fixing aortic (thoracic or abdominal) and blood of large caliber (artery (s)&#xD;

        or immunosuppression was stopped for at least 6 months. At the time of recurrence, at least&#xD;
        3 of 5 ACR criteria for the diagnosis of GCA must be present. Furthermore :&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  if BAT (Biopsy of the temporal artery) was positive at the time of initial diagnosis,&#xD;
             it is not necessary to make a new.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  if BAT was negative, the patient can not be included after completion of a new BAT&#xD;
             which will be positive or if there is a aortite, evidenced by angio-CT or MR&#xD;
