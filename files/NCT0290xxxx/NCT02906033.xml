    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to improve the surgical patients' care process. The objective is to&#xD;
      explore the effect of a new perioperative practice model on 1) patient outcomes&#xD;
      (satisfaction, surgery-related anxiety and quality of life), 2) nursing outcomes&#xD;
      (organizational engagement), and 3) organization outcomes (timeline of surgical care&#xD;
      process).&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A longitudinal untreated control group design with pre- and posttests will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the Helsinki University Hospital; more specifically at the&#xD;
      operating department K of the Peijas Hospital. The randomized patient sampling will include&#xD;
      voluntary adult surgical patients undergoing a hip or a knee replacement procedure. The&#xD;
      patients will be recruited during their preoperative visit (approx. 2-3 weeks prior to the&#xD;
      operation), and an informed consent will be obtained. Approximately 12-16 patients per day&#xD;
      are scheduled for the preoperative visits, summing up to 60-80 recruitments per week. A&#xD;
      control group (Group A) and an experimental (intervention) group (Group B) will be formed.&#xD;
      The sample size was checked with power analysis (2 sided test) with the following parameters:&#xD;
      value for Î± = 0.05, value for power 0.8, and value for common standard deviation 0.1. The&#xD;
      sample size for both groups (A and B) was set at 175. Considering the potential drop-out,&#xD;
      approx. 30%, the final sample size was determined to be 245 per group. The randomization will&#xD;
      be performed by an independent third party (i.e., nurses at the preoperative clinic). The&#xD;
      eligible patients will draw one of two cards; one indicating that an invitation to&#xD;
      participate the study will be given to them, and the other being empty. Patients for the&#xD;
      Group A will be recruited on the first week and the patients for the Group B on the second&#xD;
      week. This pattern will be repeated until the desired amount of patients is recruited. This&#xD;
      stratification will ensure that the two groups will not be contaminated in the ward where the&#xD;
      post-operative visits will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient data will be collected with 1) The Good Perioperative Nursing Care Scale&#xD;
      developed by Leinonen and Leino-Kilpi (2001); 2) 15D; a generic, 15-dimensional,&#xD;
      self-administered instrument for measuring health related quality of life among adults,&#xD;
      developed by professor Sintonen; and 3) STAI, The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; a definitive&#xD;
      instrument for measuring anxiety in adults developed by Dr. Spielberger. The following&#xD;
      demographic data from the participants will be collected: age, gender, diagnosis, procedure,&#xD;
      and ASA-classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally during the intra- and postoperative phases of surgical care, the patient is&#xD;
      cared for by several nurses; i.e. by an anesthetic nurse in the operating room and by a&#xD;
      recovery room nurse in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). Furthermore, the pre- and&#xD;
      postoperative visits to the surgical patients are rare in Finland; mainly due to resources&#xD;
      and new surgical processes where patients arrive to the hospital in the morning of the&#xD;
      scheduled procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basically, the new perioperative practice model denotes that the one and same nurse will meet&#xD;
      the patient at his/her arrival to the operating department, and will care for the patient&#xD;
      both in the operating room and in the PACU. Thus, the nursing care in the operating room and&#xD;
      in the PACU remains the same, but will be organized in a new way which focuses on the patient&#xD;
      centered individual care and the continuity of care. Furthermore, the same nurse will visit&#xD;
      the patient at the surgical unit on the first postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A uniform content for the postoperative visits will be defined to ensure consistency of the&#xD;
      intervention. The nurse will ask the patients if they have any questions or concerns&#xD;
      regarding the procedure, how they have experienced their perioperative care, what they very&#xD;
      satisfied with and what they would have desired to be different or would expect in the future&#xD;
      from their care. The main aim of the visits is to meet the patient as an individual with&#xD;
      individual needs and desires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the previous research results this new way to allocate personnel did not cause&#xD;
      additional resource needs and did not in any way harm the care of other patients who did not&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive, inferential and advanced statistical analyses will be used.&#xD;
