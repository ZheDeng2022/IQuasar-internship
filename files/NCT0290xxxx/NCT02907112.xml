  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive meat consumption, particularly of red and processed meat, is associated with&#xD;
      increased risk of developing a range of chronic diseases. Meat production also significantly&#xD;
      contributes to the production of global greenhouse gasses (GHG). Given the predicted global&#xD;
      increase in the human population, coupled with the rise in demand for meat within emerging&#xD;
      economies, it has been suggested that strategies to alter dietary patterns and reduce meat&#xD;
      intake should be devised. With the provision of appropriate non- or reduced-meat&#xD;
      alternatives, this study aims to investigate whether free living subjects can significantly&#xD;
      reduce their meat intake, and whether such dietary changes positively impact on a range of&#xD;
      health measures&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In UK adults, meat provides approximately 40% of the average daily protein intake and makes a&#xD;
      significant contribution to intake of thiamin, niacin, vitamin B12, iron, zinc, potassium,&#xD;
      and phosphorus. However, excessive consumption, particularly of red and processed meat, is&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of developing a range of chronic diseases, including&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Meat production&#xD;
      significantly contributes to the production of greenhouse gasses (GHG) and hence global&#xD;
      warming. Given the predicted global increase in the human population, coupled with the rise&#xD;
      in demand for meat within emerging economies, it has been suggested that concerted efforts&#xD;
      should be made to alter dietary patterns and reduce meat intake. Moreover, a number of&#xD;
      reports have suggested that replacing meat with non-meat protein-rich products has health&#xD;
      benefits. Such products tend to be inherently lower in total and saturated fat and, higher in&#xD;
      fibre and as such, could also be cardioprotective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial will be to investigate whether, with appropriate non/reduced-meat&#xD;
      alternatives and motivational support, free living subjects can significantly reduce their&#xD;
      meat intake and whether such dietary changes positively impact on a range of cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design; A non-randomised, single group study design, with an initial control period&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants; Forty healthy men and women will be recruited from the general population of&#xD;
      Nottinghamshire, UK. All participants will attend the David Greenfield Human Physiology Unit&#xD;
      (Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, UK) for an initial medical screening visit to confirm&#xD;
      health status. In addition, blood pressure (BP) will be measured at the left upper arm (after&#xD;
      lying semi-supine for 5min) using automated oscillometry, and body mass index (BMI) will be&#xD;
      calculated from measured height and weight. If participants are suitable to take part with&#xD;
      regards to their health questionnaire and BMI measures, a venous blood sample will then be&#xD;
      taken to assess full blood count, urea, and electrolytes. Those taking lipid-lowering&#xD;
      medication, or who report using nutritional strategies to lower their cholesterol, will be&#xD;
      excluded. Participants will be accepted onto the trial if they report habitual consumption of&#xD;
      4-5 portions of red and/or processed meat per week (with 3-4 of these being consumed as main&#xD;
      meals), they do not have food allergies related to soya or mycoprotein, and do not&#xD;
      demonstrate any clinically significant abnormalities on screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol; After recruitment, participants will be asked to record all food intake&#xD;
      (including snacks and drinks) in a diet diary, for 4 days (3x week or work days, and 1x&#xD;
      weekend or rest day) prior to assessment visit 1, for baseline assessment of macronutrient&#xD;
      and energy intake. Individuals will be asked to complete further 4-day diet diaries in the&#xD;
      week before assessment visits 2,3 and 4 (weeks 4, 10, and 16), to assess any changes in&#xD;
      macronutrient or energy intake and meat consumption which may have occurred as a consequence&#xD;
      of the intervention. Household measures will be used to estimate portion size, and diaries&#xD;
      will be analysed using a food composition database. To calculate habitual diet composition, a&#xD;
      mean daily intake will obtained from all 4 days of each recording period, and these data will&#xD;
      be combined to produce group means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment visits will take place in the morning after the individual has fasted from&#xD;
      midnight the night before. Initially, measurement of body mass will be made to the nearest&#xD;
      0.1kg using a Seca 882 Digital Scale, and waist and hip circumference will be assessed (with&#xD;
      the participant standing) mid-way between the lowest rib and the iliac crest, and at the&#xD;
      greater trochanters, respectively. Participants will then be asked to rest, semi-supine, on a&#xD;
      couch for &gt;5min before having their resting BP measured, and estimation of body composition&#xD;
      made using bioelectrical impedance. A 5ml fasting blood sample will be taken for&#xD;
      determination of serum insulin, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol&#xD;
      (HDL), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), triacyl glycerides (TAG) and whole blood&#xD;
      glucose. In a subset of the cohort (n=26, 13 Male:13 Female), flow mediated dilatation (FMD)&#xD;
      will also be measured on the laboratory visits when fasted, after resting semi-supine for 1&#xD;
      and 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention; After visit 1 (week 0) assessment, participants will be asked not to make any&#xD;
      changes to their lifestyle and to continue their habitual diet until visit 2 (week 4) when a&#xD;
      second assessment will be made ('control' period). The 12 week 'intervention' period will&#xD;
      begin on the day after the second study visit. Participants will be given information&#xD;
      regarding how meat intake can safely be reduced in their diet, including a recipe book&#xD;
      containing ideas for meals using meat analogues and other protein sources. A range of frozen&#xD;
      meat-free (soya or mycoprotein 'mince', mycoprotein sausages, meatballs and 'steak strips')&#xD;
      and reduced meat products (pork sausages, beef meatballs, beef mince and beef burgers made&#xD;
      with 50% meat and 50% soya or mycoprotein) are available for the participants to use to aid&#xD;
      this reduction in red meat intake. In addition, a range of dried beans (red kidney, haricot,&#xD;
      black turtle), pulses (chick peas, green and red lentils) and grains (quinoa) will also be&#xD;
      offered. Weekly telephone contact with the study participants will be maintained over the&#xD;
      intervention period to improve compliance, to identify any problems and to arrange further&#xD;
      food deliveries.&#xD;
