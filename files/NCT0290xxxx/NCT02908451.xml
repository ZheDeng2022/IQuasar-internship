    <textblock>
      This study is to define the safety profile and to determine the Maximal tolerated dose&#xD;
      regimen and preliminary efficacy of AbGn-107 administered every 14 days (Q2W regimen) or 28&#xD;
      days (Q4W regimen) in patients with chemo-refractory locally advanced, recurrent or&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AbGn-107 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) which targets an antigen (AG7 antigen) present&#xD;
      in gastric, colorectal, pancreatic cancer or biliary cancer. This study is a standard 3 + 3&#xD;
      dose escalation design with cohort expansion. AbGn-107 will be administered every 14 days&#xD;
      (Q2W regimen) or 28 days (Q4W regimen) in patients with chemo-refractory locally advanced,&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic gastric, colorectal, pancreatic adenocarcinoma or biliary cancer. The&#xD;
      primary objectives of this study are to define the safety profile and to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose regimen of AbGn-107, and the secondary objectives are to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, the immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of AbGn-107.&#xD;

    COVID-19 pandemic has caused a huge operational difficulty for this ongoing clinical trial, as&#xD;
    many hospitals have set limitations on onsite staff, patient visits, study related procedures&#xD;

             optimal participation in the study.&#xD;
