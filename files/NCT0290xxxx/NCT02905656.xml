      To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the independent effects of motivational interviewing&#xD;
      and rate reduction, individually versus in combination, for motivating smokers who are not&#xD;
      ready to quit (SNRTQ) to increase both quit attempts and tobacco abstinence. Given the&#xD;
      disseminability and the fact that findings can be readily translated into the network of&#xD;
      tobacco quitlines, we propose: (1) To test a tobacco quitline for SNRTQ, following methods&#xD;
      that we have previously implemented and evaluated (HL-123978, CA-127964); (2) To randomize&#xD;
      828 SNRTQs to: (a) Brief Advice + typical smoking cessation resources (control group); (b)&#xD;
      motivational interviewing format recommended by the Clinical Practice Guidelines; (c)&#xD;
      behavioral and pharmacologic rate reduction, and (d) both motivational interviewing and&#xD;
      behavioral and pharmacologic rate reduction. This design allows us to evaluate the&#xD;
      independent and additive effects of motivational interviewing and rate reduction on quit&#xD;
      attempts and smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention utilizing point prevalence at the&#xD;
      12-month follow-up. The Society for Research in Nicotine and Tobacco consensus paper&#xD;
      concluded that point prevalence (7 days without a cigarette, &quot;not even a puff&quot;) is an&#xD;
      appropriate measure in measuring long term outcome in cessation induction trials. Prolonged&#xD;
      abstinence at the 12-month follow-up and quit attempts at the 2-, 4- and 6-month and the&#xD;
      12-month follow-up are secondary endpoints. Self-efficacy, level of smoking reduction,&#xD;
      tobacco dependence, intentions, motivation, and confidence to quit, and intervention&#xD;
      adherence (# sessions attended, amount of nicotine replacement therapy used) will be tested&#xD;
      as important treatment mediators.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On the Society for Research in Nicotine and Tobacco definition of a cessation induction&#xD;
      trial, which is a treatment that promotes cessation among all smokers, including those not&#xD;
      ready to quit.1 One implication of this design is that success is based on percent abstinent&#xD;
      at a given point in time and do not tie a follow-up to a determined quit date (since smokers&#xD;
      not ready to quit often don't typically set formal quit dates).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators research led to a four condition treatment design as the main independent&#xD;
      variable of interest. Participants will be randomly assigned to four treatment conditions:&#xD;
      (1) Brief advice; (2) motivational interviewing; (3) rate reduction; and (4) combination of&#xD;
      motivational interviewing and rate reduction. All four intervention conditions will receive&#xD;
      three sessions once a week, ideally, but can extend to a 6 week time period, each&#xD;
      approximately 30 minutes in length, provided over a period of 4 to 6 weeks, depending on the&#xD;
      participant's circumstances. Upon the completion of the main components, Booster sessions&#xD;
      will be administered in 2-month increments throughout the intervention period (2 month, 4&#xD;
      month, &amp; 6 month follow-up) in conjunction with study assessments. The window for the Booster&#xD;
      sessions will be as indicated above 2M, 4M, and 6M after enrollment, but we will continue to&#xD;
      try and reach them to complete the booster session for 4 weeks. For example, 2 month booster&#xD;
      window opens at 8 weeks after enrollment and we will try to complete that 2 month booster&#xD;
      within 4 weeks. Twelve months after randomization, prolonged abstinence will be measured.&#xD;
