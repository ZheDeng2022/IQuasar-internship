      This study seeks to: Assess &quot;normal&quot; intestinal event rates for healthy subjects, to&#xD;
      determine the effect of meal size on an individual's intestinal rate, and to determine&#xD;
      whether there are differences between individuals in the fasting and post-prandial setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fasting intestinal rate will be consistently less than 14 events per minute, similar to&#xD;
           previously documented bowel sound frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will a uniform increase in intestinal rate in the immediate post-prandial setting.&#xD;
           There will be direct correlation between maximal and average post-prandial intestinal&#xD;
           rates and meal size. Likewise, meal size will correlate with time to baseline fasting&#xD;
           intestinal rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Males and those with lower body mass index (BMI) will experience higher maximal and&#xD;
           average post-prandial intestinal rates and shorter time to baseline fasting levels&#xD;
           compared to females and those with higher BMI, respectively.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will complete a baseline demographic and medical data sheet comprising of age,&#xD;
      gender, race, ethnicity, height, weight, education, employment status, past medical history,&#xD;
      and current prescription and over-the-counter medications. An AbStats device along with a log&#xD;
      sheet will be provided to each subject, both of which will be returned upon completion of&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon waking, prior to oral intake, participants will place the AbStats disposable sensor on&#xD;
      their abdomen and secure it using adhesive tape. The sensor is connected to a monitor which&#xD;
      records the sounds collected by the sensors and interprets them to create and intestinal rate&#xD;
      reading, measured as acoustic events per minute. The device will display a numerical&#xD;
      intestinal rate reading, measured as acoustic events per minute. The device will display a&#xD;
      numerical intestinal rate that participants will record on their personal log sheet. The&#xD;
      purpose of this value is to assess the intestinal rate during fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then eat a small standardized breakfast comprised of a thinkThin oatmeal&#xD;
      single serve bowl, toasted English muffin with butter, and an 11oz iced coffee. No additions&#xD;
      or substitutions are permitted in order to standardize the meal. The percent of food eaten&#xD;
      will be recorded on the log sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lunch on Day 1 will be a &quot;small meal&quot; consisting of half of a turkey and Swiss Corner Bakery&#xD;
      sandwich, cup of fruit, and 12oz can of diet soda. It will be eaten four to five hours after&#xD;
      breakfast. No snacks are permitted between breakfast and lunch. Again, a pre-meal intestinal&#xD;
      rate reading will be obtained 30 minutes prior to eating lunch; participants will secure the&#xD;
      device onto the abdomen multiple times in order to gather post-prandial data. The intestinal&#xD;
      rate will be recorded on the log sheet. The subject will record intestinal rate every 30&#xD;
      minutes for 5 hours after completion of the meal (e.g., lunch at 12 pm, then place sensors on&#xD;
      abdomen for 10 minutes at 12:30 pm, 1:00 pm, 1:30 pm, 2:00 pm, 2:30 pm, 3:00 pm, 3:30 pm, 4:&#xD;
      00 pm, 4:30 pm, and 5:00 pm). Afterwards, participants can eat freely once these data points&#xD;
      have been obtained. Dinner will be a meal of their choosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 of the study will be largely similar to Day 1: participants will measure fasting&#xD;
      intestinal rate upon waking and will eat a standardized breakfast (see above). The main&#xD;
      difference in Day 2 is that participants will eat a &quot;large meal&quot; for lunch consisting of a&#xD;
      full turkey and Swiss Corner Bakery sandwich, cup of fruit, small bag of potato chips, small&#xD;
      cookie, and a 12oz can of diet soda. The same pre- and post-lunch measurements notes above&#xD;
      will be measured and recorded. By performing the above, investigators will assess preliminary&#xD;
      intestinal rate measurements in the fasting state, after a small lunch (Day 1), and after a&#xD;
      large lunch (Day 2).&#xD;
