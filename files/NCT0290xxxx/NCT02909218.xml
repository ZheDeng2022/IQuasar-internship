      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      affordability, and scalability of offering early antiretroviral treatment to all HIV-positive&#xD;
      individuals in Swaziland's government-managed health system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical evidence in support of offering antiretroviral treatment (ART) for all&#xD;
      HIV-positive individuals to improve patient health outcomes and reduce HIV incidence is&#xD;
      building, and the resource-limited countries where this approach could have the biggest&#xD;
      impact want to evaluate if this is a feasible and effective intervention to turn the course&#xD;
      of their HIV epidemics. The MaxART Early Access to ART for All (EAAA) implementation study&#xD;
      was designed to determine the feasibility, acceptability, clinical outcomes, affordability,&#xD;
      and scalability of offering early antiretroviral treatment to all HIV-positive individuals in&#xD;
      Swaziland's government-managed health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 3-year randomized stepped wedge design with open enrollment for all adults 18 years&#xD;
      and older across 14 rural health facilities in Swaziland's Hhohho Region. Primary endpoints&#xD;
      are retention and viral suppression. Secondary endpoints include ART initiation, adherence,&#xD;
      drug resistance, tuberculosis, HIV disease progression, and cost per patient per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites are grouped to transition two at a time from the control (standard of care) to&#xD;
      intervention (EAAA) stage at each 4-month step. This balanced design will result in&#xD;
      approximately one half of the observations being under an intervention clinic, and the other&#xD;
      half under control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations were conservatively based on the estimated number of individuals expected&#xD;
      to enroll in the study comparing the first 12-month measure of retention and 6-month of viral&#xD;
      suppression on ART of those entering clinics during their control stage versus those that&#xD;
      will be entering a clinic during intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A strategic mix of multidisciplinary research methodologies will be applied to meet the study&#xD;
      aim, including implementation science, social science research, economic evaluations, and HIV&#xD;
      incidence modeling.&#xD;
