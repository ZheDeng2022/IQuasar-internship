      LifeSeal™ Kit, surgical sealant designed for staple-line reinforcement that is applied over&#xD;
      the anastomotic line to prevent bowel content leakage until full physiological function is&#xD;
      restored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE : Postoperative anastomotic leakage is one of the most devastating and feared&#xD;
      complications in colorectal surgery. The risk of postoperative anastomotic leakage varies&#xD;
      widely depending on the level of anastomosis while the risk is higher in low anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to best demonstrate the benefits of LifeSeal™ in providing staple line reinforcement&#xD;
      and helping to reduce leaks, the study includes high risk anastomoses, defined as colorectal&#xD;
      and coloanal anastomoses performed within 10 cm from the anal verge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, multinational&#xD;
      randomized, single-blind, double armed study PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the efficacy and safety of LifeSeal™ Kit as measured by the change in&#xD;
      overall anastomotic leak rates in subjects undergoing low anterior resection with an&#xD;
      anastomosis below 10 cm from the anal verge, over the first 17 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: The secondary objective of this study is to assess the incidence of&#xD;
      post-operative leaks and additional benefits that could be related to the use of LifeSeal™&#xD;
      Kit such as reducing the severity and improving the outcome of a leak once it has occurred.&#xD;
      In addition, the study will allow for collection and analysis of additional safety data and&#xD;
      usability assessment of the device, medical resource utilization, and health related quality&#xD;
      of life measures.&#xD;
