  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed for patients with a cancer of the oropharynx (tonsils or base of&#xD;
      tongue) caused by the HPV virus. Traditional treatment involves surgery followed by six weeks&#xD;
      of daily radiation therapy. This study investigates a less intense radiation treatment&#xD;
      following surgery that uses half the dose of radiation given over two weeks rather than six&#xD;
      weeks. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive the less intense treatment versus the&#xD;
      traditional treatment by coin flip. Patients are twice as likely to receive the less intense&#xD;
      treatment during randomization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies suggest that tumors in the oropharynx (tonsils or base of tongue) caused by&#xD;
      the HPV virus are much more sensitive to radiation and chemotherapy. Standard treatment for&#xD;
      HPV associated oropharynx tumor after surgery involves six weeks of radiation therapy and has&#xD;
      many long term side effects and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mayo Clinic recently piloted a study investigating whether patients with HPV-associated&#xD;
      oropharynx tumors can receive less radiation and chemotherapy after surgery when compared&#xD;
      with the standard treatment. The investigators current study will compare the new, shorter&#xD;
      treatment course (2 weeks of treatment) with the standard course of treatment (six weeks).&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either the less intense or standard treatment arm. Patients&#xD;
      will be twice as likely to receive the less intense treatment during randomization.&#xD;
