      To test the efficacy of melatonin compared to placebo in preventing post-operative delirium&#xD;
      and reduction in intensity or duration of delirium in individuals 65 years of age and older&#xD;
      who undergo orthopedic surgery after low energy lower extremity fractures (LELEF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers may play important roles in the detection, prediction and management of delirium&#xD;
      especially in frail elderly individuals. Predictive biomarkers may help characterize an&#xD;
      individual's susceptibility to delirium and thereby help specialized treatment, care and&#xD;
      management of such individuals during their hospitalization. They may also help predict&#xD;
      treatment response to a specific modality and help in selection of such modality. Recent&#xD;
      studies performed in the UK and published in 2011 have measured plasma cholinesterase&#xD;
      activity and determined that these levels were lower in patients who developed delirium&#xD;
      compared with remaining subjects. Other studies have indicated that CRP may also have a role&#xD;
      in delirium prediction as they have found that CRP measured on admission to an ICU had&#xD;
      predictable changes that occurred within 24 hours that in turn were predictors of delirium.&#xD;
      One the aims of the study is to compare the predictive and treatment response values of&#xD;
      groups of biomarkers that have been hypothesized to be of predictive value.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgery causes oxidative stress on the brain9 leading to inflammation. Post-operative&#xD;
      delirium has been linked with inflammation in the brain. Delirium has been hypothesized to be&#xD;
      a central nervous system response to systemic inflammation during a state of blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier (BBB) compromise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown a rise of inflammatory cytokines and fall of anti-inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
      Vice-versa, external cytokine administration has been shown to lead to delirium. Melatonin is&#xD;
      known for its strong anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, this should account for&#xD;
      its preventive properties in post-operative delirium. It has also been hypothesized that&#xD;
      post-operative delirium in elderly is caused by circadian rhythm disturbances secondary to a&#xD;
      relative lack of melatonin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keeping in mind the above two possible pathophysiology for delirium, investigators are&#xD;
      expecting melatonin supplementation should be able to reduce the incidence of post-operative&#xD;
      delirium particularly in elderly population.&#xD;
