  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study enrolls patients who have a type of cancer that arises from the liver called&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma. The cancer has come back, has not gone away after standard&#xD;
      treatment, has spread outside of the liver or the patient cannot receive standard treatment.&#xD;
      This research study uses special immune system cells called GLYCAR T cells, a new&#xD;
      experimental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from&#xD;
      infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special&#xD;
      infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with&#xD;
      viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with&#xD;
      cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells&#xD;
      that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In preclinical studies, the&#xD;
      investigators made several genes called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), from an antibody&#xD;
      called GC33 that recognizes glypican-3, a protein found on almost all hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma cells (GPC3-CAR). This study will test T cells genetically engineered with a&#xD;
      GPC3-CAR (GLYCAR T cells) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GLYCAR T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of GLYCAR T cells that is safe, to see&#xD;
      how long they last in the body, to learn what the side effects are and to see if the GLYCAR T&#xD;
      cells will help people with GPC3-positive hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A maximum of 30 subjects will participate in the treatment part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 180ml of blood is collected from patients to grow the T cells. The T cells are grown&#xD;
      and a retrovirus (a special virus that can carry the GPC3 CAR gene into the T cells) is used&#xD;
      to genetically engineer them. After the CAR gene is put into the T cells, the investigators&#xD;
      make sure that they are able to kill hepatocellular carcinoma cells in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LYMPHODEPLETION CHEMOTHERAPY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to proliferate and&#xD;
      accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells&#xD;
      in circulation. Because of that, participants will receive treatment with cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      (Cytoxan) and fludarabine for 3 days before receiving the T-cell infusion. These drugs will&#xD;
      decrease the numbers of the participants' own T cells before the investigators infuse the&#xD;
      GLYCAR T CELLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT THE INFUSION WILL BE LIKE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After making these cells, they will be frozen. If the patient agrees to participate in this&#xD;
      study, at the time the patient is scheduled to be treated, the cells will then be thawed and&#xD;
      injected into the patient over 5 to 10 minutes. The participant will receive the GLYCAR T&#xD;
      CELLS 48-72 hours after completing the chemotherapy. The participant may be pretreated with&#xD;
      Tylenol (acetaminophen) and Benadryl (diphenhydramine). Tylenol and Benadryl are given to&#xD;
      prevent a possible allergic reaction to the T cell administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose escalation study, which means that the investigators do not know the highest&#xD;
      dose of GLYCAR T cells that is safe. To find out, the investigators will give the cells to at&#xD;
      least 3 participants at one dose level. If that is safe, they will raise the dose given to&#xD;
      the next group of participants. The dose each patient gets will depend on how many&#xD;
      participants get the agent before that patient and how they react. The investigator will tell&#xD;
      each patient this information. This will help the patient think about possible harms and&#xD;
      benefits. Since the treatment is experimental, what is likely to happen at any dose is not&#xD;
      known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the Treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Houston&#xD;
      Methodist Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests before treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam and History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function and blood clotting (INR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the patient is infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) we will do a test to measure&#xD;
           the levels of the virus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test (if the patient is a female who can get pregnant)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the patient's tumor by scans (within 4 weeks before chemotherapy) and&#xD;
           the tumor marker alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), if the patient's tumor produces this protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests during and after treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exams and History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function and blood clotting (INR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the patient is infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) we will do a test to measure&#xD;
           the levels of the virus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the tumor maker alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), if the patient's tumor produces&#xD;
           this protein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the patient's tumor by scans (4 - 8 weeks after the infusion +/- 1 week)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsy (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP STUDIES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will follow the participant during and after the injections. To learn more&#xD;
      about the way the T cells are working in the participant's body, up to 60 mL (12 teaspoons)&#xD;
      of blood will be taken from the participant before the chemotherapy, before the T-cell&#xD;
      infusion, 3 to 4 hours after the infusion, 3 to 4 days after the infusion (this time point is&#xD;
      optional ) at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks after the injection, every 3&#xD;
      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years and then every year for the next 10 years.&#xD;
      Total time participation for this study will be 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time points listed above, if the T cells are found in the participant's blood at a&#xD;
      certain amount an extra 5mL of blood may need to be collected for additional testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use this blood to look for the frequency and activity of the cells&#xD;
      that they have given; that is, to learn more about the way the T cells are working and how&#xD;
      long they last in the body. They will also use this blood to see if there are any long-term&#xD;
      side effects of putting the new gene (chimeric antigen receptor, CAR) into the cells. In&#xD;
      addition to the blood draws, because the participants have received cells that have had a new&#xD;
      gene put in them, they will need to have long term follow up for 15 years so the&#xD;
      investigators can see if there are any long term side effects of the gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a year, participants will be asked to have their blood drawn and answer questions about&#xD;
      their general health and medical condition. The investigators may ask participants to report&#xD;
      any recent hospitalizations, new medications, or the development of conditions or illness&#xD;
      that were not present when they enrolled in the study and may request that physical exams&#xD;
      and/or laboratory tests be performed if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to procurement we confirmed GPC3-expression in your tumor by obtaining part of a biopsy&#xD;
      sample that was done for clinical purposes. We will obtain an additional tumor biopsy at 2&#xD;
      weeks after treatment for research purposes. These samples will be used to look for GPC3-CAR&#xD;
      T cells in the tumor and to learn more about the effects of the treatment on your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that a tumor biopsy is performed for clinical reasons the investigators will&#xD;
      request permission to obtain excess sample to learn more about the effects of the treatment&#xD;
      on the participant's disease. In the event of death, the investigators will request&#xD;
      permission to perform an autopsy to learn more about the effects of the treatment on the&#xD;
      participant's disease and if there were any side effects from the cells with the new gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants develop a second abnormal cancer growth, significant blood or nervous system&#xD;
      disorder during the trial, a biopsy sample of the tissue will be tested (if a sample can be&#xD;
      obtained).&#xD;
