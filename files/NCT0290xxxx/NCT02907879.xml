      The objective of the study is to assess brain tissue perfusion by ultrasound perfusion&#xD;
      imaging. Specifically&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to diagnose brain tissue hypoperfusion due to CVS with contrast enhanced UPI and to&#xD;
           assess specificity and sensitivity, and predictive values for detection of brain tissue&#xD;
           hypoperfusion leading to infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to test whether treatment-effects by induced hypertension, balloon-dilatation, or&#xD;
           intra-arterial nimodipine infusion can be detected and quantified by UPI&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to assess brain tissue perfusion by ultrasound perfusion imaging&#xD;
      (UPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim is to diagnose brain tissue hypoperfusion leading to infarction due to CVS&#xD;
      with ultrasound perfusion imaging (UPI) and to correlate it with the gold standard of&#xD;
      diagnosis of brain infarcts, i.e. with MRI and CT. According to contrast enhanced UPI brain&#xD;
      tissue will be classified as (1) normal, i.e. not leading to tissue infarction, (2) as&#xD;
      hypoperfused, i.e. functionally impaired and prone to DIND and to infarction, or (3)&#xD;
      non-perfused. Thus, temporary hypoperfusion that may be resolved by therapy or spontaneously,&#xD;
      not leading to tissue infarction shall be assessed. This strategy will lead to guiding&#xD;
      therapy by UPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess cerebral perfusion in patients with SAH by contrast enhanced UPI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess specificity and sensitivity, as well as positive and negative predictive&#xD;
           values of contrast enhanced UPI for detection of brain tissue misery perfusion leading&#xD;
           to infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate feasibility and practicability of repeated bed-side assessments of UPI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to test whether treatment-effects like induced hypertension, balloon-dilation, or&#xD;
           intra-arterial nimodipine infusion can be detected and quantified by contrast enhanced&#xD;
           UPI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to analyze whether TCD or contrast enhanced UPI is superior for screening of CVS and&#xD;
           detection of cerebral infarcts (vessel vs. tissue assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to correlate contrast enhanced UPI with perfusion measurements by CT-perfusion imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound perfusion imaging (UPI) is able to detect cerebral hypoperfusion that can result&#xD;
      in cerebral infarction in a clinical setting. As reference the incidence of cerebral infarcts&#xD;
      is assessed by CT- and MR-imaging and cerebral perfusion is analyzed by CT-perfusion (CTP)&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of the ictus (SAH) is defined as day 0. The ultrasound examinations will be performed&#xD;
      at&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 0-4: one baseline UPI study will be performed. This time period (0-4) is set as&#xD;
           baseline, because this baseline investigation will be performed before vasospasm&#xD;
           develops. The current policy of early aneurysm treatment results in clipping or coiling&#xD;
           of patients within 24-48 hours. The relevant phase of CVS, however, starts on day 4 to 5&#xD;
           after the ictus. The already established routine protocol with early CT and CTP imaging&#xD;
           after aneurysm treatment allows differentiation between infarcts due to the procedure of&#xD;
           aneurysm clipping or coiling, bleeding, edema, or surgical contusions from cerebral&#xD;
           infarcts due to CVS that develop later on. This early routine CT imaging includes a&#xD;
           CT-perfusion study on post-op day 1, serving as reference for the ultrasound perfusion&#xD;
           measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 5-14: during the term with the highest risk for CVS, a UPI study will be performed&#xD;
           every second day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Several events trigger additional UPI studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  angiography (scheduled or emergency)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  endovascular intervention (angioplasty or intraarterial nimodipine infusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CT or MRI study with new infarcts&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Development of DIND or reversal of DIND&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  in case of placement of an intracerebral microprobe (rCBF or ptiO2) an UPI study&#xD;
                will be performed when significant changes (rCBF drop below 20ml/100g/min or below&#xD;
                60% of baseline, ptiO2 drop below 10mmHg or below 60% of baseline) occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently all patients are scanned by MRI and or CT several times in the course of the&#xD;
      disease. Each imaging study serves as reference for UPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During day 5-14 high risk patients (Fisher grade 3, or TCD &gt; 150 cm/sec, or new deficit)&#xD;
      receive one CT-perfusion study between day 7 and 11 (period of highest risk).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During day 5-14 patients with proven CVS (angiography) will receive two CT-perfusion studies,&#xD;
      one at day 7, and one at day 11, or at the time when new deficits or infarcts evolve.&#xD;
      Additional about 20% of patients will get MRI including perfusion weighted imaging (PWI). In&#xD;
      these patients misery perfusion as detected by PWI serves as reference for UPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The actual UPI measurement takes place at the bedside, is performed by the study physician,&#xD;
      and takes about 15 -30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial duration per patient is 14 days during the initial hospitalization.&#xD;
