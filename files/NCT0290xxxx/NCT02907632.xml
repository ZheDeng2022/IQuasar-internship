  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) is a condition that affects the majority of premature infants&#xD;
      that are followed at the Kangaroo Mother Care Program (ambulatory program for preterm infants&#xD;
      discharged with their mothers in continuous skin to skin contact and strict outpatient follow&#xD;
      up). For over 20 years, the use of Metoclopramide has been systematic among all preterm&#xD;
      infants according to the protocols of the Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) Program . The aim of&#xD;
      this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and security of metoclopramide to lessen&#xD;
      the symptoms of GRE in premature infants that are followed and treated in the Ambulatory KMC&#xD;
      Program before 40 weeks of gestational age. Design: Randomized, double blind trial,&#xD;
      controlled with placebo. Eligible Population: Premature infants that are followed and treated&#xD;
      in the Ambulatory Kangaroo Mother Care Program at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio before&#xD;
      40 weeks of gestational age, which systematically receive: metoclopramide 0.2 mg per kg,&#xD;
      every 8 hours, 15 minutes before every feeding up to 40 weeks of gestational age, between&#xD;
      January 01 2017 and December 31 2017.Outcomes: Incidence of regurgitation episodes reported&#xD;
      by the parents of the infants, episodes of apnea, bronchoaspiration, postprandial&#xD;
      irritability, the infant rejects feeding, alteration in the postprandial posture and the&#xD;
      frequency and severity of adverse effects associated with the use of Metoclopramide such as&#xD;
      extrapyramidal symptoms and sedation. In the case of continuous variables, the mean and&#xD;
      median will be compared according to the distribution and for nominal variables, a chi&#xD;
      squared test or fisher test will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: 12 months. Ethical Aspects: Experiment with minimum mayor risk. Informed consent&#xD;
      will be requested to parents. An independent committee from the work group will be in charge&#xD;
      of carrying out the follow-up of the safety and progression of the study. A methodological&#xD;
      expert, a thematic expert, a statistician and an expert in bioethics will constitute the&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financial Disclosure: The study will be funded through the Kangaroo Foundation with the&#xD;
      collaboration of the &quot; Hospital Universitario San Ignacio&quot;, Bogotá, Colombia.&#xD;

      Justification: Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) is a condition that affects the majority of&#xD;
      premature infants that are followed at the Kangaroo Mother Care Program. The incidence of GRE&#xD;
      in premature infants can oscillate between 22 and 85% depending on the criteria used to&#xD;
      diagnose GER, which can vary among healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For over 20 years, the use of metoclopramide has been systematic among all preterm infants&#xD;
      according to the protocols of the Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) Program. These protocols were&#xD;
      established according to the recommendations emitted by the Cochrane Collaboration in 2006,&#xD;
      nevertheless according to new studies published in the last years, the controversial evidence&#xD;
      referring the use of metoclopramide given the eventual possibility of adverse effects and the&#xD;
      lack of evidence in premature infants, it is necessary to evaluate whether it is pertinent to&#xD;
      continue the use of metoclopramide in premature infants and the risk of adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and security of metoclopramide to lessen the&#xD;
      symptoms of GRE in premature infants that are followed and treated in the Ambulatory KMC&#xD;
      Program before 40 weeks of gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized, double blind trial, controlled with placebo. Eligible Population:&#xD;
      Premature infants that are followed and treated in the Ambulatory KMC Program at Hospital&#xD;
      Universitario San Ignacio before 40 weeks of gestational age, which systematically receive:&#xD;
      metoclopramide 0.2 mg per kg, every 8 hours, 15 minutes before every feeding up to 40 weeks&#xD;
      of gestational age, between April 1 2017 and January 31 2019. Intervention: Blind and&#xD;
      randomized allocation to the experimental treatment (metoclopramide 0.2 mg per kg, every 8&#xD;
      hours, 15 minutes before every feeding up to 40 weeks of gestational age) or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Incidence of regurgitation episodes reported by the parents of the infants,&#xD;
      episodes of apnea, bronchoaspiration, postprandial irritability, the infant rejects feeding,&#xD;
      alteration in the postprandial posture and the frequency and severity of adverse effects&#xD;
      associated with the use of metoclopramide such as extrapyramidal symptoms and sedation. In&#xD;
      the case of continuous variables, the mean and median will be compared according to the&#xD;
      distribution and for nominal variables, a chi squared test or fisher test will be carried&#xD;
      out.Intervention: Blind and randomized allocation to the experimental treatment&#xD;
      (metoclopramide 0.2 mg per kg, every 8 hours, 15 minutes before every feeding up to 40 weeks&#xD;
      of gestational age) or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results: Reliable information regarding the use of metoclopramide in premature&#xD;
      infants for the prevention of regurgitation episodes associated to apnea, cyanosis,&#xD;
      irritability, rejection of feeding efforts, bronchoaspiration and poor weight gain as well as&#xD;
      adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: 12 months. Ethical Aspects: Experiment with minimum mayor risk. Informed consent&#xD;
      will be requested to parents. An independent committee from the work group will be in charge&#xD;
      of carrying out the follow-up of the safety and progression of the study. A methodological&#xD;
      expert, a thematic expert, a statistician and an expert in bioethics will constitute the&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
