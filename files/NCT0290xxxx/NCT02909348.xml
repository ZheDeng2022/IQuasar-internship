  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a new form of cancer treatment called immunotherapy which does not attack cancer&#xD;
      directly but works on the immune system to make it more effective. This type of treatment may&#xD;
      have side effects which are called autoimmune side effects and are caused by the immune&#xD;
      system attacking the normal parts of the body. At the moment doctors cannot predict which&#xD;
      patients may be at more risk of developing such autoimmune side effects and doctors also&#xD;
      cannot predict which patients are more likely to benefit. This study will analyse blood&#xD;
      samples from patients receiving immunotherapy to see if markers can be identified to help&#xD;
      make such predictions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy is a new approach to treating cancers and the major side effects are classed as&#xD;
      autoimmune because the immune system is targeting itself. Currently doctors are not able to&#xD;
      identify patients at higher risk of developing such autoimmune toxicities and nor are doctors&#xD;
      able to identify patients more likely to respond to such treatment. Markers in the immune&#xD;
      system have already been identified which are associated with naturally occurring autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases. In this study the investigators will examine immune cells from patients with&#xD;
      advanced malignant melanoma receiving immunotherapy treatment with Pembrolizumab to see if&#xD;
      similar immune system markers can be identified and if such markers may be related to the&#xD;
      development of autoimmune side effects or response to treatment. This would enable better&#xD;
      selection of patients for treatment with immunotherapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Be 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have a confirmed metastatic melanoma of cutaneous or mucosal origin, and if cutaneous&#xD;
             to be confirmed BRaf wild-type.&#xD;

          4. Be willing to provide blood samples in line with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have a performance status of 0 to 2 on the ECOG Performance Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Demonstrate adequate organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study&#xD;
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy within 4 weeks of the first&#xD;
             dose of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any&#xD;
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial&#xD;
