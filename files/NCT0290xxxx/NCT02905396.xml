    <textblock>
      Small fibre neuropathy (SFN) is a disorder in which selectively thinly myelinated and&#xD;
      unmyelinated nerve fibres are involved. SFN can cause severe and chronic symptoms such as&#xD;
      burning pain in the extremities in combination with autonomic symptoms. So far, the results&#xD;
      of symptomatic SFN treatment have been rather disappointing, despite the fact that new agents&#xD;
      have been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot study to investigate whether Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) combined&#xD;
      with best (drug) treatment as usual (TAU) leads to clinically significant pain relief in&#xD;
      patients suffering from pain in the lower limbs due to SFN, defined as ≥30% pain reduction on&#xD;
      a mean NRS during daytime, and/or ≥30% pain reduction on a mean NRS during night-time, and/or&#xD;
      at least much improved or very much improved, on the Patient Global Impression of Change&#xD;
      (PGIC) for pain and sleep.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small fibre neuropathy (SFN) is caused by dysfunction of the Aδ-fibres and C-fibres. SFN is&#xD;
      diagnosed if there are typical SFN symptoms together with abnormal intraepidermal nerve fibre&#xD;
      density (IENFD) in skin biopsy and/or abnormal temperature thresholds in quantitative sensory&#xD;
      testing (QST). A large number of disorders can underlie SFN, such as diabetes, amyloidosis,&#xD;
      sarcoidosis and other systemic illnesses, vasculitis, and HIV. The proportion of idiopathic&#xD;
      or cryptogenic SFN reported in literature varies between 24% and 93%. SFN is not a rare&#xD;
      condition; a recent study showed a minimum prevalence of 53/100.000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SFN can cause severe and chronic symptoms such as burning pain in particularly the&#xD;
      extremities in combination with autonomic symptoms, with a significant impact on quality of&#xD;
      life. Moreover, neuropathic pain disorders are associated with anxiety, depression and sleep&#xD;
      disturbances, polypharmacy and significant healthcare resource use. Therefore, neuropathic&#xD;
      pain has a significant impact on society due to the high socioeconomic costs. The treatment&#xD;
      of SFN still largely relies on the agents generally used for neuropathic pain relief,&#xD;
      particularly derived from diabetic painful neuropathic studies, such as antidepressants&#xD;
      (amitriptyline, duloxetine), anti-epileptic agents (pregabalin, gabapentin), opioids and&#xD;
      topical agents (lidocain and capsaicin), but have been disappointing in SFN (clinical&#xD;
      observation in &gt; 400 patients treated). Therefore it is of major importance to develop new&#xD;
      treatment options that can provide sufficient pain relief for the individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1965 Melzack and Wall introduced the gate theory of pain perception. This theory offered&#xD;
      new perspectives in treating neuropathic pain. In the seventies SCS was introduced. It was&#xD;
      thought that the stimulation of the large myelinated fibres modulates the transmission of&#xD;
      pain signals, which run through small, non-myelinated fibres. The exact mechanism of SCS is&#xD;
      still unknown. Nowadays SCS is used worldwide and the global sales are estimated for more&#xD;
      than 35.000 systems annually. Recently, a prospective two-centre randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      was performed to investigate the effect of SCS in painful diabetic polyneuropathy. SCS was&#xD;
      successful in 59% of the patients, and the effect lasted for at least 2.5 years in most&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current pilot study will focus on the potential effect of SCS in patients with SFN. The&#xD;
      main study parameter will be the mean pain intensity as measured on a Numeric Rating Scale&#xD;
      (NRS) and/or a Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) for pain and sleep measured on a&#xD;
      7-point Likert scale, after 12 months of treatment in patients with SFN and intractable&#xD;
      neuropathic pain in the lower limbs. Besides the primary objective, the following secondary&#xD;
      aims are investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The effect of SCS on pain (at least 30% pain reduction, on mean daily, night, and&#xD;
           maximum pain);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the effect of SCS on activity and participation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the effect of SCS on and health related quality of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the effect of SCS on mood in SFN;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the effect of SCS on the reduction of pain medication.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether SCS combined with best (drug) treatment as usual (TAU) leads to clinically significant (≥30%) pain relief in patients suffering from pain in the lower limbs due to SFN after 12 months of treatment.&#xD;
Clinical significant pain relief is determined as:&#xD;
≥30% pain reduction on the mean daytime pain using the NRS, and/or&#xD;
≥30% pain reduction on the night-time pain using the NRS and/or&#xD;
At least much improved or very much improved on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) for pain and sleep.</description>
