  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the increasing number of advanced surgical operations being done annually, including the&#xD;
      elderly, the risk of developing postoperative delirium is potentially high. Postoperative&#xD;
      delirium is associated with longer hospital stay, poorer functional outcome, cognitive&#xD;
      decline and an elevated morbidity and mortality, in addition to an increased cost of health&#xD;
      care. However, most of the studies on postoperative delirium have been done in high income&#xD;
      countries, leaving a paucity of literature on the incidence and associated factors of&#xD;
      postoperative delirium in Africa and hence a need to do this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The paucity of literature in the low income setting as regards to the complication of post&#xD;
      operative delirium has led to under recognition and under diagnosis of this problem.The lack&#xD;
      of diagnostic tools, such as the CAM, has contributed to low rates of diagnosis and index of&#xD;
      suspicion among clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives were To determine the incidence and perioperative factors associated with&#xD;
      postoperative delirium in adult patients undergoing elective surgery in Mulago National&#xD;
      Referral Hospital (MNRH) Procedure Patient recruitment Patients were stratified by ward and&#xD;
      then systematic sampling was used with a sampling interval of 3. On each day of recruitment,&#xD;
      the first 3 patients on the theatre list on a particular ward were selected by writing&#xD;
      numbers 1 to 3 on pieces of paper and randomly selecting one; the number selected would be&#xD;
      the first to be enrolled, succeeded by every 3rd patient on the theatre list for that day.&#xD;
      Written informed consent was obtained preoperatively from each study patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative assessment Trained research assistants conducted the preoperative interviews&#xD;
      with a questionnaire within 12 hours before surgery. Patient demographics, pain scores,&#xD;
      Glasgow coma scores, smoking history, alcohol consumption, anaesthetic history, American&#xD;
      Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA), Class as recorded on the anaesthetic chart, vitals and&#xD;
      laboratory results of complete blood count, renal and liver functional tests available were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium assessment To determine the presence of delirium, research assistants conducted&#xD;
      structured interviews preoperatively and on the first three postoperative days between hours&#xD;
      of 9am and 12 pm, using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Based on a structured&#xD;
      interview, the CAM algorithm included four clinical criteria: acute onset and fluctuating&#xD;
      course, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. To define&#xD;
      delirium, both the first and second criteria had to have been present, plus either criterion&#xD;
      three or four. The research assistants were trained in CAM use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure consistency in the evaluation, each patient was evaluated by the same research&#xD;
      assistant for all three interviews. All cases of incident delirium were validated by a second&#xD;
      investigator. The investigators focused on delirium measurement on the first 3 days&#xD;
      postoperatively, aiming to avoid loss to follow up as the majority of postoperative patients&#xD;
      in our setting get discharged on the third postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associated factors Risk factors identified during the preoperative interviews included age,&#xD;
      history of smoking and alcohol use, preoperative pain scores, medications, and electrolytes.&#xD;
      Other factors including type of surgery, ASA classification, duration of anaesthesia,&#xD;
      Intraoperative blood loss as recorded on the anaesthetic charts. Blood loss was estimated&#xD;
      using the common method of adding up volumes of blood absorbed in the commonly used&#xD;
      absorptive materials including the gauze pieces, sponges and the mops. Suction canisters&#xD;
      measured pre and post operatively and calculated minus the irrigation used in the case. Then&#xD;
      the total estimated intraoperative blood loss was charted on the anaesthetic chart,&#xD;
      intraoperative medications were obtained from the anaesthetic chart.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All adult patients above 18 years who have consented to participate in the study and&#xD;
             are fully conscious by the Glasgow coma scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric disease confirmed by medical documents, as these were unable&#xD;
             to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing neuro surgery and open heart surgery, as these patients were&#xD;
             expected to remain intubated postoperatively, precluding cognitive assessments.&#xD;
