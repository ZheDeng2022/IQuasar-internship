      The purpose of this study is to evaluate use of four different vaginal films - two sizes and&#xD;
      two textures. The vaginal films have no active ingredients or medications. Information will&#xD;
      be gathered about each film (i.e. ease of insertion, proper placement, opinions about each).&#xD;
      The results of this study will help investigators determine which type of vaginal film to use&#xD;
      (and how to write product instructions) for future studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All women will use all 4 products in a randomized study design with a crossover evaluation&#xD;
      during 10 visits over two months. Visits will be scheduled when the participant is not&#xD;
      menstruating/bleeding. The sequence of film use will be randomized. Study procedures will&#xD;
      involve a screening visit (VISIT 1) during which a baseline cervicovaginal lavage will be&#xD;
      collected and infections will be excluded. After randomization (VISIT 2) women will be given&#xD;
      instructions and instructed to insert the first film. An external genital examination will be&#xD;
      performed after the participant inserts the film to verify film placement. In the event a&#xD;
      participant has difficulty placing the film, the study clinician may place the film for them.&#xD;
      Following each film insertion, a questionnaire will be administered to obtain feedback&#xD;
      regarding ease of administration. Thirty minutes after product insertion a clinician will&#xD;
      visualize film placement in the vagina by speculum examination. Women will be counseled to&#xD;
      avoid sexual activity or vaginal product usage before VISIT 3 scheduled for the following&#xD;
      day. At visit 3 women will have a speculum examination to assess whether the film has&#xD;
      completed disintegrated and a CVL sample will be collected. Women will be given an&#xD;
      appointment for the next film insertion in 7-20 days. The general sequence of events will be&#xD;
      repeated for each subsequent film. At the next visit (VISIT 4) women will insert the second&#xD;
      film and have the same evaluation as visit 2. A CVL sample will be collected 24 hours later&#xD;
      (VISIT 5). Women will be asked to return to insert another film 7-20 days later (VISIT 6) and&#xD;
      a CVL sample will be collected the next day (VISIT 7). Women will receive the final film 7-20&#xD;
      days later (VISIT 8) and have the final CVL collection following film insertion the next day&#xD;
      (VISIT 9). A final visit (VISIT 10) will be scheduled &gt;14 days after visit 9. During this&#xD;
      visit a CVL will be collected for glycomic and innate antiviral activity studies and an in&#xD;
      depth interview will be conducted in order to gain insights into the role of film polymer and&#xD;
      size on perceived ease of insertion across the four film types.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Female, Age 18-40&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able and willing to provide written informed consent to be screened for and enrolled&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able and willing to provide adequate locator information at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. HIV-uninfected based on documented testing performed in the previous 6 months or by&#xD;
             study staff at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In general good health as determined by the site clinician&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Agree to abstain from any intravaginal or rectal product or device or penetration&#xD;
             (including vaginal, anal, or oral sex, masturbation, or sex toys) between each film&#xD;
             insertion and the collection of the CVL approximately 24 hours later. Agree to be&#xD;
             sexually abstinent for 48 hours prior to the study visits (from enrollment to visit&#xD;
             10). Sexual activity in the 48 hours prior to screening is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willingness to undergo all study-related assessments and procedures, including&#xD;
             multiple speculum examinations, and follow all other study-related procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. At screening and enrollment, agrees not to participate in other research studies&#xD;
             involving drugs, medical devices, or vaginal products while enrolled in this trial and&#xD;
             to abstain from vaginal product usage with the exception of tampons over the study&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who meet any of the following criteria by participant report will be excluded from&#xD;
        the study. Of note, the study is limited to premenopausal women with an intact uterus&#xD;
        because the mucosal immune environment differs substantially between pre- and post-&#xD;
        menopausal women. Therefore, inclusion of post-menopausal women would introduce&#xD;
        heterogeneity into the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous participation in a vaginal film study where participant was randomized to use&#xD;
             film (i.e. FAME 02; FAME 04). Note: If participant was randomized to the gel arm, then&#xD;
             she would be potentially eligible for participation in FLAG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Menopausal at screening (as defined as amenorrhea for one year or more without an&#xD;
             alternative etiology)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hysterectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant report of any of the following at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Known adverse reaction to any of the study products (ever)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Known adverse reaction to latex (ever)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Non- therapeutic injection drug use in the 12 months prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Surgical procedure involving the pelvis in the 90 days prior to screening&#xD;
                  (includes dilation and curettage or evacuation, and cryosurgery; does not include&#xD;
                  cervical biopsy for evaluation of an abnormal pap smear or IUD placement)&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Participation in a drug, spermicide and/or microbicide study in the 30 days prior&#xD;
                  to screening or anticipated participation in an investigational drug study in the&#xD;
                  next 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Currently pregnant or pregnancy within 90 days prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Lactating&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Use of a diaphragm, NuvaRing®, or spermicide for contraception 5.) Urogenital&#xD;
                  infection or suspected infection within 14 days of enrollment including:&#xD;
                  symptomatic candidiasis, trichomonas vaginalis, and symptomatic bacterial&#xD;
                  vaginosis; or cervical infection, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC), Chlamydia&#xD;
                  trachomatis (CT), or mucopurulent cervicitis; syphilis; HSV lesions, or other&#xD;
                  sores (Note: participants seropositive for HSV without active lesions will not be&#xD;
                  excluded); acute pelvic inflammatory disease; urinary tract infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Antibiotic or antifungal therapy (vaginal or systemic) within 7 days of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Menses or other vaginal bleeding at the time of enrollment* or expecting menses in the 5&#xD;
        days after enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        *Note, for women with monthly cycles, every attempt will be made to enroll these&#xD;
        participants in the first half of their menstrual cycle. Women who have vaginal bleeding at&#xD;
        the scheduled Enrollment Visit may return at a different date to be re-examined and&#xD;
        possibly enrolled provided they are still within the screening window (maximum of 30 days&#xD;
        between screening and enrollment) and meet all criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude provision of&#xD;
        consent, make participation in the study unsafe, complicate interpretation of study outcome&#xD;
        data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives&#xD;
