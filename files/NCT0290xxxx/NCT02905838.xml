  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess and compare the esthetic outcome and clinical performance of anterior maxillary all&#xD;
      ceramic implant single crowns based either on prefabricated zirconia abutment veneered with&#xD;
      pressed ceramics or on a CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing)&#xD;
      CARES® abutment veneered with hand build-up technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the patient population who has previously received dental&#xD;
      implant treatment, received a provisional restoration and met the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria according to the study protocol. After final impression, patients will be randomised&#xD;
      into Group A (prefabricated anatomic abutments ): one-piece screw retained single crown using&#xD;
      a press technique (fluorapatite glass-ceramic, e.max ZirPress) with cut-back technique or&#xD;
      Group B (CAD/CAM CARES® abutments): one- piece screw retained single crown with a hand&#xD;
      build-up technique (fluorapatite veneering ceramic, e.max Ceram). One week after final&#xD;
      restoration (base line visit) the primary and secondary outcome parameters will be assessed.&#xD;
      The patients will be followed up to 5 years after final restoration.&#xD;
