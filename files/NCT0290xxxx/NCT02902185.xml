  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV replication can be effectively suppressed and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome(AIDS)&#xD;
      can be prevented with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, HIV-infected&#xD;
      people must remain on treatment continuously to avoid viral rebound and progression to AIDS.&#xD;
      HIV persistence is thought to stem primarily from the presence of integrated copies of the&#xD;
      proviral genome within long-lived cells. Because active viral gene expression causes cell&#xD;
      death due to viral cytopathic effects and the immune response, long-lived cells likely harbor&#xD;
      transcriptionally silent, latent provirus. HIV-1 persistence in long-lived cellular&#xD;
      reservoirs remains a major barrier to a cure. HDACi have the potential to activate (&quot;Kick&quot;)&#xD;
      these latently infected cells. This will make the HIV infected cells visible to the immune&#xD;
      system; the immune response and antiretrovirals(ARVs) will be able to attack and eliminate&#xD;
      (&quot;Kill&quot;) the infected cells. This study is subsequent to our NCT02513901. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to verify the efficacy of multi-dose Chidamide in combination with antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy in HIV-infected adults with suppressed viral load in a randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

      Sixty participants will be recruited and stratified by their CD4 cell count(30 for &lt;500&#xD;
      cells/μL and 30 for ≥500 cells/μL). Each layer was 1:1 randomly divided into Chidamide group&#xD;
      or Placebo-controlled group.Chidamide and Placebo will be administrated 10mg each time, twice&#xD;
      a week, interval not less than 3 days. Chidamide and Placebo intervention will last 12&#xD;
      consecutive weeks. All participants will keep their antiretroviral therapy during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last for 96 weeks, involving 16 study visits(Screening, Week 0, 2, 4, 8, 12,&#xD;
      14, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96) for every participant. At the screening visit,&#xD;
      participants will give a medical history and will undergo a physical exam; blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected. If participants agree, their blood samples may be stored for future research.&#xD;
