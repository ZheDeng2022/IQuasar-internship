  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease with metabolic alterations due&#xD;
      mainly by the liberation of catabolic cytokines leading to changes in body composition as&#xD;
      rheumatoid cachexia. Dynamic exercise (DE) has demonstrated to improve muscular, strength and&#xD;
      joint function as well as inflammatory process. Also, a diet focused on the consumption of&#xD;
      certain fatty acids like the Mediterranean is recommended to reduce inflammation. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to assess the effect of a dynamic exercise program in combination with a&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet in strength, joint mobility and disease activity in women with RA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation,&#xD;
      joint pain, destruction of the synovial membranes and metabolic alterations due mainly by the&#xD;
      liberation of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta mainly and leading to&#xD;
      changes in body composition as rheumatoid cachexia, which is characterized by involuntary&#xD;
      loss of muscular mass with or without loss of body weight and with or without gain of fat&#xD;
      mass and therefore reducing physical activity and affecting nutrition. Alternative therapies&#xD;
      that could improve these metabolical changes are &quot;Dynamic exercise&quot; (DE) which has&#xD;
      demonstrated to improve muscular function and muscular strength, as well as joint mobility&#xD;
      and joint inflammatory markers without negative effects on RA. Also, &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot;&#xD;
      (MD) which is recommended to reduce inflammation by the high intake of monounsaturated and&#xD;
      polyunsaturated and low in saturated fats. Previous studies report the benefits of&#xD;
      nutritional interventions but in the majority of the cases therapies are based on specific&#xD;
      foods and not in the form of diet. Likewise, physical interventions are different regarding&#xD;
      in time and type of movement. However both interventions have shown ambiguous findings in&#xD;
      terms of body composition (mainly) and which prevents drawing conclusions and generate&#xD;
      recommendations on the implementation of these therapies (in combination). As far as the&#xD;
      investigators know, no studies evaluating the effect of a diet and exercise combined. Thus&#xD;
      the aim of this study is to assess the effect of DE program in combination with a MD on body&#xD;
      composition, strength, joint mobility and disease activity in women with RA.&#xD;
