  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical&#xD;
      trial of oral D-methionine (D-met) to reduce noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus.&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to develop a safe, oral pharmacological agent to augment physical&#xD;
      hearing protectors for noise exposures that exceed the protective capabilities of ear plugs&#xD;
      and/or muffs. The study population is a cohort of Drill Sergeant (DS) instructor trainees&#xD;
      during and 22 days after their 11 day weapons training. The primary objective of this study&#xD;
      is to determine the efficacy of D-met in preventing NIHL or reducing tinnitus secondary to a&#xD;
      minimum of 500 rounds of M-16 weapons training occurring over an 11 day period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hearing loss can render a soldier less able to detect and identify the enemy, less able to&#xD;
      understand commands, particularly in background noise typical on the battlefield, and may&#xD;
      permanently reduce quality of life. In some cases, hearing loss may preclude redeployment or&#xD;
      result in less optimal job assignment. Currently, no FDA approved pharmacological prevention&#xD;
      exists for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). We have documented in animal studies that&#xD;
      administration of D-methionine (D-met) can reduce or prevent NIHL. We now need to determine&#xD;
      if it has similar efficacy in humans. Although we have not yet tested D-met on protection&#xD;
      from noise-induced tinnitus in animals, this clinical trial would provide us the opportunity&#xD;
      to also test for protection from noise induced tinnitus simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Administration of oral D-methionine prior to, during and 4 days&#xD;
      post-weapons training will reduce or prevent permanent noise-induced hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis: Administration of oral D-methionine prior to, during and 4 days&#xD;
      post-weapons training will reduce or prevent noise-induced tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether administering oral D-met can prevent permanent NIHL after weapons&#xD;
      training. This aim will be addressed by comparing the results of D-met versus placebo&#xD;
      administration starting 3 days prior to, during the 11 day period of weapons training&#xD;
      (Monday-Friday for first week, Monday-Thursday for second week), and 4 days after for a total&#xD;
      of 18 days. Pure tone hearing thresholds will be assessed before and 22 days after completion&#xD;
      of weapons training (ie; 18 days after the last day of study drug/placebo administration).&#xD;

      Tinnitus questionnaires will be assessed before and 22 days after completion of weapons&#xD;
      training (ie; 18 days after the last day of study drug/placebo administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To monitor for any potential side effects of D-met in human subjects. This aim will be&#xD;
      accomplished by subject query on each day study drug is dispensed (twice daily) and at final&#xD;
      study visit, routing of any adverse event reports to study medical personnel, statisticians&#xD;
      and to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
