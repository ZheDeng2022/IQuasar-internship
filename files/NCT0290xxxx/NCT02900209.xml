      The aim of this study is to determine responses of the immune system to the annual flu&#xD;
      vaccination in people with COPD who experience frequent or infrequent exacerbations and&#xD;
      healthy participants. We will collect blood and saliva immediately before and one month after&#xD;
      flu vaccination at GP surgeries in the Autumn/Winter period. By measuring how quickly&#xD;
      antibodies (that provide protection against infection) develop in the blood after vaccination&#xD;
      we can provide important new information to help confirm whether those prone to COPD flare&#xD;
      ups have weaker immune systems.&#xD;

      Venous blood samples will be collected in K3EDTA and serum vacutainer tubes. Saliva samples&#xD;
      will be obtained while participant is seated with the head tilted slightly forward and&#xD;
      passively dribbling into a pre-weighed sterile tube (keeping orofacial movement to a&#xD;
      minimum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood samples will be used on the day of collection and analysed before being&#xD;
      appropriately disposed of on the same day. Blood samples will be centrifuged with plasma and&#xD;
      serum frozen at -80c for later analysis. Saliva samples will also be centrifuged with&#xD;
      supernatant frozen at -80c for later analysis.&#xD;
