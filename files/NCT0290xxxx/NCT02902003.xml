      The Parenting Center (TPC) offers the Empowering Families program, which integrates a&#xD;
      relationship education curriculum (Family Wellness) into a comprehensive set of services that&#xD;
      includes case management, employment services, and financial coaching. The evaluation will&#xD;
      test the effectiveness of offering relationship skills education services with a robust&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The evaluation of Empowering Families will test the effectiveness of offering relationship&#xD;
      skills education services with a robust economic security component to low-income couples&#xD;
      raising children. The program is built on Family Wellness, a relationship education&#xD;
      curriculum that has not yet been rigorously studied. The Parenting Center (TPC) has&#xD;
      integrated Family Wellness into a comprehensive set of services that includes case&#xD;
      management, employment services, and financial coaching. The evaluation will test the effect&#xD;
      of this full package of services on couples' relationship and employment outcomes. The&#xD;
      evaluation will also examine effects on outcomes related to child well-being, such as&#xD;
      co-parenting and father involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Empowering Families evaluation will be conducted with low-income couples raising&#xD;
      children. To be eligible for program services, both members of the couple must: (1) be age 18&#xD;
      or older, (2) report that they are in a committed relationship with their partner; (3) speak&#xD;
      a language in which programming is being offered; (4) be interested in participating in a&#xD;
      program that offers both relationship skills and economic stability services; (5) be&#xD;
      available to participate in programming for the next six months; (6) pass a domestic violence&#xD;
      screen; and (7) not have an open case with child protective services. In addition, at least&#xD;
      one member of the couple must have a biological or adopted child who is under age 18 and&#xD;
      lives with them at least half time. The Parenting Center will aim to recruit couples who are&#xD;
      economically disadvantaged and likely to want both relationship skills and employment&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation plan for the Empowering Families program calls for the enrollment and random&#xD;
      assignment of 1,000 couples over the course of two years. This target requires The Parenting&#xD;
      Center to recruit approximately 42 couples for the study each month. Half of these couples&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to the Empowering Families program; the other half will be assigned&#xD;
      to a control group that is not eligible for program services.To document the outcomes of&#xD;
      study participants, survey data will be collected at two time points: (1) a baseline survey&#xD;
      administered at study enrollment and (2) a follow-up survey conducted about a year later. The&#xD;
      investigators will also conduct a process study to document how Empowering Families was&#xD;
      implemented.&#xD;
