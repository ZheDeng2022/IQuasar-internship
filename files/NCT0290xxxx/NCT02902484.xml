      The study will perform a clinical study evaluating the safety and tolerability of nintedanib&#xD;
      when combined with standard chemotherapy (Gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel) for metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. It will utilize advanced imaging correlates including dynamic contrast&#xD;
      enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) which correlates with tumor grade and&#xD;
      microvessel density.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical data suggest nintedanib inhibits primary tumor growth in in vivo xenograft models&#xD;
      of pancreatic cancer, as well as inhibiting metastasis in pancreatic cancer models. This&#xD;
      effect appears primarily due to nintedanib anti-angiogenic properties. The study will perform&#xD;
      a clinical study evaluating the safety and tolerability of nintedanib when combined with&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy (Gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel) for metastatic pancreatic cancer. It&#xD;
      will utilize advanced imaging correlates including dynamic contrast enhanced Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) which correlates with tumor grade and microvessel density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, treatment will have two phases: nintedanib monotherapy for a two week&#xD;
      period (Days 1-14) followed by combination phase of nintedanib plus chemotherapy (Cycle 2+).&#xD;

    <description>A standard 3+3 phase 1 trial design will be used for Nintedanib monotherapy for a two week period (Days 1-14) followed by combination phase of nintedanib plus chemotherapy. Two dose levels of nintedanib will be explored 150 mg IBD and 200 mg BID. The combination phase will include gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel, and nintedanib. Patient treatment will consist of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m &amp; nab-paclitaxel 120 mg/m. Treatment will be administered intravenously on days 1, 8, 15 every 28 days.</description>
