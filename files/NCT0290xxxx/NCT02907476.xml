      This randomized controlled trial is designed to test the Vagal-gamma amino-butyric acid&#xD;
      (GABA) Hypothesis that one of the mechanisms by which yoga-based practices improve mood and&#xD;
      decrease anxiety is by correcting an autonomic system (ANS) imbalance with too much activity&#xD;
      in the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and too little activity in the parasympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system (PNS). This imbalance is associated with under activity in the GABA system. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that yoga-based practices increase activity in the PNS by increasing&#xD;
      respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), which is associated with increased activity in the GABA&#xD;
      system and decreased depressive and anxiety symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) will be randomized into two treatment groups, a&#xD;
      yoga group (YG) and a walking group (WG). After screening and Scan 1, each subject will be&#xD;
      randomized to a 12-week yoga or walking intervention consisting of two group sessions and&#xD;
      three homework sessions a week.The primary dependent variable will be brain gamma&#xD;
      amino-butyric acid (GABA) levels measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in two&#xD;
      regions of interest (ROI)s: the thalamus and the anterior cingulate. GABA levels will be&#xD;
      measured three times: Scan 1 prior to randomization, Scan 2 after the 12-week intervention,&#xD;
      and immediately after Scan 2, subjects will participate in either the yoga intervention or&#xD;
      walking intervention, followed immediately by Scan 3. The secondary dependent variable will&#xD;
      be changes in depressive symptoms, mood and anxiety measured by valid and reliable&#xD;
      psychological instruments obtained before each scan and at screening, week-4, week-8 and&#xD;
      week-12. The third dependent variable will be respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) a component&#xD;
      of heart rate variability (HRV) that is an accurately index of vagal influences on the heart.&#xD;
      RSA will be measured scan 1, pre and post an intervention session depending on group&#xD;
      assignment at week 4, 8 and 12 evaluations, pre and post the yoga or walking intervention&#xD;
      between Scan 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To complete 22 subjects in the yoga group and 22 subjects in the walking group for a&#xD;
      total of 44 subjects with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Completion is defined at a&#xD;
      baseline evaluation, a week-4 or week-8 evaluation and a week-12 evaluation with usable&#xD;
      thalamic data for Scans 1, 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To measure changes in GABA levels over time using a mixed linear model analogue of&#xD;
      repeated measures analysis-of-variance with independent groups in regional GABA levels in MDD&#xD;
      subjects assigned to yoga and walking interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To assess changes in psychological measurements and regional GABA levels over the&#xD;
      course of the interventions using linear regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. To assess changes in PNS using Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) over the course of&#xD;
      the study using linear regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5. To assess changes in PNS, RSA and regional GABA levels over the course of the study&#xD;
      using linear regression.&#xD;
