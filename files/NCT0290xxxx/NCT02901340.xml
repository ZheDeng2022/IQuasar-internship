      The purpose of the study is to investigate third trimester fetal renal artery doppler indices&#xD;
      in borderline idiopathic isolated oligohydramnios and relationship between neonatal outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During a routine pregnancy examination at 34-37 weeks gestation, the fetus was evaluated&#xD;
      using ultrasound with the Toshiba Xario 200 3.5-megahertz probe. Fetal biometric measurements&#xD;
      were obtained and placental structure and the amniotic fluid amount were evaluated in four&#xD;
      quadrants. After detailed ultrasonography of the fetus, eligible pregnant women were included&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Borderline idiopathic isolated oligohydramnios was defined according to the four quadrants&#xD;
      technical with ultrasound examination and diagnosed with amniotic fluid index &gt;5.0 and&#xD;
      ≤8.0cm. After first ultrasound examination all patients in borderline isolated&#xD;
      oligohydramnios group were hydrated with one to two liters of water daily. All patients&#xD;
      monitored with non stress test and amniotic fluid index twice weekly until delivery after&#xD;
      treatment with hydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For evaluating renal artery blood flow, an axial image of the fetal abdomen was obtained at&#xD;
      the level of the fetal kidneys. Using color flow Doppler, the renal arteries were evaluated&#xD;
      at the level of their origin from the abdominal aorta. The Doppler gate was placed within the&#xD;
      lumen in a straight segment of the vessel. A minimum of three consecutive waveforms was used&#xD;
      to calculate the PI. The umbilical artery Doppler measurements were studied in a free loop of&#xD;
      cord, far from the fetus and placenta. pulsatile index and resistance index values were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consisted of two groups. The first group was formed of the patients who had normal&#xD;
      amniotic volume and meets the inclusion criteria. In second group the investigators included&#xD;
      patients who diagnosed borderline idiopathic isolated oligohydramnios. After delivery the&#xD;
      investigators compared fetal renal artery doppler indices and neonatal outcomes between&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

        The study population was consisted of 2 groups and included pregnant women in between 34&#xD;

        healthy pregnant women whom excluded borderline idiopathic isolated oligohydramniosis , the&#xD;
        main group was consisted of 40 pregnant women with diagnosed borderline idiopathic isolated&#xD;
