      This pilot study evaluates the effect of exercise training on CFR, functional capacity, heart&#xD;
      rate variability, endothelial function and quality of life in patients with no obstructive&#xD;
      coronary artery disease and angina.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impaired coronary flow reserve (CFR) is associated with increased mortality in patients with&#xD;
      chest pain despite normal coronary arteries (chest pain and normal coronary angiograms&#xD;
      (CPNCA)) , . Furthermore, impaired CFR without any concomitant impairment of regional or&#xD;
      global left ventricular function have additional prognostic significance . In patients with&#xD;
      hypertension both microvascular dysfunction and increased left ventricular mass (LVM) are&#xD;
      described sequels . LVM has also been associated with endothelial dysfunction and coronary&#xD;
      artery remodelling . In addition, patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      (HOCM) and an impaired micro vascular cardiac circulation assessed with PET, have been&#xD;
      documented to have a poor prognosis . Also diastolic dysfunction as measured by Em/Am ratio&#xD;
      during stress dobutamine echocardiography is related to CFR . Patients with Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
      have an impaired prognosis and longstanding disease influence microvascular physiology .&#xD;
      Several methods have been utilized to assess micro vascular function including intracoronary&#xD;
      Doppler measurements. CRF can now be assessed with transthoracic Doppler registration .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several patients with angina and normal coronary arteries show persistence and even worsening&#xD;
      of angina symptoms over time. . These patients constitute a therapeutic problem with&#xD;
      considerable residual morbidity associated with functional limitation and reduced quality of&#xD;
      life . The primary end point in the treatment of these patients is symptom control .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced physical activity is one of the major avoidance behaviours in patients with coronary&#xD;
      heart disease . On the other hand several studies have documented the positive effect of ET&#xD;
      in this population . Psychological morbidity with great impact on daily living is well known&#xD;
      in both patients with cardiovascular disease and in patients with chest pain with no obvious&#xD;
      physical disease. This includes patients with CPNCA. These patients constitute a relatively&#xD;
      large proportion of patients taken care of by the health authority system indicating that&#xD;
      this issue has economic consequences for the society that is not neglectable2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise training (ET) has been shown to improve endothelial function in patients with&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and to reduce LVM in hypertension.. ET also improves&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and reverse inflammation in CAD. It is also associated with improved&#xD;
      outcome in the general population and in patients with CAD and heart failure. It has been&#xD;
      documented that hs-CRP correlates with symptoms and ECG markers of myocardial ischemia in&#xD;
      CPNCA patients . Whether hs-CRP is related to the pathogenesis of angina in these patients&#xD;
      deserves further investigation. Whether ET may influence on pathological reduced CFR is&#xD;
      currently not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions proposed in CPNCA patients are directed at either improving microvascular&#xD;
      function or decreasing chest pain perception, in an attempt to counteract the accepted&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms of the syndrome. A multidisciplinary approach and a genuine,&#xD;
      sympathetic appreciation by the health staff of the devastating effect of cardiac syndrome X&#xD;
      on the patients' quality of life usually have a positive therapeutic impact . Unfortunately,&#xD;
      most treatments have been evaluated in small numbers of patients and/or in uncontrolled&#xD;
      trials, thus making it difficult to establish their real degree of effectiveness. Tynni Lee&#xD;
      11 investigated the effects of physical training and relaxation therapy on exercise capacity&#xD;
      and quality of life in patients with syndrome X. It is the first trial reported to assess the&#xD;
      effect of physiotherapy intervention in terms of quality of life in patients with coronary&#xD;
      syndrome X. Female patients with this syndrome benefit from physical training in terms of&#xD;
      exercise capacity and quality of life, and from relaxation therapy in terms of quality of&#xD;
      life. However a limitation is the small sample size and therefore non-significant findings&#xD;
      may be due to an inability to detect a difference among groups. Further studies with larger&#xD;
      number of patients are recommended. Different modes of physiotherapy could have the potential&#xD;
      to break the vicious circle of effort-induced chest pain, functional limitations and poor&#xD;
      quality of life in the patients with coronary syndrome.&#xD;
