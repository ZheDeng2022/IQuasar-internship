      The purpose of this exploratory study is to evaluate the characteristics of sleep,&#xD;
      perceptions of barriers and facilitators to adequate sleep, and the associations among sleep&#xD;
      characteristics, executive functioning, coping, adherence, 24-hour glucose levels, and&#xD;
      adjustment in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. A mixed methods approach that includes a&#xD;
      quantitative component, consisting of actigraphy and sleep diaries, questionnaires, tests of&#xD;
      executive function and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) as well as a narrative qualitative&#xD;
      component will be used. Results from this pilot study will be used to provide the effect&#xD;
      sizes needed for a larger-scale descriptive study and to establish the need for a possible&#xD;
      sleep-promoting intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes. This project is consistent&#xD;
      with ongoing research focused on developing preventive, behavioral interventions for youth&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes and their families to improve physiological (i.e., glycemic control) and&#xD;
      psychological (i.e., quality of life) outcomes. Sleep promotion may become an important&#xD;
      component of these interventions. Thus, the following specific aims will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the objective and subjective characteristics of sleep (duration, continuity,&#xD;
           bed time/rise times); sleep quality and sleep habits among adolescents with type 1&#xD;
           diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore the relationship between characteristics of self-reported sleep (i.e., habits,&#xD;
           duration, daytime sleepiness) and executive function, coping, adherence, and adjustment&#xD;
           (i.e., depressive symptoms, quality of life) in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore the relationship of glucose excursions on sleep characteristics and executive&#xD;
           functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Conduct a qualitative study using narrative analysis with adolescents to identify&#xD;
      perceived barriers, facilitators, and consequences associated with insufficient sleep in&#xD;
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

      A mixed methods approach will be used to characterize sleep and explore the associations&#xD;
      between sleep disturbances and executive function, coping, glycemic control, adherence, and&#xD;
      adjustment in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. To understand these relationships, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect quantitative data, including self-report and parent-report&#xD;
      questionnaires and a test of cognitive functioning after consent and screening. Clinical data&#xD;
      related to diabetes will be collected from the medical chart and CGM, and overnight sleep&#xD;
      data will be collected during the subsequent week. The investigators will also collect&#xD;
      qualitative data, using semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Describe the objective and subjective characteristics of sleep (duration, continuity,&#xD;
      bed time/rise times); sleep quality and sleep habits among adolescents with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the initial recruitment procedures and questionnaires, adolescents will wear&#xD;
      the Respironics Minimitter Actiwatch AW64, a wrist-worn accelerometer, continuously for 1&#xD;
      week, removing them only for bathing, and depress the event marker at &quot;lights out&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;lights on&quot; times to demarcate time in bed. Sleep diaries will be completed daily in the&#xD;
      mornings and evenings to track daytime sleep-related behaviors (e.g., caffeine use, exercise)&#xD;
      and nocturnal sleep characteristics (e.g., bedtime, wakings). The research assistants will&#xD;
      call adolescents the day after enrollment to address any problems and elicit understanding.&#xD;
      At the end of the week, they will call adolescents as a reminder to complete the data&#xD;
      collection and return the watch and diary in a prepaid mailer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis. Actigraph data will be scored with Actiware v. 5 software. Diary forms have&#xD;
      been prepared in scannable format to reduce the need for research staff entering data&#xD;
      manually. Forms will be examined for improperly filled items and missing data, scanned and&#xD;
      committed to an MS Access database. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize each of&#xD;
      the primary sleep variables (diary and actigraph) (% wake after sleep onset, time in bed,&#xD;
      sleep efficiency, sleep latency, duration) over the 1-week interval. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      will also be used to characterize the total and component scores of the Children's Sleep&#xD;
      Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcome of this aim is a more detailed characterization of sleep patterns in&#xD;
      adolescents with T1D to identify the key variables to be measured in a large scale study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Explore the relationship between characteristics of self-reported sleep (i.e., habits,&#xD;
      duration, daytime sleepiness) and executive function, coping, adherence, and adjustment&#xD;
      (i.e., depressive symptoms, quality of life, anxiety) in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
      Questionnaires and test of executive function will be completed by adolescents and their&#xD;
      parent/guardian after screening and consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: The proposed measures have been used in our ongoing studies with adolescents with&#xD;
      T1D, and they have established reliability and validity. The questionnaires will take about&#xD;
      20-30 minutes to complete, and the test of executive function will take 5 minutes. Following&#xD;
      the established protocol, a trained RA will demonstrate the Trail Making Test using the&#xD;
      sample sheet. The adolescent will be timed on the full test (drawing lines to connect 25&#xD;
      circles, alternating letters and numbers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: To explore the relationship between sleep and executive function, coping,&#xD;
      adherence, and adjustment, the investigators will use bivariate correlations. To evaluate the&#xD;
      extent to which insufficient sleep is associated with executive function, coping, adherence,&#xD;
      and adjustment in this population the investigators will use conduct independent groups&#xD;
      t-tests to obtain estimates of the differences on key variables between adolescents who get&#xD;
      insufficient vs. sufficient sleep (&lt; 7 hours/night vs. &gt; 7 hours/night). The investigators&#xD;
      will also calculate the effect size from these data to establish the basis for a power&#xD;
      analysis for a possible future larger study. Finally, using a linear regression model, the&#xD;
      effect of sleep duration on key variables will be examined after controlling for potential&#xD;
      confounders; gender, race/ethnicity, and income have been shown to impact sleep habits.&#xD;
      Further, the investigators will explore the extent to which there is an effect of gender on&#xD;
      the outcome variables or their interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcome of this aim is estimates of effect sizes needed to conduct power&#xD;
      analyses for a full-scale study of the associations between sleep and cognitive function,&#xD;
      coping, adherence, and adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Explore the relationship of glucose excursions on sleep characteristics and executive&#xD;
      function. Using CGM data from the iPro CGM system, glucose excursions and time with&#xD;
      hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia will be identified. Youth who are already using CGM will not&#xD;
      have to wear a second monitor, but will provide downloaded data from their CGM at the return&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses: Bivariate correlations to examine relationships among sleep and executive&#xD;
      function, coping, adherence, and adjustment and glycemic excursions will be conducted. To&#xD;
      evaluate the extent to which insufficient sleep is associated with executive function,&#xD;
      coping, adherence, and adjustment in this population independent groups t-tests will be used&#xD;
      to obtain estimates of the differences on key variables between adolescents with nighttime&#xD;
      hypo- or hyperglycemia. The effect size will be calculated from these data to establish the&#xD;
      basis for a power analysis for a possible future larger study. Finally, using a linear&#xD;
      regression model, the effect of sleep duration on key variables will be examined after&#xD;
      controlling for potential confounders; gender, race/ethnicity, and income have been shown to&#xD;
      impact sleep habits. Further, the extent to which there is an effect of gender on the outcome&#xD;
      variables or their interactions will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcome of this aim is estimates of the effect sizes needed to conduct power&#xD;
      analyses for a full-scale study of the associations among glucose excursions, sleep&#xD;
      characteristics, and cognitive function, coping, adherence, and adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. Conduct qualitative study using narrative inquiry with all adolescents in our&#xD;
      population to identify perceived factors associated with insufficient sleep in adolescents&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past several decades, adolescents have shifted to later sleep times, while wake times&#xD;
      have remained the same, resulting in insufficient sleep. Barriers to sleep in adolescents&#xD;
      include extracurricular activities, work, academics, and social interaction. More recently,&#xD;
      electronic media use and video-game playing have been linked to shorter sleep duration.&#xD;
      Predictors of disturbed sleep in adolescents and young adults (college students) include&#xD;
      emotional and academic stress. Many of these are modifiable behaviors that could be addressed&#xD;
      in future interventions. For adolescents with T1D, sleeping late on the weekends has&#xD;
      additional risks of hypoglycemic episodes. What is not known are the barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to sleep specific to this population. Interviews will be conducted with&#xD;
      adolescents to learn through their stories what are important factors associated with&#xD;
      insufficient sleep in this population.&#xD;
