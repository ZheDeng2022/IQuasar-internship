  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the major health problems worldwide, and one of the leading cause of&#xD;
      death especially in Asia. Though the cytotoxic chemotherapy is the main treatment option,&#xD;
      newer and molecularly targeted agents are recently incorporated to improve the survival&#xD;
      outcome. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, ErbB2) is a transmembrane tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase receptor and is overexpressed or amplified in 10-20% of gastric cancer. Recently,&#xD;
      Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer (ToGA) study reported the clinical benefit of trastuzumab for&#xD;
      HER2 positive gastric cancer patients. However, because the majority of patients develop&#xD;
      intrinsic or acquired resistance within 1 year, elucidating the molecular mechanisms for&#xD;
      trastuzumab resistance is warranted to improve the survival outcome of HER2 positive gastric&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing body of preclinical and clinical evidence shows that the immune system contributes&#xD;
      substantially to the therapeutic effects of &quot;monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab&quot; in solid&#xD;
      tumors. Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody designed&#xD;
      to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on strong rationale in exploring the impact of combining trastuzumab with anti-PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitor in HER2 positive cancer, we suggest multicenter phase IB/II study to determine&#xD;
      antitumor activity and safety of pembrolizumab in combination with standard treatment&#xD;
      (trastuzumab, capecitabine, and cisplatin) in patients with HER2 positive gastric cancer.&#xD;
