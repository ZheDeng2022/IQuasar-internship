      Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is an online platform that has become a popular means of&#xD;
      recruiting participants with problem drinking, gambling, or even illicit drug use for the&#xD;
      purposes of survey-based research. There is also the possibility that potential participants&#xD;
      could be identified through MTurk for online longitudinal studies, including for brief&#xD;
      intervention research. The potential to quickly and easily identify large numbers of&#xD;
      participants through MTurk is important for research evaluating online interventions during&#xD;
      the period that these interventions are being developed and refined. However, before&#xD;
      proposing MTurk workers as a viable source for participants in online intervention trials, it&#xD;
      is important to evaluate the feasibility of using MTurk for such a purpose. This pilot study&#xD;
      proposes to test this feasibility by systematically replicating a trial of an extensively&#xD;
      evaluated brief online intervention for hazardous alcohol use (CheckYourDrinking; CYD) and&#xD;
      will attempt to recruit and follow-up participants for this replication using people&#xD;
      recruited through MTurk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through Amazon's MTurk crowdsourcing platform. Participants&#xD;
      identified as problem drinkers based on an initial survey will be invited to complete another&#xD;
      survey in 3 months time. Those who are interested will be randomized to receive access to the&#xD;
      Check Your Drinking screener (CYD condition) or to a no additional information condition&#xD;
      (control condition). At three-months post-baseline, the MTurk portal will be used to send&#xD;
      invitation emails that contain a link to the follow-up survey. The primary hypothesis to be&#xD;
      tested is that participants receiving access to the CYD intervention will report a greater&#xD;
      level of reduction in number of drinks in a typical week between the baseline survey and&#xD;
      three-month follow-up as compared to participants in the no information control condition.&#xD;
