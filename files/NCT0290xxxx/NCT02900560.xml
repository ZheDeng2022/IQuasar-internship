      The purpose of the study is to determine the optimal dose of CC-486 (oral azacitidine) in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of platinum-resistant/refractory Epithelial&#xD;
      Ovarian Cancer (EOC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, four-cohort study, in which intravenous pembrolizumab&#xD;
      will be combined with 4 different schedules of administration of CC-486 (oral azacitidine),&#xD;
      for the treatment of platinum-resistant/refractory (EOC). This is also a futility trial for&#xD;
      the strategy to combine pembrolizumab and CC-486 in EOC. Eligible subjects will be treated in&#xD;
      one of four cohorts of combined oral CC-486 and intravenous pembrolizumab (200 mg intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) every 3 weeks in all cohorts) to evaluate the safety of each combination schedule and to&#xD;
      have preliminary data on their efficacy. The primary objective is to establish the optimal&#xD;
      dosing schedule for comparison with pembrolizumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned to a treatment cohort in the order they are enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      In all subjects, tumor tissue will be obtained via image-guided core biopsy at study entry&#xD;
      and 6 weeks after commencing treatment with CC-486. A cohort will remain open to accrual&#xD;
      until five subjects treated on that cohort have completed two CC-486 cycles and have had the&#xD;
      first post-baseline tumor burden assessment and both tumor biopsies performed and adequate&#xD;
      paired tissue obtained. At least 5 evaluable subjects per cohort will be accrued over an&#xD;
      estimated period of approximately 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be treated in the assigned cohort until progressive disease based on&#xD;
      Immune-Related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (irRECIST), unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, consent withdrawal or the Investigator concludes that it is in the subject´s best&#xD;
      interest to discontinue. Once 5 subjects in each cohort are considered evaluable for&#xD;
      response, toxicity and treatment responses will be analyzed for each of the four cohorts and&#xD;
      an optimal schedule will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes mandatory tumor core biopsies for biomarkers research and mandatory whole&#xD;
      blood sampling for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation analyses.&#xD;
