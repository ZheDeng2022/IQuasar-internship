      There is no evidence that discontinuing antibiotic therapy for non-bacterial infections is&#xD;
      safe. The main objective of this study is to determine whether discontinuation of antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy when a clinician no longer considers it necessary makes any difference in terms of&#xD;
      the number of days with severe symptoms. This is a multicentre, open-label, randomised&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial. The study will be conducted in ten primary care centres in Spain.&#xD;
      We will include patients from 18 to 75 years of age with uncomplicated acute respiratory&#xD;
      tract infections (RTIs) in whom: antibiotics are not necessary; or those diagnosed with&#xD;
      clinical conditions for which antibiotics might be necessary but according to the history and&#xD;
      clinical examination the physician considers that antibiotics are not needed or the patient&#xD;
      feels that the antibiotic regimen has not worked as expected; or several doses of an&#xD;
      antibiotic have been taken from leftovers found in the household or obtained at the pharmacy&#xD;
      without any medical prescription for a clinical condition for which antibiotics are not&#xD;
      necessary. The patients will be randomly assigned to the usual strategy of continuing&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment (usual intervention group) or discontinuing antibiotic therapy (novel&#xD;
      intervention group). A sample size of 215 patients per group was calculated on the basis of a&#xD;
      reduction of one day in the duration of severe symptoms as a clinically relevant outcome. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be duration of severe symptoms, i.e. symptoms scored 5 or 6 by means of&#xD;
      a symptom diary. Secondary outcomes will include: antibiotics taken, adverse events, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, and complications within the first 3 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction: General practitioners (GP) have always been told to continue an antibiotic&#xD;
      regimen once the patient has initiated it in order to prevent the patient from acquiring&#xD;
      resistant microorganisms. This might be true for confirmed bacterial infections; however,&#xD;
      continuing an antibiotic regimen when this is not indicated might hasten the acquisition of&#xD;
      resistant organisms and cause adverse events. Since 2011 the Spanish Society of Family&#xD;
      Medicine has been recommending GPs to ask their patients to stop taking antibiotics when they&#xD;
      suspect a viral infection. However, there is no evidence that discontinuing antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy for these conditions is safe. The main objective of this study is to determine&#xD;
      whether discontinuation of antibiotic therapy when a GP no longer considers it necessary&#xD;
      makes any difference in terms of the number of days with severe symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled clinical trial. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted in ten primary care centres in Spain. We will include patients from 18 to&#xD;
      75 years of age with uncomplicated acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in whom: 1.&#xD;
      Antibiotics are not necessary; or 2. Those diagnosed with clinical conditions for which&#xD;
      antibiotics might be necessary but according to the history and clinical examination the GP&#xD;
      considers that antibiotics are not needed or the patient feels that the antibiotic regimen&#xD;
      has not worked as expected; or 3. Several doses of an antibiotic have been taken from&#xD;
      leftovers found in the household or obtained at the pharmacy without any medical prescription&#xD;
      for a clinical condition for which antibiotics are not necessary. The patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the usual strategy of continuing antibiotic treatment (usual&#xD;
      intervention group) or discontinuing antibiotic therapy (novel intervention group). A sample&#xD;
      size of 215 patients per group was calculated on the basis of a reduction of one day in the&#xD;
      duration of severe symptoms as a clinically relevant outcome. The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      duration of severe symptoms, i.e. symptoms scored 5 or 6 by means of a symptom diary.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include: antibiotics taken, adverse events, patient satisfaction, and&#xD;
      complications within the first 3 months. A post-trial implementation observational clinical&#xD;
      study by means of a qualitative analysis is planned to be carried out after the clinical&#xD;
      trial to know the percentage of the use of the strategy of discontinuing antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      and the pros and cons of its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination: The study was approved by the Ethical Board of Fundaci√≥ Jordi Gol i&#xD;
      Gurina (reference number: 16/093) and informed consent will be obtained from all the patients&#xD;
      included. The findings of this trial will be disseminated through research conferences and&#xD;
      peer-reviewed journals.&#xD;
