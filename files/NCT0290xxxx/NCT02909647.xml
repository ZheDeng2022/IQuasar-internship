      Background: Three dimensional (3D) digital pre-operative planning software for osteosynthesis&#xD;
      of fractures was developed. To assess the usefulness of the 3D planning, we evaluated the&#xD;
      accuracy of the reduction shapes and selected implants in the patients with distal radius&#xD;
      fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Thirty wrists of 30 distal radius fracture patients who underwent osteosynthesis&#xD;
      using volar locking plates were evaluated. Fifteen wrists were treated with 3D preoperative&#xD;
      planning as the plan group. The other fifteen wrists were treated with conventional&#xD;
      preoperative planning as the control group. Volar tilt and radial inclination were measured&#xD;
      after operation and compared with the healthy side wrist. In addition, preoperative planning&#xD;
      and postoperative reductions were compared by measuring the volar tilt and radial inclination&#xD;
      of the 3D images in the plan group. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) values of&#xD;
      the radiological parameters between healthy side wrists and injured side wrists, between&#xD;
      preoperative planning and postoperative reductions were evaluated. For the accuracy of the&#xD;
      implant choices, the ICCs for the screw lengths between the preoperative plan and the actual&#xD;
      choices were evaluated in the plan group.&#xD;

      Patients and Methods The study protocol was approved by our Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
      Thirty wrists of 30 distal radius fracture patients who underwent osteosynthesis using&#xD;
      locking plates (19 females, 11 males; age range 23-89, mean age 59.5 years) were evaluated.&#xD;
      Patients were excluded if they reported a previous history of traumatic injuries to the arm.&#xD;
      The patients were divided into two groups: 15 patients in the plan group utilized our 3D&#xD;
      digital preoperative planning software, and 15 patients in the control group utilized&#xD;
      standard preoperative assessment on plain radiographs and CT scans. The age, sex, and&#xD;
      fracture types were matched between groups. According to the preoperative CT scans, fractures&#xD;
      were classified using the AO classification system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Planning In the plan group, 3D digital preoperative planning and a surgical&#xD;
      simulation were performed in order to determine the reduction and the placement of the&#xD;
      implants in addition to the plate/screw size prior to surgery. Reduction and placement of the&#xD;
      implants were simulated using software newly-developed by the authors (Zed-Trauma, LEXI Co.,&#xD;
      Ltd. Tokyo, Japan). Planning using this software is based on digital imaging and&#xD;
      communications in medicine (DICOM) data from CT scans. All preoperative planning group&#xD;
      patients had pre- and post-operative CT scans in order to compare the planned and&#xD;
      post-operative reduction shape and placement of the implant. The CT comprised contiguous&#xD;
      sections of 1 mm thickness. The software allows the surgeons to 1) visualize the fracture&#xD;
      displacement, 2) simulate repositioning of the fragments, 3) place the plate and screws, 4)&#xD;
      adjust the sizes of the implants, and 5) check the shape after the reduction and implant&#xD;
      placement by measuring anatomical shape (Figure 1 and 2). After importing the DICOM images to&#xD;
      the software, a 3D image of the distal radius was made. Each distal radius fracture was&#xD;
      segmented according to the main fracture fragments using the cut function. Each fragment was&#xD;
      repositioned in accordance with fracture lines. After repositioning the fragments, the bone&#xD;
      shape was checked three dimensionally. Reduction of the fragment was performed to regain the&#xD;
      volar tilt and the radial inclination, and less than 2mm step-off for the intra-articular&#xD;
      displacement referring to the healthy side wrist X ray. Simulation of the implantation of the&#xD;
      volar locking plate used 3D templates with variable sizes of plates and screws. The Stellar&#xD;
      II locking plate (HOYA Technosurgical, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) was used in this study. This plate&#xD;
      system has small, medium, and large sizes for the width, and short and long sizes for the&#xD;
      plate length. Screw lengths from 10 to 24 mm for the distal (2.4 mm diameter), and 10 to 20&#xD;
      mm for the proximal (2.6 mm diameter) are available. Computer aided design models of&#xD;
      different-sized implants were installed in the software. The plate size was chosen to cover&#xD;
      the distal fragment maximally and not exceeded the width of the distal radius. The plans were&#xD;
      made by a single hand surgeon. After the planning, osteosynthesis was performed under general&#xD;
      anesthesia. During the surgery, the operator performed the reduction and the placement of the&#xD;
      plate while comparing images between the preoperative plan and fluoroscopy. The surgeons&#xD;
      tried to reproduce the planned position of the implant by checking the distances from the&#xD;
      margin of the implant to the margin of the radius under fluoroscopy. The screw sizes were&#xD;
      determined by intraoperative measurement in reference to the preoperative plan. For the screw&#xD;
      fixation, a guide block was used to insert the distal screws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, preoperative planning was performed using conventional&#xD;
      posterior-anterior and lateral view radiographs. Based on the X-ray image, the plate size was&#xD;
      chosen using the conventional template. After the planning, osteosynthesis was performed&#xD;
      under general anesthesia in the same manner as for the plan group. The surgeries were&#xD;
      performed by several residents and fellows under supervision of a hand surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations The planned sizes of implant were compared with the actual sizes used at&#xD;
      operation in the plan group. The screw holes were numbered from 1 to 8 for the distal (there&#xD;
      were 7 holes in small and medium plates, and 8 holes in a large plate), and from 1 to 3 for&#xD;
      the proximal. The screw lengths actually chosen were recorded according to the screw number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the accuracy of the anatomical reduction, volar tilt and radial inclination of&#xD;
      the post-operative wrists X-ray were compared with those of the healthy side wrist in both&#xD;
      plan and control groups. The posterior-anterior view was obtained with the elbow flexed at&#xD;
      90°, the ulna perpendicular to the humerus, and the forearm in the pronated position. The&#xD;
      lateral view was obtained with the elbow flexed at 90° and adducted against the trunk. The&#xD;
      wrists were in a neutral position with no flexion, extension, or deviation in either view.&#xD;
      Volar tilt was measured on a lateral view. The angle between a line along the distal radial&#xD;
      articular surface and the line perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the radius at the&#xD;
      joint margin was measured as volar tilt. Radial inclination was measured on a&#xD;
      posterior-anterior view. The angle between one line connecting the radial styloid tip and the&#xD;
      ulnar aspect of the distal radius and a second line perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of&#xD;
      the radius was measured as radial inclination. These radiological parameters were measured by&#xD;
      a single hand surgeon. In addition, preoperative planning and postoperative reductions were&#xD;
      compared by measuring the volar tilt and radial inclination of the 3D images in the plan&#xD;
      group (Figure 3). The axis of the radius was adjusted. The angle between a line from the&#xD;
      dorsal edge to the volar edge of the radius and the line perpendicular to the longitudinal&#xD;
      axis of the radius was measured as 3D volar tilt. The angle between a line from the radial&#xD;
      styloid tip to the ulnar aspect of the distal radius and the line perpendicular to the&#xD;
      longitudinal axis of the radius was measured as 3D radial inclination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The results are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation. An intra-class&#xD;
      correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate the accuracy of the anatomical reduction.&#xD;
      The ICC values of the radiological parameters (volar tilt and radial inclination) between&#xD;
      healthy side wrists and injured side wrists after the surgery were evaluated in both the plan&#xD;
      and control groups. In addition, the ICCs of the 3D measurements between the pre-operative&#xD;
      plan and the post-operative 3D images were evaluated in the plan group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the accuracy of the implant choices, the ICCs for the screw lengths between the&#xD;
      preoperative plan and the actual choices were evaluated. According to the previous&#xD;
      recommendation12, ICC less than 0.40 was considered poor reproducibility, between 0.40 and&#xD;
      0.59 was considered moderate, between 0.60 and 0.74 was considered good, and between 0.75 and&#xD;
      1.00 was considered excellent. The differences between preoperative plan and postoperative&#xD;
      reductions, healthy side and injured side after surgery were analyzed using the paired&#xD;
      t-test. P values of &lt;0.05 were considered significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS&#xD;
      version 13.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
