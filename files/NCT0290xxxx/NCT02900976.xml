  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well rituximab and latent membrane protein&#xD;
      (LMP)-specific T-cells work in treating pediatric solid organ recipients with Epstein-Barr&#xD;
      virus-positive, cluster of differentiation (CD)20-positive post-transplant&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disorder. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. LMP-specific T-cells are special immune system&#xD;
      cells trained to recognize proteins found on post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder&#xD;
      tumor cells if they are infected with Epstein-Barr virus. Giving rituximab and LMP-specific&#xD;
      T-cells may work better in treating pediatric organ recipients with post-transplant&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disorder than rituximab alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility of treating pediatric and young adult solid organ transplant&#xD;
      recipients who have newly diagnosed, relapsed or refractory Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive&#xD;
      CD20-positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) with a novel T-cell&#xD;
      therapeutic, allogeneic LMP1/LMP2-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (third party latent&#xD;
      membrane protein [(LMP]-)]-specific T cells), in a cooperative group setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the percentage of eligible patients for whom a suitable LMP-specific T-cell&#xD;
      product derived from a third party LMP-specific T-cell bank is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the response rate (RR) to three doses of rituximab (RTX) as single agent in&#xD;
      children and young adults with newly diagnosed or relapsed EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD&#xD;
      after solid organ transplantation (SOT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the 2-year event-free survival (EFS) of children and young adults with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed, refractory or relapsed EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD after SOT treated with RTX&#xD;
      and/or LMP-specific T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate overall survival (OS) of children and young adults with newly diagnosed,&#xD;
      refractory or relapsed EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD after SOT treated with RTX and/or&#xD;
      LMP-specific T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To estimate the RR to LMP-specific T cells of newly diagnosed (without complete response&#xD;
      to course RTX1), refractory, and relapsed children and young adults with EBV-positive&#xD;
      CD20-positive PTLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) of children and young adults with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed, refractory or relapsed EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD after SOT treated with RTX&#xD;
      and/or LMP-specific T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To describe the toxicity of third party LMP-specific T cells in children and young&#xD;
      adults with newly diagnosed, refractory or relapsed EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD after SOT&#xD;
      treated with RTX and/or LMP-specific T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To validate that absence of EBV viremia correlates with RR, EFS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether third party LMP-specific T cells promote autologous immune&#xD;
      reconstitution of EBV-specific T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether EBV viremia is inversely correlated with an increase in EBV-specific&#xD;
      T cells in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether plasma cytokine profile and changes in cytokines over time&#xD;
      correlate with treatment response or toxicity (e.g. cytokine release syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION (Cohorts A and B): Patients receive rituximab or biosimilar intravenously (IV) on&#xD;
      days 1, 8, 15. Cycle continues for up to 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (RTX, Cohorts A): Patients with newly diagnosed PTLD who achieve a complete response&#xD;
      (CR) after induction receive additional rituximab or biosimilar as in induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (LMP-TC, Cohorts A, B, C): Patients with newly diagnosed PTLD who do not achieve a CR&#xD;
      to induction, all relapsed patients after induction, and all patients with refractory disease&#xD;
      who received rituximab or biosimilar within 90 days according to institutional guidelines,&#xD;
      receive allogeneic LMP1/LMP2-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes IV over 1- 2 minutes on days 0&#xD;
      and 7. Cycle continues for up to 42 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with PR or SD after first cycle of cycle allogeneic&#xD;
      LMP1/LMP2-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes receive an additional course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
