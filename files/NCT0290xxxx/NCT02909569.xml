      This study evaluates the effect of twice daily dose of INCB39110 in the treatment of itch in&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic idiopathic itch accompanies low-grade skin inflammation. These inflammatory features&#xD;
      are associated with cytokine production which signal through the common JAK1-STAT pathway. It&#xD;
      is therefore theorized that a selective JAK1 inhibitor such as INCB039110 may provide relief&#xD;
      of itch symptom.&#xD;
