  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is currently recommended by the World Health Organization for&#xD;
      use as intermittent preventive treatment against malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) in areas of&#xD;
      moderate to high malaria transmission. However, in some locales malaria parasites have lost&#xD;
      sensitivity to SP, compromising its protective effect. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is&#xD;
      a candidate replacement for SP. This trial is designed to confirm the cardio-safety of DP&#xD;
      compared to SP amongst pregnant women in Tanzania.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial hypothesis is that DP will increase the time between the start of the Q wave and&#xD;
      the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle, a phenomenon referred to as QT&#xD;
      prolongation, in the study population. However, if QT prolongation is observed, it is&#xD;
      expected to be time-limited and of no clinical consequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QT interval, measured in milliseconds (MS) will be corrected (QTc) to account for natural&#xD;
      heart rate (HR) extremes. The Fridericia formula will also be used to correct (QTcF) for&#xD;
      variation in cardio-contraction. As part of the electrocardiogram (ECG), the period from the&#xD;
      beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex (PR interval) will be measured,&#xD;
      as well as the ST-segment which connects the QRS complex and the T wave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolongation of the QT interval will be estimated when peak drug-concentrations are most&#xD;
      likely to be found in the peripheral blood as measured using pharmacokinetic (PK) techniques.&#xD;
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods will be used for genetic sequencing of molecular&#xD;
      markers (A581G) associated with malaria parasite drug resistance to SP. The rapid diagnostic&#xD;
      test (RDT) CareStart™ will be used to screen pregnant women attending antenatal care.&#xD;
