  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the eNOS activating agent&#xD;
      triflusal on episodic memory and cognitive functions in participants under chronic stress.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Randomised, placebo controlled, double blind, cross-over design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study outcome is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance in a verbal memory task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main secondary outcomes are: Performance in working memory and cognitive tasks and influence&#xD;
      on mood, depression and anxiety and subjective memory impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once daily oral administration of 600 mg triflusal and placebo mannitol for 8 days in a&#xD;
      cross-over trial with a washout period of at least 14 days between the two periods. Each&#xD;
      participant will take triflusal as well as placebo&#xD;
