  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The age-associated loss of lean mass is a defining parameter of sarcopenia and may lead to&#xD;
      various negative health outcomes such as impairment of physical performance and disability.&#xD;
      Furthermore sarcopenia is considered to be one of the main factors in the pathogenesis of the&#xD;
      frailty syndrome. However, for clinical use and for treatment and prevention strategies,&#xD;
      reliable diagnostic criteria and cutpoints based on clinically relevant thresholds are&#xD;
      indispensable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This topic has recently been addressed by the Foundation for the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health Sarcopenia Project which identified cutpoints for appendicular lean mass (ALM) below&#xD;
      which older adults had a higher likelihood of clinically relevant weakness reflected by low&#xD;
      grip strength. Moreover, a low ALM-to-body mass index (BMI) ratio (&lt;0.789 men and &lt;0.512&#xD;
      women) was found to be associated with increased likelihood for mobility impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the aim of this study is to study the prevalence of sarcopenia in a sample&#xD;
      of community-dwelling frail and pre-frail older adults.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome of SAF study is to assess the prevalence of sarcopenia in frail and pre-frail older adults. The primary endpoint is the sarcopenia diagnostic. In patients with at least one Fried criteria, we would like to detect the number of patient with low lean muscle mass adjusted for body mass index &lt;0.789 for men and &lt;0.512 for women.</description>

    <description>All patients who are enrolled in study with at least one Fried criteria will have a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure lean muscle mass adjusted for body mass index. As part of the usual care in the Frailty Clinic patients will also have a clinical examination, a standard biological sample (requiring 15 ml of blood); an evaluation of the cognitive and functional performances, of their medico-economic situation and lifestyle.</description>
