      Comparison of efficacy of rectal misoprostol for reduction amount of blood loss in women&#xD;
      undergoing myomectomy, both open and laparoscopic approach&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to development of reproductive technology to assist infertile women, rate of&#xD;
      myomectomy increases. During this operation, surgeons would deal with hypervascular masses&#xD;
      with raw surfaces that tend to bleeding. Interventions to diminish bleeding were studied such&#xD;
      as using misoprostol, vasopressin, transamenic acid along with mechanical intervention such&#xD;
      as tourniquet and uterine artery ligation. But in Rajavithi hospital, such procedures aren't&#xD;
      generally used because of fewer cases and also lacks of supporting data. Misoprostol, used in&#xD;
      gynecologic patients for a long time with a wide safety margin acts at prostaglandin&#xD;
      receptors of myometrium to stimulate contraction that constricts uterine vessels that lead to&#xD;
      decreasing amount of bleeding during the operation. This led to the experimental study of&#xD;
      rectal misoprostol administered at 15 - 30 minutes prior the operation to decrease blood loss&#xD;
      and also blood transfusion rates. Our study also gather data about adverse effect that&#xD;
      subject experienced after drug administration.&#xD;
