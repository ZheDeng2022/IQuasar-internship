      A national database is being set-up to collate clinical outcome information before and after&#xD;
      children undergo Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR). SDR is a surgical procedure that has been&#xD;
      used for many years but has not been routinely available within the United Kingdom National&#xD;
      Health Service (NHS). The SDR procedure is used to improve spasticity in children with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy and involves dividing some of the nerve fibres running from the muscles back&#xD;
      to the spinal cord. While it is believed that SDR is effective, there are no definitive data.&#xD;
      In July 2014 NHS England commissioned five NHS Trusts to undertake SDR surgery in eligible&#xD;
      children for a two-year period, and to collect detailed information on their outcomes. The&#xD;
      proposed database will aggregate these data from the five centres and analyse them to provide&#xD;
      overall evidence on the clinical effectiveness of SDR. This information will be used to&#xD;
      inform future commissioning decisions. The database has been developed by the King's&#xD;
      Technology Evaluation Centre (KiTEC) in conjunction with NHS England and the national&#xD;
      clinical SDR steering committee and its data subcommittee. KiTEC undertakes research&#xD;
      evaluations for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and has been&#xD;
      commissioned by NICE to undertake this work. Clinicians in the SDR data subgroup have liaised&#xD;
      closely with KiTEC to agree which data to collect so that it the least amount needed and will&#xD;
      be in a standardised format across all centres. When all two-year outcome data are recorded,&#xD;
      KiTEC will analyse the data and present a report to NHS England, NICE and the SDR steering&#xD;
      committee and data sub-group. While there are no firm plans to follow the children beyond two&#xD;
      years post-surgery, all parties involved are hoping that further funding can be obtained to&#xD;
      continue following these children up as these data will be unique.&#xD;

      Disease overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral Palsy is an all-encompassing term for numerous neurological conditions caused by&#xD;
      problems in the brain and nervous system. More specifically, cerebral palsy is related to&#xD;
      problems in muscle movement, which result in abnormalities in walking, posture, and balance.&#xD;
      Other important functions can also be affected, such as language/communication, learning, and&#xD;
      vision. There is currently no cure for cerebral palsy; however, there are several treatment&#xD;
      options that can aid alleviation of symptoms and improve quality of life. The selection of&#xD;
      appropriate treatment(s) for each child requires input from a multi-disciplinary team of&#xD;
      health professionals, such as paediatricians, social workers, physiotherapists, speech and&#xD;
      language therapists, occupational therapists, neurologists and surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidance related to&#xD;
      treatment options for cerebral palsy in 2012 (CG145). One of the treatment options discussed&#xD;
      was Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR). SDR is an irreversible surgical procedure, which&#xD;
      involves the division of some of the sensory nerves of the spinal cord in order to reduce&#xD;
      sensory input to the sensory-motor reflex arcs. Intensive physiotherapy is required SDR post&#xD;
      surgery for up to 24 months to achieve the outcome goals of improvement in muscle function,&#xD;
      tone, and quality of life. NICE CG145 recommends consideration of SDR in children with a&#xD;
      GMFCS level II or III. This recommendation was based on a review of evidence evaluation,&#xD;
      which concluded that there was reasonable evidence that SDR combined with appropriate&#xD;
      post-operative treatment can result in significant improvements in motor function and quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current project is being commissioned by NICE to support NHS England in its&#xD;
      Commissioning through Evaluation (CTE) approach. CTE was launched in September 2013 and&#xD;
      involves funding medical treatments and technologies not routinely commissioned within the&#xD;
      NHS. SDR is one such procedure which was selected for CTE, with the aim of evaluating the&#xD;
      'outcome of SDR and demonstrate improvement in function after SDR at 6 months that is&#xD;
      maintained or improved at 12 months and two years post operation'. As part of this programme,&#xD;
      NICE commissioned, in early 2014, a data collection and register development service from one&#xD;
      of its External Assessment Centres (EACs): King's Imaging Technology Evaluation Centre&#xD;
      (KiTEC). The key objective of the KiTEC EAC is to collect SDR related data that will inform&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness and other outcomes of interest to NHS England in making its&#xD;
      commissioning plans and addressing the following research question from section 4.5 of CG145:&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Does selective dorsal rhizotomy followed by intensive rehabilitation performed between the&#xD;
      ages of 3 and 9 years in children who are at GMFCS level II or III result in good community&#xD;
      mobility as a young adult?'&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-centre national database (register) project to obtain the evidence related to&#xD;
      SDR that will address the research question in section 4.5 of CG145 and inform clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness and other outcomes of interest to NHS England. All patients will undergo&#xD;
      pre-assessment prior to undergoing SDR. This varies between centres, and can be anywhere from&#xD;
      6 months prior to SDR. Hospital admission for SDR usually is between 1-2 weeks. Post-SDR&#xD;
      follow-up will be conducted up to two years for the purposes of this project. All patients'&#xD;
      will followed up to two years post-SDR by members of the relevant clinical team. Post-SDR&#xD;
      discharge there will be three main data collection points for the purposes of this project:&#xD;
      6, 12 and 24 months post-SDR. Patient data will be collected at various time-points, as&#xD;
      agreed between the EAC and various SDR subgroup members. Pre-assessments may be split into&#xD;
      more than one appointment, depending on the particular patient care pathway at each&#xD;
      participating centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of patients will be approached by the SDR clinical team when they attend for their&#xD;
      first pre-SDR clinic visit. It will be explained to the parents and children that their&#xD;
      hospital will be making clinical assessments before and after SDR to enable them to provide&#xD;
      optimum care and to evaluate the success of the operation and post-operative rehabilitation.&#xD;
      These assessments along with patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life assessments,&#xD;
      will be standardised across all five commissioned hospitals. The parents and children will be&#xD;
      asked for permission to add their data to the national database to facilitate aggregation of&#xD;
      results across the United Kingdom (UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study information sheets will be provided. If they agree to take part, parents will sign a&#xD;
      consent form at the 2nd pre-SDR visit. This will allow time for them to consider whether or&#xD;
      not they wish to take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centre and Subject Compliance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centre compliance refers to all centres providing the agreed standardised dataset and input&#xD;
      into the standardised database as per the CTE selection criteria. The EAC will regularly&#xD;
      monitor Centre compliance in liaison with NHS England and include tables of compliance in the&#xD;
      project report. The project report (with potential for interim analysis) will include tables&#xD;
      on the number of eligible patients that were referred for treatment through the&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary team process and consented to part of the database as well as those that&#xD;
      were actually registered in the SDR database. The project report (with potential for interim&#xD;
      analysis) will list the percentage of missing data in each of the clinical domains and&#xD;
      differentiate between baseline and follow-up variables. Depending on the stage of the&#xD;
      database a table depicting the number of children that have been lost to follow up will be&#xD;
      included in the project report or in potential interim analyses reports. The SDR centres will&#xD;
      be given regular reports on the quality of their data in terms of missing variables and&#xD;
      possible outliers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EAC statisticians will carry out all analyses. All data obtained will be analysed at&#xD;
      regular specified time points to inform ongoing assessment of the clinical effectiveness,&#xD;
      relevant outcomes and assessment of the overall research question.The SDR database is&#xD;
      expected to have small numbers, in the region of up to n=120 a year in England. A range of&#xD;
      clinical and patient-reported outcomes will be recorded and there will be no single primary&#xD;
      or secondary outcome. Rather the aim is to describe and quantify the changes in a number of&#xD;
      important clinical domains such as spasticity, function, range of motion, gait and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the database constitutes research involving human subjects, the following ethical&#xD;
      considerations arise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parental consent will be required to add the child's data to the national database and&#xD;
           patient information sheets (PIS) have been developed for both children and parents of&#xD;
           potential children at the designated SDR centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only the minimum number of data items needed to meet the objectives of the database and&#xD;
           comply with ethical and regulatory requirements will be included in the final dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children's confidentiality will be protected during data collection and handling thus&#xD;
           reducing the risk of disclosure.&#xD;
