  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controlled exercise training is a valuable therapeutic addition to pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      in most patients with chronic heart failure, reducing long-term mortality, preventing cardiac&#xD;
      remodeling and improving functional capacity. Despite the mechanism underlying its benefits&#xD;
      might be multifactorial, a sustained improvement in autonomic balance is usually attributed&#xD;
      as a major effect. Nevertheless, not all eligible subjects show the same response to&#xD;
      exercise, probably due to several differences in the subpopulations enrolled. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that some Heart Rate Variability indexes could be valid tools to&#xD;
      optimize the selection and follow-up of chronic heart failure patients to training&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty subjects followed in a University Heart Failure Management Program were prospectively&#xD;
      included. All patients were evaluated before the randomization and after 24 weeks from&#xD;
      enrollment. The investigators performed a detailed anamnesis and complete physical&#xD;
      examination, Doppler echocardiography, Stress Testing, 6-minute walk test, heart rate&#xD;
      variability analysis, and quality of life test. Patients were randomized either to a training&#xD;
      group: performing a supervised training program, or a control group receiving usual care. All&#xD;
      patients received an optimal pharmacologic treatment including diuretics, angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-adrenergic blocking&#xD;
      agents. All patients included in the training group attended a supervised program 3-days/week&#xD;
      during 24 weeks (68-74 sessions). Physical aerobic training appears to impart beneficial&#xD;
      changes in autonomic control of patients with chronic heart failure through both&#xD;
      parasympathetic and sympathetic control of hear rate. These effects produce changes in&#xD;
      several Heart Rate Variability indices as HF and rMSSD related with parasympathetic tone.&#xD;

    <description>Exercise Training program on a 3-days/week basis during 24 weeks (68-74 sessions). Each session started with a 10-min warm-up walking period followed by 20-min of breathing exercises and free non-resistance movements of limbs. This stage was followed by pedaling during 20-minutes at a circuit resistance training protocol using a stationary cycle-ergometer. Each session ended with a cool down period (5-minutes) including diverse stretching maneuvers of engaged muscle groups. The initial bicycle-ergometer workload (WL) was defined as 50% of the maximum achieved in the previous stress testing</description>
