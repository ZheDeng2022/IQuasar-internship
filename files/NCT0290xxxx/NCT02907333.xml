  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who are diagnosed with CIN2 and who have a pregnancy wish are followed up 6 months&#xD;
      after the diagnosis with new examinations. The regression rate is based solely on the woman's&#xD;
      own ability to clear the cervical lesions. The use of condoms has shown a relatively good&#xD;
      protective effect against Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection. It has furthermore been&#xD;
      indicated that condoms increase the regression rate of cervical lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that the regression rate of cervical intraepithelial&#xD;
      neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) increases when condoms are used consistently in the follow-up period&#xD;
      of 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Use of condoms has shown a considerable protective effect, when used correctly and&#xD;
      consistently, against several sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HIV virus,&#xD;
      trichomoniasis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. It has been indicated that use of condoms also&#xD;
      offers a relatively good protection against HPV infections. It is furthermore indicated that&#xD;
      use of condoms in women with CIN may increase the regression rate of these lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine if advising women to use condoms&#xD;
      during the follow-up period after a CIN2 diagnosis will increase the regression rate. The&#xD;
      advice is based on the presumption that condom use will prevent HPV-infection and reinfection&#xD;
      to some extent and thereby allow the immune system to clear the HPV-infection and &quot;repair&quot;&#xD;
      the CIN-lesion. Based on the literature, we expect regression in non-condom users to be&#xD;
      around 22% and regression in condom-users to be 2.5 times larger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial will be conducted as a randomized non-blinded controlled trial. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted at hospital- and gynecological outpatient clinics in Central Region Denmark&#xD;
      and Region Zealand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gynaecologists will obtain oral and written consent from women with an abnormal cytology&#xD;
      to allow the project physician to contact them by telephone. The written consent will be&#xD;
      compared to a list from the national pathology register for all diagnosed CIN2 in the&#xD;
      relevant regions. If there is a match between the two documents, the gynecologists will be&#xD;
      contacted to find out if the woman has been informed about the biopsy result and a follow-up&#xD;
      after 6 months has been decided. If this is the case, the woman will be included in the study&#xD;
      and randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect 700 women to be randomized into an intervention- and a control arm. Women in the&#xD;
      intervention arm will receive information about the project by telephone by the project&#xD;
      physician. The intervention arm will thereafter be subdivided into a condom group and a&#xD;
      non-condom group based on the women's acceptance of the intervention. Women in the condom&#xD;
      group will be provided with free condoms for the entire study period. The project physician&#xD;
      will not contact women in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the routine samples taken at the first visit and at the follow-up examination, an HPV&#xD;
      test will be requested from the pathology departments for the women in the condom group. The&#xD;
      women are also asked to fill out a questionnaire at the follow-up. The information from the&#xD;
      questionnaire is used to estimate compliance to the condom use and to have background&#xD;
      information about the women in the condom group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is approved by the Data Protection Agency and the Ethical Committee of the Capital&#xD;
      Region of Denmark. The total period of time in which the trial is planned to include women is&#xD;
      one year having the last woman to her follow-up visit 18 months after the beginning of the&#xD;
      trial. The inclusion period is expected to commence 15.09.16 and end 15.09.17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be conducted electronically by the statistician of the department but&#xD;
      neither the investigator nor the patient will be blinded as it is not possible for this study&#xD;
      design. Data for the study will be collected from registers and from the questionnaires. All&#xD;
      final results from the study will be published in relevant international journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is supported by funds and we have received a sponsorship for condoms. The&#xD;
      sponsors had no influence on the study design, and will have no influence on the data&#xD;
      collection, analysis and reporting.&#xD;

    <description>Difference in regression of CIN2 between the intervention- and control group. Regression is defined as less than CIN2 diagnosis at the 6 months follow-up. For the primary outcome an intention-to-treat analysis will be performed when comparing the intervention group with the control group. Furthermore two per-protocol analysis will be performed. One defining the per-protocol group as those who agreed to use condoms and one defining the per-protocol group who retrospectively reported to use the condoms. Both analysis will be made with control for selection bias.</description>
