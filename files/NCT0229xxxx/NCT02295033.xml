      Radiation therapy may kill any tumor cells remaining after surgery. This randomized phase III&#xD;
      trial is studying the effect of an extra dose of radiation therapy (Boost dose) after breast&#xD;
      conserving surgery and 50 Gy adjuvant external beam radiotherapy to see how well it works&#xD;
      compared to no further therapy in treating women with early breast cancer that has been&#xD;
      surgically removed.&#xD;

      This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by participating institution, menopausal&#xD;
      status, clinical tumor size, nodal status, presence of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, age, and&#xD;
      resection margin status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to assess the local recurrence rate and the cosmetic result in&#xD;
      women who have had conservative resection of small breast cancers and who are randomly&#xD;
      assigned after postoperative whole-breast irradiation to no boost vs. 15-16 Gy boost&#xD;
      (patients with microscopically complete resections) or 10 Gy vs. 25-26 Gy boost (patients&#xD;
      with microscopically incomplete resections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following tumorectomy, all patients receive radiotherapy for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with microscopically negative resection margins are randomized to one of 2 groups:&#xD;
      no further radiotherapy; or a radiotherapy boost with either external-beam radiotherapy or an&#xD;
      interstitial implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with microscopically positive resection margins are also randomized to receive&#xD;
      either lower dose or higher dose radiotherapy boosts by external beam or interstitial&#xD;
      implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with positive lymph nodes are encouraged to receive at least 6 courses of adjuvant&#xD;
      or perioperative chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy provided radiotherapy is initiated within&#xD;
      6 months of surgery. All other patients begin radiotherapy within 9 weeks of surgery. All&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with positive lymph nodes receive oral tamoxifen daily for 2 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically documented invasive adenocarcinoma (any subtype) of the breast with&#xD;

             postmenopausal patients (Irradiation of clinically negative axilla is an acceptable&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Residual microcalcification on postoperative mammogram&#xD;
&#xD;

             disease after first surgical procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Multiple foci of tumor in more than 1 quadrant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous or concurrent malignant tumor in contralateral breast&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In situ carcinoma of the breast, without invasive tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumorectomy performed more than 9 weeks before the start of radiotherapy in cases&#xD;
             where no adjuvant chemotherapy is given and more than 6 months before the start of&#xD;
             radiotherapy if chemotherapy is given&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous history of malignant disease, except adequately treated carcinoma in situ of&#xD;
             the cervix or basal cell carcinoma of the skin&#xD;
