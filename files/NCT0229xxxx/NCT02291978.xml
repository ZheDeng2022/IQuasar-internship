  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this protocol is to assess the ExAblate 2100 MR guided high intensity&#xD;
      focused ultrasound device as an intervention for treatment of facetogenic lower back pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single group, single arm, open/nonblinded, non-randomized study. The primary&#xD;
      outcomes are safety and preliminary efficacy. The InSightec ExAblate 2100 MRgHIFU system is a&#xD;
      non-invasive thermal ablation device fully integrated with an MR imaging system and used for&#xD;
      the ablation of soft tissue and bone.The study will reach primary completion 12 months from&#xD;
      the time the study opens to accrual.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men and women &gt; 21 years of age and who are skeletally mature&#xD;

             document and able to attend all study visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with at least 6 months of chronic lower back pain (LBP) localized to the&#xD;
             midline or axial low back, with symptoms attributed to the facet joints on physical&#xD;
             examination that have persisted despite conservative therapy. Conservative therapy is&#xD;
             defined as systemic pain medications and anti-inflammatory medications, as well as&#xD;
             physical therapy, such as massage, heating, hydrotherapy, and strengthening exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with Numerical Rating Scale worst lumbar back pain score of at least 4 out of&#xD;
             10 over the 24 hours preceding the time of rating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have chronic LBP attributed to facet joints as demonstrated by MRI&#xD;
             consistent with at least grade 2 facet joint arthritis, with corresponding abnormal&#xD;
             activity at the facet joint on 18F-sodium fluoride PET-CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have an analgesic response to either prior local anesthetic injection to&#xD;
             the facet joint or to radiofrequency ablation of the facet joint, with relapse of&#xD;
