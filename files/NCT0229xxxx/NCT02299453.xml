  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial is testing if telephone-administered interpersonal&#xD;
      psychotherapy (IPT) can reduce depression in rural persons living with HIV/AIDS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to their urban counterparts, HIV-rural persons are more likely to be diagnosed with&#xD;
      depression, less likely to seek assistance from mental health professionals, and appear to&#xD;
      have shorter periods of survival. This application responds to PA-07-103 (&quot;Research on Rural&#xD;
      Mental Health and Drug Abuse Disorders&quot;) and the PA's stated need for research that will&#xD;
      &quot;Study whether individuals with various mental disorders can be treated effectively via&#xD;
      telemedicine.&quot; A pilot RCT recently completed by our team showed that a 6-session&#xD;
      telephone-delivered, interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) intervention reduced depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in 79 HIV- infected rural persons (Ransom, Heckman, et al., 2008, Psychiatric&#xD;
      Services). This follow-up RCT will enroll 180 persons living with HIV/AIDS in rural counties&#xD;
      in the United States who are diagnosed with depression via telephone interviews. Participants&#xD;
      will complete self-administered surveys at pre-intervention, post- intervention, and 4- and&#xD;
      8-month follow-up that assess depressive symptoms (the primary outcome measure),&#xD;
      interpersonal problems, social support, and ART adherence. Participants will also provide&#xD;
      weekly data (for 41 weeks) via interactive voice response (IVR) systems that assess&#xD;
      depressive symptoms (41 weeks) and therapeutic alliance (9 weeks). Ninety (n=90) participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to a 9-session, one-on- one, telephone-delivered, IPT intervention&#xD;
      and 90 will be assigned to a usual care comparison group. Linear mixed models (LMM) will test&#xD;
      if IPT participants report greater reductions in depressive symptoms compared to usual care&#xD;
      controls. Analyses of reliable change will test if a greater proportion of IPT participants&#xD;
      report clinically-significant reductions in depressive symptoms compared to usual care&#xD;
      controls. Using weekly data collected via IVR systems, time series analyses will test if IPT&#xD;
      participants report greater decreases in depressive symptoms over a 41-week follow-up period&#xD;
      compared to usual care control. Mixed models analyses will assess the importance of&#xD;
      therapeutic alliance in telephone-delivered IPT. Public Health Significance: This study will&#xD;
      test if nine sessions of telephone-administered interpersonal psychotherapy can reduce&#xD;
      depressive symptoms in HIV-infected rural persons, a group that is increasing in size and&#xD;
      that experiences great difficulty accessing mental health support services.&#xD;

    <description>Self-administered surveys. Pre-intervention surveys are administered one week before therapy is initiated. Post-intervention surveys are administered one week after completing the 9 week therapy. Four-month follow-ups occur 4 months after the last therapy session and 8-month follow-ups are completed 8 months after the final therapy session. Control participants complete all four measures with their time-matched experimental participant.</description>
