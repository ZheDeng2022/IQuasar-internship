  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abnormal PI3K-Akt-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway signaling and autocrine&#xD;
      activation of the mTOR pathway, mediated through insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), has&#xD;
      been implicated in the proliferation of pNET ( primitive neuroectodermal tumor) cells.&#xD;
      Everolimus ,an mTOR inhibitor (a central regulator of growth/proliferation, cellular&#xD;
      metabolism and angiogenesis) has shown antitumor benefit in pNETs alone and in combination&#xD;
      with Octreotide LAR in RADIANT-1 and RADIANT-3 studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite EVE-based phase II/III trials improve progression-free survival (PFS) for pNETs, they&#xD;
      are limited to significantly prolong overall survival (OS). Metformin has recently shown some&#xD;
      anti-cancer activity, both in vitro and in vivo studies by antisecretory properties to&#xD;
      decrease insulin and IGF1 levels; and by antitumor effect due to AMPK (adenosine&#xD;
      monophosphate kinase) activation and consequently inhibition to TSC1(tuberous sclerosis&#xD;
      complex 1) -2/mTOR complex, mediated to LKB1 oncogene expression. The investigators&#xD;
      retrospective experience, despite in a limited group of pWDNET, highlights the role of MET to&#xD;
      improve clinical benefit in diabetic pts receiving EVE-OCT (octreotide) combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the antiproliferative potential of MET in combination with EVE&#xD;
      and OCT in pWDNETs. MetNET1 prospective trial (EudraCT 2014-000888-41) may be helpful to&#xD;
      either confirm or discard these preliminary findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate progression free survival rate at 12 months&#xD;
      of treatment. The secondary objectives are safety, overall survival, response rate&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sub-study analysis will evaluate circulant biomarkers levels (IL 6, IGF1) in blood samples.&#xD;
