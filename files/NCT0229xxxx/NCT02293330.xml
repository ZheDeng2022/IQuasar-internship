  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is developed to determine if the local anaesthetic dose can be reduced by the use&#xD;
      of intermittent bolus technique compared to continuous infusion when the nerve catheter is&#xD;
      placed underneath the paraneurium by ultrasound guidance in the popliteal fossa. Our primary&#xD;
      outcome is local anesthetic use the first 48 hours after connecting the peripheral nerve&#xD;
      catheter. Our hypothesis is that with an intermittent bolus less local anaesthetic is&#xD;
      necessary the first postoperative 48 hours after surgery for adequate postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia. As secondary outcomes the investigators study pain scores, motor block, sensory&#xD;
      block, feeling of numbness, patient satisfaction, sleep quality and rescue analgesia during&#xD;
      the nerve block and afterwards.&#xD;

      Patients scheduled for foot surgery under general anaesthesia and a popliteal nerve catheter&#xD;
      will be asked to take part and give informed consent. The anaesthesiologist performing the&#xD;
      block, the patient and the independent observer will be blinded to the study group and the&#xD;
      settings of the pump (CADD®-Solis) will be regulated and the data collected after 48 hours by&#xD;
      an independent pain nurse or anaesthetist who is aware of the study group but does not&#xD;
      register any other parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised by a computer-generated sequence, concealed by sealed envelopes.&#xD;
      The envelope will be opened and the pump prepared by an independent pain nurse or&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist who will not participate in registration of the parameters except&#xD;
      extracting information out of the pump when the catheter is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to detect a 20 % increase in local anaesthetic dose for the continuous&#xD;
      administration group (230 mg/48 hour). We used a standard deviation of 25%(58 mg) from a&#xD;
      previous study. The minimum sample size required is 20 patients per group for a power of 80%&#xD;
      with a 2-tailed significance level of 5%. We decided to include 25 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      An IV access and standard monitoring is used throughout the procedure. A pre puncture scan&#xD;
      will be performed and an experienced anaesthesiologist will perform all blocks. The block is&#xD;
      performed in the lateral decubitus with a 12-18 MHz (megahertz) linear probe (BK medical®)&#xD;
      and a solo long needle-catheter set (Pajunk®,18 gauge needle, 20 gauge catheter). The nerve&#xD;
      will be visualised in a short axis image and the puncture will be done out of plane.&#xD;
      Confirmation of accurate needle tip position will be confirmed by injection of nacl 0,9%&#xD;
      (sodium chloride) and the appearance of a &quot;twin- or triple halo sign&quot;. After confirmation of&#xD;
      correct needle tip position 15 ml levobupivacaine 0,25% (chirocaine® Abbot)will be injected&#xD;
      in between de peroneal and tibial nerve as an initial bolus. After injection a will be&#xD;
      advanced 4 cm beyond the needle tip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correct catheter placement will be confirmed by ultrasound. A detailed description of block&#xD;
      performance will be registered according to our standard hospital policy. The sensory block&#xD;
      of the peroneal and tibial nerve will be separately tested by loss of cold sensation before&#xD;
      transfer to the operating room, at least 20 minutes after the initial injection of lidocaine.&#xD;
      When no block is detected it is considered as a block failure and the patient will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After performing the popliteal block the patients will be transferred to the operating room&#xD;
      and receive general anaesthesia by an independent anaesthesiologist. Surgery will be&#xD;
      performed with a tourniquet at 300 mm Hg. Standard monitoring is used during surgery (ecg,&#xD;
      pulse oximetry and non invasive blood pressure measurement). Duration of surgery will be&#xD;
      registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the operation the patient will be transferred to the recovery room. Here the popliteal&#xD;
      catheter will be connected pain pump (which will be defined as t=0) with an infusion protocol&#xD;
      according to the study group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      C group: continuous infusion of levobupivacaine 0,125% (chirocaine ®, Abbot) B group:&#xD;
      Intermittent bolus of levobupivacaine 0,125 ( chirocaine®Abbot) Both groups will have the&#xD;
      possibility of administering a pca (patient controlled analgesia) bolus of 6 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pump (CADD®-Solis Smiths medical) which will be started in the recovery room by an&#xD;
      independent pain nurse or anaesthetist who is aware of the appointed study group (C group or&#xD;
      B group). Pain scores ,motor block,sensory block and presence of numbness will be registered&#xD;
      when the patient is awake enough to evaluate these parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then be transferred to the ward after clear instructions of how to use the&#xD;
      pain pump.The study will continue until 48 hours after starting the pump. Pain scores will be&#xD;
      registered every four hours at the ward as well as feeling of numbness and sleep quality at&#xD;
      regular intervals. During night hours (00-06)when the patient is sleeping pain scores will be&#xD;
      registered as &quot;S&quot;.When pain control is insufficient at the PACU or on the ward patients will&#xD;
      receive paracetamol 1gr IV(Paracetamol® )and ketorolac (taradyal®) 30 mg IV. Tramadol (&#xD;
      contramal ®) 2 mg/kg will be given as rescue analgesia. On day one rescue analgesia will be&#xD;
      provided orally .&#xD;
&#xD;
      All rescue analgesia or other medication will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      48 hours after starting the pain pump the pump will be removed and all data will be collected&#xD;
      and filed by an independent pain nurse or anaesthetist. This file will consist of a detailed&#xD;
      description of the history of local anaesthetic administered, including total anaesthetic&#xD;
      dose at 6,12,24 and 48 hours , frequency of extra boluses required and time intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before removing the nerve catheter the depth of the catheter is checked and bolus of nacl&#xD;
      will be infused under ultrasound guidance and if possible correct placement can be confirmed&#xD;
      after two days. Then the catheter will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After stopping the pump the patient will be asked if he or she was satisfied by the&#xD;
      postoperative analgesic technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Satisfied&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sufficient&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Not satisfied&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is discharged but is asked to register the exact time point when sensation and&#xD;
      motor function (when a motor block was present) after catheter removal appeared. The patient&#xD;
      will be called two days after discharge to register these parameters.&#xD;
