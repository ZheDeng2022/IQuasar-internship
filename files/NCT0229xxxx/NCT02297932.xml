  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity and exercise interventions in multiple sclerosis (MS) have received great&#xD;
      attention most recently and there exists several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) addressing&#xD;
      the outcomes associated with such intervention. The majority of such interventions have&#xD;
      primarily focused on directly influencing disease processes (e.g., inflammation, neurotrophic&#xD;
      factors), the reduction of symptoms (e.g., fatigue, depression), improvement in physical&#xD;
      functioning (e.g., gait, strength) or enhancing one's quality of life. To date, the evidence&#xD;
      suggests that exercise intervention in MS holds anywhere from minimal to great promise&#xD;
      depending on the outcome of interest. For some outcomes such as depression or cognition,&#xD;
      findings are even less optimistic, being null, or inconsistent, at best. These inconsistent&#xD;
      findings may be attributed to methodological issues such as use of subjective reports, lack&#xD;
      of appropriate control group, poor compliance, and sample selection. The proposed&#xD;
      investigation aims to address some of these issues by: (1) Obtaining objective measures of&#xD;
      outcomes of interest (i.e., fatigue, cognition, and participation/activities of daily living&#xD;
      [ADLs]) and; (2) assessing certain person-specific factors (e.g., personality) and&#xD;
      intermediary factors that may be influenced by physical activity and indirectly result in&#xD;
      improved outcomes (e.g., improvement in sleep and subsequent improvement in fatigue and/or&#xD;
      cognition). Thus, the primary objective of the proposed investigation is to: (1) utilize&#xD;
      innovative and objective measures of outcomes and; (2) obtain comprehensive assessment of&#xD;
      intermediary variables (e.g., sleep) or person-specific characteristics (e.g., personality),&#xD;
      which together may explain the inconsistent findings in the literature and has the following&#xD;
      specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve these goals, individuals will complete a comprehensive assessment of cognition,&#xD;
      person-specific factors, intermediary factors, physical fitness, and functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) prior to and following a home based exercise intervention.&#xD;

      PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Specific Aims Specific Aim 1: Utilize innovative and objective&#xD;
      measures/techniques (i.e., brain imaging, structured clinical interviews, performance based&#xD;
      assessment of functional activity) to examine the effects of physical activity on fatigue,&#xD;
      cognition, and participation/activities of daily living (ADLs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Obtain preliminary data to identify factors that may explain the&#xD;
      inconsistencies in the literature pertaining to effects of physical activity on fatigue,&#xD;
      cognition, and participation/ADLs. Specifically, intermediary factors may include sleep&#xD;
      quality, depression, pain, and self-efficacy, which may be affected by the intervention and&#xD;
      subsequently influence outcomes. Other potential factors that are independent of the&#xD;
      intervention may include person-specific, baseline characteristics such as personality, trait&#xD;
      anxiety, motivation, health beliefs and engagement in health-related behaviors, and certain&#xD;
      demographics and disease variables (e.g., age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either the strength training or stretching&#xD;
      group based on an a priori randomization scheme. All participants will complete pre and post&#xD;
      assessments consisting of subjective and objective measures of fatigue, cognition, &amp;&#xD;
      participation/ADLs (Per Specific Aim 1). Additionally baseline physical functioning measures&#xD;
      will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue Measures: Briefly, all imaging data for the study will be obtained using a 3.0 T&#xD;
      Siemens Allegra scanner. The following anatomical images will be obtained: MPRAGE and&#xD;
      localizer. fMRI will be performed during the performance of a cognitively fatiguing task&#xD;
      (Modified SDMT [mSDMT]) during which the subject will be asked throughout the task to report&#xD;
      on a scale of 0-100 how cognitively fatigued they feel &quot;right now, at this moment.&quot; These&#xD;
      ratings will then be used as an amplitude modulated regressor to determine where in the brain&#xD;
      increased fatigue is associated with increased brain activity. Once this neural network is&#xD;
      identified, we can compared the activation observed following the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. The intervention will consist of a Home-based Resistance Training Intervention.&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the home-based progressive resistance training (PRT) condition and&#xD;
      will be provided with a training manual, an exercise log book, and resistance training&#xD;
      equipment. The training manual will consist of a detailed description of the exercises to be&#xD;
      performed and how to progress over 6-months. The exercise logbook will allow participants to&#xD;
      provide a detailed recording of each training session. Home-based PRT equipment will consist&#xD;
      of elastic bands (Thera-BandÂ®, Hygenic Corporation, Akron, OH) and weighted vests. This&#xD;
      equipment has been used successfully in supervised and home-based PRT interventions which&#xD;
      have improved strength, function, and health-related outcomes in clinical populations,&#xD;
      particularly older adults. Participants will be involved in an initial training session at&#xD;
      Kessler Foundation (KF) to learn how to perform the exercise program including demonstration&#xD;
      and practice of exercise techniques, use of training equipment, and how to monitor and record&#xD;
      training progress. Four follow-up visits to KF will occur throughout the 4-month program to&#xD;
      provide participants with individualized feedback and training progressions. The home-based&#xD;
      PRT program is based on the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for&#xD;
      prescription of resistance training, as well as previous PRT programs in persons with MS.&#xD;
      This prescription is further consistent with recently developed evidence-based guidelines for&#xD;
      physical activity for persons with MS. The prescription will consist of 3 weekly sessions of&#xD;
      1-3 sets, 8-12 repetitions of 10 exercises targeting lower body, upper body, and core muscle&#xD;
      groups. The 10 exercises will include lunges, chair raises/squats, calf raises, knee flexion,&#xD;
      knee extension, shoulder row, shoulder lateral raise, elbow flexion, elbow extension, and&#xD;
      abdominal curls. The intensity of the training program will be prescribed based on the type&#xD;
      or color of elastic band used and the amount of weight in the weighted vest, and is based on&#xD;
      previous studies using these modalities.Five colors of elastic bands will be used which vary&#xD;
      in level of resistance or difficulty (i.e., yellow &lt; red &lt; green &lt; blue &lt; black).&#xD;
      Participants will begin with the yellow band and progress following the described color band&#xD;
      progression. The amount of weight added to the weighted vest will be determined as a percent&#xD;
      of each individual's body weight. The initial weight in the vest will be set as 0.5% of body&#xD;
      weight. Vest weight progression will occur by adding 0.5 to 1.5% of body weight every 2 weeks&#xD;
      for the first 12 weeks of the program. During the second half of the program, vest weight&#xD;
      progression will occur by adding 0.05 to 1.0% of body weight every 2 weeks. At each follow-up&#xD;
      training session, body weight will be re-assessed to ensure accurate training progression.&#xD;
      Other progressions throughout the program will include increasing the number of sets and&#xD;
      repetitions, and increasing the level of difficulty of the exercises (e.g., changing exercise&#xD;
      position from sitting to standing). Individualized feedback and progress with the program&#xD;
      will be provided during one-on-one phone chat sessions. This will provide participants with&#xD;
      the opportunity to modify and adapt their goals as they progress through the program with the&#xD;
      ultimate goal of developing the skills necessary to independently monitor and change their&#xD;
      behavior. The behavioral content will be delivered through text-based materials and&#xD;
      one-on-one phone chat sessions with a member of the research team not involved in outcome&#xD;
      assessments. Text-based materials will be provided at the initial training session including&#xD;
      the training manual, exercise log book, and information on self-monitoring and setting goals&#xD;
      for the PRT program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison Group. Individuals in the stretching condition will participate in a four month&#xD;
      home-based stretching program developed by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS).&#xD;
      They will be provided text-based materials and asked to provide a weekly log book. In efforts&#xD;
      to equate the attention received, individuals will come to KF at the same frequency as those&#xD;
      receiving the PRT intervention and will also engage in the same number of chat sessions to&#xD;
      assess their adherence to the program.&#xD;
