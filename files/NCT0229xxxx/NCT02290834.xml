      This research study evaluates the effect of chemotherapy on cognition (thinking) and the&#xD;
      brain in people with breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This study is being done to study effects of chemotherapy (cancer treatment) on the&#xD;
           brain and cognition (thinking). &quot;Chemo-brain&quot; is a term sometimes used to refer to&#xD;
           effects of chemotherapy on the brain and cognition (thinking).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study is being done to test for &quot;chemo-brain&quot; in older adults with breast cancer&#xD;
           treated with chemotherapy, and to identify people who are most likely to be affected.&#xD;
           The investigators will look at thinking abilities and brain images before and after&#xD;
           chemotherapy to see if it can help identify people at risk for cognitive side effects of&#xD;
           the treatment, and to better understand effects of treatment on brain structure and&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators are looking for participants who have either been recently recently&#xD;
           diagnosed breast cancer participant or a healthy volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is involved in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Memory and Thinking Tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Imaging: Either MRI/or MRI and PET Scans&#xD;
