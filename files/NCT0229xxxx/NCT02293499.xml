    <textblock>
      Asthma is a serious chronic health condition particularly in inner-city adolescents, who&#xD;
      suffer disproportionately high asthma-related morbidity and mortality that place heavy&#xD;
      economic burdens on families and society. There is a consensus that adverse asthma outcomes&#xD;
      can be ameliorated by an individual's active engagement in adequate self-management. This&#xD;
      multi-site randomized controlled study proposes to implement and evaluate a peer-led asthma&#xD;
      self-management for adolescents (PLASMA) program that has demonstrated its feasibility and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy in a previous study. PLASMA will be implemented in three cities (Buffalo&#xD;
      NY, Baltimore MD, and Memphis TN) that have particularly high rates of pediatric asthma and&#xD;
      asthma-related morbidity, and are thus most likely to benefit from the program. PLASMA&#xD;
      comprises three main components: (a) peer-leader training; (b) a one-day asthma camp where&#xD;
      peer leaders will deliver manualized self-management content recommended by the national&#xD;
      guidelines; and (c) bi-monthly peer-leader contacts. Specific aims are: (1) to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of PLASMA in inner-city adolescents with asthma in improving quality of life&#xD;
      (primary outcome), and asthma knowledge, attitudes, outcome expectations, self-efficacy,&#xD;
      self-management skills, and asthma control, FEV1 (exploratory outcomes) over time, compared&#xD;
      to a control group for whom adult leaders will deliver the same program content; (2) to&#xD;
      examine the mediating effects of the exploratory outcomes on quality of life; (3) to examine&#xD;
      the moderating effects of personal factors (e.g., age, sex, family support) on the&#xD;
      intervention's primary and exploratory outcomes; (4) to evaluate the effects of PLASMA on&#xD;
      study outcomes in peer leaders (16-20 years); and (5) to determine the economic impact of the&#xD;
      intervention. These aims will be accomplished using a two-group randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      with 378 adolescents (12-17 years) from the three cities (126 for each site). A total of 42&#xD;
      qualified peer leaders (14 in each site) will be enrolled based on adult nomination.&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria for both peer leaders and adolescent learners include: a current asthma&#xD;
      diagnosis; persistent asthma; absence of other chronic or mental illness; inner-city&#xD;
      residence; and capability of verbal and written communication in English. Participants will&#xD;
      provide data at enrollment (T1), camp (T2), and at 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-months post-camp&#xD;
      (T3-T7). Data will be analyzed using a multi-site hierarchical three-level linear&#xD;
      mixed-effects model where level 1 represents repeated measures, level 2 = subject, and level&#xD;
      3 = site. To determine the economic impact of the program, investigator will measure the&#xD;
      direct healthcare costs and total costs of the program, and perform net cost analyses for&#xD;
      each type of costs. In addition, investigator will estimate cost-effectiveness ratios of the&#xD;
      PLASMA group compared with the control.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma, the most common pediatric chronic condition, is a serious problem for many&#xD;
      adolescents. In 2010, nearly 11% of adolescents (2.7 million) ages 12 through 17 years in the&#xD;
      US reported current asthma. This age cohort suffers greater asthma-related morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality than younger children. Asthma disproportionately affects inner-city youth, where&#xD;
      asthma severity has increased and achieving optimum asthma control has been elusive. Several&#xD;
      factors including poor socioeconomic conditions, life stresses, and environmental triggers&#xD;
      have been found to be associated with poorly controlled asthma in inner-city children.&#xD;
      Programs targeting asthma in inner-city children have primarily focused on the modification&#xD;
      of environmental factors and addressing disparity in healthcare access. Limited intervention&#xD;
      efforts have been directed to address high inner-city asthma morbidity specifically in&#xD;
      adolescents by promoting adequate self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Rhee successfully completed an R21 (NR009837) where she designed an evidence-based&#xD;
      peer-led asthma self-management for adolescents (PLASMA) program and tested its efficacy in a&#xD;
      randomized parallel group design in 112 urban and suburban adolescents with persistent&#xD;
      asthma. The PLASMA program was implemented at a one-day camp and involved monthly follow-ups&#xD;
      by peer leaders. The program was well received by participants, and relative to adolescents&#xD;
      who received an adult-led program, the PLASMA group reported better quality of life and&#xD;
      asthma control and fewer asthma-related urgent office visits. Subgroup analysis revealed that&#xD;
      the program was particularly effective for inner-city adolescents in improving asthma&#xD;
      outcomes compared with suburban participants. Given the disproportionate burdens of asthma in&#xD;
      inner-city youth and the program's compelling effects in this population, focusing on&#xD;
      inner-city adolescents as a target of the PLASMA program is critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on this previous trial of efficacy, the overall goal of the proposed study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of the peer-led intervention, PLASMA, in&#xD;
      improving asthma outcomes in inner-city adolescents from three metropolitan cities in the&#xD;
      Northern, Eastern and Southern US with distinctive historical and cultural backgrounds.&#xD;
      Multisite studies have been advocated as an effective approach to strengthening external&#xD;
      validity as such studies afford the opportunity to assess the extent to which treatment&#xD;
      effects are generalizable to different settings. Ascertaining generalizability across sites&#xD;
      is important as it guides future translation of study findings into policy and practice. This&#xD;
      study will also determine long-term sustainability of PLASMA effects and estimate the&#xD;
      economic impact of the intervention. This multi-site study is significant in that it will&#xD;
      target the understudied population, inner-city adolescents with asthma in three cities in the&#xD;
      US, who present serious challenges to optimum asthma management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific study aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate systematically the effectiveness of a peer-led asthma program in inner-city&#xD;
           adolescents with persistent asthma. This aim will be accomplished by using a two-group&#xD;
           randomized controlled trial with 378 adolescents (12-17 years) from the three cities.&#xD;
           The intervention group will receive PLASMA involving peer leader training, a one-day&#xD;
           intense asthma self-management program led by peer leaders and bimonthly contacts from&#xD;
           peer leaders. Intervention effects will be examined in comparison to the control group,&#xD;
           who will receive the same program content delivered by adult leaders. Investigators&#xD;
           hypothesize that: relative to the control group, the PLASMA group will report greater&#xD;
           improvement over time in (H1) quality of life (primary outcome), and (H2) asthma&#xD;
           knowledge, attitudes, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, self-management skills, and&#xD;
           asthma control, FEV1 (exploratory outcomes). (H3) The post-PLASMA scores on outcome&#xD;
           measures will be higher than pre-program scores from both treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the mediating effects of the secondary outcomes (knowledge, attitudes,&#xD;
           outcome expectations, self-efficacy, self-management skills, asthma control, and FEV1)&#xD;
           on the primary outcome (quality of life) of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the moderating effects of personal factors (e.g., age, sex, family support)&#xD;
           on primary and secondary outcomes of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the effects of PLASMA on primary and exploratory outcomes in peer leaders&#xD;
           (16-20 years). Investigators hypothesize that the peer leaders (n=42) will report&#xD;
           significant improvement in quality of life (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes&#xD;
           (knowledge, attitudes, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, self-management skills,&#xD;
           asthma control and FEV1) over the course of 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the economic impact of the intervention. This aim will be accomplished by&#xD;
           (5a) measuring the direct healthcare costs and total costs of the PLASMA program, as&#xD;
           compared with the control group; (5b) performing net cost analyses for each type of&#xD;
           costs; and (5c) estimating cost-effectiveness ratios of the PLASMA group compared with&#xD;
           the control. Investigators hypothesize that the direct and overall costs per participant&#xD;
           in the PLASMA group will be less than costs per participant in the control group, or&#xD;
           cost neutral.&#xD;
