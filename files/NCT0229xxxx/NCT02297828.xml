    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the application of Boussignac continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) immediately after extubation improves PaO2 and PaO2/FiO2&#xD;
      ratio in morbidly obese patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery .&#xD;

      Background: In 2010, the prevalence of obesity in individuals above 15 years old in Portugal&#xD;
      was 15.5% for males and 17.7% for females. .In this country bariatric surgery has increased&#xD;
      significantly playing an important role in the treatment of individuals with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2&#xD;
      or less than 35 kg/m2 in the presence of comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbid obesity has a negative impact in the respiratory physiology and is associated with a&#xD;
      decreased compliance of the lung and chest wall, increased airway resistance, decreased&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength, increased work of breathing, worsening of ventilation /&#xD;
      perfusion ratio and postoperative hypoxemia. General anesthesia and surgery in these patients&#xD;
      will maximize these physiologic alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ahmad et al. (2008) found that morbid obesity per se, regardless of the presence of&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea was associated with increased risk of desaturation in the first 24h&#xD;
      of the postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gaszynski et al. (2007) found that the use of Boussignac CPAP in the postoperative period of&#xD;
      patients undergoing bariatric surgery improved oxygenation. However, it was used capillary&#xD;
      blood gas analysis not arterial blood and the FiO2 was different between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, in 2011, Wong et al. investigated the effect of Boussignac CPAP versus Venturi&#xD;
      mask in the first one hour after bariatric surgery, measuring the PaO2 / FiO2 ratio at 1 hour&#xD;
      and 2 hours of the postoperative period. The group maintained with CPAP showed better&#xD;
      results. There were no differences between the two groups for FEV1 and FVC. The study does&#xD;
      not reveal, however, the analgesic protocol used postoperatively or the patient's position&#xD;
      during the spirometric measurements. These variables could be possible confounders. The PaO2&#xD;
      absolute value was not evaluated because of the different FiO2 between patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: We aim to assess the impact of the application of Boussignac CPAP ventilation&#xD;
      immediately after extubation for improving PaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 ratio in morbidly obese&#xD;
      patients submitted to gastric bypass surgery. As a secondary objective we intend to evaluate&#xD;
      if there are differences in spirometry parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized controlled study on 24 patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery.&#xD;
      Control group receives a Ventury mask immediately after extubation and the intervention group&#xD;
      gets the Boussignac CPAP immediately after extubation. Both groups have the same anesthetic&#xD;
      protocol during the intraoperative period and receive a 50% FiO2 after extubation. Venturi&#xD;
      mask and Boussignac CPAP are maintained for two hours. A blood sample is collected from&#xD;
      radial artery to measure PaO2 and calculate PaO2/FiO2 ratio before surgery and at 1, 2 and 24&#xD;
      hours after extubation in both groups. Evaluation of forced expiraroty volume in 1 second&#xD;
      (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) with a portable spirometer is also performed at the&#xD;
      same intervals. Patients are monitored for oxygen saturation, arterial pressure and cardiac&#xD;
      rhythm while using the devices. Tolerance to the device, analgesic requirements and sedation&#xD;
      level are also monitored and registered.&#xD;
