      Gangliosidosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gangliosides are complex compunds consisting of a glycosphingolipid and a sialic acid and are&#xD;
      located at the cell surface where they are responsible for detecting extracellular molecules.&#xD;
      Gangliosides are mainly located in the nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If gangliosides accumulate pathologically throughout the body this is known as&#xD;
      Gangliosidosis. There are two main sub-types of Gangliosidosis depending on the deficient&#xD;
      enzyme, which are known as GM1 and GM2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GM1-Gangliosidosis GM1-Gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive disease. Genetic counselling&#xD;
      should be provided to affected families. The disorder is caused by mutations in the GLB1-gene&#xD;
      coding for beta-galactosidase. To day, more than 165 mutations have been identified.&#xD;
      Deficient enzyme activity leads to toxic accumulation of gangliosides in body tissues, and&#xD;
      particularly in the central nervous system (CNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disorder is pan-ethnic, however the worldwide prevalence is not known. Prevalence at&#xD;
      birth is estimated to be approximately 1:100,000 to 200,000 live births. High prevalence has&#xD;
      been found in Malta and Brazil, and in the Cypriot and Roma populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deficiency of the lysosomal hydrolase, acid β-galactosidase, causes GM1.Three clinical&#xD;
      sub-types of GM1-Gangliosidosis are recognized, classified by age of onset, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infantile (type 1): In the most common infantile form, coarse facial features,&#xD;
           hepato-splenomegaly, generalized skeletal dysplasia (dysostosis multiplex), macular&#xD;
           cherry-red spots, and developmental delay/arrest (followed by progressive neurologic&#xD;
           deterioration) usually occur within the first 6 months of life. Nonimmune hydrops&#xD;
           fetalis has been reported. An increased incidence of Mongolian spots has also been&#xD;
           described. A wide spectrum of variability is observed in the appearance and progression&#xD;
           of the typical dysmorphic features. As many as 50% of affected infants have a macular&#xD;
           cherry-red spot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Juvenile (type 2): The juvenile form is characterized by a later age of onset, less&#xD;
           hepatosplenomegaly (if any), fewer cherry-red spots (if any), dysmorphic features, or&#xD;
           skeletal changes (vertebral dysplasia may be detected radiographically).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult (type 3): The adult form is characterized by normal early neurologic development,&#xD;
           with variable age of clinical presentation. Slowly progressing dementia with&#xD;
           parkinsonian features and extrapyramidal disease is common. Intellectual impairment may&#xD;
           be initially absent or mild but progresses with time. Generalized dystonia with speech&#xD;
           and gait disturbance is the most frequently reported early feature. Typically, no&#xD;
           hepato-splenomegaly, cherry-red spots, dysmorphic features, or skeletal changes are&#xD;
           present aside from scoliosis (mild vertebral changes may be revealed with radiography),&#xD;
           but short stature is common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GM2-Gangliosidosis The GM2-Gangliosidosis are a group of lysosomal lipid storage disorders&#xD;
      caused by mutations in at least 1 of 3 recessive genes: HEXA, HEXB, and GM2A. Normal products&#xD;
      of all 3 genes are required for normal catabolism of the GM2 ganglioside substrate. Deficient&#xD;
      activity of these enzymes leads to accumulation of the substrate inside neuronal lysosomes,&#xD;
      leading to cell death. The products of the 3 genes are, respectively, the alpha subunits of&#xD;
      b-hexosaminidase A (Hex A). Hex A is a dimer and has the structure alpha-beta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      β-Hexosaminidase B (Hex B) is a dimer of beta chains. It hydrolyzes GM2 and its neutral&#xD;
      asialo derivative GA2. Both subunit precursors acquire the mannose 6-phosphate marker for&#xD;
      recognition by lysosomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hexosaminidase S (Hex S) is a dimer of alpha chains; it is a normal constituent of plasma and&#xD;
      degrades a wide range of glycoconjugates containing β-linked N-acetylhexosaminyl residues.&#xD;
      With lack of beta-subunits the increased polymerization of alpha subunits leads to the&#xD;
      in-creased formation of Hex S in Tay - Sachs disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GM2A is a cofactor required for the normal function of Hex A; it´s disruption likewise leads&#xD;
      to a reduced function of Hex A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease classification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tay-Sachs disease Tay-Sachs disease (also known as GM2-Gangliosidosis or hexosaminidase-A&#xD;
      deficiency) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. In its most common variant (known as&#xD;
      infantile Tay-Sachs disease), it causes a progressive deterioration of mental and physical&#xD;
      abilities that commences around six months of age and usually results in death by the age of&#xD;
      four. The dis-ease occurs when harmful quantities of cell membrane components known as&#xD;
      gangliosides accumulate in the brain nerve cells, eventually leading to the premature death&#xD;
      of the cells. A ganglioside is a form of sphingolipid, which makes Tay-Sachs-Gangliosidosis a&#xD;
      member of the Sphingolipidosis. There is no known cure or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation in the HEXA gene on (human) chromosome 15.&#xD;
      A large number of HEXA mutations have been discovered, and new ones are still being reported.&#xD;
      These mutations reach significant frequencies in specific populations. French Canadians of&#xD;
      south-eastern Quebec have a carrier frequency similar to that seen in Ashkenazi Jews, but&#xD;
      carry a different mutation. Cajuns of southern Louisiana carry the same mutation that is seen&#xD;
      most commonly in Ashkenazi Jews. HEXA mutations are rare and are most seen in genetically&#xD;
      isolated populations. Tay-Sachs can occur from the inheritance of either two simi-lar, or two&#xD;
      unrelated, causative mutations in the HEXA gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tay-Sachs disease is classified into several forms, which are differentiated based on the&#xD;
      onset age of neurological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infantile Tay-Sachs disease: Infants with Tay-Sachs disease appear to develop normally&#xD;
           for the first six months after birth. Then, as neurons become distended with&#xD;
           gangliosides, a relentless deterioration of mental and physical abilities begins. The&#xD;
           child becomes blind, deaf, unable to swallow, atrophied, and paralytic. Death usually&#xD;
           occurs before the age of four.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Juvenile Tay-Sachs disease: Juvenile Tay-Sachs disease is rarer than other forms of&#xD;
           Tay-Sachs, and usually is initially seen in children between two and ten years old.&#xD;
           People with Tay-Sachs disease develop cognitive and motor skill deterioration,&#xD;
           dysar-thria, dysphagia, ataxia, and spasticity; they typically die between five and&#xD;
           fifteen years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult/Late-Onset Tay-Sachs disease: A rare form of this disease, known as Adult-Onset or&#xD;
           Late-Onset Tay-Sachs disease usually has its first symptoms during the 30s or 40s. In&#xD;
           contrast to the other forms, late-onset Tay-Sachs disease is usually not fatal as the&#xD;
           effects can stop progressing. It is frequently misdiagnosed. It is characterized by&#xD;
           unsteadiness of gait and progressive neurological deterioration. Symptoms of late-onset&#xD;
           Tay-Sachs disease which typically begin to be seen in adolescence or early adulthood -&#xD;
           include speech and swallowing difficulties, unsteadiness of gait, spasticity, cognitive&#xD;
           decline, and psychiatric illness, particularly a schizophrenia-like psychosis. People&#xD;
           with late-onset Tay-Sachs disease frequently become full-time wheelchair users in&#xD;
           adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until the 1970s and 1980s, when the disease's molecular genetics became known, the juvenile&#xD;
      and adult forms of the disease were not always recognized as variants of Tay-Sachs disease.&#xD;
      Post-infantile Tay-Sachs was often misdiagnosed as other neurological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sandhoff disease Sandhoff disease is a lipid storage disorder characterized by a progressive&#xD;
      deterioration of the central nervous system. The clinical symptoms of Sandhoff disease are&#xD;
      identical to Tay-Sachs disease. Sandhoff disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder&#xD;
      caused by an abnormal gene for the beta subunit of the hexosaminidase B enzyme. This gene&#xD;
      abnormality results in a deficiency of hexosaminidase A and B that results in accumulation of&#xD;
      fats (lipids) called GM2 gangliosides in the neurons and other tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sandhoff disease, also known as Sandhoff-Jatzkewitz disease, variant 0 of GM2-Gangliosidosis&#xD;
      or Hexosaminidase A and B deficiency, is a lysosomal genetic, lipid storage disorder caused&#xD;
      by the inherited deficiency to create functional beta-hexosaminidases A and B. These&#xD;
      catabolic enzymes are needed to degrade the neuronal membrane components, ganglioside GM2,&#xD;
      its derivative GA2, the glycolipid globoside in visceral tissues, and some oligosaccharides.&#xD;
      Accumulation of these metabolites leads to a progressive destruction of the central nervous&#xD;
      system and eventually to death. The rare autosomal recessive neurodegenera-tive disorder is&#xD;
      clinically almost indistinguishable from Tay-Sachs disease, another genetic disorder that&#xD;
      disrupts beta-hexosaminidases A and S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three different types of Sandhoff disease, classic infantile, juvenile, and adult&#xD;
      late onset. Each form is classified by the severity of the symptoms as well as the age in&#xD;
      which the patient shows these symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Classic infantile form: Classic infantile form of the disease is classified by the&#xD;
           development of symptoms anywhere from 2 months to 9 months of age. It is the most severe&#xD;
           of all of the forms and will lead to death before the patient reaches the age of three.&#xD;
           This is the most common and severe form of Sandoff disease. Infants with this disorder&#xD;
           typically appear normal until the age of 3 to 6 months, when development slows and&#xD;
           muscles used for movement weaken. Affected infants lose motor skills such as turning&#xD;
           over, sitting, and crawling. As the disease progresses, infants develop seizures, vision&#xD;
           and hearing loss, mental retardation, and paralysis. An eye abnormality called a&#xD;
           cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye examination, is characteristic of&#xD;
           this disorder. Some infants with Sandhoff disease may also have enlarged organs&#xD;
           (or-ganomegalie) or bone abnormalities. Children with the severe form of this disorder&#xD;
           usually live only into early childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Juvenile form: Juvenile form of the disease shows symptoms starting at age 3 ranging to&#xD;
           age 10 and although the child usually dies by the time they are 15, it is possible for&#xD;
           them to live longer if they are under constant care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult onset form: Adult onset form of the disease is classified by its occurrence in&#xD;
           older individuals and has an effect on the motor function of these individuals and it is&#xD;
           not yet known if Sandhoff Disease will cause these individuals to have a decrease in&#xD;
           their life span.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Juvenile and Adult onset forms of Sandhoff disease are very rare. Signs and symptoms can&#xD;
      begin in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood and are usually milder than those seen with the&#xD;
      infantile form of Sandhoff disease. As in the infantile form, mental abilities and&#xD;
      coordination are affected. Characteristic features include muscle weakness, loss of muscle&#xD;
      coordination (ataxia) and other problems with movement, speech problems, and mental illness.&#xD;
      These signs and symptoms vary widely among people with late-onset forms of Sandhoff disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sandhoff disease symptoms are clinically indeterminable from Tay-Sachs disease. The classic&#xD;
      infantile form of the disease has the most severe symptoms and is incredibly hard to diagnose&#xD;
      at this early age. The first signs of symptoms begin before 6 months of age and the parents'&#xD;
      notice when the child begins digressing in their development. If the children had the ability&#xD;
      to sit up by themselves or crawl they will lose this ability. This is caused by a slow&#xD;
      deterioration of the muscles in the child's body from the build-up of GM2 gangliosides. Since&#xD;
      the body is unable to create the enzymes it needs within the central nervous system, it is&#xD;
      unable to attach to these gangliosides to break them apart and make them non-toxic. With this&#xD;
      build-up there are several symptoms that begin to appear such as muscle/motor weakness, sharp&#xD;
      reaction to loud noises, blindness, deafness, inability to react to stimulants, respiratory&#xD;
      problems and infections, mental retardation, seizures, cherry red spots in the retina,&#xD;
      enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), pneumonia, or bronchopneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other two forms of Sandhoff disease have similar symptoms but to a lesser extent. Adult&#xD;
      and juvenile forms of Sandhoff disease are rarer then the infantile form. In these cases&#xD;
      victims suffer cognitive impairment (retardation) and a loss of muscle coordination that&#xD;
      impairs and eventually destroys their ability to walk; the characteristic red spots in the&#xD;
      retina also develop. The adult form of the disease, however, is sometimes milder, and may&#xD;
      only lead to muscle weakness that impairs walking or the ability to get out of bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic&#xD;
      alterations in the blood of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future the disease&#xD;
      earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is the goal of the study to validate this new biochemical marker from the blood&#xD;
      of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose and thereby&#xD;
      with an earlier treatment.&#xD;
