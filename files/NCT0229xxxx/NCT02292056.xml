    <textblock>
      There is currently limited research that addresses the unique medication safety and family&#xD;
      planning needs among women of reproductive age with psychiatric conditions. The study will&#xD;
      research the feasibility of a novel individualized 1-on-1 counseling session at the Gifford&#xD;
      Clinic in the Department of Psychiatry at UCSD that will help women in this population better&#xD;
      understand: 1) which of their medications are safe to use in pregnancy, 2) provide education&#xD;
      regarding the importance of using contraception and which contraceptive choices are available&#xD;
      to them, and 3) raise awareness of any drug-drug interactions that may exist between their&#xD;
      medications and their chosen method of contraception. Patients will be given questionnaire to&#xD;
      assess their contraceptive utilization. They will also be given a before and after quiz to&#xD;
      allow for an objective measure of the patient's increase in knowledge regarding medication&#xD;
      safety and contraceptive choices as a result of the investigators intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half of all pregnancies in the general population in 2006-2010 were unintended. In&#xD;
      addition, data from the National Survey of Family Growth shows that in 2006-2010, only 62.2%&#xD;
      of women aged 15-44 in the United States are using some form of contraception. These&#xD;
      statistics inherently suggest a need for additional education in the general population&#xD;
      regarding contraceptive options. It is unknown how these statistics for the general&#xD;
      population apply to women with psychiatric conditions. In addition, reproductive age women&#xD;
      with psychiatric diagnoses have several unique family planning considerations, some of which&#xD;
      are outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERATOGENICITY OF PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some women with psychiatric conditions may be on medications that are not safe for use in&#xD;
      pregnancy and therefore may require counseling on their highly effective contraceptive&#xD;
      options. These women may also have other environmental exposures to alcohol, tobacco and&#xD;
      illicit drugs, so this may be an additional need for counseling about risk to a potential&#xD;
      pregnancy. Other women in this population may become pregnant and stop using their&#xD;
      psychiatric medications because they are unaware that their medications are safe to use in&#xD;
      pregnancy. The United States Food and Drug Administration uses the following categories to&#xD;
      rate the safety of using various pharmaceutical agents in pregnancy: A, controlled studies in&#xD;
      humans fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in pregnancy; B, no evidence of risk to fetus&#xD;
      in animal studies but no controlled studies for use in pregnant women; C, animal studies&#xD;
      demonstrate an adverse effect on the fetus, but no controlled studies in humans; D, positive&#xD;
      evidence of risk to fetus in human studies; and X, agent contraindicated in pregnancy because&#xD;
      risks to fetus clearly outweigh potential benefits. Most psychotropic drugs used to treat&#xD;
      bipolar disorder are category C or D. For example, lithium, a commonly prescribed mood&#xD;
      stabilizer used as a first-line treatment for bipolar disorder, is associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of congenital cardiac abnormalities and is FDA category D for use in&#xD;
      pregnancy. Also, valproate and carbamazapine, which are commonly used as mood stabilizers,&#xD;
      have been associated with neural tube defects in the fetus and thus are also FDA category D&#xD;
      for use in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTRACEPTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in this population may also wish to delay or avoid pregnancy due to the current state&#xD;
      of their psychiatric condition and thus should be encouraged to use effective contraception.&#xD;
      It has been shown that women with psychiatric diagnoses may interrupt their use of&#xD;
      contraception due a variety of factors including: drug-drug interactions with their&#xD;
      psychiatric medication, psychiatric hospitalization, loss of personal control over their&#xD;
      medication administration, and preconceived notions of how contraception may impact their&#xD;
      psychiatric condition or vice versa. Long-acting reversible contraceptive options, such as&#xD;
      intrauterine devices (IUDs), requiring no patient compliance to achieve maximal efficacy may&#xD;
      therefore be particularly well-suited options for these women. For these reasons, there may&#xD;
      be a role for focused counseling in this population regarding options for safe, effective and&#xD;
      reversible forms of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some women with psychiatric conditions are on medications that interact with combined&#xD;
      hormonal contraceptives and may benefit from specialized counseling regarding which&#xD;
      contraceptive options are safe for them to use. In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention (CDC) published the United States Medical Eligibility Criteria (USMEC) in an&#xD;
      effort to improve contraceptive safety guidance. The USMEC includes guidance on contraceptive&#xD;
      safety for specific medications, including those commonly used to treat psychiatric illness.&#xD;
      For example, carbamazapine, oxcarbazapine, lamictal, and topiramate, which are commonly&#xD;
      prescribed for mood stabilization, increase the clearance rate of oral contraceptives; thus&#xD;
      patients receiving one of these treatments should consider switching to an alternative form&#xD;
      of contraception. The USMEC continues to be updated and will likely prove to be a valuable&#xD;
      resource to optimize contraceptive counseling for these women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multidisciplinary research project involves a unique collaboration between the&#xD;
      MotherToBaby Project, Reproductive Medicine at UCSD and Psychiatry at UCSD to deliver&#xD;
      individualized contraceptive and teratogen counseling to women with psychiatric conditions.&#xD;
      MotherToBaby California, formerly known as the CTIS Pregnancy Health Information Line, in the&#xD;
      Department of Pediatrics at UCSD is a community-based organization founded 27 years ago which&#xD;
      has been continuously funded at UCSD to provide direct-to-consumer and direct-to-health care&#xD;
      provider counseling free of charge on the risks or safety of medications, chemicals,&#xD;
      recreational drugs and alcohol, infectious or chronic disease, and medical conditions in&#xD;
      pregnancy. The goal of MotherToBaby is to provide individualized risk assessments and&#xD;
      referrals for further assistance or diagnostic testing to pregnant or breastfeeding women in&#xD;
      order to prevent birth defects that are related to prenatal or breastfeeding exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will serve to investigate the feasibility of a novel type of counseling&#xD;
      service that may uncover and address unmet family planning needs of reproductive age women&#xD;
      with psychiatric diagnoses. The proposed project also promotes the utilization of the&#xD;
      relatively new evidence-based USMEC contraceptive guidance from the CDC which has been&#xD;
      endorsed by the American Congress of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists and American Academy of&#xD;
      Family Physicians.&#xD;
