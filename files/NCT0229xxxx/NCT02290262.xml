  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery often experience a range&#xD;
      of problems and symptoms related to the procedure and the underlying heart disease.These&#xD;
      problems include anxiety and depressive symptoms, immobility issues, complications such as&#xD;
      wound seeping, neck and shoulder pains, interrupted and insufficient sleep. No studies have&#xD;
      tested a combined intervention on phase 1 rehabilitation in coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      surgery patients. However, randomised trials with either a physical or a mental part have&#xD;
      been conducted with positive result, but evidence is lacking for a combined intervention.&#xD;
      Before a large randomised trial was set up a pilot trial was conducted to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of patient recruitment and intervention: to test the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the intervention by patients and to provide outcome data for sample size calculations. The&#xD;
      SheppHeartCABG pilot showed trial feasibility, safety and sufficient inclusion rate and high&#xD;
      compliance with most elements. Outcome data from the pilot trial has been used to sample size&#xD;
      and power calculation in this randomised clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this trial is to investigate the benefits and harms of a phase 1&#xD;
      comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programme consisting of an exercise-training and a&#xD;
      psycho-educative component, including plus treatment as usual in patients who undergo&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting.&#xD;

      Background: Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery often experience a&#xD;
      range of problems and symptoms related to the procedure and the underlying heart disease.&#xD;
      These problems include anxiety and depressive symptoms, immobility issues, complications such&#xD;
      as wound seeping, neck and shoulder pains, interrupted and insufficient sleep. Over the last&#xD;
      2 decades, cardiac rehabilitation has become recognized as a significant component in the&#xD;
      continuum of care for persons with cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation has undergone a significant evolution moving from a focused exercise&#xD;
      intervention to a comprehensive disease management program. In Guidelines for Coronary Artery&#xD;
      Bypass Graft Surgery cardiac rehabilitation is described as including early ambulation during&#xD;
      hospitalisation and outpatient prescriptive exercise training beginning 6-8 weeks following&#xD;
      surgery. Our hypothesis is that a comprehensive rehabilitation programme including physical&#xD;
      exercise with moderate intensity and a psycho-educative component can begin in the early&#xD;
      postoperative phase during hospitalising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No studies have tested a combined intervention on phase 1 rehabilitation in coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass graft surgery patients. However, randomised trials with either a physical or a mental&#xD;
      part have been conducted with positive result, but evidence is lacking for a combined&#xD;
      intervention. Before a large randomised trial was set up a pilot trial was conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of patient recruitment and intervention: to test the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the intervention by patients and to provide outcome data for sample size&#xD;
      calculations. The SheppHeartCABG pilot showed trial feasibility, safety and sufficient&#xD;
      inclusion rate and high compliance with most elements. Outcome data from the pilot trial has&#xD;
      been used to sample size and power calculation in this randomised clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this trial is to investigate the benefits and harms of a phase 1&#xD;
      comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programme consisting of an exercise-training and a&#xD;
      psycho-educative component, including plus treatment as usual in patients who undergo&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: SheppHeartCABG is an investigator-initiated randomised clinical trial with 1:1&#xD;
      randomisation from two sites to a comprehensive physical and psycho-educative rehabilitation&#xD;
      programme plus usual care or usual care alone, with blinded outcome assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Patients 18 years or older with ischaemic heart disease, who have to undergo&#xD;
      elective coronary artery bypass grafting, who speak and understand Danish and who provide a&#xD;
      written informed consent will be included. The following patients will be excluded from the&#xD;
      trial: patients at intermediate or high risk to their cardiovascular status according to&#xD;
      guidelines, patients with neurological or orthopaedic deficits which prevent training and&#xD;
      patients who do not wish to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants: 326 participants will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: All patients - both in the intervention group and in the control group -&#xD;
      receive usual care. Patients allocated to the experimental group receive a rehabilitation&#xD;
      programme consisting of physical exercise and psycho-education. The control group will&#xD;
      receive usual care alone. The physical exercises consist of; breathing exercises with and&#xD;
      without using incentive spirometry with expiratory positive pressure airway, walking and&#xD;
      cycling exercises and neck/shoulder exercises during hospitalisation and an exercise&#xD;
      programme running from discharge until 4 weeks following surgery. The psycho-educative&#xD;
      rehabilitation programme consists of four psycho-educative consultations with a specially&#xD;
      trained nurse. The last consultation will take place 4 weeks following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Primary outcome is physical capacity measured by 6-minute walk test 4 weeks&#xD;
      following surgery. Secondary outcomes; perceived mental and physical(SF 12), health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (HeartQoL), anxiety and depression (HADS), sleep (PSQI), pain (ÖMPSQ) and leg&#xD;
      endurance and strength (sit and stand test). Explorative outcomes are; fatigue (MFI-20),&#xD;
      physical activity (IPAQ), cognitive and emotional representation of illness (B-IPQ) and&#xD;
      self-rated health (EQ-5D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: There are no previous reports of risks associated with psycho-educational&#xD;
      consultations. Physical exercise is tested extensively in patients with heart disease and is&#xD;
      considered safe and will meet the applicable requirements for safety during training of&#xD;
      cardiac patients. The interventions are considered safe for patients at low risk according to&#xD;
      their cardiovascular status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations: The trial is performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      in its latest form. All patients must give informed consent prior to participation and the&#xD;
      trial is initiated after approval by the Danish Data Protection Agency and the regional&#xD;
      ethics committee. The trial will be registered at www.clinicalTrials.gov before randomisation&#xD;
      of the first participant.&#xD;
