  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators aim to: 1) confirm the objective response rate (ORR) observed&#xD;
      in the investigators initial study for patients with the TSER*2/*2 genotype 2) determine&#xD;
      whether PEMOX regimen is more worthy of future development for this patient genotype selected&#xD;
      population than FOLFOX based on the data indicating that pemetrexed may be a better TS&#xD;
      targeted agent than 5-FU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are homozygous for the TSER*2 allele (TSER*2/*2) will be able to continue in the&#xD;
      study and will be randomized. Patients with other TSER genotypes will not be included and&#xD;
      will be considered screen fails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 8 patients with the TSER*2/*2 genotype will be randomized 1:1 to receive treatment&#xD;
      with either PEMOX or FOLFOX (4 in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the objective response rate (ORR) in each treatment arm will occur after the&#xD;
      first 8 patients are enrolled. Using the proposed Bayesian design, subsequent patients will&#xD;
      be preferentially assigned to the &quot;better performing&quot; treatment arm based on continuous&#xD;
      real-time reassessments of ORR results.&#xD;
