      A Phase 1b Study of ACP-196 in Combination with Obinutuzumab for Patients with&#xD;
      Relapsed/Refractory or Untreated CLL/SLL/PLL Study started with two cohorts, on Acalabrutinib&#xD;
      and Obinutuzumab, cohort 1 for relapsed or refractory patients and cohort two for treatment&#xD;
      naïve subjects. Then for longer survival data and combination therapy, two new cohorts added&#xD;
      to the study, cohort 3 with relapsed or refractory subjects on Acalabrutinib, Rituximab and&#xD;
      Venetoclax, and cohort 4 with treatment naïve subjects on Acalabrutinib, Obinutuzumab and&#xD;
      Venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints: For Cohorts 1 and 2, the ORR (PR or better) at the 12-month response&#xD;
      assessment will be calculated and 95% exact binomial CIs will be provided. For Cohorts 1 to&#xD;
      4, toxicities will be tabulated by type and grade using NCI-CTCAE version 4.03 criteria or&#xD;
      higher and displayed in summary form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently study is in maintenance phase and we don't expect a major change in the near&#xD;
      future.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Subject must provide written informed consent. A signed copy of the consent form will&#xD;
             be retained in the subject's chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject must be able to receive outpatient treatment and follow-up at the treating&#xD;
             institution.&#xD;

             acalabrutinib, 30 days after the last dose of venetoclax, 12 months the last dose of&#xD;
             rituximab, or 18 months after the last dose of obinutuzumab, whichever is the longest&#xD;
             period following the subject's study drug discontinuation. Men who are sexually active&#xD;
             and able to have children must agree to use highly effective methods of contraception&#xD;
             during the study and use a barrier method (condom; even if the subject had a&#xD;
             vasectomy) for 2 days after the last dose of acalabrutinib, 18 months after the last&#xD;
             dose of obinutuzumab, or 12 months after the last dose of rituximab, or 30 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of venetoclax, whichever is longer. Highly effective forms of&#xD;
             contraception are defined in Section 6.4.3. Additionally, men must agree to refrain&#xD;
             from sperm donation during the study and for 18 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             obinutuzumab, or 12 months after the last dose of rituximab, or 30 days after the last&#xD;
             dose of venetoclax, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Inclusion of women and minorities: Subjects of both genders and all racial/ethnic&#xD;
             groups are eligible for the study if they meet eligibility criteria outlined. To date,&#xD;
             there is no information that suggests that differences in drug metabolism or disease&#xD;
             response would be expected in one group compared with another. The small number of&#xD;
             subjects in a Phase 1b trial precludes any analysis of data to compare subject&#xD;
             subgroups based on gender or race/ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. For Cohorts 2 and 4, received previous therapy for CLL. Treatment of autoimmune&#xD;
             complications of CLL with steroids or rituximab is allowed, however, CD20 must have&#xD;
             returned on 10% of the CLL cells if rituximab was recently administered. Palliative&#xD;
             steroids are acceptable at doses ≤20 mg prednisone equivalent daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ dysfunction, which in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion, could compromise the subjects' safety, interfere with the&#xD;
             absorption or metabolism of acalabrutinib, or put the study outcomes at undue risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with active cardiovascular disease not medically controlled or those who have&#xD;

             ms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting GI function, or resection of&#xD;
             the stomach or small bowel or gastric bypass, ulcerative colitis, symptomatic&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease, or partial or complete bowel obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Grade ≥2 toxicity (other than alopecia) continuing from prior anticancer therapy&#xD;
             including radiation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Uncontrolled AIHA or idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months before the first dose of&#xD;
             study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Requires or receiving anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K&#xD;
             antagonists (e.g., phenprocoumon) within 28 days of first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Requires treatment with proton-pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole, esomeprazole,&#xD;
             lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole, or pantoprazole).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects with active infections requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotic/antiviral&#xD;
             therapy are not eligible for entry onto the study until resolution of the infection.&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Subjects with history of or ongoing drug-induced pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active infection with hepatitis C&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Serologic status reflecting active hepatitis B or C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Subjects who are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive and who are&#xD;
                  hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative will need to have a negative&#xD;
                  hepatitis B DNA result by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) before randomization.&#xD;
                  Those who are HBsAg-positive and/or hepatitis B PCR positive will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subjects receiving prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may have&#xD;
                  positive hepatitis serologies. Subjects who are on IVIG who have positive&#xD;
                  hepatitis serologies must have a negative hepatitis B DNA to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Subjects with a history of HBV infection but negative HBV serologies at screening&#xD;
                  must also have a negative HBV PCR to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Subjects with a known history of hepatitis C or who are hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
                  positive should be tested for HCV RNA during screening. Subjects who are&#xD;
                  hepatitis C antibody positive will need to have a negative PCR result before&#xD;
                  randomization. Those who are hepatitis C PCR positive will be excluded. No&#xD;
                  further testing beyond screening is necessary if PCR results are negative.&#xD;
                  However, in the setting of rising transaminase and/or bilirubin levels, HCV PCR&#xD;
                  testing should be performed when clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subjects with substance abuse or other medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, would confound study interpretation or affect the&#xD;
             subject's ability to tolerate or complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subjects cannot concurrently participate in another therapeutic clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject who have received a live virus vaccination within 1 month of starting study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
