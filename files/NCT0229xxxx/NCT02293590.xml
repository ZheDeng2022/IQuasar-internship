  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist which is marketed for&#xD;
      the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Keystone, 2008) when given in&#xD;
      combination with methotrexate (MTX). CZP is a PEGylated Fab' fragment of humanized anti-TNF&#xD;
      antibody with a high affinity for TNF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RA is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease with multiple treatment strategies and&#xD;
      combination therapies available including analgesia, anti-inflammatory drugs and&#xD;
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Previous trials have demonstrated positive results&#xD;
      from the use of CZP but have compared its use to placebo in a fixed dose concomitant&#xD;
      medication regime rather than using a more realistic dynamic treatment strategy normally&#xD;
      employed in the clinical outpatient care of RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is aimed at comparing the use of CZP in patients with moderate to severe RA when&#xD;
      administered in conjunction with an intensive, adapted treatment strategy (Group A) versus a&#xD;
      fixed-dosed program (Group B). CZP will be given in conjunction with MTX (a disease modifying&#xD;
      anti-arthritic drug - or DMARD), steroidal therapy in the form of prednisolone and joint&#xD;
      infiltrations of triamcinolone (another corticosteroid) and lidocaine (a pain therapy). Both&#xD;
      treatment arms will include these concomitant medications but there will be an intensive&#xD;
      adaptive approach adopted for the 'treat to target' population of Group A with a more&#xD;
      fixed-dose approach set-out for Group B. Patients will be centrally randomized after&#xD;
      screening to ensure a 50:50 ratio for both Groups in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tight control of an adaptive concomitant treatment strategy after initiation of CZP will lead&#xD;
      to an improved outcome of RA patients with an active disease despite DMARD treatment.&#xD;
