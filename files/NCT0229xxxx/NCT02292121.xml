  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In rodents, obesity is associated with changes in tight junctions' structure in small&#xD;
      intestine, which impacts intestinal permeability and results in metabolic complications. Few&#xD;
      data exist in human. We hypothesized that intestinal permeability is altered in obese&#xD;
      subjects in comparison to lean subjects, linked to metabolic and inflammatory status and that&#xD;
      these alterations are modified after gastric bypass.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The regulation of the permeability of the intestinal barrier is essential in the molecular&#xD;
      traffic between the lumen and the internal environment. It affects the absorption of&#xD;
      nutrients and tolerance or immunization against foodborne non-self antigens that penetrate&#xD;
      the barrier. In rodents, increased endotoxemia has been proposed as an important player in&#xD;
      low-grade inflammation accompanying the development of obesity and metabolic disorders. In&#xD;
      humans, the intestinal barrier function is altered in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD,&#xD;
      Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and celiac disease). The term &quot;leaky gut&quot; is used to&#xD;
      describe a porous intestine with hyper-permeability associated with acute or chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases such as &quot;systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS),&quot;acute&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD for &quot;inflammatory bowel disease&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deficiencies of the barrier are also observed in extra-intestinal diseases (type-1 diabetes,&#xD;
      food allergies, and autoimmune diseases). Impairments in tight junctions may precede clinical&#xD;
      signs and constitute a risk factor for developing diseases or secondarily be altered and&#xD;
      cause an increased entry of undesirable bacterial or nutritional antigens. The state of the&#xD;
      intercellular tight junctions of the intestine controls the diffusion of molecules between&#xD;
      cells. A deficiency of the intestinal barrier function is often associated with structural&#xD;
      changes in the tight junctions resulting from loss of localization of protein or expression&#xD;
      of genes and / or cellular signals such as ZO-1, occludin or tricellulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few studies about the condition of the intestinal barrier in the context of human&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of our study are to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compare intestinal permeability in obese subjects with non obese subjects and after&#xD;
           gastric bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  search links between intestinal permeability and 1) metabolic and inflammatory&#xD;
           bioclinical parameters 2) dietary profiles 3) microbiota&#xD;
