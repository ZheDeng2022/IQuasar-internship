      The purpose of our retrospective study is to describe which circumstances EGFR TKI is&#xD;
      continued despite progression according to the usual Response Evaluation CrIteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumours (RECIST) in patients with EGFR activating mutations and acquired resistance to EGFR&#xD;
      TKI .We will collect their social and demographic data (age, sex), first Progression Free&#xD;
      Survival ( PFS) - from start of EGFR TKI to 1st progression PFS 1- and - from first&#xD;
      progression according to RECIST to second progression : PFS2- , Overall Survival (OS) - from&#xD;
      diagnosis OS 1 and from first progression OS 2 -, mutational status. We will analyze more&#xD;
      closely the mode of progression (site), the therapeutic approach at disease progression. We&#xD;
      will define two subgroups: those for whom EGFR TKI was continued at least three months&#xD;
      despite progression defined according to RECIST criteria, and those for whom a second-line&#xD;
      treatment (chemotherapy without EGFR TKI) was chosen at disease progression. It will be&#xD;
      individualized the subgroup of patients in whom it was continued TKI after progression.&#xD;

      Background :&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Lung cancer represents the leading cause of death by cancer in France. Significant advances&#xD;
      have been made in recent years on knowledge of oncogenesis of NSCLC in particularly the&#xD;
      discovery of specific oncogenic drivers playing major role in oncogenic addiction responsible&#xD;
      for the occurrence of NSCLC. Activating mutations of the gene encoding the receptor tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase EGFR appeared in a subgroup of patients with NSCLC. In 2010, the search for EGFR&#xD;
      mutations in patients with lung cancer was performed in 16,834 patients and the mutation rate&#xD;
      was 10.5%. The use of specific inhibitors of EGFR tyrosine kinase in patients with activating&#xD;
      mutations of EGFR have shown a significant clinical benefit with a response rate more than 70&#xD;
      % ,with PFS ranging from 9 to 13,1 months and median overall survival from 20 to 30 months.&#xD;
      Despite these very good results, all patients develop a resistance to EGFR TKI. This&#xD;
      progression is usually defined according to RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These RECIST criteria were established primarily on studies conducted in patients treated&#xD;
      with conventional chemotherapy with few or no targeted therapies. In addition, the mode of&#xD;
      action of TKI (blocking signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation, angiogenesis,&#xD;
      apoptosis, metastasis ..) is very different from the mode of cytotoxic action (action during&#xD;
      cell division). Thus, the use of RECIST does not seem to be the most appropriate way to&#xD;
      evaluate the response in patients treated by TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this, the RECIST criteria have been used to demonstrate superiority of EGFR TKI&#xD;
      compared to chemotherapy in patients with EGFR activating mutations in first line setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2010, Pr Jackman proposed a clinical definition of acquired resistance to EGFR TKI :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment with a single agent EGFR TKI,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Presence of EGFR activating mutation, clinical benefit from treatment with an EGFR TKI&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Systemic progression of disease according to RECIST or WHO criteria while on continuous&#xD;
           treatment with EGFR TKI within the last 30 days TKI&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. No intervening systemic therapy between cessation of EGFR TKI and initiation of new&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tony Mok , in the accompanying editorial, made some criticism to this definition. He argued&#xD;
      that it was not uncommon to find new small slow growing tumor nodules after the dramatic&#xD;
      initial response to EGFR TKIs. He stated that in this situation, EGFR TKIs could be continued&#xD;
      with benefit for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since then, others clinical situations have been described, such as the emergence of one or&#xD;
      even more new metastasis located in one single organ (like the brain or bones), which can be&#xD;
      controlled by a loco-regional treatment. The authors found that the continuation of EGFR TKIs&#xD;
      in these cases allowed control of the disease for a considerable length of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, it has been suggested that even loco-regional treatment was not mandatory for&#xD;
      EGFR TKIs continuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pr Nishino studied retrospectively 56 patients with EGFR activating mutations and acquired&#xD;
      resistance. 88% of patients continued EGFR TKI treatment for at least 2 months beyond&#xD;
      progressive disease defined according to RECIST criteria. The median time from RECIST&#xD;
      progressive disease to termination of TKI for these patients was 10.1 months (range 2.2 to&#xD;
      64.2 months) and the median overall survival was 31.8 months, which is a rather good result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pr Oxnard, in a similar study, found that in 45% of 42 patients with acquired resistance to&#xD;
      EGFR TKI, alternate systemic therapy could be delayed for three months or more. These 19&#xD;
      patients had more frequently the exon 19 deletion and were free of cancer related symptoms at&#xD;
      RECIST progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another recently published retrospective Japanese study suggested that continuous use of&#xD;
      EGFR-TKI beyond progressive disease may prolong overall survival compared with switching to&#xD;
      cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with EGFR activating mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective ASIAN phase II study (ASPIRATION) has been recently completed. It compared the&#xD;
      continuous use of erlotinib versus stopping erlotinib at progression according to RECIST&#xD;
      criteria. Patients could continue erlotinib if progression was slow (&gt; 6 months stability),&#xD;
      asymptomatic minimal increase and/or new cerebral metastasis controlled locally. The patients&#xD;
      switch to another systemic treatment if they had rapid progressive disease, extra brain&#xD;
      symptomatic metastasis, deterioration of Performance Status (PS) or life threatening&#xD;
      complications. The results of this study should be available in December 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our retrospective study is to describe which circumstances EGFR TKI is&#xD;
      continued despite progression according to the usual RECIST criteria in patients with EGFR&#xD;
      activating mutations and acquired resistance to EGFR TKI. This study concerns patients who&#xD;
      have began a TKI treatment in first line from 1st JANUARY 2010 to 1st JUNE 2012.We'll collect&#xD;
      their social and demographic data (age, sex), first PFS (from start of EGFR TKI: PFS 1) and&#xD;
      second (from first progression according to RECIST 1.1 to second progression : PFS2) , OS&#xD;
      (from diagnosis OS 1 and from first progression OS2), mutational status, and we will analyze&#xD;
      more closely the mode of progression (site), the therapeutic approach at disease progression.&#xD;
      We will define two subgroups: those for whom EGFR TKI was continued at least three months&#xD;
      despite progression defined according to RECIST criteria, and those for whom a second-line&#xD;
      treatment (chemotherapy without EGFR TKI) was chosen at disease progression. It will be&#xD;
      individualized the subgroup of patients in whom it was continued TKI after progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this subgroup, it will be searched for a correlation between delaying systemic therapy&#xD;
      (second line) by pursuing a EGFR TKI at least 3 months and various parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of EGFR mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms at disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical characteristic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergence of new metastases vs increasing size of known targets&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Speed of decay and tumour progression (% per month)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delivery of loco-regional treatment when relapse occurs in a single site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PFS (PFS1 and PFS2) and OS (OS1) from the first progression in this group will be&#xD;
           compared to the general population (population for which there was TKI stop to the&#xD;
           progression) with EGFR activating mutations.&#xD;
