    <measure>Change From Baseline in Amount of Urine Leakage (Median 24 Hour Pad Weight)</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the amount of urine leakage from baseline was assessed by 24-hour pad test at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. Amount of urine leakage experienced by subject at home during a 24-hour period; all pads used during test period are weighed before and after use and differences in weights represent the amount of urine leaked.</description>

    <description>Change in the amount of urine leakage from baseline was assessed by a 24-hour pad test at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. Amount of urine leakage experienced by subject at home during a 24-hour period; all pads used during test period are weighed before and after use and differences in weights represent the amount of urine leaked.</description>

    <measure>Median Change From Baseline in Patient-reported Quality of Life (QOL) - Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Median change from baseline in patient-reported quality of life (QOL) was assessed by the Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL) questionnaire at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-treatment. The I-QOL questionnaire was a validated, 22-item tool used to assess QOL of participants with urinary incontinence. Scored 0 to100, with higher scores indicating a better QOL.</description>

    <measure>Median Change From Baseline in Patient-reported Symptom Severity- International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Median change from baseline in patient-reported symptom severity was assessed by the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ) questionnaire at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. The ICIQ questionnaire was a validated 4-item tool used to assess symptom severity of participants with urinary incontinence. Scored 0 to 21, with lower scores indicating a better symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Median Change in Patient-reported Incontinence Symptom Severity - International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported incontinence symptom severity was assessed by questionnaires at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment using the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) questionnaire. The I-PSS was a validated questionnaire used to assess the severity of three urine storage symptoms (frequency, nocturia, urgency), four voiding symptoms (feeling of incomplete emptying, intermittency, straining, and a weak stream) and the degree of bother associated with those symptoms. A score of 0 to 7 indicates mild symptoms, 8 to 19 indicates moderate symptoms, and 20 to 35 indicates severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Distribution of Patient-reported Incontinence Symptom Severity Scores - Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported incontinence symptom severity was assessed by questionnaires at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment using the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) questionnaire. The PGI-S was a global assessment of symptom severity compared with severity before treatment started. Ratings that could be selected were: 1-normal, 2-mild, 3-moderate, and 4-severe. Percentages of participants in each category were determined at each visit.</description>

    <measure>Distribution of Patient-reported Incontinence Symptom Severity Scores - Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported incontinence symptom severity was assessed by questionnaires at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment using the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) questionnaire. The PGI-I was a global assessment of symptom severity in which participants selected the following ratings: 1-Very much better, 2-Much better, 3-A little better, 4-No change, 5-A little worse, 6-Much worse, and 7-Very much worse. Percentages of participants in each category were determined at each visit.</description>

    <measure>Median Change From Baseline in Patient-reported Erectile Dysfunction (ED) - Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>SUI and ED can be comorbidities that develop following prostate surgery; median change from baseline in patient-reported Erectile Dysfunction (ED) was assessed by the 5-Item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). The IIEF-5 questionnaire was a validated 5-item tool used to assess to presence and severity of erectile dysfunction. Scored from 5 to 25, with lower scores indicating less ED symptoms.</description>

          <description>A test in which the participant wears specific absorbent pads dispensed by the clinic. The pads are weighed to record the pre-test weight prior to dispensing to the participant. The participant must wear the absorbent pads for 24 hours. The participant returns the used absorbent pads to the clinic, and the clinic records the post-test weight to determine urinary leakage for the 24 hour period. The difference in weights represent the amount of urine leaked.</description>

        <title>Median Change in Patient-reported Incontinence Symptom Severity - International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>Patient-reported incontinence symptom severity was assessed by questionnaires at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment using the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) questionnaire. The I-PSS was a validated questionnaire used to assess the severity of three urine storage symptoms (frequency, nocturia, urgency), four voiding symptoms (feeling of incomplete emptying, intermittency, straining, and a weak stream) and the degree of bother associated with those symptoms. A score of 0 to 7 indicates mild symptoms, 8 to 19 indicates moderate symptoms, and 20 to 35 indicates severe symptoms.</description>

        <description>SUI and ED can be comorbidities that develop following prostate surgery; median change from baseline in patient-reported Erectile Dysfunction (ED) was assessed by the 5-Item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). The IIEF-5 questionnaire was a validated 5-item tool used to assess to presence and severity of erectile dysfunction. Scored from 5 to 25, with lower scores indicating less ED symptoms.</description>
