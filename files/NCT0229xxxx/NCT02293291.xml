      Although thermal therapy has been utilized in the rehabilitation of war veterans since the&#xD;
      Roman Empire, no investigations actually exist about the use of thermal therapy in GWI, This&#xD;
      due to the fact that nobody knows that the cure for the syndrome in GWI veterans may exist in&#xD;
      thermal therapy which is the primary objective of this investigation.&#xD;

      Gulf War illness (GWI) refers to the complex of symptoms that affects veterans of the&#xD;
      1990-1991 Gulf War at significantly excess rates. It is characterized by multiple diverse&#xD;
      symptoms not explained by established medical diagnoses or standard laboratory tests,&#xD;
      symptoms that typically include a combination of memory and concentration problems,&#xD;
      persistent headache, unexplained fatigue, and widespread pain, and can also include chronic&#xD;
      digestive difficulties, respiratory symptoms, and skin rashes. A similar profile of excess&#xD;
      symptoms has been described in every study of U.S. Gulf War veterans from different regions&#xD;
      and units, and in Gulf War veterans from the United Kingdom and other allied countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gulf War illness is not the only health condition related to Gulf War service, but it is by&#xD;
      far the most common. Gulf War illness prevalence estimates vary with the specific case&#xD;
      definition used. Studies consistently indicate, however, that an excess of 25 to 32 percent&#xD;
      of veterans who served in the 1990-1991 Gulf War are affected by a complex of multiple&#xD;
      symptoms, variously defined, over and above rates in contemporary military personnel who did&#xD;
      not deploy to the Gulf War. That means that between 175,000 and 210,000 of the nearly 700,000&#xD;
      U.S. veterans who served in the 1990-1991 Gulf War suffer from this persistent pattern of&#xD;
      symptoms as a result of their wartime service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has not supported early speculation that Gulf War illness is a stress-related&#xD;
      condition. Large population-based studies of Gulf War veterans consistently indicate that&#xD;
      Gulf War illness is not the result of combat or other deployment stressors, and that rates of&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychiatric conditions are relatively low in&#xD;
      Gulf War veterans. Gulf War illness differs fundamentally from trauma and stress-related&#xD;
      syndromes that have been described after other wars. No Gulf War illness-type problem, that&#xD;
      is, no widespread symptomatic illness not explained by medical or psychiatric diagnoses, has&#xD;
      been reported in veterans who served in Bosnia in the 1990s or in current conflicts in Iraq&#xD;
      and Afghanistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiologic studies indicate that rates of Gulf War illness vary in different subgroups of&#xD;
      Gulf War veterans. Gulf War illness affects veterans who served in the Army and Marines at&#xD;
      higher rates than those in the Navy and Air Force, and enlisted personnel more than officers.&#xD;
      Studies also indicate that Gulf War illness rates differ according to where veterans were&#xD;
      located during deployment, with highest rates among troops who served in forward areas. More&#xD;
      specifically, studies consistently show that the rate of Gulf War illness is associated with&#xD;
      particular exposures that veterans encountered during deployment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identified links between veteran-reported exposures and Gulf War illness have raised a great&#xD;
      deal of interest, but have also been the source of considerable confusion. The use of&#xD;
      self-reported exposure information raises a number of concerns, most obviously in relation to&#xD;
      recall bias. These concerns emphasize the importance of assessing findings across a broad&#xD;
      spectrum of studies, rather than relying on results from individual studies, and of&#xD;
      evaluating the impact of recall and other information bias on study results where possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 34-65% of Gulf War veterans (GWV) continue to suffer from chronic multi symptom&#xD;
      illness (CMI).Novel pharmacological treatment approaches are needed to improve the health of&#xD;
      these veterans. The current study aims to target neurological alterations that have been&#xD;
      described in veterans of the 1991Gulf War. In particular, a low lithium has been associated&#xD;
      with Gulf War deployment and symptoms of CMI. A correct Lithium level trough of dietary&#xD;
      supplement and external bath have effects on multiple systems, including the immune system,&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system, and the central nervous system, this system is a potential target&#xD;
      of treatment in CMI To be a factor in the multifactorial development of GWI, the American&#xD;
      Society of Thermalism and Climatology has reviewed each of the aggressive external factors&#xD;
      that the investigators veterans have been exposed to during their deployment in the Gulf and&#xD;
      the symptoms this exposure may cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After six months of study the investigators have concluded that the syndrome is a&#xD;
      multi-systematic response to multiple factors so the treatment must be multiple therapeutic&#xD;
      treatment. If the ones the investigators treat are man-nature unbalanced, the cure is to be&#xD;
      found in the balance so climatological hydro therapy is the first source to achieve this&#xD;
      balance (TA Silega theory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although thermal therapy has been utilized in the rehabilitation of war veterans since the&#xD;
      Roman Empire, no investigations actually exist about the use of thermal therapy in war&#xD;
      veterans with the knowledge that the cure for the syndrome in GWI veterans may exist in&#xD;
      thermal therapy which is the primary objective of this investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using data for the last 3 year for New York metropolitan VA office (2011-2013), will show&#xD;
      that' the incidence rates of GWI are significantly higher in these veterans whose plasma&#xD;
      contain a unbalance of electrolytes in special lithium than in veterans with normal&#xD;
      electrolytes levels ranging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results will suggest that lithium has moderating effects on suicidal and violent&#xD;
      criminal behavior at levels that may be encountered in GWI. Comparisons of lithium levels in&#xD;
      the respective veterans, with the incidences GWI from 2011-2013 also will produced&#xD;
      statistically significant inverse associations, whereas consistent associations will observed&#xD;
      with the reported GWI. These results will suggest that lithium at low dosage levels has a&#xD;
      generally beneficial effect on human behavior, which may be associated with the functions of&#xD;
      lithium as a nutritionally-essential trace element. Subject to confirmation by controlled&#xD;
      experiments with high-risk military populations, increasing the human lithium intakes by&#xD;
      supplementation, or the lithiation of drinking water in military bases campuses is suggested&#xD;
      as a possible means of GWI reduction at the individual and community level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lithium is a trace element that appears to be essential for higher animals (1, 2). However,&#xD;
      although the element is widely used at pharmacological dosages in the treatment of various&#xD;
      mental disorders (3), its effects at normal nutritional levels have not yet received much&#xD;
      attention. Dawson, Moore and McGanity (4) previously compared the lithium concentrations in&#xD;
      the regional drinking water supplies with the incidence of admissions and readmissions for&#xD;
      psychoses, neuroses, and personality disorders in Texas state mental hospitals and observed a&#xD;
      statistically significant inverse relationship. The same authors subsequently showed that the&#xD;
      homicide rates were also inversely correlated with the lithium levels in the drinking water&#xD;
      and the urinary excretion of lithium by normal residents in their respective areas (5). The&#xD;
      associations remained significant after consideration of possible confounding variables, such&#xD;
      as population density, the distance to the nearest state hospitals, and rainfall. Although&#xD;
      rainfall was positively correlated with the county rates of first mental hospital admission,&#xD;
      as well as with homicide rates, rainfall was also found to be inversely correlated with the&#xD;
      lithium levels in the drinking water and the urinary excretion of lithium by healthy&#xD;
      subjects, demonstrating a dilution effect of rainfall on the water supplies. With the suicide&#xD;
      rates, the association with water lithium levels was inverse, but did not reach statistical&#xD;
      significance. Since incidence data for only two years, 1967-1969, were used in these studies,&#xD;
      the investigators decided to reinvestigate the relationships between drinking water lithium&#xD;
      with homicide and suicide rates for 10 years, using data from 1978-1987, and extend the study&#xD;
      to other GWIs (rapes, robberies, thefts, burglaries, assault, motor vehicle theft, and the&#xD;
      total GWI rate). As the addiction to narcotics may be regarded as a self-destructive trait,&#xD;
      which thus could depend on the same environmental influences as suicide, comparisons were&#xD;
      also made between the drinking water lithium levels in the respective veterans and the&#xD;
      incidences of arrests for possession of opium, cocaine, and their derivatives (morphine,&#xD;
      heroin, and codeine), and possession of marijuana, as well as arrests for drunk driving and&#xD;
      using data from 2011-201 This research will suggest a beneficial effect of lithium at GWI.&#xD;
      These could be related to the roles of lithium as an essential trace element.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lithium as the carbonate at therapeutic dosage (300 mg/d) has previously been used to control&#xD;
      episodic outbreaks of rage among prisoners (10, 11) and in the management of drug abusers&#xD;
      (12). Animal experiments have demonstrated that lithium suppresses the cocaine-induced super-&#xD;
      sensitivity, as well as the super sensitivity induced by haloperidol, the kindling phenomenon&#xD;
      following the chronic application of pentylene-tetrazole, a central nervous system stimulant,&#xD;
      and head-twitching in response to the administration of mescaline (13). Furthermore, lithium&#xD;
      has been found to decrease distractibility by irrelevant stimuli and produce a&#xD;
      dose-independent improvement of selective attention to stimuli that provide detailed&#xD;
      information about the environment. It prevents behavioral alterations owing to social&#xD;
      isolation, lowers aggressively owing to confinement in isolated environments, and causes a&#xD;
      normalization of spontaneous motor activity (14). The majority of these effects may be&#xD;
      associated with the dampening of phosphoinositide-mediated neuro- transmission, which was&#xD;
      also suggested to explain the normalizing effects of lithium in treating both mania and&#xD;
      depression (15).&#xD;
