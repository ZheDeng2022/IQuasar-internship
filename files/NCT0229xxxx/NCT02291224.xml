    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate a multi-component, clinic-based intervention aimed at increasing&#xD;
      dual protection strategy selection and adherence among young African American females at an&#xD;
      urban family planning clinic. Dual protection is the use of contraceptive strategies to&#xD;
      prevent both unintended pregnancy (UIP) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This is&#xD;
      an unblinded randomized controlled trial; participants will either get the interactive&#xD;
      multimedia platform focused on DP strategies with intervention arm counseling or the standard&#xD;
      of care arm counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit 710 African American females aged 14-19 who are attending the Grady&#xD;
      Health System (GHS) Teen Services Clinic (TSC) in Atlanta, Georgia, for reproductive health&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will recruit and enroll 710 young women presenting to the clinic for clinical care&#xD;
      who have the following characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  self-identify as African American,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  14-19 years of age,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have had vaginal sex with a male partner in the past 6 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV-negative by self-report,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  not pregnant,verified by urine pregnancy test,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no desire to be pregnant in next 12 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  plan to stay in the Atlanta area for the next year,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are willing to provide contact information, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  were not previously enrolled in the pilot study of this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those enrolled will be in the study for 12 months. Young women who are eligible and give&#xD;
      written consent or assent for study participation will be enrolled. Half will be randomized&#xD;
      to the control arm, half to the intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control arm (standard of care) includes individual clinical care and standard of care&#xD;
           counseling consistent with protocols at the TSC, with study visits for data collection&#xD;
           at enrollment, 6 months, and 12 months, during which any medical care or counseling that&#xD;
           they would normally get will also be provided. Control arm participants will also get&#xD;
           telephone calls from clinic staff to update their contact information and remind them of&#xD;
           upcoming visits at 3 weeks and 5 months after the enrollment visit, and at 3 weeks and 5&#xD;
           months after the 6 month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention arm, consisting of the following intervention components:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Enrollment visit&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  A culturally-appropriate interactive multimedia platform focused on DP&#xD;
                     strategies and designed to prepare the individual for selection of a DP&#xD;
                     strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Individual intervention arm counseling to select the DP strategy that is best&#xD;
                     suited for the participant (by a clinic health care provider).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Individual intervention arm counseling to build skills for correct and&#xD;
                     consistent use of the selected DP strategy (by a nurse educator (NE)).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Booster counseling via phone at about 3 weeks and 5 months after the enrollment&#xD;
                visit, and at about 3 weeks and 5 months after the 6 month visit (by an NE).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. 6 month visit&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  An abbreviated version of the interactive multimedia platform focused on dual&#xD;
                     protection strategies and strategy adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Individual intervention arm counseling to reinforce skills for correct and&#xD;
                     consistent use of the DP strategy (by an NE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the final study visit at 12 months there is no difference between the counseling provided&#xD;
      to the two groups; participants in both arms will receive the clinic standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both arms of the study will follow the same data collection procedures&#xD;
      throughout the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At all three study visits, participants in both arms will receive urine pregnancy and&#xD;
           STI tests and complete an audio computer assisted self-interview (ACASI) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 3 and 9 months after enrollment, participants in both arms will receive a data&#xD;
           collection call with administration of a telephone questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, all participants will be encouraged to come in for evaluation if they&#xD;
      have any concerns. Any data from pregnancy or STI testing at these interim clinic visits will&#xD;
      be later collected via chart review. If participants seek reproductive health care at other&#xD;
      facilities during the study period, records will be requested with participant permission,&#xD;
      and data from pregnancy or STI testing at these outside clinic visits will be collected via&#xD;
      review of records received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will examine the efficacy of the intervention arm relative to control arm across the&#xD;
      following primary behavioral and biologic outcomes over the 12 months of follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Self-reported dual protection strategy selection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Self-reported dual protection strategy adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Incidence of pregnancy or infection with chlamydia, gonorrhea or trichomonas (as&#xD;
           confirmed by laboratory testing)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small pilot study was be conducted prior to the initiation of enrollment in the main study.&#xD;
