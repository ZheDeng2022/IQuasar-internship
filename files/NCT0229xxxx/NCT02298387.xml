        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have a histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or&#xD;
             unresectable for which there is no remaining standard curative therapy and no therapy&#xD;
             with a demonstrated survival benefit or they must be ineligible to receive such&#xD;
             therapy and/or have declined all such therapy. In addition, subjects must have a tumor&#xD;
             that is at least 1 cm in a single dimension and is radiographically apparent on CT or&#xD;
             MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. FFPE tumor tissue either fresh core needle biopsied or archived (two FFPE cores&#xD;
             preferred whenever possible) is required for participation in the study. If fresh&#xD;
             tissue is obtained, the core biopsy must be done at least â‰¥7 days prior to Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have received their last chemotherapy, non-anti-VEGF biologic, or&#xD;
             investigational therapy at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment, 6 weeks if the last&#xD;
             regimen included BCNU or mitomycin C, and 8 weeks if the last regimen was an anti-VEGF&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
