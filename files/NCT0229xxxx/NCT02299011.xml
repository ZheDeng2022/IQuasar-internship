  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the BIODEGRADE study is to evaluate clinical efficacy of the Orsiro&#xD;
      drug-eluting stent compared with Biomatrix drug-eluting stent, both of which have&#xD;
      biodegradable polymer for the treatment of all-comers' coronary artery diseases.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rate of in-stent restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has decreased&#xD;
      since the launching of drug-eluting stents (DES). However, restenosis still remains a problem&#xD;
      since PCI is being performed on more complex, calcified, tortuous and tough lesions.&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is still a controversy on whether these DES are more thrombogenic than&#xD;
      bare metal stent (BMS) because of inflammation related to the polymer coating and delayed&#xD;
      vessel healing due to the eluted drug despite of reduced restenosis. Therefore, works aiming&#xD;
      to reduce both restenosis and thrombotic event are still on-going in the field of&#xD;
      interventional cardiology, and there has been a rush of various third generation DES with&#xD;
      &quot;biodegradable polymer&quot;. Recently, Orsiro hybrid DES (Biotronik AG, Bulach, Switzeland) has&#xD;
      been developed. The Orsiro DES incorporated optimally combined two kind of polymer onto&#xD;
      thinner cobalt-chromium backbone (60um) compared with earlier type of DES. The BIOlute®&#xD;
      active component is a bioabsorbable polymer matrix combined with an anti-proliferative drug,&#xD;
      sirolimus, that is released in a controlled manner leaving only the PROBIO® coated stent in&#xD;
      the long-term. The PROBIO® passive coating encapsulates the stent and eliminates interaction&#xD;
      between the metal stent and the surrounding tissue. To date, Orsiro stent showed excellent&#xD;
      results in terms of late lumen loss at 9 months in first-in-man single arm trial comparing&#xD;
      the historical results of other DES (BIOFLOW-I trial), and RCT with non-inferiority design,&#xD;
      comparing late lumen loss at 9 months of Orsiro versus everolimus-eluting stent (Xience&#xD;
      prime®) is ongoing (BIOFLOW-II trial). However, there have been no trials comparing the&#xD;
      Orsiro stent versus the Biomatrix stent (Biosensors Inc, Newport Beach, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter, randomized, open label, parallel arm study will evaluate whether the&#xD;
      innovative newer generation stent, Orsiro hybrid DES, is non-inferior to the third generation&#xD;
      stent, Biomatrix stent, in terms of 18 months late lumen loss.&#xD;
