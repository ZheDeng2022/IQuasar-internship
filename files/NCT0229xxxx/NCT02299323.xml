      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate radiographic outcomes, intra-operative&#xD;
      parameters, clinical outcomes, and patient satisfaction following circumferential fusion&#xD;
      using the INDEPENDENCE® integrated plate and spacer with REVOLVE® Stabilization System for&#xD;
      the treatment of severe low back pain due to lumbar disc degeneration unresponsive to 6&#xD;
      months of non-operative treatment.&#xD;

      A total of thirty subjects will be enrolled at Scott &amp; White Healthcare. The INDEPENDENCE&#xD;
      spacer will be filled with autogenous bone graft material. The devices subject to this&#xD;
      Agreement have received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the indications specified in this&#xD;
      Agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 2 years with evaluations at the following time intervals:&#xD;
      preoperatively (within 2 months of surgery) and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months, 12 months, and 24 months.&#xD;
