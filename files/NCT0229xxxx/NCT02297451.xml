      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is a form of vascular access for haemodialysis. An AVF is&#xD;
      normally created at the level of the wrist, but occasionally it is created in the elbow when&#xD;
      there is no suitable vessel in the forearm. The most common type of elbow (antecubital)&#xD;
      fistula (AFF) is a brachiocephalic fistula, which carries significantly higher risk of steal&#xD;
      syndrome (AVF-associated hand ischaemia) than wrist fistulas. More recently, AFF using&#xD;
      proximal radial or ulnar artery as inflow has been described and shown to have a lower rate&#xD;
      of Steal syndrome than brachiocephalic fistula. This study aims to investigate the incidence&#xD;
      of steal syndrome between AFF using brachial artery and that using the proximal radial/ulnar&#xD;
      artery as inflow.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) are the safest form of vascular access for long-term&#xD;
      haemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal failure. The strategy in creating an AVF in&#xD;
      the upper limbs is to start at a distal site and if that fails, to attempt an AVF on a more&#xD;
      proximal site i.e. from wrist, forearm to elbow. The most common type of AVF is the&#xD;
      radiocephalic AVF at the wrist. A more proximal AVF is often created as a primary procedure&#xD;
      when there is poor vasculature in the distal forearm or as a secondary procedure when a wrist&#xD;
      fistula has failed. Traditionally, brachiocephalic fistulas (BCF), which involves&#xD;
      anastomosing the cephalic vein to the brachial artery, have been the most common type of AVF&#xD;
      created in the antecubital fossa at the elbow level. Other common types of antecubital fossa&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula (AFF) are the brachiobasilic (BBF) and brachio-median cubital AVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steal syndrome relates to hand ischaemia associated with AVF creation, and is a major risk of&#xD;
      AVF formation. The symptoms of steal syndrome ranges from cold extremities, numbness, hand&#xD;
      claudication (pain after exercise), to rest pain and tissue loss. Steal syndrome can also be&#xD;
      measured by Digital Brachial Pressure Index. Severe steal syndrome is debilitating, and&#xD;
      limb-threatening, and requires surgical revision or ligation of the AVF. This leads to&#xD;
      additional surgical risks and loss of dialysis vascular access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes and the types of AVF have been found to be independent risk factors for developing&#xD;
      steal syndrome following AVF creation1. The highest risk is seen in patients with a proximal&#xD;
      AVF i.e. BCF/BBF; up to 50% of patients in some studies, compared to 5-8% in all upper limb&#xD;
      AVFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative technique that may reduce risk of steal in this group of patients is to&#xD;
      anastomose the vein to the radial artery or ulnar artery, distal to the brachial artery&#xD;
      bifurcation. This technique, theoretically, will only 'steal' blood from one artery e.g.&#xD;
      radial artery if the anastomosis is created on the proximal radial artery so blood flow can&#xD;
      therefore be maintained by the ulnar arterial system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have suggested that using the proximal radial or ulnar artery reduced the risk&#xD;
      of steal to as low as 0% to 3%. The type of arterial inflow to an AFF is therefore a&#xD;
      potentially significant factor in causing steal syndrome. There is, however, no current&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial to prove this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of steal syndrome varies greatly in the literature. Some studies have defined&#xD;
      steal syndrome as the presence of mild symptoms such as cold hand, while the others reported&#xD;
      steal syndrome when it was severe enough to require surgical intervention. This has led to&#xD;
      the huge variations in the incidence of steal syndrome being reported and has made comparison&#xD;
      difficult between studies. A few scoring systems to describe the severity of steal syndrome&#xD;
      have been suggested in previous studies, but none of them has been widely used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the difference in the severity of steal between the two intervention groups&#xD;
      will be investigated. This will be done using the Hoek score, which was originally used by&#xD;
      Hoek et al in 2006 to report steal syndrome associated with the AVFs created in their centre.&#xD;
      There was, however, no comparison of scores among the different types of AVF.&#xD;
