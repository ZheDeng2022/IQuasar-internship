    <description>PedsQL includes a child self-report (CS-R) for participants 5 to 18 years and parents' report (PR) of participants 2 to 18 years. CS-R: 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales report includes 4 scales, Physical (P), Emotional (E), Social (S), and School Functioning (SF). PR: 21-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales report includes P, E, S, and SF scales. Each item used a 5-point rating scale ( from 0=never to 4=almost always). Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0 (almost always) -100 (never) scale. Higher score indicates better Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). P, E, S and SF summary scores are calculated as mean of respective functioning items. Psychosocial Health Summary Score is calculated as mean of 13 or 15 items (E, S and SF). Generic core total scale score is calculated as the mean of all the 21 or 23 items (P, E, S and SF). All summary/total scores are mean of specific items and they all have values ranges from 0 to 100, where higher score=better HRQoL.</description>

        <description>Serum samples for immunogenicity assessment were analyzed to detect ADA. ADA response were categorized as: treatment emergent antibody i.e. treatment-induced/treatment-boosted response. A participant whose ADA status was positive anytime post-baseline and was negative or missing at baseline was considered to have treatment induced ADA. A participant whose ADA status was positive at baseline (pre-existing ADA) and the ADA titer level anytime post-baseline was significantly higher than that at baseline is considered to have treatment boosted ADA. Positive samples in the ADA assay were further analyzed in the NAb assay as positive NAb inhibition of catalytic activity and positive NAb inhibition of cellular uptake.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Height Z-Scores at Week 52</title>
        <description>Z-score for height of participants was evaluated. Height Z-Score, i.e., the height-for-age Z Score, is the number of standard deviations of the actual height of a child from the median height of the children of the corresponding age and sex as determined from the standard sample. A height Z-score of 0 is equal to the median and is considered normal. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the median and positive numbers indicate values higher than the median. For analysis, mean Z-score was calculated and an increase of mean height Z-score from baseline indicates an improvement on growth.</description>

These 7 categories were converted to scores as follows: 3 = marked improvement of daily activities, 2 = moderate improvement of daily activities, 1 = mild improvement of daily activities, 0 = no change, -1 = mild worsening of daily activities, -2 = moderate worsening of daily activities, -3 = marked worsening of daily activities where higher score indicated improvement in daily activities as compared to baseline. In this outcome measure, observed scores of participant's clinical status at Week 52 are reported.</description>

          <title>Physician's Global Assessment of Participant's Progress: Observed Scores at Week 52</title>
          <description>Physician assessed participant's current clinical status (refers to clinical status at Week 52 in comparison to Baseline) was evaluated by marking 1 of the following 7 categories: • marked improvement, • moderate improvement, • mild improvement, • no change, • mild worsening, • moderate worsening, or • marked worsening. These 7 categories were converted to scores as follows: 3 = marked improvement of daily activities, 2 = moderate improvement of daily activities, 1 = mild improvement of daily activities, 0 = no change, -1 = mild worsening of daily activities, -2 = moderate worsening of daily activities, -3 = marked worsening of daily activities where higher score indicated improvement in daily activities as compared to baseline. In this outcome measure, observed scores of participant's clinical status at Week 52 are reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Outcome Questionnaires : Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) Generic Core Total Scale Scores at Week 52</title>
        <description>PedsQL includes a child self-report (CS-R) for participants 5 to 18 years and parents' report (PR) of participants 2 to 18 years. CS-R: 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales report includes 4 scales, Physical (P), Emotional (E), Social (S), and School Functioning (SF). PR: 21-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales report includes P, E, S, and SF scales. Each item used a 5-point rating scale ( from 0=never to 4=almost always). Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0 (almost always) -100 (never) scale. Higher score indicates better Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). P, E, S and SF summary scores are calculated as mean of respective functioning items. Psychosocial Health Summary Score is calculated as mean of 13 or 15 items (E, S and SF). Generic core total scale score is calculated as the mean of all the 21 or 23 items (P, E, S and SF). All summary/total scores are mean of specific items and they all have values ranges from 0 to 100, where higher score=better HRQoL.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52 (last assessment)</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis performed on mITT population. Number of participants analyzed=participants with available data. PedsQL includes CS-R age 5 to18 (scoring categories 5 to 7, 8 to 12 and 13 to 18 years); PR age 2 to 18 (scoring categories 2 to 4, 5 to 7, 8 to 12 and 13 to 18 years). Since PedsQL scoring age categories are not the same as the age cohort defined for the study and since this is a single arm study, overall mITT population with available data is reported for this outcome.</population>
