      This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NEM® brand eggshell membrane&#xD;
      in patients with grades 2 and 3 knee osteoarthritis (OA) having significant joint pain and&#xD;
      stiffness, in a large, multi-center clinical trial. Improvement in joint pain and stiffness,&#xD;
      if any, will be evaluated using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis&#xD;
      index ((WOMAC; v LK3.1: Turkish language translation). Improvement in knee range of motion&#xD;
      (ROM), if any, will be measured by goniometer.&#xD;

             with routine laboratory and X-RAY degeneration detection methods. Subjects must have&#xD;
             2nd or 3rd grade knee osteoarthritis diagnose according to the Kellgren Lawrance&#xD;
             criteria as a result of the knee graph determined with Anteroposterior (AP) graph&#xD;
             method while standing on referencing American College of Rheumatology (ACR) or The&#xD;
             European Leauge Aganist Rheumatism (EULAR) 2010.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Subject must have mild to moderate persistent joint pain lasting for at least 3 months&#xD;
             with a score of at least 15 mm on a Patient's Assessment of Joint pain - WOMAC&#xD;
