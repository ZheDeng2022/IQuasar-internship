  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to determine whether a group-based parent support program (&quot;Family&#xD;
      Startup&quot;) can lead to early improved parental sense of competence, family relations, and&#xD;
      child development. Evaluation is based on a randomized controlled trial, with half of the&#xD;
      participants receiving Family Startup and the other half receiving treatment as usual.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some knowledge exists about effectiveness of high-intensity delivery of parenting support to&#xD;
      subsets of at risk families. To the best of our knowledge, however, little is known about&#xD;
      effects of universal primary prevention programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Family Startup Program is a structured format for implementing pre- and postnatal&#xD;
      parenting support groups that prepare new families for their roles as parents as well as&#xD;
      focus on enhancing parents' social network. The Family Startup Program gathers couples in&#xD;
      groups and introduces participants to informal sources of support (e.g. by meeting and&#xD;
      interacting with other new families) and to a broad range of community resources (e.g.&#xD;
      financial advisers, child dentist, local solicitors, family counselors) providing them with&#xD;
      information and parenting skills. The program content includes handling family finance,&#xD;
      choice of paternity leave, couple communication, breastfeeding, network formation, ensuring&#xD;
      dental health, sensitivity toward child signals, child rearing discipline, help-seeking&#xD;
      behavior, home safety, and more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second formulated rational behind the program is that strengthening father involvement,&#xD;
      social network formation and access to family services will serve to enhance family&#xD;
      relationships, including parenting, coparenting and couple relationship quality. Through&#xD;
      participation in Family Startup, families receive a long term connection with a health&#xD;
      visitor in the community and are introduced to a broad range of community services. This can&#xD;
      be expected to benefit optimal health service utility and ease access to resources for&#xD;
      families and children with need. Improved child outcome are the ultimate goal. No scientific&#xD;
      evaluation of program effects of the Family Startup program on child or family outcome was&#xD;
      previously conducted.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Parents, mothers as well as their partners, expecting their first child in the&#xD;
        municipality of Aarhus are eligible for the study. This is because of the universal nature&#xD;
        of the original program. Mothers are included if interested regardless of the fathers'&#xD;
        decline. Biological fathers, registered partners, as well as non-registered partners are&#xD;
        eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents are excluded from the study if they are under the age of 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not capable of managing own legal affairs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Choose not to accept any routine pregnancy scans. These exclusion criteria are chosen&#xD;
             to secure that study participants are legally responsible and that we are able to&#xD;
             recruit them via the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in connection with the&#xD;
             nuchal translucency scan around week 12&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The father or partner is not included if the mother declines participation. The mother&#xD;
             can choose to attend the Family Startup Program with a friend (i.e. a sister, friend&#xD;
             or neighbor) but friends are not eligible for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Finally, individuals are excluded if they are not able to understand the Danish oral&#xD;
             presentation of the study information and hence cannot give informed consent&#xD;
