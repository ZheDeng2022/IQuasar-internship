  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this application is to understand the connection between people's eating habits&#xD;
      and the risk for developing diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than a third of U.S. adults are obese (BMI greater than 30), 8-12% of adults suffer from&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, and up to 30% of adults have pre-diabetes. Recent research studies have&#xD;
      suggested that it is not just what we eat, but also when we eat that may put us at risk for&#xD;
      obesity and type 2 diabetes. Skipping breakfast and eating late at night have been associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), substantiated by recent animal&#xD;
      and human experimental studies showing that altered meal timing itself, without changes in&#xD;
      caloric intake, can influence weight regulation and impaired glucose tolerance. This research&#xD;
      will determine in prediabetic and non-diabetic participants whether delaying meal times&#xD;
      worsens glucose tolerance, leads to physiological changes favoring a positive energy balance,&#xD;
      and increases caloric intake. This research will provide mechanistic insights into the&#xD;
      metabolic consequences of changing meal timing and may help in evidence-based approaches to&#xD;
      improve dietary interventions in the fight against obesity and T2D.&#xD;
