  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a history of blood clots are at risk of developing additional clots in the&#xD;
      future. Doctors use a tool called a clinical decision rule to tell them how likely it is that&#xD;
      a patient has a blood clot and if they should have further testing to look for the clot. This&#xD;
      tool may cause doctors to over-diagnosis a recurrent clot because the symptoms may be left&#xD;
      over from the previous clot. Correctly diagnosing a recurrent blood clot is very important&#xD;
      since there are risks associated with both over-diagnosis and under-diagnosis. If a recurrent&#xD;
      blood clot is missed (under-diagnosis) the patient is at risk of death from a clot in the&#xD;
      lungs. If blood thinners are prescribed when they are not needed (over-diagnosis), the&#xD;
      patient may have to take blood thinners for their lifetime and risk having serious bleeding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several tools have been developed to standardize the diagnostic management of a suspected&#xD;
      first blood clot. One of these tools is the use of a clinical decision rule. Clinical&#xD;
      decision rules have been designed to help clinicians make diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      decisions at the bedside. A score is computed on the presence of some criteria from the&#xD;
      patient's medical history, clinical signs and symptoms. The score provides the probability of&#xD;
      a blood clot. The rules can be used in combinations with a simple blood test - called D-dimer&#xD;
      - to identify patients at low risk who don't require diagnostic imaging testing. Benefits&#xD;
      include reduced costs, length in hospital and radiation exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with prior blood clots have been shown to be less likely to benefit from the&#xD;
      non-invasive testing. Therefore, they often need to undergo imaging tests, which are&#xD;
      frequently difficult to interpret in patients with prior blood clots since residual clots are&#xD;
      often present and are difficult to distinguish from a recurrent clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to try to prospectively assess the role of existing clinical&#xD;
      decision rules in patients with prior blood clots, and to attempt to improve them in order to&#xD;
      increase the yield of non-invasive testing and to reduce the risk of over-diagnosis with&#xD;
      imaging tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to this study, clots within the deep veins of the legs are called deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis (DVT), while clots in the lungs are called pulmonary embolism (PE).&#xD;
