      The study will collect the clinical and biological data of the patients, the investigators&#xD;
      could further analyse and identify the risk factors and optimize clinical treatment method.&#xD;
      Besides, population-based healthy people with informed consent are also collected.&#xD;

      Menopause is the last step in the process of ovarian ageing. Decrease in follicle numbers&#xD;
      dictates the onset of cycle irregularity and the cessation of menses. At the same time,&#xD;
      decaying in oocyte quality contributes to the gradual decline in fertility. Endocrine changes&#xD;
      mainly depend on the decline in the negative feedback by ovarian factors at the&#xD;
      hypothalamo-pituitary unit. The declining antral follicle cohort(AFC) with age first results&#xD;
      in gradually elevated FSH levels. The gradual decline in the size of AFC is best represented&#xD;
      by decreasing levels of anti-Mullerian hormone. The identification of women who have severely&#xD;
      decreased ovarian reserve is clinically relevant. Ovarian reserve tests have appeared to be&#xD;
      fairly accurate in predicting response to ovarian stimulation in the assisted reproductive&#xD;
      technology (ART) setting. The capacity to predict the chances for spontaneous pregnancy or&#xD;
      pregnancy after ART appears very limited. As menopause and the preceding decline in oocyte&#xD;
      quality seem to have a fixed time interval, tests that predict the age at menopause may be&#xD;
      useful to assess individual reproductive lifespan like genetic studies, ovarian ageing&#xD;
      mechanism studies and epigenetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart disease remains a major cause of death among women in China. We focuses on physiologic&#xD;
      endogenous sex steroid levels and heart disease especially for CAD among postmenopausal women&#xD;
      with natural or surgical menopause. Now there are more and more reasons to seek evidence for&#xD;
      associations of circulating estrogen or other endogenous sex steroid levels and CAD. In the&#xD;
      future, we design a cohort study to confirm whether ovarian sex steroid hormonal changes is&#xD;
      associated with CAD postmenopausal women, or there may be other components explaining the&#xD;
      gender differences in CAD patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature ovarian failure(POF), is a disorder of infertility characterized by amenorrhoea,&#xD;
      low estrogen levels and increased gonadotropin levels in women aged &lt;40 years. POF is the&#xD;
      result of premature exhaustion of the follicle pool or can be attributed to follicular&#xD;
      dysfunction, for example, owing to mutations in the FSH receptor or steroidogenic cell&#xD;
      autoimmunity. Moreover, advances in cancer therapeutics over the past decades have led to&#xD;
      increasing survival rates for both paediatric and adult malignancies. Given the gonadotoxic&#xD;
      effect of many cancer treatments, more women develop POF. Markers that predict whether women&#xD;
      are at risk of POF would, therefore, aid in early diagnosis and fertility counselling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The history of past and present status has been taken in our research. Women on the process&#xD;
      of natural aging and disease-induced ovarian aging are all included. The key factors that&#xD;
      influence ovary aging may be identified by epidemiological and molecular biological research.&#xD;
