      Background: It is well documented that individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) respond&#xD;
      well during evidence-based psychological treatment, but also that a large proportion relapse&#xD;
      when discharged from treatment and confronted with alcohol in real life. Cue Exposure Therapy&#xD;
      (CET) focuses on confronting alcohol cues in order to reduce cravings as well as the&#xD;
      likelihood of relapse. The aim of this study is to investigate whether CET as aftercare&#xD;
      increases the efficiency of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) among AUD individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methods: The study is implemented as an investigator-blinded randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. A total of 300 consecutively enrolled AUD patients, recruited from an alcohol&#xD;
      outpatient clinic will be randomized to one of the three following aftercare treatment&#xD;
      groups: (A) CET as a smartphone application (n = 100); (B) CET as group therapy (n = 100),&#xD;
      and (C) Aftercare as Usual (n = 100). It is hypothesized that the two experimental groups&#xD;
      ((A) and (B)) will achieve better treatment outcomes as compared to the control group ((C)),&#xD;
      and It will be explored whether CET as smartphone application is as effective as CET as group&#xD;
      therapy. The groups will be compared in a number of parameters including alcohol intake,&#xD;
      cravings and copings-strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: If the hypothesis, that CET increases the efficiency of CBT is verified, it will&#xD;
      make sense to supplement CBT with CET as aftercare, hence, reintegrating CET within a CBT&#xD;
      approach. Although, CET is most often regarded as one of the behavioral methods in CBT, there&#xD;
      appears to be segregation in the empirical literature when it comes to treatment of addictive&#xD;
      disorders. However, CET may allow the patient to practice and gain control over alcohol cue&#xD;
      reactivity and associated high-risk situations in an inter-mediating therapeutic context&#xD;
      before the patients inevitably are confronted by them. In this way, one might expect the&#xD;
      transition from treatment to daily life less overwhelming and CET may help prevent relapse in&#xD;
      the long term. Thus, CET may be particularly suitable as aftercare.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND It is well documented that individuals with Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) respond&#xD;
      well during Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, but that a large proportion of individuals relapse&#xD;
      after treatment when confronted with alcohol in real life. Therefore, future treatment&#xD;
      interventions for long-term prevention of relapse should aim to teach how to apply coping&#xD;
      strategies and regain control over their alcohol cravings in their daily confrontations with&#xD;
      alcohol and associated stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cue Exposure Treatment (CET) is a behavioural psychological approach that focuses on&#xD;
      confronting alcohol cues in order to reduce cravings as well as the likelihood of relapse.&#xD;
      During CET individuals are exposed to alcohol related stimuli whilst their usual drink&#xD;
      responses are hindered. Thus, they are given the opportunity to practice coping strategies&#xD;
      during exposure to alcohol. In this way, it is predicted that individual's learned automatic&#xD;
      responses will extinguish over time and that their cognitive control over cue reactivity&#xD;
      strengthens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental health care applications, has the potential to improve alcohol treatment and&#xD;
      continuing care by offering psychological treatment anywhere and when the patient find it&#xD;
      convenient. Because, psychological treatment is a substantial socio-economic burden when&#xD;
      delivered in individual sessions, there has been a tendency to deliver the relevant treatment&#xD;
      through group sessions. However, mental healthcare applications, have even more potential in&#xD;
      order to reduce the burden on the health care system, in addition to increasing the&#xD;
      availability of evidence-based treatment. Whilst group sessions are documented effective,&#xD;
      behavioural healthcare applications targeting AUD needs further exploration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is three-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate whether manual-based CET delivered via a smartphone or in group sessions&#xD;
           increases the efficiency of CBT outpatient treatment in groups of AUD individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether CET as a smartphone application is as or more effective than CET&#xD;
           group therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate whether CET as smartphone intervention will show to be more&#xD;
           cost-effective than CET delivered in group sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND METHODS The study is implemented as an investigator-blinded, randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. A total of 300 consecutively enrolled AUD individuals, recruited from an alcohol&#xD;
      outpatient clinic will be randomized to one of the three following aftercare treatment&#xD;
      groups: (1) CET as a smartphone application; (2) CET as group therapy, and (3) Standard&#xD;
      aftercare treatment. Individuals in group 1 are required to use the smartphone application&#xD;
      five times a week for eight weeks. Individuals in group 2 are required to have CET group&#xD;
      therapy every other week for eight weeks. Individuals in group 3 will receive one individual&#xD;
      follow-up session eight weeks after the primary treatment has ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized a priori that the two experimental groups will achieve better treatment&#xD;
      outcomes as compared to the control group (3). No a priori hypotheses guides comparisons of&#xD;
      the effect of CET delivered via group sessions and smartphone application. Two-sided analyses&#xD;
      are conducted here, because there is no empirical literature in this specific area to&#xD;
      generate a priori hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The groups will be compared pre- and post-aftercare treatment, according to the following&#xD;
      parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Relapse and alcohol intake, as measured with the Time-Line-Follow-Back (TLFB) method;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cravings, measured with Desires for Alcohol Questionnaire (DAQ), Obsessive-Compulsive&#xD;
           Drinking Scale (OCDS), and Visual Analogue Scale for Craving (VAS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Coping skills, operationalized with Urge-Specific Strategies Questionnaire (USS)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data will be collected at three different time-points: before entering aftercare&#xD;
           treatment (baseline), after eight weeks (follow-up), and again after six month&#xD;
           (follow-up). In addition, we will follow the patients through medical registers for one&#xD;
           year in order to measure relapse in the longer term, without the challenges associated&#xD;
           with getting contact one year after ended treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data from registers: The National Patient Register, The National Health Service&#xD;
           Register, The National Prescription Registry and The Psychiatric Central Research&#xD;
           Register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat analyses (ITT) will be carried out for all outpatients. With regard to&#xD;
      incomplete data, &quot;last observation carried forward&quot; (LOCF) and multiple imputations will be&#xD;
      used. Completer (on-treatment) analyses will be carried out for patients who have completed&#xD;
      the respective interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Odense Patient data Explorative Network (OPEN) data manager develops electronic schemes for&#xD;
      data entry. Data will be imported and stored in OPEN Projects.&#xD;
