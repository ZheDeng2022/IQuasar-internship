      Hurler disease - MPS I- (mucopolysaccharidosis I) is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder&#xD;
      caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase, a lysosomal enzyme normally required for the&#xD;
      breakdown of certain complex carbohydrates known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). If the enzyme&#xD;
      is not present in sufficient quantities, the normal breakdown of GAGs is incomplete or&#xD;
      blocked. The cell is then unable to excrete the carbohydrate residues and they accumulate in&#xD;
      the lysosomes of the cell. This accumulation disrupts the cell's normal functioning and gives&#xD;
      rise to the clinical manifestations of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of MPS I is estimated to be at about 1 in 100,000 births. It is inherited in an&#xD;
      autosomal recessive manner, affects males and females equally, and in most cases, both&#xD;
      parents of an affected child are asymptomatic carriers of the disease. Types of MPS I.&#xD;
      Children diagnosed with MPS I have historically been classified into one of three categories&#xD;
      based on the severity of their symptoms and rate of disease progression. It has now become&#xD;
      clear, however, that there is a wide spectrum of severity in MPS I with much overlap between&#xD;
      the categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Hurler Syndrome: The most severe form of MPS I is characterized by progressive&#xD;
      developmental delay and severe progressive physical problems. Death often occurs before 10&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Hurler-Scheie Syndrome: The intermediate form of MPS I is characterized by normal or near&#xD;
      normal intelligence but more severe physical symptoms than those with Scheie Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Scheie Syndrome: The attenuated form of MPS I is characterized by normal intelligence,&#xD;
      usually normal height, and milder physical problems than Hurler-Scheie. These individuals&#xD;
      potentially have a normal life span.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients present within the first year of life with musculoskeletal alterations including&#xD;
      short stature, dysostosis multiplex, thoracic-lumbar kyphosis, progressive coarsening of the&#xD;
      facial features including large head with bulging frontal bones, depressed nasal bridge with&#xD;
      broad nasal tip and anteverted nostrils, full cheeks and enlarged lips, cardiomyopathy and&#xD;
      valvular abnormalities, neurosensorial hearing loss, enlarged tonsils and adenoids, and nasal&#xD;
      secretion. Developmental delay is usually observed between 12 and 24 months of life and is&#xD;
      primarily in the speech realm with progressive cognitive and sensorial deterioration.&#xD;
      Hydrocephaly can occur after the age of two. Diffuse corneal compromise leading to corneal&#xD;
      opacity becomes detectable from three years of age. Other manifestations include&#xD;
      organomegaly, hernias and hirsutism. MPS1 syndrome is caused by mutations in the IDUA gene&#xD;
      (4p16.3) leading to complete deficiency in the alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme and lysosomal&#xD;
      accumulation of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Transmission is autosomal recessive.&#xD;
      Early diagnosis is difficult because the first clinical signs are not specific, but it is&#xD;
      very important to allow early treatment. Diagnosis is based on detection of increased urinary&#xD;
      excretion of heparan and dermatan sulfate by 1, 9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMB) test and&#xD;
      glycosaminoglycan (GAG) electrophoresis, and demonstration of enzymatic deficiency in&#xD;
      leukocytes or fibroblasts. Genetic testing is available. Differential diagnoses include the&#xD;
      milder form of mucopolysaccharidosis type 1, the MPS1-Scheie syndrome, although this form is&#xD;
      associated with developmental delay with only slight cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic&#xD;
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future&#xD;
      the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from&#xD;
      the plasma of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose&#xD;
      and thereby with an earlier treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though MPS1 disease is a pan-ethnic disorder, the prevalence of this autosomal-recessive&#xD;
      disorder is elevated in countries with a higher frequency of consanguinity. Therefore, we&#xD;
      estimate that every 400th newborn in Arabian countries may be eligible for inclusion due to&#xD;
      high-grade suspicion of MPS1 disease, while approximately every 2000th newborn in a&#xD;
      non-Arabian country may be eligible.&#xD;

      Laboratory Blood Test&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectometry, a blood&#xD;
      sample of maximal 10 ml blood will be taken via using a dry blood spot filter card. To proof&#xD;
      the correct MPS1 diagnosis in those patients where up to the enrolment in the study no&#xD;
      genetic testing has been done, sequencing of MPS1 will be done. The analyses will be done at&#xD;
      the Centogene AG Am Strande 7 18055 Rostock Germany&#xD;
