      The purpose of this pilot study is to test the efficacy of the physical activity (PA)&#xD;
      intervention protocol to increase preschoolers overall PA levels and time spent in moderate&#xD;
      to vigorous PA (MVPA) at the day care setting. The PA intervention includes the Healthy&#xD;
      Opportunities for Preschoolers manual, a compilation of locomotor, gross motor and movement&#xD;
      based activities developed for preschoolers and successfully piloted for feasibility in 3 to&#xD;
      5 year old preschoolers by Drs. Viviene Temple, Justen O'Connor, and Patti-Jean Naylor. As&#xD;
      well, the PA intervention includes educational workshops for the day care providers, ongoing&#xD;
      biweekly facilitation and troubleshooting sessions with a Master Trainer, and the equipment&#xD;
      necessary to implement the program. The study is also evaluating the efficacy of the PA&#xD;
      intervention to decrease the amount of time spent in sedentary behaviour at the day care&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include evaluating the effects of the PA intervention on preschool&#xD;
      children's anthropometrics, and fundamental and gross motor skills. In addition, the&#xD;
      intervention is also assessing the effects of the program on day care provider's attitudes,&#xD;
      control beliefs, and self-efficacy toward incorporating PA into the day care curriculum.&#xD;

      Background &amp; Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective measures of physical activity (PA) using accelerometers (motion sensors worn at the&#xD;
      hip) reveal that preschoolers level of sedentary behaviour are high, and levels of moderate&#xD;
      to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) are low (Pate et al., 2004, Reilly et al., 2004, 2006).&#xD;
      Inquiry into preschoolers daily levels of PA suggest that 2.6% to 4% of waking hours are&#xD;
      spent in MVPA (Reilly, 2004, 2006;Montgomery et al. 2004), and, during pre-school hours, Pate&#xD;
      and colleagues found that 3 to 5 year old children engaged in 7.7 minutes of MVPA. A recent&#xD;
      study of Canadian preschoolers found remarkably similar levels of MVPA (Temple et al., 2009),&#xD;
      that include 12.3 minutes of MVPA per day and 39.5 minutes of sedentary behaviour per hour.&#xD;
      Although Pate et al. 2004 found that boys had higher levels of MVPA than girls, they did not&#xD;
      detect differences in levels of sedentary behaviour, which constituted the vast majority of&#xD;
      time for boys and girls. The findings suggest that young children are very inactive and&#xD;
      therefore may be at risk for adverse health consequences related to physical inactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opportunities for PA and motor development in early childhood may, over the lifespan,&#xD;
      influence health behaviours and the potential to maintain a healthy body weight. Fundamental&#xD;
      movement skills (e.g., catching, throwing, jumping, running, etc.) are the essential building&#xD;
      blocks for the acquisition of more refined and complicated skills that can be applied later&#xD;
      in life, such as sporting, recreational and physical activities (Gallahue et al. 2002; Carson&#xD;
      1994; Seefeldt, 1979). However, movement skills will not develop to their potential without&#xD;
      opportunities to practice in environments that are stimulating and supportive (Kelly et al.,&#xD;
      1989; Taggart &amp; Keegan, 1997). Butcher &amp; Eaton found that preschoolers movement competence&#xD;
      already influenced their PA choices and levels. It is the mastery of motor skills and the&#xD;
      ability of children to incorporate these skills into games, dances, and sports of one's&#xD;
      culture that provides the stimulus for movement which contributes to long-term health&#xD;
      (Seefeldt &amp; Vogel, 1987).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity of information on current trends in PA of preschool aged children, and on&#xD;
      the relationship between the ability of children to perform fundamental movement skills and&#xD;
      prediction of PA (Mackenzie et al 2003). The few studies noted above indicate that preschool&#xD;
      aged children do not come close to being physically active enough to accrue health benefits.&#xD;
      In fact, although the evidence of how much and what type of PA is necessary to optimize&#xD;
      health and development of preschool-aged children is somewhat unclear (Timmons et al., 2007),&#xD;
      expert consensus suggests that preschool-aged children should not be sedentary for more than&#xD;
      60 minutes at a time, except when sleeping, and they should engage in at least 60 minutes&#xD;
      (and up to several hours) of structured (facilitated by day care providers, parents, etc. )&#xD;
      and 60 minutes of unstructured PA daily, as well as 180 mins of total PA (National&#xD;
      Association for Sport &amp; Physical Education, NASPE, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In keeping with the settings-based approach to health promotion, which acknowledges the&#xD;
      influence of place on behaviour (Dooris et al. 2007), it is believed that powerful influences&#xD;
      on children's PA levels are the social and physical environments in which they spend time&#xD;
      (Bower et al., 2008; Dowda et al., 2004; Finn eta l., 2002). Over half of all Canadian&#xD;
      children aged 6 months to 5 years were in some form of nonparental/guardian care in&#xD;
      2002-2003, and children spent an average of 29 hours a week in these day care settings&#xD;
      (Bushnik , 2006; Silver 2000). The majority of Canadian children in both two parent and&#xD;
      single parent families fall into this category as 77% of two parent families and 75% of&#xD;
      single parent families rely on day care for their children. As such, the paid child day care&#xD;
      setting provides an ideal opportunity to examine and enhance the movement skills and PA&#xD;
      behaviours of preschool-aged children. There is a small body of evidence that suggests that&#xD;
      group preschool and child care settings, policies and practices strongly influence children's&#xD;
      PA (Finn et al., 2002; Pate et al., 2004; Bower et al., 2008), but the efficacy of&#xD;
      interventions in day care centre settings on preschool children's PA and inactivity&#xD;
      behaviours has not yet been determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current PA intervention program is based upon the Healthy Opportunities for Preschoolers&#xD;
      manual and program which were developed and successfully piloted for feasibility in 3 to 5&#xD;
      year old preschoolers by Drs. Viviene Temple, Justen O'Connor, and Patti-Jean Naylor. Drs&#xD;
      Temple and Naylor are researchers from the University of Victoria, and are co-investigators&#xD;
      on this study (Temple et al., 2009). We are using a randomized controlled trial design to&#xD;
      build on their previous work to evaluate the efficacy of the physical activity intervention&#xD;
      training manual and program to increase PA (with slight modifications and editing of the&#xD;
      Healthy Opportunities for Preschoolers training manual).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Preschoolers Activity Trial was developed from a socio-ecological perspective recognizing&#xD;
      that behaviour is affected by multiple levels of influence: intrapersonal, interpersonal,&#xD;
      organizational/environmental, community and policy levels. (Burkman &amp; Kawachi, 2000). The&#xD;
      program is an environmentally-based intervention and focuses on child care as a setting of&#xD;
      influence in children's lives. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of focusing on&#xD;
      settings to modify health promoting behaviours such as eating, PA and tobacco use (Snyder et&#xD;
      al., 1992; Moore et al., 2001; McKenzie et al., 1994) Theoretically, the focus on the setting&#xD;
      is underpinned by the work of community psychologists Barker (1968) and Bronfenbrenner&#xD;
      (1999). Behaviour settings are stable units that affect more than one individual and&#xD;
      substantially influence the behaviour that occurs within them (Barker, 1968). Barker's&#xD;
      research showed that some attributes varied less across children within settings than between&#xD;
      settings. Bronfenbrenner's (1999) bio-ecological model expanded this, highlighting the&#xD;
      importance of reciprocal interactions in children's development; and the need for children to&#xD;
      engage in activities regularly over extended periods of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, the effectiveness of the PA intervention will rest in our ability to transfer&#xD;
      knowledge to the day care-providers which would motivate them to change the child care&#xD;
      programming and environment in which children spend time. Despite varying definitions, the&#xD;
      measure of effective knowledge transfer or exchange is knowledge utilization (Cousins &amp;&#xD;
      Leithwood, 1993); the uptake and implementation of innovation to the curriculum&#xD;
      (evidence-based practices) by decision-makers and practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cluster randomized controlled trial design will be used with day care centres as the unit&#xD;
      of measurement (clusters), though analysis will also be at the individual subjects level&#xD;
      given the few number of day cares targeted in this study. Several large (non-home based) day&#xD;
      care centres in Ottawa that represent ethnic diversity and varying levels of socio-economic&#xD;
      status (SES) have been invited to participate. We sent out a letter to a few daycares that&#xD;
      expressed interest, outlining the objectives and procedures of the project, as well as the&#xD;
      chance of being randomly assigned to either Intervention or Control Group. The current&#xD;
      intervention is designed for 3-5 year old children attending day care. Of the interested day&#xD;
      care centres, 3 have been randomly assigned to intervention and 3 to the control group. Day&#xD;
      care providers in centres randomized to the control group will receive the educational&#xD;
      workshops and the resource manual after their involvement with the study is completed (6&#xD;
      months post-treatment), however the children in the control day care centres will not be&#xD;
      evaluated after the providers receive the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PA intervention designed to increase PA and reduce sedentary behaviour consists of 2,&#xD;
      three-hour workshop training sessions conducted by a master trainer with experience in&#xD;
      promoting PA in preschoolers. The training workshops target the day care providers of 3 to 5&#xD;
      year old children assigned to the intervention group. The first workshop focuses on the&#xD;
      importance of PA and movement skills for pre-school-aged children, understanding structured&#xD;
      and unstructured play, how to implement HOP in day care centres, and practical activities&#xD;
      related to movement skills. The second workshop focuses on overcoming barriers to&#xD;
      facilitating PA; understanding the range of movement skills; and using everyday materials to&#xD;
      facilitate PA and active play. Each provider in the intervention group is provided with the&#xD;
      Healthy Opportunities for Preschoolers resource training manual, a recommended program&#xD;
      outlining which activities to participate in and how often, and a starter kit of equipment&#xD;
      that forms the basis of training for the day care providers and the intervention. The manual&#xD;
      is full of various ways providers can get children active in structured and unstructured&#xD;
      physical activities, some of which target motor skill development. The aim of the&#xD;
      intervention is based on the aforementioned NASPE (2002) guidelines of not having children&#xD;
      sedentary more than 60 minutes at a time, and that children accumulate at least 60 minutes in&#xD;
      structured PA and at least 60 minutes of unstructured (active play) each day at moderate&#xD;
      intensity or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation and Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parents of children aged 3-5 years, in participating day cares, were given informed&#xD;
      consent forms to take home to read. The letter made it clear that the care provider's&#xD;
      participation was not dependent on all of the children participating and that their&#xD;
      participation was completely voluntary. Participating children receive a randomized&#xD;
      identification number, which is used for all data collection, as the information is&#xD;
      confidential. This information is linked to a master sheet that is locked in a secure&#xD;
      location. Data is collected solely on children who have parental consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day care providers in both groups will be surveyed about their understanding of the Central&#xD;
      Health Messages (CHM) associated with Healthy Opportunities for Preschoolers manual, as well&#xD;
      as physical facilities in the day care environments that may promote or restrict PA. The&#xD;
      questionnaire also assesses providers attitudes, control beliefs, intentions, and support for&#xD;
      PA based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Providers will complete these&#xD;
      questionnaires at baseline and after the 2 training workshops. This information can then be&#xD;
      used to evaluate how well it predicts changes in children's PA and sedentary behaviour. This&#xD;
      questionnaire was specifically developed and successfully used in the feasibility and&#xD;
      collection of preliminary outcome data in the HOP trial conducted by Drs. Temple and Naylor&#xD;
      (co-investigators).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of participating children are sent a socio-demographics questionnaire asking details&#xD;
      on parent's age, sex, highest level of education achieved, total parental/family income,&#xD;
      height and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry and Body Composition Data is collected at each measurement period (baseline, 3&#xD;
      months and 6 months post-intervention workshops):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body mass index (kg/m2)(calculated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition (lean body mass, fat mass, and percent body fat) using Bioelctrical&#xD;
           impedance analysis validated for the preschool population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity: Self-reported or care provided reports of PA are fraught with difficulties&#xD;
      and subject to considerable bias in young children (Adamo et al. 2008). Thus, we are&#xD;
      measuring PA objectively using the Actical (mini Mitter Co., Inc., Bend, Ore.) accelerometer&#xD;
      which is a small unobtrusive device worn on the right hip by using belts around the waist (in&#xD;
      young children), and is an omni-directional sensor to monitor the occurrence and intensity of&#xD;
      motion. At each measurement period (baseline, 3- and 6- months post workshop intervention),&#xD;
      children wear these activity monitors from the time of awakening (except showering/bathing as&#xD;
      they are not waterproof) until the time they go to bed from Monday to Friday, thus providing&#xD;
      each subject with a minimum of 4 days of PA monitoring. Parents keep a log to verify times&#xD;
      when accelerometers were on and taken off, and whether children napped. To account for the&#xD;
      possibility that not all children will wear the Acticals every day, and the length of time&#xD;
      that children spend in day care differs, the proportion of PA and sedentary behaviour per&#xD;
      hour of wear time will be computed, as done previously in a group of preschool children&#xD;
      (Temple et al. 2009). Pfeiffer et al's (2006) cut points for preschool-aged children's&#xD;
      moderate and vigorous (MVPA) will be applied. The cut-points will be 715 counts with a 15&#xD;
      second epoch sampling for MVPA,1411 counts using the same 15 second epoch sampling for&#xD;
      vigorous PA, and less than 50 counts per hour for sedentary behaviour using a 15 second epoch&#xD;
      sampling. For ease of comprehension and comparison with other studies, activity data will be&#xD;
      summarized and reported as activity minutes per hour, computed from tallied counts for each&#xD;
      activity level average across wear time. Only children with 4 or more hours of accelerometer&#xD;
      data per day will be included in the dataset. Acticals will be used to assess overall levels&#xD;
      of PA, PA intensity, and energy expenditure at baseline, 3- and 6- months post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundamental/Gross Motor Skills: We are using the Test of Gross Motor Development -2 (TGMD-2)&#xD;
      to evaluate the effects of the intervention on children's movement skills (Ulrich, 2000). The&#xD;
      TGMD-2 is a validated standardized norm-referenced measure of 12 common gross motor skills of&#xD;
      children ages 3 to 11 years (Evaggelinou et al., 2002). Reliability of the Gross Motor&#xD;
      composite index in our targeted age range of children is 0.91 (Ulrich, 2000). Since this test&#xD;
      takes about 30-40 minutes, it is conducted on a sub-group (about 50%) of children in both&#xD;
      groups to provide pilot data on trends in motor skill development that can inform a larger&#xD;
      and more definitive RCT test of HOP. Children in each group are randomly selected to do the&#xD;
      TGMD-2 at each measurement time period (baseline, 3- months and 6-months).&#xD;
