      A loss of body weight has been documented in lowland-living individuals when exposed to&#xD;
      hypoxic environments, such as at high altitude, or under laboratory conditions. A reduction&#xD;

      hypoxic ambulatory confinement (HAMB; FiO2=14%; ~4000 m simulated altitude), and normobaric&#xD;
      hypoxic bed rest (HBR; FiO2=14%). The effects of hypoxia and bedrest on appetite and its&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A loss of body weight has been documented in lowland-living individuals when exposed to&#xD;
      hypoxic environments, such as at high altitudes, or under laboratory conditions. This weight&#xD;
      loss has been attributed both to a reduced appetite (and subsequent fall in dietary energy&#xD;
      intake), and to an increase in resting energy expenditure. Interestingly, a reduction in&#xD;
      appetite and energy intake has also been reported during space flight, although the mechanism&#xD;
      for this has not been explained. As the gas inside future planetary habitats is likely to&#xD;
      have lower partial pressure of oxygen than in Earth's atmospheric air, hypoxia induced&#xD;
      appetite reduction could pose a challenge for individuals in these environments. For example,&#xD;
      persistent under-eating could compromise long term health due to inadequate intake of&#xD;
      essential micronutrients, especially in the presence of altered nutrient metabolism and&#xD;
      requirements seen during space flight. Moreover, inadequate macronutrient intake could&#xD;
      exacerbate the loss of lean body tissue which occurs in situations (such as microgravity,&#xD;
      inactivity and bed rest) where muscles are unloaded. Indeed, a protein intake greater than&#xD;
      normal could be required in situations where there is muscle inactivity, to achieve the same&#xD;
      postprandial anabolic effect of amino acids seen in ambulatory individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism for the reduction in appetite observed in hypoxia is not well established.&#xD;
      Several incretin hormones and adipokines have been implicated in the control of appetite and&#xD;
      may be candidates for inducing this alteration in appetite observed in hypoxia. However,&#xD;
      reports in the literature present contradictory findings, perhaps due to the use of different&#xD;
      experimental paradigms (hypobaric and normobaric hypoxia, active and resting subjects,&#xD;
      variability in the degree and duration of hypoxia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol of the current study standardises physical activity, ambient temperature,&#xD;
      hypoxic stimulus and nutritional composition of the diet, and aims to extend our knowledge of&#xD;
      the effects of hypoxia and bedrest on appetite and its hormonal control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to discern the separate and combined effects of microgravity and hypoxia, fourteen&#xD;
      normal or over-weight men, who are otherwise healthy, will be recruited following medical and&#xD;
      psychological screening. They will be invited to attend the Olympic Sport Centre, Planica,&#xD;
      Slovenia on 3 occasions, with each visit being 31 days in duration and separated by 5 months.&#xD;
      Each 31-day visit ('campaign') includes a baseline recording period (5 days), 21 days of&#xD;
      intervention and a recovery period (5 days), with the 3 interventions allocated in a&#xD;
      randomized, cross over design: i) Normobaric normoxic bed rest (NBR; FiO2=21%), ii)&#xD;
      Normobaric hypoxic ambulatory confinement (HAMB; FiO2=14%; ~4000 m simulated altitude), and&#xD;
      iii) Normobaric hypoxic bed rest (HBR; FiO2=14%). A standardized, repeating, 14-day dietary&#xD;
      menu, comprised of foods commonly consumed in the Slovenian diet, will be applied during all&#xD;
      campaigns, the targeted energy intakes being calculated individually using a modified&#xD;
      Benedict-Harris formula with physical activity factor multipliers of 1.2 for the HBR and NBR&#xD;
      campaigns and 1.4 for the HAMB campaign. Food will be provided in weighed portions and&#xD;
      subjects will be encouraged to eat all food supplied. However, any food not eaten will be&#xD;
      weighed and actual amount consumed recorded in a diet analysis programme. Body mass will be&#xD;
      assessed daily during the campaigns using a gurney incorporating load cells, and whole body&#xD;
      composition will be determined before and immediately after each intervention using fan beam&#xD;
      dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a mixed meal tolerance test before and on day 17 of each&#xD;
      intervention period, in the morning, after a 12 hour fast, with the time of assessment&#xD;
      replicated on each study day at every campaign. On arrival, participants will rest supine on&#xD;
      a hospital bed and place their hand in a heated hand warming unit (air temperature 50-55oC).&#xD;
      An intravenous cannula will then be inserted retrograde into a dorsal hand vein for&#xD;
      arterialised-venous blood sampling. After 15mins rest, a baseline, fasting blood sample will&#xD;
      be taken for determination of serum insulin, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein&#xD;
      (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, adiponectin and leptin, whole&#xD;
      blood glucose and lactate, and plasma catecholamines, ghrelin, PeptideYY (PYY), glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide-1(GLP-1), triglycerides, and non-esterified fatty acid concentration. An expired&#xD;
      breath sample will be collected into evacuated tubes for 13 labelled carbon dioxide (13CO2)&#xD;
      determination, and a 20min baseline measurement of resting energy expenditure (REE) and&#xD;
      respiratory exchange ratio (RER) will be then made using indirect calorimetry, with subjects&#xD;
      wearing a mask, and both inspired and expired air being measured on every breath. Appetite&#xD;
      assessment will be made by asking subjects to rate their hunger, desire to eat, fullness, and&#xD;
      their prospective food intake, by placing a vertical mark on a 0-100mm linear scale. This&#xD;
      visual analogue scale will be measured from left to right, with 0 indicating no experience of&#xD;
      the variable (e.g. not hungry, unable to eat anything) and 100 indicating the most of each&#xD;
      variable that they can imagine experiencing (e.g. intense desire to eat, or completely full).&#xD;
      Values for these 4 variables will be combined to calculate a combined appetite score (CAS).&#xD;
      Once baseline measurements have been completed, subjects will consume a mixed nutrient&#xD;
      milkshake (Ensure Plus, Abbott Nutrition) at 5ml/kg body weight, which will be supplemented&#xD;
      (at 1% of carbohydrate content) with 13-Carbon labelled (13C) Glucose. Arterialised venous&#xD;
      blood samples will subsequently be taken every 10min for glucose and lactate assessment, and&#xD;
      every 20min for assessment of serum insulin and incretin hormones. A measurement of REE and&#xD;
      RER will be performed in the last 15min of every 30min period for the following 2 hours to&#xD;
      assess fuel oxidation and metabolic rate, and an expired breath sample will be collected into&#xD;
      evacuated tubes for 13CO2 determination at a later date. Subjective appetite will be assessed&#xD;
      every 15minutes throughout using visual analogue scales, as described above, and at the end&#xD;
      of the 2hr postprandial period subjects will be given an ad libitum pasta-based test meal and&#xD;
      will be instructed to eat until they feel comfortably full. This meal will be comprised of&#xD;
      cooked dried white pasta, commercially available tomato-based pasta sauce, olive oil and&#xD;
      grated hard cheese, with a composition of 37% of total energy derived from fat, 48%&#xD;
      carbohydrate, and 16% protein. The amount eaten will be recorded and related to subjective&#xD;
      appetite ratings.&#xD;
