&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess 4-month disease control rate (DCR) in pre-treated patients with unresectable&#xD;
      malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) treated with alisertib&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed complete + partial responses) To&#xD;
      assess the progression-free survival. To assess overall survival. To evaluate the side&#xD;
      effects and toxicities associated with this treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect archival tissue, blood, pleural effusion fluid and plasma for correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect archival or new tissue, blood and pleural effusion fluid for correlative studies.&#xD;
      Tissue biomarkers to be evaluated include aurora kinase pathway and c-myc gene amplification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next generation sequencing (NGS) will be conducted on adequate tumor tissue specimens.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take alisertib tablets&#xD;
      by mouth 2 times each day on Days 1-7 of each 21-day study cycle. You must take your doses of&#xD;
      alisertib at least 6 hours apart with 1 cup (about 8 ounces) of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you miss or vomit a dose of alisertib, do not retake that dose. Wait and take the next&#xD;
      dose as scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-3 and then every odd-numbered cycle after that (Cycles 5, 7, 9 and so&#xD;
      on):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 weeks while you are on study, you will have a PET-CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and&#xD;
      pelvis to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will be over after you have completed follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your study doctor or study team will follow you up 30 days after your last dose by reviewing&#xD;
      your medical chart or calling you to see if the side effects are resolved. After that, you&#xD;
      will continue to be followed up at 3 months, 6 months and every 6 months beyond that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 58 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>Trial conducted by Simon's minimax two-stage design and disease control rate at 4 months estimated accordingly (Simon, 1989). New regimen will have a target disease control rate of 50% at 4 months. A disease control rate of 30% or lower is considered a failure and the new regimen will be rejected under this circumstance.</description>

    <description>Participants re-staged every 2 cycles of therapy. 1 cycle = 21 days or 3 weeks. Imaging studies consist of any of the following studies: PET-CT scans, chest CT scans, abdominal-pelvic CT scans. Modified RECIST (preferred) or RECIST (if modified RECIST cannot be used) measurements performed after every 2 cycles of therapy. The radiologist or the PI will review and determine response based on the RECIST.</description>
