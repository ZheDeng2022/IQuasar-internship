      The purpose of this study is to determine if a 6 month mind-motor intervention will help to&#xD;
      improve overall brain health in adults over the age of 55 with type 2 diabetes and a&#xD;
      self-reported complaint about memory or thinking skills. It is hypothesized that the&#xD;
      intervention group will show improvements in their overall brain health after 6 months of&#xD;
      mind-motor training compared to the control group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dementia has been identified as a global health concern because of the increase in incidence&#xD;
      globally. Regardless of whether individuals with self-reported cognitive complaints (CCs)&#xD;
      have objective impairment, they are at increased risk for cognitive decline, and they are&#xD;
      comparable to those with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for brain atrophy and&#xD;
      increased risk of progression towards Alzheimer's disease (AD). People who express being&#xD;
      worried about their memory or cognition show a further increased risk of cognitive decline.&#xD;
      If prevention programs could delay the onset of dementia even in part of the at-risk&#xD;
      population, this could decrease disease prevalence significantly. The risk of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment or dementia is increased in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and T2D accelerates the&#xD;
      progression from MCI to dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed mind-motor intervention for the prevention of cognitive decline in T2D is called&#xD;
      square stepping exercise (SSE). The SSE program was developed by Shigematsu and Okura (2005)&#xD;
      and can be best described as a visuospatial working memory task with a stepping response.&#xD;
      There are more than 200 patterns developed for this program that progress from simple to&#xD;
      advanced stepping patterns. The primary focus of Shigematsu and colleagues' research has been&#xD;
      to examine the impact of SSE on fall risk factors and mobility in older adults. Within their&#xD;
      research they have found that SSE improves lower extremity functional fitness, reduces fall&#xD;
      risk, and improves overall fitness in older adults when compared to walking or strength and&#xD;
      balance training. In combination with Dr. Shigematsu's research in Japan in healthy older&#xD;
      adults, the investigators are aiming to provide a significant evidence base for SSE&#xD;
      internationally and within varied populations, including older adults with subjective&#xD;
      cognitive complaints and with different chronic diseases. In collaboration with Dr.&#xD;
      Shigematsu, the investigators have executed SSE studies at the Canadian Centre for Activity&#xD;
      and Aging and currently are running a study in the community in Woodstock, ON. Preliminary&#xD;
      evidence has shown that over a 6-month exercise plus mind-motor training period, participants&#xD;
      improved in global cognitive functioning, verbal learning and memory, and verbal fluency,&#xD;
      when compared to an exercise control group. Most recently, Shigematsu and colleagues have&#xD;
      found the SSE program to improve memory and executive function in a 6-month pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of the investigators is healthy aging; research goals aim to evaluate&#xD;
      intervention tools in the prevention of cognitive decline at one of the earliest markers of&#xD;
      cognitive decline, which is a subjective complaint. As well, goals of the intervention&#xD;
      strategies are to maintain mobility and balance with advancing age and chronic disease. The&#xD;
      T2D population is at increased risk of decline and the added component of self-management of&#xD;
      diabetes and insulin treatment makes it crucial to maintain adequate cognition and&#xD;
      independence in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This study will be a 24-week Proof-of-Concept randomized controlled trial (1:1&#xD;
      allocation) whereby consenting and eligible participants will be randomized to either: 1) the&#xD;
      SSE intervention group or 2) a usual-care, wait-list control group. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from the St. Joseph's Primary Care Diabetes Support Program (SJHC- PCDSP) and the&#xD;
      study intervention will be conducted at a community location in London, Ontario. This will be&#xD;
      a single blinded study. All assessments will be done pre-intervention (V0) and&#xD;
      post-intervention (V2), with interim assessments after 12-weeks (V1) (with the exception of&#xD;
      sensorimotor). Assessments will take place at SJHC-PCDSP and Western University. One&#xD;
      assessment will be done online either at the participant's home or at SJHC-PCDSP (solely&#xD;
      completed by the participant)(i.e. Cambridge Brain Sciences). We will use blocked&#xD;
      randomization and thus, participants will begin and complete the trial within waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: All participants will be required to self-report a cognitive complaint; once&#xD;
      eligibility is determined, participants will then be asked further questions about their&#xD;
      cognition. Participants will undergo a number of measurements at baseline, which will be used&#xD;
      to describe the study sample. These measures include: i) baseline cognition: Montreal&#xD;
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Clock Drawing Test; ii) baseline fitness: Step test iii)&#xD;
      Anthropometric measures: weight, height, waist circumference; iv) history of physical and&#xD;
      mental activities: Leisure Activities questionnaire v) clinic blood work values HbA1c,&#xD;
      creatine (eGFR), and lipid assessment obtained from clinic electronic medical records (EMR)&#xD;
      and vi) demographic information. Current medications, blood pressure and patient medical&#xD;
      history will also be obtained from EMRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention SSE (Intervention) Group: Participants in the Square Stepping Exercise group&#xD;
      will be doing a group-based mind-motor intervention program. Participants will come to a&#xD;
      community location for 60 minutes on one day per week to participate in the SSE program. An&#xD;
      instructor will be present to demonstrate the walking patterns on a gridded mat. Participants&#xD;
      must memorize and complete the patterns as a group, and they are encouraged to help one&#xD;
      another to promote social engagement. Eighty percent of the group must successfully complete&#xD;
      the patterns to move on to the next pattern. There are over 200 patterns that increase in&#xD;
      difficulty from beginner, to intermediate and advanced. If some participants are struggling&#xD;
      to keep up with the group, a catch-up session will be made available to assist those&#xD;
      participants. Participants will be asked to use the smartphone application (Healthebrain) 10&#xD;
      minutes per day or 2 patterns as homework to supplement the SSE program. Participants will be&#xD;
      able to use their own smartphones (apple or android devices) or they will be given a&#xD;
      smartphone to use for the duration of the study as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wait-List Control Group: The investigators have opted to use a wait-list control group for&#xD;
      this study in order to see differences of our intervention from usual care in T2D.The control&#xD;
      group will be on a wait list to participate in the 24-week SSE program, which will commence&#xD;
      after all measurements are completed by both groups. The classes will be offered free of&#xD;
      charge.&#xD;
