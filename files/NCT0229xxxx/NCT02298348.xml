      This study will combine three drugs: sorafenib, cyclophosphamide and topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adding sorafenib to cyclophosphamide and topotecan may increase the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      combination. The investigators first need to find out the highest dose of sorafenib that can&#xD;
      be given safely together with cyclophosphamide and topotecan. This is the first study to test&#xD;
      giving these three drugs together and will help determine the highest dose of sorafenib that&#xD;
      can safely be given together with cyclophosphamide and topotecan to patients with&#xD;

      This study will combine three drugs: sorafenib, cyclophosphamide and topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves the use of an experimental drug, called sorafenib. Sorafenib blocks the&#xD;
      function of a protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells. This drug has been&#xD;
      tested by itself (as a single-agent) in children with relapsed solid tumors, including&#xD;
      patients with neuroblastoma. In the laboratory, sorafenib appears to make neuroblastoma&#xD;
      tumors smaller, and in addition can help immune cells to be more active in attacking tumors&#xD;
      and blocks other harmful immune cells from promoting tumor growth and function. Sorafenib&#xD;
      also helps to block tumor cells from developing blood vessels used to &quot;feed&quot; to tumor.&#xD;
      Sorafenib is an FDA-approved drug currently widely used for adults with specific types of&#xD;
      liver and kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide and topotecan are both FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs. These drugs are&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of certain adult cancers, but have also been used to treat&#xD;
      children with cancer. These drugs have been used in combination in many people with&#xD;
      neuroblastoma. In some neuroblastoma patients, this combination has reduced the amount of&#xD;
      tumor burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adding sorafenib to cyclophosphamide and topotecan may increase the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      combination. The investigators first need to find out the highest dose of sorafenib that can&#xD;
      be given safely together with cyclophosphamide and topotecan. This is the first study to test&#xD;
      giving these three drugs together and will help determine the highest dose of sorafenib that&#xD;
      can safely be given together with cyclophosphamide and topotecan to patients with&#xD;
      resistant/relapsed neuroblastoma.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be evaluable for inclusion in dose escalation consideration if they have received &gt;80% of the 70 planned doses of sorafenib, &gt;= 4 of the 5 planned doses of cyclophosphamide, and &gt;=4 of the 5 planned doses of topotecan in course 1 AND are followed until Day 35 of the first course of therapy. In addition, patients who experience DLT at any time after the first dose of sorafenib are evaluable for inclusion in dose escalation consideration. Toxicity will be assessed and reported on all patients who begin sorafenib therapy. All toxicities observed will be summarized and graded using the CTCAE criteria, version 4.0 which can be downloaded from the CTEP home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov). The type of toxicities (organ affected or laboratory determination), severity, duration, and reversibility or outcome will be recorded. Toxicities observed during the first course of therapy (day -6 through day 28) will be assessed to define the MTD and guide dose escalation.</description>
