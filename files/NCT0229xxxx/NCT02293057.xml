  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Girls in the juvenile justice system have unique developmental pathways to drug use and&#xD;
      co-occurring risk (e.g., HIV/STI) behaviors that have typically not been considered or tested&#xD;
      in order to identify evidence-based gender-specific substance use treatment approaches for&#xD;
      this population. This study will advance scientific knowledge and clinical practice in the&#xD;
      drug treatment and public health fields by testing the efficacy of a pre-existing, widely&#xD;
      disseminated gender-responsive substance use treatment (VOICES) on drug use and HIV/STI risk&#xD;
      behavior outcomes for a broad range of substance using girls and young women (ages 12-24) who&#xD;
      are at-risk for or already involved with the justice system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to both non-offending females and male offending counterparts, offending girls are&#xD;
      at significantly greater risk for the development of substance use disorders, psychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms and negative health outcomes, such as HIV/AIDS or other sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infections (STIs). Research suggests that girls may have different developmental pathways to&#xD;
      drug use, initial legal involvement and co-occurring negative health outcomes that support&#xD;
      the importance of testing gender-specific treatments for juvenile justice girls. Although&#xD;
      there is recent increased emphasis on gender-specific programming in juvenile justice,&#xD;
      empirically supported gender specific interventions to improve health, mental health and/or&#xD;
      legal outcomes among juvenile justice girls are lacking. The objective of this Stage II&#xD;
      treatment trial is therefore to test the efficacy of a pre-existing, widely disseminated&#xD;
      gender-responsive drug use treatment (VOICES) among 130 girls who are at-risk for or already&#xD;
      involved with the justice system. We seek to test the effect of VOICES on girls' drug and&#xD;
      alcohol use, HIV/STI risk, psychiatric symptoms and recidivism as well as explore moderators&#xD;
      and mediators of outcomes. Girls and young women, ages 12-24 (N= 6 juveniles for Phase I&#xD;
      Intervention Run-Through; N=130 for Phase II RCT study) will be recruited from justice&#xD;
      partners (probation, diversion programs) and school partners (high schools/middle schools).&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either the VOICES (active) intervention (n=65) or a Girl&#xD;
      Health (attention control) condition (n=65). In Phase I (first six months of Year 1), 6&#xD;
      juveniles will be recruited to complete the Intervention Run-Through and research assessment&#xD;
      once to allow testing of RCT intervention and assessment procedures prior to the RCT phase.&#xD;
      In Phase II (last half of Year 1 through Year 4), 130 girls will be recruited and randomized&#xD;
      at baseline and then re-assessed at mid-treatment, end of treatment, 3 months and 6 months&#xD;
      post-intervention. Biological specimens for juvenile drug use will also be collected at each&#xD;
      3-month assessment. Efficacy trial results can be used to make immediate changes to current&#xD;
      widespread program delivery resulting in direct impact on the field of evidence-based&#xD;
      gender-responsive substance use interventions for juvenile justice girls and young women.&#xD;
