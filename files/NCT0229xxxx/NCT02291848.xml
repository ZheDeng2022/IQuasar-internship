    <textblock>
      This study is for patients that have a cancer called Multiple Myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy&#xD;
      of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering myeloma (SM). MGUS and SM have tumor cells&#xD;
      that possess nearly identical properties to the cancer cells seen in patients with multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to target proteins that are expressed by these cells using the&#xD;
      patient's own immune cells known as T lymphocytes.This research study uses special immune&#xD;
      system cells called tumor associated antigen (TAA)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), a&#xD;
      new experimental therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proteins that investigators are targeting in this study are called tumor associated&#xD;
      antigens (TAAs). These are cell proteins that are specific to the cancer cell.They either do&#xD;
      not show or show up in low quantities on normal human cells. In this study the investigators&#xD;
      are targeting five common TAAs called NY-ESO-1, MAGEA4, PRAME, Survivin and SSX. On a&#xD;
      different protocol, patients have been treated and so far this treatment has shown to be&#xD;
      safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators now want to try this treatment in patients with multiple myeloma or if the&#xD;
      investigators can arrest the progression of the patient's condition condition (described&#xD;
      above) to multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These TAA-specific CTLs are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of TAA-specific CTLs, to learn&#xD;
      what the side effects are, and to see whether this therapy might help patients with multiple&#xD;
      myeloma monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering myeloma (SM)&#xD;
&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 390 mL (78 teaspoons) of blood will be collected from the patient on one to three&#xD;
      occasions over a two month period. Under certain conditions related to the patient's health,&#xD;
      the blood may need to be collected using a process called apheresis. Apheresis is the process&#xD;
      where blood is passed through a machine that separates out the components of the blood that&#xD;
      is needed. The remainder of the blood is then returned to the patient's body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will use this blood to grow T cells. They will first grow a special type of&#xD;
      cells called dendritic cells which will cause activity in the T cells. Once these are made&#xD;
      the investigator will load them with small pieces of protein called peptides taken from the&#xD;
      TAAs that they want to target. This helps to train the T cells to kill cells with TAAs on&#xD;
      their surface. Then the investigators expand these TAA-specific CTLs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cells will be infused by intravenous (IV) infusion into the patient over 10 minutes. The&#xD;
      patient may be pre-treated with acetaminophen (Tylenol) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl).&#xD;
      Initially, two doses of TAA-specific CTLs will be given two weeks apart. The patient's&#xD;
      disease will be assessed pre-infusion and then 6 weeks after the second infusion. If after&#xD;
      the second infusion there is a decrease in the patient's disease or it remains stable, the&#xD;
      patient can receive up to six (6) additional doses of the TAA-specific CTLs at monthly&#xD;
      intervals. All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at&#xD;
      Houston Methodist Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In between the first and second infusions and for 6 weeks after the last infusion, the&#xD;
      patient is asked not to receive any other anti-cancer treatments, such as radiation therapy&#xD;
      or chemotherapy, with the exception of lenalidomide, thalidomide, pomalidomide, or immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors, such as CTLA4 and/or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. If they do receive any&#xD;
      other therapies in-between the first and second infusion of cells, the patient will be taken&#xD;
      off treatment and will not be able to receive the second infusion of cells. If the patient&#xD;
      bad side effects from the first infusion, he or she will also not be able to receive the&#xD;
      second infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started&#xD;
      on the lowest dose (1 of 3 different levels) of TAA-specific CTLs. Once that dose schedule&#xD;
      proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will&#xD;
      continue until all 3 dose levels are studied. If the side-effects are too severe, the dose&#xD;
      will be lowered or the TAA-specific CTL infusions will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering&#xD;
      myeloma (SM), they will receive a fixed dose of TAA-specific CTLs. This dose Was determined&#xD;
      based on data obtained from patients who have multiple myeloma and have received these cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Tests Before Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of the patient's multiple myeloma, MGUS or SM markers by blood tests and&#xD;
           bone marrow biopsy (within 4 weeks before the CTL infusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the patient's tumor by routine imaging studies. The investigators will&#xD;
           use the imaging study that was used before to follow the patient's tumor: Computerized&#xD;
           Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Positron Emission Tomography&#xD;
           (PET/CT), skeletal bone survey. These studies will be done on a case-by-case basis at&#xD;
           the descretion of the patient's treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test (using a blood sample) if the patient is a female who can have children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Tests After Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive standard medical tests after their infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of the patient's multiple myeloma, MGUS or SM markers by blood tests and&#xD;
           bone marrow biopsy (at 4-6 weeks and 8-12 weeks post 1st CTL infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators may request a sample of the patient's previous biopsy (e.g. bone marrow or&#xD;
      other tissue) that he or she has had or from a biopsy performed at any time while they are on&#xD;
      this study. The sample may be used to measure the multiple myeloma, MGUS or SM in the bone&#xD;
      marrow, or for research purposes related to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the TAA-specific CTLs are working in the patient's body, an extra&#xD;
      20-40 mL (4-8 teaspoons) of blood will be taken before each infusion, and at Weeks 1, 2, 4&#xD;
      and 6. Afterwards, blood will be collected at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the last infusion.&#xD;
      The investigators will use this blood to see how long the TAA-specific CTLs last, and to look&#xD;
      at the immune response to the cancer. Patients will then be contacted once a year for up to 4&#xD;
      additional years (total of 5 years follow-up) to evaluate their disease response long-term.&#xD;
