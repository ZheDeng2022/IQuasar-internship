  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over one million hospitalizations for acute heart failure (AHF) occur over every year in the&#xD;
      United States, resulting in high mortality, re-hospitalizations, and incurred financial&#xD;
      costs; yet nearly every attempt over the last 10 years to improve outcomes with novel&#xD;
      therapies have all failed. In this proposal, we will study whether a generic drug known as a&#xD;
      mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (more commonly known as an aldosterone blocker), proven&#xD;
      to reduce morbidity and mortality for chronic heart failure patients, is safe and feasible to&#xD;
      give to AHF patients in the emergency department and during hospitalization for a total of 3&#xD;
      days. The results of this study will provide necessary and sufficient data to design an&#xD;
      efficacy study in a larger population to test whether early use of a high-dose of&#xD;
      mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists will reduce post-discharge morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

      This clinical trial pilot study - Early Aldosterone Blockade in Acute Heart Failure: An&#xD;
      Exploratory Safety Study - will explore the safety of early mineralocorticoid receptor&#xD;
      blockade with high-dose spironolactone (100mg/daily), an oral mineralocorticoid receptor&#xD;
      antagonist, versus placebo (both in addition to standard therapy), in patients admitted with&#xD;
      acute heart failure (AHF) for 3 days. Aim 1 will answer the critical question that early&#xD;
      mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonism in AHF patients is sufficiently safe to move&#xD;
      forward with a definitive trial. Aim 2 will demonstrate feasibility of patient enrollment and&#xD;
      compliance with treatment throughout the study to inform future study design and enrollment&#xD;
      projections. This study will provide the necessary and sufficient data in order to plan a&#xD;
      larger, simple, definitive trial to test the hypothesis that early aldosterone blockade in&#xD;
      AHF patients will reduce mortality and 30-day readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for the pilot study will be the difference in incidence of mean change&#xD;
      of serum potassium of a specific amount from baseline to 120 hours from initial dose between&#xD;
      placebo vs. spironolactone treated subjects.&#xD;
