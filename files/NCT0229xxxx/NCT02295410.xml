      The intent of this study is to assess whether cognitive functioning improves as&#xD;
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms decrease as a step toward developing an&#xD;
      objective measure of PTSD improvement. The study also evaluates the feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of home-based telemental health care (HBTMH) compared to usual care in the&#xD;
      treatment of rural Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For this&#xD;
      assessment-only study, the investigators plan to assess approximately 200 Veterans in total,&#xD;
      of which 150 will be undergoing regular evidenced-based therapy (EBT) for PTSD, and 50 will&#xD;
      be receiving other treatment as usual (TAU). The 150 veterans in the EBT group will be&#xD;
      undergoing Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), Cognitive-Behavioral Couple Therapy (CBCT),&#xD;
      Prolonged Exposure (PE), or Seeking Safety (SS) treatment for PTSD in clinic or via&#xD;
      home-based telemental health (HBTMH). The study will also assess a comparison group of&#xD;
      approximately 50 rural Veterans with PTSD diagnoses who are receiving treatment as usual&#xD;
      (TAU) (neither EBT nor HBTMH). The HBTMH patients will be recruited from an Office of Rural&#xD;
      Health (ORH) funded project to VA Pacific Island Health Care System (VAPIHCS), based at the&#xD;
      National Center for PTSD (NCPTSD) and funded to offer 100 rural Veterans mental health&#xD;
      treatment in their homes. This research protocol intends to assess rural veterans with PTSD&#xD;
      who are being seen within this clinic versus those who have been referred for HBTMH yet who&#xD;
      are ineligible for pragmatic purposes, with outcomes including feasibility,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, and clinical effectiveness. The cognitive change will also be measured in&#xD;
      patients with PTSD diagnoses receiving EBT PTSD treatment at VA clinics in the Pacific&#xD;
      Islands.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Office of Rural Health has funded the VA Pacific Islands Healthcare System (VAPIHCS) to&#xD;
      provide HBTMH for rural veterans diagnosed by a mental health provider as having PTSD.&#xD;
      VAPIHCS serves an area about the size of the continental United States. Outside of Honolulu,&#xD;
      there are few mental health specialists to serve Veterans with PTSD and common comorbid&#xD;
      disorders, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), pain, insomnia, and substance abuse.&#xD;
      Moreover, many such Veterans have difficulty following-up for services at Community-Based&#xD;
      Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) due to psychological or physical limitations, transportation, work&#xD;
      schedule, or stigma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost is another reason to develop a HBTMH approach. Seventy percent of those who complete a&#xD;
      course of Evidence Based Therapy (EBT) significantly improve their symptoms, with most no&#xD;
      longer carrying the diagnosis following such treatments (Bradley, Greene, Russ, Dutra, &amp;&#xD;
      Westen, 2005). However those who lack access to EBTs, especially those with polytraumas, have&#xD;
      a low chance of recovery (Elhers &amp; Clark, 2008; Lyons &amp; Keane, 1992). The lack of specialists&#xD;
      in these regions means that the Veterans continue to suffer with PTSD and related disorders&#xD;
      far longer than if specialized care were available. Sending experts to these areas is costly,&#xD;
      and inefficient. The cost and difficulty for highly rural Veterans to travel for weekly&#xD;
      appointments to a CBOC that lacks expertise in EBT for PTSD and treating Veterans with&#xD;
      polytrauma has minimal value. Finally, the no-show rate for such Veterans can run well above&#xD;
      15%, whereas research with HBTMH has no-show rates of less than 4%&#xD;
      (http://conference.avapl.org/pubs/2012%20Conference%20Presentations/HBTMH%20SOP_Shore_11-12-1&#xD;
      1%20copy.pdf)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve services for Veterans, the VA provides telehealth options at its CBOC locations in&#xD;
      the Pacific Islands. Many patients live too far from the CBOC or prefer to receive mental&#xD;
      health treatment in the comfort of their own homes. HBTMH technology, such as televideo&#xD;
      sessions between a home-based patient and their mental healthcare provider, has been&#xD;
      successfully implemented in the VA (e.g. throughout VISN 20 and VISN 7) and in the Department&#xD;
      of Defense (DOD). VAPIHCS was funded by the ORH to provide evidence-based specialty treatment&#xD;
      via HBTMH to rural Veterans with PTSD who would not otherwise have such treatment available&#xD;
      to them. The clinical project is funded to provide up to 100 rural patients who were referred&#xD;
      by their CBOC providers to this specialty clinic for HBTMH PTSD treatment. This VAPIHCS&#xD;
      clinic provides evidence-based treatment to eligible veterans in their homes via televideo by&#xD;
      clinicians currently based at the NCPTSD. Only ORH-funded VAPIHCS clinical staff will provide&#xD;
      treatment to the PTSD patients who choose to and are eligible to receive the home-based&#xD;
      telemental health. Veterans are eligible for this VAPIHCS-HBTMH clinic if they have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with PTSD by a licensed mental health provider at a CBOC, or are referred by a CBOC&#xD;
      (via clinical consult).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to initially evaluate the effectiveness of HBTMH, the current research study will&#xD;
      evaluate veterans participating in the VAPIHCS-HBTMH clinic compared to Treatment as Usual&#xD;
      (TAU - those who were referred to the clinic, however either refused to participate in this&#xD;
      type of clinical care or were ineligible to be part of this clinic due to structural&#xD;
      difficulties (no 4G in their area, can't type, lack of nearby emergency services, etc). Thus,&#xD;
      this protocol is assessment only, and is separate from the treatment provided to the rural&#xD;
      Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no standardized, objective assessments available for determining&#xD;
      impairment and improvement of PTSD. The Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment (DANA)&#xD;
      is a clinical decision support tool developed for the Department of Defense (DoD) for field&#xD;
      and clinic-based neurobehavioral functioning. This neurobehavioral assessment system was&#xD;
      developed on the assumption that various risk factors (PTSD, Depression, Insomnia, anger,&#xD;
      pain, etc.) lead to significantly slower and less accurate (throughput) performance on&#xD;
      cognitive tests. The primary goal of DANA is to assist providers in determining level of&#xD;
      functioning and to track recovery over time. An important purpose of this study is to collect&#xD;
      longitudinal data from patients receiving EBT (both in clinics and through HBTMH) in order to&#xD;
      assess whether cognitive functioning improves as PTSD symptoms decrease with treatment. This&#xD;
      information will provide support for DANA's validity as an objective measure of PTSD&#xD;
      impairment. The study also plans to determine the sensitivity and specificity of DANA&#xD;
      neurocognitive measures in determining changes in cognitive functioning within PTSD patients&#xD;
      engaged in EBT over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project aims to examine the effectiveness of an empirically based trauma-focused&#xD;
      treatment intervention delivered via video conferencing to the home. This project aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Examine the feasibility of HBTMH compared to treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Compare the effectiveness of HBTMH compared to treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Determine predictors of successful treatment outcomes (including treatment&#xD;
      completion and clinically significant reduction in PTSD and related symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4: Determine the sensitivity and specificity of Defense Automated Neurobehavioral&#xD;
      Assessment (DANA) neurocognitive measures in determining changes in psychological functioning&#xD;
      within subjects over time.&#xD;

        Up to 200 Veterans with PTSD who have been referred by their CBOC to the HBTMH PTSD clinic&#xD;
        or a VA Clinic will be enrolled in this research study. This sample size is based on the&#xD;
        number of treatment subjects intended to be treated by the HBTMH clinic, the VA clinic, and&#xD;
        the estimated numbers of subjects who will be ineligible or choose not to participate in&#xD;
        the HBTMH treatment. This number should be sufficient given past effect size differences&#xD;
        between HBTMH treatment and TAU (Cohen's d effect size averaging about 1.0). It will also&#xD;
        allow us to measure changes in psychological and cognitive functioning within treatment&#xD;
        subjects over time.&#xD;
