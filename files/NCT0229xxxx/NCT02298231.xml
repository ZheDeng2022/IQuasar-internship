    <textblock>
      Traumatic Brain injury (TBI) is a major health concern for the U.S. military and civilian&#xD;
      populations, resulting in more than 5.3 million people who require rehabilitation and&#xD;
      assistance for the short and long-term consequences of TBI. TBI impairs the integration and&#xD;
      organization of the visual, auditory and somatosensory inputs that permit body position&#xD;
      awareness, in relation to self and the environment. Even minor impairments in any of these&#xD;
      systems can cause balance dysfunction (BDF), which is one of the most disabling aspects of&#xD;
      TBI. BDF affects over 65% of all individuals with TBI. When cognitive deficits are present,&#xD;
      BDF may become more pronounced, particularly when attempting to engage in more than one task&#xD;
      at a time (i.e., dual task). Treating BDF in patients with TBI can be challenging, as&#xD;
      traditional treatments do not consistently replicate everyday life environments. Virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) interventions enable clinicians to systematically deliver and control dynamic,&#xD;
      interactive, multisensory stimuli. The proposed study will implement and evaluate a novel,&#xD;
      low-cost, VR rehabilitation tool (Mystic Isle; MI) targeting somatosensory, vestibular, and&#xD;
      vision systems through a double-blind RCT. Given the importance of dual-task skills for&#xD;
      real-world functioning, the investigators will also evaluate the relative effectiveness of&#xD;
      dual task (balance and cognitive) VR training to improve balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary case, feasibility and efficacy studies have been conducted using MI with&#xD;
      rehabilitation populations. Findings demonstrate that customized VR using full-body movement&#xD;
      tracking is motivating, feasible for balance training in neurorehabilitation populations, and&#xD;
      results in improved balance and motor action planning. The proposed study will directly&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of a low-cost, interactive, multisensory, VR training using MI to&#xD;
      improve balance and global functioning. The investigators will evaluate the relative&#xD;
      effectiveness of dual task (balance and cognitive) VR training to improve balance, the&#xD;
      long-term effectiveness of such training, and the utility of a balance maintenance program&#xD;
      for facilitating longer-term treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 180 participants (Service Members, Veterans, civilians) with mild to severe TBI&#xD;
      and documented balance impairments will be randomly assigned into one of three balance&#xD;
      treatment groups: 1) Standard of care (control condition); 2) MI; 3) MI dual task (balance&#xD;
      plus cognitive). All groups will undergo 2 treatment sessions/week x 6 weeks (i.e. 12&#xD;
      sessions). Following completion of the treatment protocol, participants in the MI training&#xD;
      group will be randomly assigned to a maintenance training group (2 sessions/month x 4 months)&#xD;
      or a non-maintenance group. All participants will undergo baseline, immediate (6 weeks), and&#xD;
      long-term (4 months) follow-up assessments of: 1) static and dynamic balance and 2) community&#xD;
      integration, self-efficacy, quality of life, and cognitive function. This design will allow&#xD;
      us to assess the efficacy of MI as a customizable balance treatment in TBI, and to evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of this remediation program on overall functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypotheses are proposed: 1) Participants completing both MI training conditions&#xD;
      will exhibit significantly improved balance relative to the control group; 2) Participants&#xD;
      completing both MI training conditions will demonstrate significantly greater improvements in&#xD;
      global functioning relative to the control group; 3) Participants receiving the MI dual task&#xD;
      training (balance and cognitive) will exhibit significantly greater improvements in balance&#xD;
      relative to those in the single task MI training; 4) Participants completing both MI training&#xD;
      conditions will sustain treatment gains for up to 4 months following treatment relative to&#xD;
      baseline performance; the control group will maintain or decrease balance between follow-up&#xD;
      sessions; and 5) Participants receiving maintenance training will maintain better balance&#xD;
      over the 4 month follow-up period compared to the non-maintenance group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is poised to make an important contribution to enhancing balance function&#xD;
      in service members and civilians with TBI, thereby promoting recovery of physical and social&#xD;
      functioning and overall quality of life.&#xD;
