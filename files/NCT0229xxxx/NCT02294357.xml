      The purpose of this Phase II study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness (good and bad&#xD;
      effects) of carfilzomib given as a 30-minute infusion and at a dose of 70 mg/m2 to treat&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma (MM), who are currently showing progressive disease&#xD;
      (worsening) and had progressed (did not respond to treatment) within 8 weeks of receiving&#xD;
      treatment with twice weekly 27mg/m2 of carfilzomib. Carfilzomib is approved by the U.S. Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used only in certain U.S. patients with relapsed and&#xD;
      refractory multiple myeloma that have tried and failed other therapies. Carfilzomib is&#xD;
      considered an investigational drug for this study because the dose and regimen included in&#xD;
      this study are different from the FDA approved carfilzomib regimen. Carfilzomib is a type of&#xD;
      drug called a proteasome inhibitor. Carfilzomib is thought to work by preventing breakdown of&#xD;
      abnormal proteins in cells, causing the cells to die. Cancer cells are more sensitive to&#xD;
      these effects than normal cells. Carfilzomib has been previously given to more than 1800&#xD;
      people in clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open label, non-randomized study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of a 30-minute infusion of 70 mg/m2 of carfilzomib among MM patients who are&#xD;
      currently showing progressive disease (PD) and had failed their last treatment with twice&#xD;
      weekly 27mg/m2 of carfilzomib alone or as part of a combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 1) a screening period; 2) up to eight 28-day, treatment cycles; 3)&#xD;
      maintenance treatment; 4) a final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last&#xD;
      treatment cycle; and 5) a follow-up period. The study will enroll a total of 45 patients who&#xD;
      are currently showing PD and had progressed within 8 weeks of receiving their last treatment&#xD;
      with twice weekly 27mg/m2 of carfilzomib alone or as part of a combination regimen.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients who have not achieved a complete response (CR) and have plateaued (as&#xD;
      defined by unchanged disease markers for at least 8 weeks) while treated with a combination&#xD;
      of carfilzomib (twice weekly 27 mg/m2), lenalidomide and dexamethasone; carfilzomib (twice&#xD;
      weekly 27 mg/m2), pomalidomide and dexamethasone; or carfilzomib (twice weekly 27 mg/m2) and&#xD;
      dexamethasone are also eligible for this study. Patients who were treated with a carfilzomib&#xD;
      (twice weekly 27 mg/m2) containing combination who are currently on carfilzomib (twice weekly&#xD;
      27 mg/m2) and dexamethasone with or without lenalidomide or pomalidomide maintenance therapy&#xD;
      and are not in CR and show unchanged disease markers for at least 8 weeks will also be&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled from 15 hematology/oncology sites across the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period, all doses of carfilzomib will be given at 70 mg/m2 infused over&#xD;
      30 minutes. Among patients who received steroids at the equivalent of &gt; 8 mg of dexamethasone&#xD;
      weekly with carfilzomib, steroids will be administered using the same drug(s) at the same&#xD;
      dose(s) and schedule(s) as they received during their previous carfilzomib treatment.&#xD;
      Patients who did not receive steroids or received the equivalent of less than 8 mg of&#xD;
      dexamethasone weekly will be given 8 mg of dexamethasone prior to each carfilzomib&#xD;
      administration. Carfilzomib will be administered at a facility capable of managing&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reactions. Pre- and post-dose intravenous (IV) hydration (between 250 mL and&#xD;
      500 mL normal saline or other appropriate IV fluid formulation) may be given at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician. Subjects should be monitored periodically during this&#xD;
      period for evidence of fluid overload. Subjects who complete 8 cycles without showing PD will&#xD;
      be eligible to receive maintenance therapy on a 28-day cycle with carfilzomib and steroids as&#xD;
      administered during the last cycle of the treatment period. In addition, those treated with&#xD;
      lenalidomide with carfilzomib and dexamethasone will continue lenalidomide at the same dose&#xD;
      and schedule as used during the treatment period. For those treated with pomalidomide with&#xD;
      carfilzomib and dexamethasone, pomalidomide will be administered at the same dose and&#xD;
      schedule as during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During maintenance (cycle 9 and beyond), carfilzomib will be administered at the dose&#xD;
      received during the last cycle of study treatment on Days 1, 8 and 15, and steroids will be&#xD;
      administered using the same drug(s) at the same dose(s) and schedule(s) as given during the&#xD;
      last cycle of study treatment. Patients will remain on maintenance therapy until&#xD;
      documentation of PD as defined by the modified Bladé criteria or until they develop toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients with stable disease (SD) will remain on maintenance therapy. Dose reductions of&#xD;
      carfilzomib and steroids will be permitted as per protocol guidelines.&#xD;
