  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Multimeric-001&#xD;
      in thirty six (36) volunteers 50-65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive an intramuscular (IM) injection, in each one of three visits, with&#xD;
      a 21±2 days interval between treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo screening procedures within 30 days prior to first vaccination which&#xD;
      will include medical history, vital signs, ECG, physical examination and safety blood and&#xD;
      urine lab tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first treatment visit, eligible subjects will undergo pre-dose physical examination&#xD;
      and vital signs, and a blood sample will be drawn for baseline cellular immunogenicity and&#xD;
      circulating Interferon gamma (IFN-g). They will then receive an IM injection of either&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo, according to the above treatment assignment, into the deltoid muscle&#xD;
      preferably of the same arm. The subjects will remain under medical supervision for 2 hrs (±&#xD;
      15 min) at which time they will be released from the Clinical research center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second treatment will take place 21 (±2) days after the first vaccination. Procedures&#xD;
      will be the same as that of Visit 2 Additional two follow-up visits will take place at&#xD;
      approximately 24 hrs and 48h The third treatment will take place 21 (±2) days after the&#xD;
      second vaccination. Procedures will be the same as that of Visit 2 21 days later, each&#xD;
      subject will be immunized with the seasonal influenza vaccine approved for 2014/15 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Study Termination visit will take place at 21 (±2) days after last vaccination. Adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) and changes in concomitant medications will be recorded, vital signs will be&#xD;
      measured and the subjects will undergo physical examination and ECG. Blood and urine samples&#xD;
      will be collected for safety.&#xD;
