      This placebo-controlled study is designed to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability&#xD;
      of vortioxetine in the treatment of adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) that is&#xD;
      comorbid with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). Half of the subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive vortioxetine and the other half will receive placebo.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), single episode (296.2) or recurrent&#xD;
             (296.3), according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version 5&#xD;
             (DSM-5) criteria, as determined by psychiatric evaluation with the investigator and&#xD;
             confirmed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Duration of current Major Depressive Episode must be at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) (300.23 Social Phobia) according to DSM-5&#xD;
             criteria, as determined by psychiatric evaluation with the Investigator and confirmed&#xD;
             by the MINI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Duration of current SAD must be at least 6 months, and SAD should be observable in&#xD;
             subjects' lives when they are not suffering from MDD, if such periods have occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects must have a minimum total score of 60 on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale&#xD;
             (LSAS) at both Screening and Baseline visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects must have a minimum total Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)&#xD;
             score of 20 at both Screening and Baseline visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects must have a Clinical Global Inventory (CGI) Severity score of 4 or greater at&#xD;
             both Screening and Baseline visits, where the CGI is based on a composite of MDD and&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Subjects with a history or complication of cancer or malignant tumor not in remission&#xD;
