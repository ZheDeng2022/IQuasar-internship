    <textblock>
      Patients with myocardial infarction, which does not include all layers of the heart's muscle&#xD;
      wall are common and they often receive pharmacological treatment with the platelet inhibiting&#xD;
      drug ticagrelor. However, the drug uptake after an oral dose of 180mg ticagrelor has not been&#xD;
      thoroughly studied in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will evaluate ticagrelor uptake and platelet aggregation after a 180 mg&#xD;
      loading dose ticagrelor in these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to be considered as an observational prospective case-controlled study,&#xD;
      according to the Swedish Medical Product Agency (MPA), in response to our enquiry. This is&#xD;
      due to lack of intervention in routine medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are common, but the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic properties of ticagrelor in the acute phase have, to the best of our&#xD;
      knowledge, not been thoroughly studied in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will evaluate ticagrelor uptake and platelet aggregation after a 180 mg&#xD;
      loading dose ticagrelor in NSTEMI patients and compare results with a control group of&#xD;
      patients with stable coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses/questions The stress reaction from suffering an NSTEMI causes delayed absorption&#xD;
      and possibly delayed and lowered maximal plasma concentrations after a loading dose&#xD;
      ticagrelor and thus a delayed and possibly impaired inhibition of platelet aggregation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Study population Subjects eligible for the study will be ticagrelor naïve patients&#xD;
      with NSTEMI presenting at the emergency room at Södersjukhuset. Upon arrival to the emergency&#xD;
      room written informed consent will be obtained before the patients receive their 180 mg&#xD;
      loading dose of ticagrelor if the responsible physician choses this therapy. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria: 1) a diagnosis of NSTEMI (i.e relevant symptoms associated with ischemic ECG&#xD;
      changes (not categorized as STEMI) and/or relevantly increased cardiac markers); 2) an&#xD;
      indication for a 180 mg ticagrelor loading dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group Patients with stable coronary artery disease presenting at the cardiology&#xD;
      clinic at Södersjukhuset. A single 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor will be administrated if&#xD;
      the responsible physician choses this therapy. Inclusion criteria. The inclusion criterion&#xD;
      for the control group will be documented stable coronary artery disease. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
      1) ACS within the last 3 months; 2) Age &lt;18 years; 3)Administration of ticagrelor during the&#xD;
      week before inclusion; 4) Treatment with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists within 48 hours&#xD;
      before inclusion; 5) Ongoing morphine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures and methods Samples of venous blood will be collected into lithium-heparin&#xD;
      tubes, centrifuged at 1500 g at 4ºC for 10 min within 30 min of blood sampling at the&#xD;
      following time points: pre-dose, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours post-dose, as shown in the table&#xD;
      below. For P2Y12-antagonist naïve patients and controls, sampling of venous blood into&#xD;
      Hirudin tubes for pharmacodynamics evaluation will be performed for analysis using an&#xD;
      ADP-induced platelet aggregation assay (Multiplate®, Roche Diagnostics International Ltd,&#xD;
      Rotkreuz, Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting plasma samples will then be stored below minus 20ºC until analyzed. Plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of ticagrelor and its active metabolite AR-C124910XX will be determined by&#xD;
      validated methods (high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry&#xD;
      detection; LC-MS/MS) at a certified laboratory (Covance Laboratories Inc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The median Tmax in the control group with stable coronary artery disease&#xD;
      can be expected at approximately 2 hours after a 180 mg loading dose. The range of the Tmax&#xD;
      in patients with stable coronary artery disease receiving a 180mg loading dose was between 1&#xD;
      and 8 hours. A rough standard deviation estimate of 1.25 hours was obtained from this range&#xD;
      using the formula (ln (maxT⁡max) - ln (minTmax))/k from a statistical textbook by Dixon et&#xD;
      al. A statistician estimated k to 9.5 from a natural distribution table. The estimated&#xD;
      standard deviation of 0.22 on the logarithm scale was then calculated using the calculation&#xD;
      above. For the study group with NSTEMI, a larger standard deviation can be expected and was&#xD;
      estimated with the following formula provided by the statistician: sqrt((0.22^2 )× 2)) =0.31.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To make a sample size calculation possible, the above calculated standard deviations were&#xD;
      anti-logged using the exponential function and found to be 1.25 hours and 1.36 hours,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the power calculation, a 50% delay in median ticagrelor Tmax (1 hour delay) was&#xD;
      considered, as this can be regarded as a clinical significant difference. A power calculation&#xD;
      with the above described time to Tmax and estimated standard deviations, showed that a study&#xD;
      with 80% power would require 40 patients in the study group and 20 patients in the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

               -  Co-administration of ticagrelor with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g.,&#xD;
                  ketoconazole,clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, and atazanavir) is&#xD;
                  contraindicated, as co-administration may lead to a substantial increase in&#xD;
                  exposure to ticagrelor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
