      The objective of this study is to utilize delayed enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      to assess the success of pulmonary vein isolation after cryoablation of paroxysmal atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation. The primary hypothesis is that cardiac magnetic resonance imaging will be able&#xD;
      to visualize changes in left atrial tissue characteristics caused by cryoablation used to&#xD;
      treat paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the world, affecting 1-2% of the&#xD;
      general population and 10% of people older than 80 years old. Medical therapy is only&#xD;
      partially effective at treatment of symptoms of atrial fibrillation and ablation procedures&#xD;
      have been developed that offer a potential curative approach to treatment of the symptoms of&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation. Prior to an ablation procedure, it is standard of care to perform&#xD;
      imaging (either contrast cardiac computed tomography or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)&#xD;
      imaging) to determine the size and orientation of the pulmonary veins, the presence or&#xD;
      absence of left atrial thrombus and the size and volume of the left atrium. Cardiac magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging has the advantage of high spatial resolution without additional radiation&#xD;
      exposure. There are some additional features of CMR that make it potentially even more useful&#xD;
      for patients undergoing an ablation procedure for treatment of atrial fibrillation. One main&#xD;
      advantage involves the use of delayed-enhancement MRI (DE-MRI) to characterize the tissue of&#xD;
      the left atrium to visualize the presence of absence of scars. Prior studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the ability of CMR to visualize radiofrequency-induced scar in the left atrial&#xD;
      wall after atrial fibrillation ablation. These studies have postulated that CMR could be&#xD;
      utilized to determine the success rates of atrial fibrillation ablation. However, there has&#xD;
      been significant variability between published studies looking at CMR post radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation, which for many years was the only type of ablation procedure available to treat&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation. Some studies demonstrate a correlation between DE-MRI and ablation&#xD;
      lesions, while others do not report such a correlation. Furthermore, no study to date has&#xD;
      been designed to examine cryoablation specifically. Cryoablation is alternative method of&#xD;
      performing an ablation procedure that utilizes a freezing balloon to make a circumferential&#xD;
      lesion around the atrum of the pulmonary vein, as opposed to radiofrequency ablation which&#xD;
      uses a catheter to create the same pattern of lesions around the pulmonary vein utilizing a&#xD;
      4mm catheter that generates heat as a byproduct of radiofrequency energy. Using DE-MRI to&#xD;
      analyze injury and scar after cryoablation would be a novel application of this imaging&#xD;
      modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several reasons why lesions produced with cryoablation procedures may offer better&#xD;
      visualization on DE-MRI as compared to radiofrequency ablation. First, the circumferential&#xD;
      lesion generated by cryoablation is created utilizing a uniform distribution of energy in a&#xD;
      simultaneous fashion to the entire pulmonary vein antrum. In contrast, lesions created by&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation are produced sequentially and each lesion has variable contact with&#xD;
      the myocardium and therefore variable energy delivery. As a consequence, lesions created with&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation may not uniformly penetrate the myocardium, creating a situation&#xD;
      whereby contiguous lesions have variable depth. This may explain the heterogeneity of scar&#xD;
      visualization on DE-MRI in earlier studies. Furthermore, despite the advantages and accuracy&#xD;
      of electroanatomical mapping, due to variations in tissue architecture in the pulmonary vein&#xD;
      antrum, there may be technical challenges in ensuring truly contiguous lesions.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the non-contiguous nature of radiofrequency ablation lesions may not be become&#xD;
      evident until localized tissue edema has subsided and clinical evidence of recurrent atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation is observed several months after the procedure. Cryoablation offers a&#xD;
      theoretical advantage in this regard by producing near uniform tissue contact as well as an&#xD;
      ability to assess for gaps in tissue contact by injecting contrast dye under fluoroscopic&#xD;
      visualization during the period of pulmonary vein occlusion to demonstrate areas of poor&#xD;
      tissue contact where contrast dye escapes from the occluded pulmonary vein. Another advantage&#xD;
      is that the cryoballoon is in contact with a greater amount of myocardium in the pulmonary&#xD;
      vein antrum than the radiofrequency ablation catheter due to the larger surface area of the&#xD;
      23 or 28mm diameter cryoballoon as compared to the 3.5 or 4mm diameter radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation catheter. The smaller surface area of the radiofrequency ablation lesions may be&#xD;
      missed in the delayed enhancement sequences on MRI, which are acquired at a greater slice&#xD;
      thickness as compared with standard acquisition. Therefore, the cryoablation lesions may be&#xD;
      more likely to be visualized, as there is a greater probability that some portion of the&#xD;
      ablated myocardium will be present in a given imaging slice of delayed enhanced atrial&#xD;
      myocardium. Finally, the nature of cryoablation itself may cause less inflammation in the&#xD;
      short term in the atrial myocardium as compared to radiofrequency ablation due to the fact&#xD;
      that the tissue is frozen and not heated. The effect of this on ability to visualize ablated&#xD;
      tissue on DE-MRI is unknown, as none of the published studies have examined cryoablation&#xD;
      specifically.&#xD;
