      This is a two-arm, randomized-controlled pilot study with 2 year duration. The &quot;intervention&quot;&#xD;
      refers to surveillance based on the EAU guidelines and the &quot;control&quot; refers to surveillance&#xD;
      based on the AUA guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methods: Participants who presents with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and meets&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be given an option to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled at the Urology Clinics at the University of Texas Health&#xD;
      Science Center San Antonio (UTHSCSA) Medical Arts and Research Center (MARC) and South Texas&#xD;
      Veterans Health Care System (STVHCS). Non-local site include the University of Texas&#xD;
      Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW). The research procedures consist of urine collection,&#xD;
      cystoscopy, and patient satisfaction and cost questionnaires. The evaluation will be done by&#xD;
      the tumor recurrence and progression of the disease. At various time points throughout the&#xD;
      study, urine may be obtained from the patient and banked in the Genitourinary (GU) Tissue&#xD;
      Bank. Subjects asked to provide a urine sample(s) will be asked to sign a separate informed&#xD;
      consent. The urine is de-identified in the lab per the Health Insurance Portability and&#xD;
      Accountability Act (HIPAA) protocol GU Tissue Bank Institutional Review Board (IRB) #&#xD;
      20050234H). Patients will undergo cystoscopy in clinic (standard of care). In the&#xD;
      intervention arm, patient surveillance cystoscopy will be performed at 3, 12 months and again&#xD;
      at 24 months following the diagnosis of bladder cancer. Patients randomized to the control&#xD;
      arm, will undergo surveillance cystoscopy every 3 months for 2 years following the diagnosis&#xD;
      of bladder cancer. Because use of cytology is variable among the participating urologist, the&#xD;
      utilization of cytology will be at the treating urologist's discretion as per usual standard&#xD;
      care. Study duration will be 2 years from most recent biopsy. Patients will be placed on the&#xD;
      surveillance schedule based on the length of time from their last tumor.&#xD;
