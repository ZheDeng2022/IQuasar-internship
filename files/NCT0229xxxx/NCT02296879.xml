  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c-MET) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, when&#xD;
      engaged by its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), has been implicated in various cellular&#xD;
      process including development as well as oncogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAIT301 is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the alpha chain of extracellular&#xD;
      domain of c-MET. Binding of SAIT301 to c-MET blocks HGF binding and inhibits HGF-mediated&#xD;
      signaling. Furthermore, SAIT301 also induces efficient c-MET internalization from the cell&#xD;
      surface and subsequent degradation, resulting in inhibition of growth of the c-MET addicted&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor decided to enroll subjects with tumors that express c-MET (by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry [IHC]) for this study, as the subjects with no c-MET expression are&#xD;
      unlikely to benefit from SAIT301 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 of this Phase I study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, and anti-tumor activity of SAIT301 administered as a single IV&#xD;
      infusion in 21 day cycles, for up to 4 cycles. Subjects without evidence of tumor progression&#xD;
      after 4 cycles will be eligible to continue on SAIT301 treatment if there is no evidence of&#xD;
      tumor progression for a further 4 cycles (Cycles 5 to 8). Biomarkers related to SAIT301&#xD;
      and/or tumor response will also be evaluated.Stage 2 will further evaluate the safety and PK&#xD;
      profile of SAIT301 in select types of cancers. Dosing frequency may be adjusted based on the&#xD;
      PK profile obtained during Stage 1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAIT301.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the MTD of SAIT301 and the dose level of SAIT301 where dose limiting&#xD;
           toxicity (DLT) is observed in subjects with advanced solid tumors or define recommended&#xD;
           Phase II dose (RP2D) as an alternative to establishing the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This first in man study will consist of 2 stages. Stage 1 will be a dose&#xD;
      escalation study with a 3 + 3 design and will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK profile,&#xD;
      biomarkers, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of ascending doses of SAIT301 in subjects&#xD;
      with c-MET + advanced solid tumors and define the MTD (or recommended Phase II dose [RP2D])&#xD;
      of SAIT301. If the PK trough levels exceed the minimum acceptable trough level for SAIT301&#xD;
      (25 μg/mL), the Safety Review Committee (SRC) may elect to terminate further dose escalation&#xD;
      and declare a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and schedule as an alternative to establishing&#xD;
      the MTD. In Stage 2 the MTD (or RP2D) defined in Stage 1 will be administered to additional&#xD;
      subjects with selected diagnoses, 15 subjects per selected diagnosis, to further evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and PK profile, and any evidence of anti tumor activity of SAIT301 in these&#xD;
      populations. The tumor types to be included in Stage 2 will be defined in a protocol&#xD;
      amendment at a time close to study execution based on information available at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment period will consist of 21-day cycles. On Day 1 of each cycle, SAIT301 will be&#xD;
      administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For dose level 1, the first subject will receive an IV infusion of SAIT301 on Cycle 1 Day 1&#xD;
      and will be followed for 21 days (Cycle 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the first subject at dose level 1 experiences a DLT during Cycle 1, 1 additional subject&#xD;
      will be enrolled and will receive dose level 1, which is 50% of dose level 1. If this subject&#xD;
      at dose level -1 does not experience a DLT during Cycle 1, 2 more subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      at dose level -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the first subject at dose level 1 does not experience a DLT during Cycle 1, the second and&#xD;
      third subjects will receive SAIT301 at dose level 1 and will be followed for 21 days (Cycle&#xD;
      1). At the discretion of the SRC, if the first 3 subjects at dose level 1 do not experience a&#xD;
      DLT during Cycle 1, dose level 2 may be administered in the next cohort. If one of these&#xD;
      subjects experiences a DLT, the cohort will be expanded and evaluated as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For dose level 2 and each subsequent dose level, 3 subjects will receive SAIT301 on Day 1 of&#xD;
      Cycle 1 and will be followed for 21 days (Cycle 1). If none of the 3 subjects experience a&#xD;
      DLT, the next dose level can be administered in the next cohort. If 1 or more of the first 3&#xD;
      subjects experience a DLT, 3 more subjects will receive the same dose level. Dose escalation&#xD;
      will continue until at least 2 subjects in a cohort of 3 to 6 subjects experience a DLT&#xD;
      (i.e., ≥33% of subjects with a DLT at that dose level). Considering the possibility of&#xD;
      relatively low efficacy, each subjects of dose level 1 and 2 can be administered with higher&#xD;
      dose level after their first administration. This individual dose escalation can be&#xD;
      determined by Investigators when safety data of the higher dose level are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both Stage 1 and 2, subjects will continue to receive the assigned dose level of SAIT301&#xD;
      until unacceptable toxicity, documented progression of disease, another criterion for&#xD;
      discontinuation is met, or until 4 cycles have been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects without evidence of tumor progression after 4 cycles may continue on SAIT301&#xD;
      treatment if there is no evidence of tumor progression for a further 4 cycles (Cycles 5 to&#xD;
      8). Subjects without evidence of tumor progression at the completion of Cycle 8 will be&#xD;
      eligible for a follow-on protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who experience a DLT will be discontinued from further treatment. At the completion&#xD;
      of the dose escalation stage, the SRC may for Stage 2 alter the dosing interval between&#xD;
      cycles based on emerging PK data from lower SAIT301 dose levels.&#xD;
