      Despite the wide availability of advanced lipoprotein tests, no reference standard exists for&#xD;
      Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) due to inherent problems with each of the assays.&#xD;
      Newer methods for estimating LDL particle numbers, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#xD;
      spectroscopy and vertical auto profile (VAP) are currently under investigation. NMR has been&#xD;
      proposed as having the best correlation with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      the accuracy of LDL-C or LDL particle number measurements is currently not monitored by&#xD;
      national standardization programs. Direct comparisons between the various testing methods&#xD;
      have been limited restricting our ability to accurately interpret and compare values across&#xD;
      vendors and lipid parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. LDL particle count numbers, as determined by NMR (Liposcience), provides the best&#xD;
           estimates of cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Discrepancies exist between the LDL particle count by NMR and other values as presented&#xD;
           by calculated LDLC and directly measured LDL (VAP and ion mobility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 100 patients recruited from the Lipid Clinic at the Scripps&#xD;
      Center for Integrative Medicine. Each patient will have one blood draw from which four tests&#xD;
      will be analyzed. Risks are associated with drawing blood, which will be minimized by using&#xD;
      Scripps Clinic Lab technicians. The potential loss of personal health information will be&#xD;
      reduced by limiting access to study and lab staff and keeping information password-protected&#xD;
      on Scripps servers.&#xD;

      Introduction Advanced lipoprotein testing has been available for over 50 years and its use in&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk stratification has been proposed in a number of clinical trials (Superko&#xD;
      2009, 2383). Low Density Lipid Cholesterol (LDLC) is currently used as the key cardiovascular&#xD;
      biomarker for assessing risk and monitoring response to lipid therapy (Cole, T. 2013, 752).&#xD;
      The highest correlation with cardiovascular risk has been found with apolipoproteinB (apoB)&#xD;
      or LDL particle concentration by NMR (Brunzell 2008, 814). Despite the wide availability of&#xD;
      advanced lipoprotein tests, no reference standard exists for LDLC due to inherent problems&#xD;
      with each of the assays (Mora 2009, 2402)(Marcovina 2006, 440). The most common laboratory&#xD;
      method of determining LDLC is by precipitation of apolipoproteinB (apoB) containing&#xD;
      lipoprotein particles, measurement of the high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), and&#xD;
      calculation of the LDLC by the Friedewald equation; however, there are inherent errors&#xD;
      associated with three separate measurements (Marcovina 2006, Superko 2009, 2384). Correlation&#xD;
      between lab LDLC and values obtained by ultracentrifugation has been reported to range from 7&#xD;
      to 31.2%, with a significant amount of misclassification (Marcovina, S. and Packard, C. 2006,&#xD;
      440). Furthermore, elevated triglycerides have been reported to interfere with the accuracy&#xD;
      of LDLC measurements (Marcovina, S. and Packard, C. 2006, 440). ApoB, which is the main&#xD;
      protein component of LDL, is also considered a direct measure of LDL particle number (Cole,&#xD;
      T. 2013, 753). Newer methods for estimating LDL particle number, including NMR and VAP are&#xD;
      currently under investigation. NMR has been proposed as having the best correlation with&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular outcomes (reference). Unfortunately, the accuracy of LDLC or LDL&#xD;
      particle number measurements is currently not monitored by national standardization programs.&#xD;
      Direct comparisons between the various testing methods have been limited limiting our ability&#xD;
      to accurately interpret and compare values across vendors and lipid parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LDL particle count numbers determined by NMR (Liposcience) provides the best estimates&#xD;
           of cardiovascular risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discrepancies exist between the LDL particle count by NMR and other values:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Calculated LDLC&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Directly measured LDL (VAP and ion mobility)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the test which has the highest concordance and lowest concordance with the&#xD;
           NMR test Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective analysis with a target study population of 100 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Superiority study aimed to detect a 300 point difference in LDL particle count&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requires a one-time lab draw for all patients&#xD;
