  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease. Based on previous research, study&#xD;
      doctors think that giving medicines to affect the immune system soon after diabetes is&#xD;
      diagnosed may stop, delay or decrease the destruction of beta cells, resulting in better&#xD;
      glucose control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers believe that tocilizumab could have some effect on the cells in the immune system&#xD;
      that are thought to be involved in the development of type 1 diabetes. This study will test&#xD;
      whether tocilizumab can help preserve or delay destruction of remaining beta cells in people&#xD;
      recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

      Staggered enrollment is planned for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to initiating the study in the pediatric age group (6-17 years old), 30-99 eligible&#xD;
      adults (ages 18-45 years) will be randomized 2:1 to tocilizumab or placebo, respectively.&#xD;
      Once the first thirty adult participants have completed 12 weeks of treatment, the FDA and&#xD;
      Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review available data (e.g., interim analysis)&#xD;
      to weigh potential risks and benefits before opening the trial to pediatric participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of ≥ May 15, 2017: Study enrollment limited to participants ages 6 to 17 years inclusive.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 2-Hour C-peptide Mean Area Under the Curve (mAUC) in Pediatric Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-treatment) to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>C-peptide is a substance released by the pancreas into the bloodstream in equal amounts to insulin and reflects how much insulin pancreatic beta cells are making. The standardized MMTT evaluates whether beta cells are producing endogenous insulin. The MMTT was performed in the morning and blood samples for C-peptide collected at baseline (pre-meal) and 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 minutes post-meal. C-peptide mAUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule over the 2-hour time period. Larger numbers are preferable (better) in these mAUC results: more insulin being produced reflects less severe disease. C-peptide levels in the serum (e.g., mAUC following a standardized MMTT) compared to control group at 1 year post treatment initiation for the evaluation of investigational products intended to preserve endogenous beta-cell function in T1DM trials is recognized by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the FDA as a valid efficacy endpoint.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were screened from February 11, 2015 to Jun 21, 2018 at 17 sites in the US and two sites in Australia. March 12, 2015 was the actual date on which the first participant was enrolled in this clinical study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Before initiating the study in the pediatric group (6-17 years old), adults (18-45 years old) were randomized 2:1 to tocilizumab or placebo, respectively. After at least 30 adults completed 12 weeks of treatment, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and FDA reviewed the available data and allowed the enrollment of children 6-17 years old.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>C-peptide is released by the pancreas into the bloodstream in equal amounts to insulin and reflects how much insulin pancreatic beta cells are making. The MMTT was performed in the morning and blood samples for C-peptide collected at baseline (pre-meal) and various minutes post-meal. C-peptide AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule over the 2-hour time period. Results of the stimulated 2-hour (e.g., 120 minutes) post-meal C-peptide AUC are provided. Larger numbers are preferable (better) in these AUC results: more insulin being produced reflects less severe disease.</description>

          <description>Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a measure of the average plasma concentration of blood sugar (glucose) over the previous three months and measures the level of optimal management of underlying disease. An HbA1c of 5.6% or less is considered normal. HbA1c of 6.5% or higher is typical for individuals with Type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The closer HbA1c levels are to normal, the better controlled the disease is.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 2-Hour C-peptide Mean Area Under the Curve (mAUC) in Pediatric Participants</title>
        <description>C-peptide is a substance released by the pancreas into the bloodstream in equal amounts to insulin and reflects how much insulin pancreatic beta cells are making. The standardized MMTT evaluates whether beta cells are producing endogenous insulin. The MMTT was performed in the morning and blood samples for C-peptide collected at baseline (pre-meal) and 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 minutes post-meal. C-peptide mAUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule over the 2-hour time period. Larger numbers are preferable (better) in these mAUC results: more insulin being produced reflects less severe disease. C-peptide levels in the serum (e.g., mAUC following a standardized MMTT) compared to control group at 1 year post treatment initiation for the evaluation of investigational products intended to preserve endogenous beta-cell function in T1DM trials is recognized by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the FDA as a valid efficacy endpoint.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 2-Hour C-peptide Mean Area Under the Curve (mAUC)</title>
        <description>C-peptide is a substance released by the pancreas into the bloodstream in equal amounts to insulin and reflects how much insulin pancreatic beta cells are making. The standardized MMTT evaluates whether beta cells are producing endogenous insulin. The MMTT was performed in the morning and blood samples for C-peptide collected at baseline (pre-meal) and 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 minutes post-meal. C-peptide mAUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule over the 2-hour time period. Larger numbers are preferable (better) in these mAUC results: more insulin being produced reflects less severe disease. C-peptide levels in the serum (e.g., mAUC following a standardized MMTT) compared to control group at 1 year post treatment initiation for the evaluation of investigational products intended to preserve endogenous beta-cell function in T1DM trials is recognized by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the FDA as a valid efficacy endpoint.</description>

        <title>2-Hour C-peptide Mean Area Under the Curve (mAUC), Mixed Model</title>
        <description>C-peptide is a substance released by the pancreas into the bloodstream in equal amounts to insulin and reflects how much insulin pancreatic beta cells are making. The standardized MMTT evaluates whether beta cells are producing endogenous insulin. The MMTT was performed in the morning and blood samples for C-peptide collected at baseline (pre-meal) and 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 minutes post-meal. C-peptide mAUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule over the 2-hour time period. Larger numbers are preferable (better) in these mAUC results: more insulin being produced reflects less severe disease.

          <title>2-Hour C-peptide Mean Area Under the Curve (mAUC), Mixed Model</title>
          <description>C-peptide is a substance released by the pancreas into the bloodstream in equal amounts to insulin and reflects how much insulin pancreatic beta cells are making. The standardized MMTT evaluates whether beta cells are producing endogenous insulin. The MMTT was performed in the morning and blood samples for C-peptide collected at baseline (pre-meal) and 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 minutes post-meal. C-peptide mAUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule over the 2-hour time period. Larger numbers are preferable (better) in these mAUC results: more insulin being produced reflects less severe disease. C-peptide levels in the serum (e.g., mAUC following a standardized MMTT) compared to control group at 1 year post treatment initiation for the evaluation of investigational products intended to preserve endogenous beta-cell function in T1DM trials is recognized by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the FDA as a valid efficacy endpoint.</description>

        <description>The need to use exogenous insulin is an indication that the body is not producing enough endogenous insulin. Higher amounts of insulin use indicate higher disease activity. Insulin use was collected each day for 5 days prior to the visit. Average insulin use per kg is the average insulin use over the 5 days prior to the visit divided by the participant's weight in kg.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Insulin Use Per Kg, Mixed Model</title>
        <description>The need to use exogenous insulin is an indication that the body is not producing enough endogenous insulin. Higher amounts of insulin use indicate higher disease activity. Insulin use was collected each day for 5 days prior to the visit. Average insulin use per kg is the average insulin use over the 5 days prior to the visit divided by the participant's weight in kg.</description>

        <description>Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a measure of the average plasma concentration of blood sugar (glucose) over the previous three months and measures the level of optimal management of underlying disease. An HbA1c of 5.6% or less is considered normal. HbA1c of 6.5% or higher is typical for individuals with Type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The closer HbA1c levels are to normal, the better controlled the disease is.</description>

        <description>Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a measure of the average plasma concentration of blood sugar (glucose) over the previous three months and measures the level of optimal management of underlying disease. An HbA1c of 5.6% or less is considered normal. HbA1c of 6.5% or higher is typical for individuals with Type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The closer HbA1c levels are to normal, the better controlled the disease is.</description>

          <description>Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a measure of the average plasma concentration of blood sugar (glucose) over the previous three months and measures the level of optimal management of underlying disease. An HbA1c of 5.6% or less is considered normal. HbA1c of 6.5% or higher is typical for individuals with Type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The closer HbA1c levels are to normal, the better controlled the disease is.</description>
