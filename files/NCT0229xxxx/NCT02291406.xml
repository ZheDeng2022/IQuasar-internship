  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance is a key reaction to surgery and trauma and reflects the degree of&#xD;
      metabolic stress. With greater degree of insulin resistance the development of complications&#xD;
      increase, in particular infectious complications. The aim of this study is to determine if&#xD;
      robotic assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy induces less insulin resistance compared to&#xD;
      abdominal hysterectomy. Insulin resistance is measured by the hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic&#xD;
      clamp method. In addition inflammatory factors and clinical recovery will be measured.&#xD;

      This is a prospective randomized controlled single center study. Primary screening will take&#xD;
      place in the gynecological ward of Orebro University hospital according to the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. 20 patients will be enrolled. All participants are randomized between&#xD;
      robotic assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study are to determine if robotic assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy&#xD;
      induces less insulin resistance compare to abdominal hysterectomy. Both patients with benign&#xD;
      and malignant disease are included. In addition inflammatory factors such as IL-6 and CRP are&#xD;
      measured and clinical recovery is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be studied twice using the hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic clamp, a method&#xD;
      that now is the gold standard for determining insulin sensitivity. During the clamp insulin&#xD;
      is infused intravenously to attain an elevation at levels seen after an abnormal meal. At the&#xD;
      same time glucose is infused to balance the effect of insulin and to maintain normal blood&#xD;
      glucose level. The amount of the glucose infusion needed is the level of insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
      The clamp procedure is performed before surgery as a control measure and the morning after&#xD;
      surgery to yield the relative change in insulin sensitivity caused by the operation&#xD;
      (postoperative insulin resistance). Before the onset of the infusion, and after 60 minutes of&#xD;
      steady state during insulin stimulation, blood is collected for the analysis of immune&#xD;
      function. This is also collected 3 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 6 minutes walk test is performed before surgery and the day after surgery, in order to&#xD;
      determine a more clinical measure on recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition demographic and clinical data are systematically collected during the hospital&#xD;
      stay and 30 days after.&#xD;
