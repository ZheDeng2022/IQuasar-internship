  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal microchimerism has been discussed as an etiological mechanism in infantile&#xD;
      (perinatal) biliary atresia (BA). In Kasai's operation (resection of the liver hilum plaque&#xD;
      followed by hepato-portoenterostomy) surgeons frequently encounter swollen portal and&#xD;
      mesenteric lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymph nodes were sampled during Kasai' s operation and examined for maternal DNA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon operation of infants with non-syndromatic biliary atresia (BA, commonest form), surgeons&#xD;
      almost invariably note the prominent finding of multiple swollen lymph nodes of up to 2 cm in&#xD;
      size in the porta hepatis and the small bowel mesentery where they may constitute grape like&#xD;
      complexes. Same-age infants laparotomized for other pathology commonly do not present such&#xD;
      nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biliary atresia is a disease of the newborn which is fatal when left untreated.&#xD;
      Histologically it corresponds to a degeneration of intra- und extra hepatic bile ducts within&#xD;
      a in part specific inflammatory infiltrate and progressive cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of this rare but constant disease (1:8-1:15.000) is unknown. Currently in BA&#xD;
      etiology research two main avenues are pursued:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Virally induced perinatal (auto)immune processes are suspected. An experimental form of&#xD;
           BA can be provoked by infecting murine mothers with dsRNA-viruses e.g.&#xD;
           Rhesus-rotaviruses or Reo-viruses while in mice, vaccination of mothers has prevented&#xD;
           experimental BA . The importance of the γ/δ-T-cell and IL17/IL 23 pathway , for BA is&#xD;
           currently probed. However, in groups of syngenic animals treated by the same batch of&#xD;
           viruses BA tends to be inconstant and it is limited to extrahepatic bile ducts such as&#xD;
           about the validity of the animal model is an issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The other direction of research does not primarily rely on experiments involving newborn&#xD;
           animals: There are indications that during pregnancy the placental barrier may become&#xD;
           permeable for maternal lymphocytes (e.g. by a faulty silencing of T-cell attracting&#xD;
           chemokines in decidual stroma cells) and already in 2008 maternal lymphocytes have been&#xD;
           demonstrated in livers of BA infants . Subsequently the phenomenon of materno-fetal&#xD;
           microchimerism has come into focus of BA ethiology research: in the context of mixed&#xD;
           materno-fetal immune reactions cells of maternal origin could misdirect the immature&#xD;
           immune system of the infant into auto-immunity or act directly as effectors in a graft&#xD;
           vs. host like fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of mesenteric and portal lymph nodes for maturation of the immune system&#xD;
      during pregnancy has been reported recently . Moreover it has been demonstrated that flow the&#xD;
      between liver and portal lymph nodes is bidirectional . In In mice the frequence of CD4+ and&#xD;
      FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells was found to be linked to the mothers immune status. We thus&#xD;
      hypothesized that the prominently swollen lymph nodes of BA infants which surgeons constantly&#xD;
      encounter during Kasai's operation may hold a key to the better understanding of&#xD;
      pathophysiological important lymphocyte trafficking mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the standard operation, the Kasai-operation which in a race with increasing liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis makes sense up to an age of 4 months, the degraded rests of the major bile ducts in&#xD;
      the liver hilus (the so called &quot;hilar plate&quot;) are resected, A Roux y-loop is sutured onto the&#xD;
      resection site. It shall drain any contingent bile flow from remaining bile ducts. The long&#xD;
      term success rate of this tentative of surgical cure which is of moderate technical&#xD;
      complexity and invasiveness is estimated to ca. 15-20%. In the remaining a partly sucess may&#xD;
      postpone the necessity of liver transplantation. We examined in seven consecutive patients&#xD;
      with histologically proven biliary atresia whether in periportal lymph nodes there was&#xD;
      evidence for maternal gentic material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 consecutive patients with the preoperative diagnosis of BA were included in the study.&#xD;
      Other causes of icterus prolongatus (α1 anti-trypsin deficiency, Alagilles syndrom, PFIC&#xD;
      etc.) had been excluded amongst the methods technical successful ERCP (5/7 patients) which&#xD;
      showed absence of intrahepatic bile ducts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining the parent's informed consent 2 ml EDTA whole blood were collected from&#xD;
      mother and infant. During Kasai's operation one portal and one mesenterial lymphnode were&#xD;
      sampled (Hannover Medical School ethical committee vote No.1650/11.12.2012. After bipolar&#xD;
      dissection the mesenteric gaps were closed with 4-0 Vicryl sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymph nodes were disrupted mechanically and DNA was extracted enzymatically (QIAmp Kit,&#xD;
      Qiagen, Hilden/Germany) as described previously and normalized to 30 ug/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short tandem repeat analysis was realized with multiplex PCR for markers LIPOL, VWA, TH01,&#xD;
      D19S253, CSF, PLA2A. FGA, D21S11, D18S51 as described. Briefly, fragment length analysis was&#xD;
      performed an Abi Prism 310 System with GeneScan 3.11. software for comparison of mother's and&#xD;
      infant's blood with lymph node DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were traced by quantitative real time PCR&#xD;
      chimerism analyses. Reactions were executed on an iCycler iQ5 real-time PCR platform&#xD;
      (Bio-Rad) using the ABsolute QPCR Rox Mix (Thermo scientific). Custom designed primers and&#xD;
      probes were provided by Sigma-Aldrich. Control reactions and normalization of sample DNA were&#xD;
      performed by amplifying the albumin gene.&#xD;
