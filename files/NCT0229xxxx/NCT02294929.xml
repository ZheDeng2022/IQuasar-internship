      Prospective and explorative clinical study. The objective is to assess the clinical efficacy&#xD;
      of pulmonary vein isolation using the Arctic Front Advance cryoballoon in patients with&#xD;
      longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) at one year follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      44 subjects will be enrolled. Patients with longstanding persistent AF, with continuous AF&#xD;
      duration longer than one year, who have not previously undergone an AF ablation procedure,&#xD;
      and have symptoms related to AF corresponding to at least European Heart Rhythm Association&#xD;
      (EHRA) score 2, will be studied. Patients should have failed at least one betablocker or&#xD;
      class I or III antiarrhythmic drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excluded are those with congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class&#xD;
      3 or more, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40%, left atrial diameter ≥ 60 mm,&#xD;
      significant valvular disease or planned cardiac intervention within next 12 months, and&#xD;
      conventional contraindications for AF ablation procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened with echocardiography and response to electrical cardioversion.&#xD;
      Following conversion to sinus rhythm, amiodarone will be initiated to maintain sinus rhythm.&#xD;
      Pulmonary vein isolation will be performed using the Arctic Front Advance cryoballoon&#xD;
      ablation catheter. Pulmonary vein conduction block will be assessed by a circular mapping&#xD;
      catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be subject to electroanatomical voltage mapping during sinus rhythm for&#xD;
      demonstration of extent of atrial myocardial lesions after ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed every third month up to one year after the ablation procedure.&#xD;
      Arrhythmia monitoring during follow up will be performed by 7 day Holter monitoring at 6, 9&#xD;
      and 12 months follow up, including a 12 lead ECG. 12 months follow up for symptoms, EHRA&#xD;
      score, and quality of life. Patients with symptomatic recurrence requiring a redo ablation&#xD;
      procedure will be re-studied after 8-12 months while asymptomatic patients will be studied at&#xD;
      12 months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-Point is Clinical success based on symptoms and presence of AF. Secondary&#xD;
      end-Points include freedom from AF without antiarrhythmic drugs at 6 and 12 months according&#xD;
      to 7 day Holter and ECG, Rhythm, AF burden, AF profile, Quality of Life, Symptoms, Adverse&#xD;
      Events, atrial size and function, Biomarkers, extent of scar tissue, predictive factors of&#xD;
      freedom from AF, complications, hospitalization and Health economics.&#xD;

      This is a prospective and explorative clinical study performed at one centre. Objective: The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess the clinical efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation using&#xD;
      the Arctic Front Advance cryoballoon in patients with longstanding persistent atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (AF) at one year follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      44 subjects will be enrolled. Clinical sites: Arrhythmia centre in Uppsala University&#xD;
      Hospital, Uppsala Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject population: Patients with longstanding persistent AF, with continuous AF of longer&#xD;
      duration than one year, who have not previously undergone an AF ablation procedure, and who&#xD;
      have symptoms related to AF corresponding to at least EHRA score 2, will be studied. Atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation should be confirmed on at least 2 consecutive ECG recordings during the past one&#xD;
      year supporting the presence of AF for at least one year. Patients should have failed at&#xD;
      least a betablocker or class I or III antiarrhythmic drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to exclude permanent AF patients, an electrical cardioversion with conversion to&#xD;
      sinus rhythm maintained for at least one hour, is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excluded patients are those with congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association&#xD;
      (NYHA) class 3 or more, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40%, left atrial diameter&#xD;
      (LA) ≥ 60 mm, significant valvular disease or planned cardiac intervention within the next 12&#xD;
      months, and conventional medical contraindications for AF ablation procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary vein isolation: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) will be performed using the Arctic&#xD;
      Front Advance cryoballoon ablation catheter. Acute procedural success is defined as&#xD;
      electrical isolation of all pulmonary veins assessed by entrance and exit block, including 20&#xD;
      minutes waiting time and the use of the provocative agent adenosine to screen for early&#xD;
      recurrence of PV conduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study: Patients will be screened with echocardiography and response to&#xD;
      electrical cardioversion. Following conversion to sinus rhythm, amiodarone will be initiated&#xD;
      in order to maintain sinus rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After cryoballoon ablation of all pulmonary veins, PV conduction block will be assessed by a&#xD;
      circular mapping catheter, including waiting time and provocative agents. All patients will&#xD;
      be subject to electro anatomical voltage mapping during sinus rhythm for demonstration of the&#xD;
      extent of atrial myocardial lesions after ablation. Biomarkers including nTproBNP and&#xD;
      troponin I, reflecting myocardial strain and destruction, will be collected at baseline and&#xD;
      at different time points after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed every third month up to one year after the ablation procedure.&#xD;
      Amiodarone will be withdrawn one month after the ablation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arrhythmia monitoring during follow up will be performed by a 7 day Holter monitoring every&#xD;
      third month at 6, 9 and 12 months follow up, including a 12 lead ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A transthoracic echocardiography will be repeated at 12 months follow up to assess LA volume&#xD;
      and contractility. Symptoms, EHRA score, and quality of life (QoL) will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Predictive variables for successful outcome/AF recurrence will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be reinvestigated for assessment of PV re-conduction using a circular&#xD;
      mapping catheter, irrespective of symptoms. Patients with symptomatic recurrence requiring a&#xD;
      redo ablation procedure will be re-studied after 8-12 months while asymptomatic patients will&#xD;
      be studied at 12 months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical success defined as&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Freedom from AF related symptoms, off or on previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drugs&#xD;
           irrespective of the presence of asymptomatic AF on Holter. AF may be either absent or&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Presence of AF related symptoms, off or on previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drugs,&#xD;
           but with significant symptomatic improvement to the extent that a redo procedure or a&#xD;
           novel previously not tested antiarrhythmic drug is not desired as declared by the&#xD;
           patient on a symptom questionnaire. Atrial fibrillation may be either absent or&#xD;

           destruction, will be collected at baseline and at different time points after the&#xD;
           procedure. A biomarker reflecting fibrosis and brain damage will be analysed.&#xD;
