    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response to three DNA vaccines&#xD;
      and a MVA-CMDR vaccine that may boost the immune response to the DNA vaccines in healthy,&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity to four different HIV&#xD;
      vaccines in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. The vaccines include three DNA vaccines-DNA Nat-B&#xD;
      env, DNA CON-S env, and DNA Mosaic env-and a vaccine called MVA-CMDR that may boost the&#xD;
      immune response to the DNA vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected participants aged 18 to 50 years. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of three groups and will receive either one of the&#xD;
      experimental vaccine regimens or a placebo vaccine regimen. Group 1 participants will receive&#xD;
      the DNA Nat-B env and MVA-CMDR vaccines or placebo. Group 2 participants will receive the DNA&#xD;
      CON-S env and MVA-CMDR vaccines or placebo. Group 3 participants will receive DNA Mosaic env&#xD;
      and MVA-CMDR vaccines or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive one of their assigned vaccines at study entry (Month 0), and&#xD;
      Months 1, 2, 4, and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration will be either 3 years after enrollment (for participants in the United&#xD;
      States) or 5 years after enrollment (for participants in Switzerland). For all participants,&#xD;
      study visits will occur at study entry (Month 0), and Months 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 4, 4.5, 8,&#xD;
      8.25, 8.5, 11, 13.75, and 14. After the last study visit, participants will be contacted&#xD;
      annually by phone or e-mail for a total of 3 (U.S. participants) or 5 (Switzerland&#xD;
      participants) years to answer questions about their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study visits will include a physical exam, HIV risk reduction counseling, and an&#xD;
      interview and/or questionnaire. Select study visits will include blood collection, urine and&#xD;
      stool collection, HIV testing, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and a pregnancy test for&#xD;
      participants who were born female. For participants receiving the MVA-CMDR vaccine, select&#xD;
      study visits may also include an assessment of cardiac symptoms.&#xD;
