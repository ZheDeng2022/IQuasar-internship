  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The South Asian population is facing an epidemic of type 2 diabetes, of which the underlying&#xD;
      cause is still unknown. It is currently hypothesized that an ethnic susceptibility towards a&#xD;
      disturbed energy metabolism may underlie this disadvantageous metabolic phenotype. In line&#xD;
      with this, the investigators recently discovered that Dutch South Asian subjects have 32%&#xD;
      lower resting energy expenditure (REE) and 34% lower energy-combusting brown adipose tissue&#xD;
      (BAT) compared to matched white Caucasians. Nitric oxide (NO) was recently shown to be&#xD;
      crucial for BAT development and, interestingly, South Asians have diminished NO&#xD;
      bioavailability. Thus, the disadvantageous metabolic phenotype in South Asians may be caused&#xD;
      by diminished NO bioavailability resulting in lower BAT volume. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that increasing NO generation in the body by administration of L-arginine, the&#xD;
      precursor of NO, will improve their metabolic phenotype by increasing BAT volume, thereby&#xD;
      increasing REE and clearance of triglycerides and glucose by BAT. To investigate this, the&#xD;
      investigators will perform a randomized placebo-controlled multicenter cross-over study in&#xD;
      moderately obese Dutch South Asians and matched white Caucasians. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      L-arginine (9 gram/day) or placebo for 6 weeks, followed by a wash-out period of 4 weeks and&#xD;
      then again 6 weeks of one of either treatments. At the end of both treatment periods, a&#xD;
      cold-induced PET-CT scan will be performed. Furthermore, muscle and fat biopsies will be&#xD;
      obtained and thermoregulation will be assessed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale: The South Asian population originally descends from the Indian subcontinent and&#xD;
      represents approximately 20% of the total world population. This population is facing an&#xD;
      epidemic of type 2 diabetes, of which the underlying cause is still unknown. A high&#xD;
      prevalence of a disadvantageous metabolic phenotype, consisting of obesity, insulin&#xD;
      resistance and dyslipidemia, may at least in part contribute to this excess risk. It is&#xD;
      currently hypothesized that an ethnic susceptibility towards a disturbed energy metabolism&#xD;
      may underlie this disadvantageous metabolic phenotype. In line with this, the investigators&#xD;
      recently discovered that Dutch South Asian subjects have 32% lower resting energy expenditure&#xD;
      (REE) and 34% lower energy-combusting brown adipose tissue (BAT) compared to matched white&#xD;
      Caucasians. Nitric oxide (NO) was recently shown to be crucial for BAT development and,&#xD;
      interestingly, South Asians have diminished NO bioavailability. Thus, the disadvantageous&#xD;
      metabolic phenotype in South Asians may be caused by diminished NO bioavailability resulting&#xD;
      in lower BAT volume. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that increasing NO generation&#xD;
      in the body by administration of L-arginine, the precursor of NO, will improve their&#xD;
      metabolic phenotype by increasing BAT volume, thereby increasing REE and clearance of&#xD;
      triglycerides and glucose by BAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objectives are: 1) to determine the effect of L-arginine on glucose&#xD;
      uptake by brown adipose tissue and to assess whether the effect differs between South Asian&#xD;
      and white Caucasian subjects; 2) to determine the effect of L-arginine on whole body energy&#xD;
      expenditure and to assess whether the effect differs between South Asian and white Caucasian&#xD;
      subjects; 3) to determine the effect of L-arginine on fat mass and to assess whether the&#xD;
      effect differs between South Asian and white Caucasian subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized placebo-controlled multicenter cross-over study will be performed&#xD;
      in moderately obese Dutch South Asians and matched white Caucasians. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      L-arginine (9 gram/day) or placebo for 6 weeks, followed by a wash-out period of 4 weeks and&#xD;
      then again 6 weeks of one of either treatments. At the end of both treatment periods, a&#xD;
      cold-induced PET-CT scan will be performed. Furthermore, muscle and fat biopsies will be&#xD;
      obtained, thermoregulation will be assessed, an oral glucose tolerance will be performed and&#xD;
      the investigators will assess NO-dependent and independent vasodilation by means of&#xD;
      iontophoresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Mildly obese (BMI 25-30 kg/m2) pre-diabetic male volunteers of South Asian&#xD;
      and white Caucasian descent aged between 35-50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention will consist of administration of 9 grams of L-arginine per&#xD;
      day in three gifts (3dd 3 gram).&#xD;
