      The optimal anesthetic technique would provide excellent operating conditions, rapid&#xD;
      recovery, early discharge, no postoperative side effects, and high patient's satisfaction. In&#xD;
      addition to increasing the quality and decreasing the costs of the anesthetic services (1).&#xD;
      Selective spinal anesthesia (SSA) -spinal block with minimal effective doses for a specific&#xD;
      type of surgery - has become very popular technique) 2(for some orthopedic and gynecological&#xD;
      surgeries [3-9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saddle anesthesia is a SSA directs a small bolus of hyperbaric local anesthetic, towards&#xD;
      S4-S5 and coccygeal nerve roots (11), and is commonly utilized for perianal surgeries&#xD;
      (11-14). Hyperbaric bupivacaine has been safely, replaced hyperbaric Lidocaine for saddle&#xD;
      block (11, 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although Saddle blocks at different low doses of hyperbaric bupivacaine (1.5- 4 mg) have been&#xD;
      used previously for miÂ¬nor perianal surgeries (11, 13, 14), the optimal effective dose has&#xD;
      yet to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the minimal effective dose of hyperbaric spinal&#xD;
      bupivacaine required to induce a reliable and satisfactory saddle block for perianal&#xD;
      surgeries (using a modified Dixon's up-and-down method.&#xD;

      Following approval of the Research and Ethics Committee of the University of Dammam and&#xD;
      written informed consent, patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical Status&#xD;
      I and II, aged 20-55 years, scheduled for outpatient elective perianal surgery in the&#xD;
      lithotomy position ( hemorrhoidectomy, fistulectomy), were prospectively enrolled in this&#xD;
      study. Patients unwilling to participate, those with contraindications to regional&#xD;
      anesthesia, morbid obesity, bleeding disorders, mental health problems or language barriers,&#xD;
      taking psychotropic or analgesic medication, or a known history of allergic reactions to&#xD;
      amide local anesthetics, were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually, 35 patients were enrolled. However; after they have signed the informed consent; 7&#xD;
      patients were excluded because they have received analgesics in the morning of surgery, and 4&#xD;
      patients refused to receive the saddle block on the operating room. So actually 24 patients&#xD;
      out of 35 participants underwent intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were fasted for over 6 hours and were premedicated with 0.2 mg/kg oral diazepam&#xD;
      60 min before spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room (OR), an intravenous (IV) 18-20G catheter was placed, and standard&#xD;
      monitoring [electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), and&#xD;
      noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP)] were started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under aseptic conditions, the dural puncture was performed by staff-grade anesthesiologists,&#xD;
      using a standard midline approach in the sitting position at the L3-L4 or L4-L5&#xD;
      intervertebral space, using a 25-gauge Whitacre needle with its orifice directed caudally. A&#xD;
      predetermined small dose of hyperbaric bupivacaine (Marcaine Spinal Heavy; Astra Zeneca,&#xD;
      Lund, Sweden) which was prepared in1 mL tuberculin syringe was injected. All patients&#xD;
      remained in the sitting position for 10 min. the patient was asked if he/she perceived any&#xD;
      change in motor power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If not, the patient was allowed to position him/herself without aid for surgery in the&#xD;
      lithotomy position. Immediately before surgery, the sacral level of sensory block was tested&#xD;
      using a long surgical toothless clamp gently applied radially, starting from the anal&#xD;
      orifice, in different diagonal directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The motor block was tested by a modified Bromage scale (0 = no motor block, 1 = able to flex&#xD;
      the ankle and bend knees, 2 = able to flex ankle, and 3 = full motor block).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A successful block was defined as one that was sufficient to proceed with the surgery without&#xD;
      any supplementation (intravenous analgesic, local anesthetic infiltration, or general&#xD;
      anesthesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of bupivacaine given to each patient was determined by the response of the&#xD;
      previously tested patient using a modified Dixon's up-and-down method (using 0.5 mg as a step&#xD;
      size) (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first patient was tested at a dose 1.5 mg bupivacaine, if the patient responded with a&#xD;
      failed block then the next patient received an increment of 0.5 mg bupivacaine, if the&#xD;
      patient responded with a successful block, then the next patient received a decrement of 0.5&#xD;
      mg bupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research continued until the investigators obtained seven crossover midpoints. The&#xD;
      initial starting dose of 1.5 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine of the first patient was selected from&#xD;
      the findings of Wassef R et al. who demonstrated adequate anesthesia for short perianal&#xD;
      surgery with the use of 1.5 mg spinal hyperbaric bupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bupivacaine was prepared immediately before injection by an independent anesthesiologist and&#xD;
      was administered by a second anesthesiologist. Block assessment and clinical follow-up of the&#xD;
      patients was also performed by a third anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data were recorded; Patient demographics, duration of anesthesia and surgery,&#xD;
      level of sensory and motor block immediately before surgery, at the end of the surgery, and&#xD;
      every 30 minutes until resolution of the block. NIBP and HR were documented every 5 minutes&#xD;
      in the OR and PACU. Also Times to ambulation, first voiding time, and time to home discharge&#xD;
      were recorded. Patient's and surgeon's satisfaction were evaluated with a 4-point score&#xD;
      (0=poor, 1=good, 2=very good, 3= excellent). Patients were followed by phone call to note&#xD;
      down any possible postoperative complication (postdural puncture headache, TNS or backache)&#xD;
      at day 1 postoperatively and 10 days later. The time of the dural puncture was used as the&#xD;
      primary starting point of assessment.&#xD;

          <description>The dose of bupivacaine given to each patient was determined by the response of the previously tested patient using a modified Dixon's up-and-down method (using 0.5 mg as a step size) (16). The first patient was tested at a dose 1.5 mg bupivacaine, if the patient responded with a failed block then the next patient received an increment of 0.5mg bupivacaine, if the patient responded with a successful block, then the next patient received a decrement of 0.5mg bupivacaine. The research continued until we obtained seven crossover midpoints.</description>
