  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was a randomized, single-blinded, sham-controlled study, in which the patients&#xD;
      were blinded to treatment assignment. First, all candidates underwent audiological testing of&#xD;
      hearing thresholds, tympanometry and stapedius reflex tests. The patients who were selected&#xD;
      for the study were interviewed to assess and evaluate their condition and then underwent a&#xD;
      detailed physical examination that included a complete otorhinolaryngologic examination and a&#xD;
      complete blood test. Then, the subjects were randomized to undergo true or sham ACP. Seven&#xD;
      days before (baseline) and seven days after twelve acupuncture (ACP) sessions (up to six&#xD;
      weeks), which were performed twice a week, all participants underwent 99mTc-ECD SPECT&#xD;
      scanning and completed the Portuguese version of the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), the&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAS) and the Beck Depression Inventory&#xD;
      (BDI). The purpose of this study was to integrate the neuroscience research findings with the&#xD;
      clinical research on tinnitus. Thus, a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      was implemented to investigate the effect of ACP as a treatment for tinnitus using&#xD;
      ethylcysteine dimer single-photon emission computer tomography (99mTc-ECD SPECT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acupuncture (ACP) is frequently used to treat tinnitus, the condition defined as the&#xD;
      perception of sound in the absence of an external auditory stimulus. However, no information&#xD;
      is available regarding the consequences of ACP on the neural architecture and functionality&#xD;
      of the brain in tinnitus patients. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in brain&#xD;
      activity using ethylcysteine dimer single-photon emission computer tomography (99mTc-ECD&#xD;
      SPECT) in patients with tinnitus and normal hearing who underwent ACP treatment. Methods and&#xD;
      Findings: This was a randomized, single-blinded, sham-controlled study. The participants were&#xD;
      adults (18-60 years old) with either normal hearing or chronic, idiopathic and continuous (+&#xD;
      3 months) tinnitus. Fifty-seven (57) subjects were randomized to receive true (n=30) or sham&#xD;
      (n=27) ACP, and 99mTc-ECD SPECT exams were performed seven days before (baseline) and seven&#xD;
      days after twelve ACP sessions (up to six weeks), which were performed twice a week.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes included changes in the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), the Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale (VAS), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).&#xD;
      Data regarding imaging outcomes were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8)&#xD;
      software using a factorial design. For secondary outcomes, regression models were built&#xD;
      considering two different analytical paradigms: intention-to-treat (ITT; where multiple&#xD;
      imputations were conducted due to loss to follow-up) and complete cases. No significant&#xD;
      differences in brain perfusion were observed between patients who underwent true versus sham&#xD;
      ACP treatment. However, a significant improvement in THI scores at the end of true ACP&#xD;
      treatment was observed for all domains (all p &lt; 0.001), with the exception of the&#xD;
      catastrophic field. For the other outcome measurements (VAS, BDI and HAS), no significant&#xD;
      differences were observed between groups. The small sample size represents a potential&#xD;
      limitation of this study. Conclusions: These findings suggest that ACP may improve the impact&#xD;
      of tinnitus on daily life, although additional studies are needed to verify the consequences&#xD;
      of ACP on the neural architecture and functionality of the brain in tinnitus patients.&#xD;

    <description>12 sessions of ACP treatment were performed twice a week. Before ACP was performed, patients were examined based on the diagnostic pattern of TCM. Then, the appropriate acupoints for treatment were selected according to the tinnitus-related syndrome. The experimental group was treated with true ACP (stimulating selected meridian points), and the control group was treated with sham-ACP (stimulating false meridian points). The patients were blinded to the identity of their treatment group. Disposable stainless steel ACP needles (0.25 x 30 mm, Dong Bang Acupuncture, Korea) were used in both groups. Needles were inserted manually at each meridian point, and the retention time was twenty minutes.</description>

    <description>All treatments were performed by the same acupuncturist, who is a medical doctor with more than eight years of clinical and research experience in ACP for tinnitus. Acupoints described as being effective for tinnitus were selected according to TCM theory. Basic points that are manipulated in ACP include GV 20 (Baihui), TE 17 (Yifeng), GB 8 (Shuaigu), SI 19 (Tinggong), GB 2 (Tinghui), TE 21 (Ermen), VC 23 (Lianquan), GB 20 (Fengchi), TE 2 (Yemen), TE 5 (Waiguan), SI 2 (Qiangu), GB 43 (Xiaxi) and GB 41 (Zulinqi). However, several secondary (accessory) acupoints were also added according to TCM and the etiological diagnosis of tinnitus: GV 4 (Mingmen), KI 3 (Taixi), BL 23 (Shenshu), BL 19 (Danshu), BL 18 (Ganshu) and CV 4 (Guanyuan).</description>
