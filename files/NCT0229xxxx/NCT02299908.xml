  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute postoperative pain is one of the most important centers of therapeutic attention in&#xD;
      postoperative phase of any procedure. It is a complex entity that requires a multiple&#xD;
      intervention to be treated and, depending on the intervened surgical site, it has different&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite attempts to reduce postoperative pain by implementing management protocols, rates of&#xD;
      pain prevalence from moderate acute to severe pain are still reported as high as 50% in the&#xD;
      first 24 postoperative hours. Among the surgeries that report greater intensity of&#xD;
      postoperative pain is open inguinal Herniorrhaphy. That is why several techniques have been&#xD;
      described for the management of acute pain in this surgery postoperative, among which PAT&#xD;
      blocking has shown to be beneficial in some studies. However, some reports question its&#xD;
      usefulness but with the emergence of ultrasound-guided techniques for its realization,&#xD;
      interest in this blockage has grown back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to demonstrate the utility of the PAT blocking in the management of acute&#xD;
      pain of pre-peritoneal inguinal herniorrhaphy with mesh.&#xD;

      1. Patient registry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cases will be recorded by an external agent who will verify compliance with the protocol&#xD;
      by the treating physicians (surgeons and anesthesiologists); additionally this agent will&#xD;
      interview patients for the processing of the instrument and will also collect the proper&#xD;
      information of the procedure. At random and in an unannounced way, visits will be made to the&#xD;
      centers of attention to verify that the procedure was done according to what had been agreed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally when the full record of the patients is registered in a database, they will be&#xD;
      called one by one to confirm the information collected. Further records are sought in the&#xD;
      systematized medical history in order to verify additional information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Quality assurance plan: i. Each record will be completed by an external agent to the&#xD;
      surgical procedure who will be trained for this work according to the methodological design&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Regular visits are made to the information collection site to confirm compliance with&#xD;
      attention and randomization protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Information collected on the instrument will be confirmed with each patient's the&#xD;
      clinical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Data verification for range and consistency: i. Each of the instruments for each unit of&#xD;
      analysis will be typed in a database by the same person (who will be trained in the&#xD;
      methodological design of the study) who will monitor that each variable has been collected&#xD;
      according to the categories previously established for that variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. One second revision of the database will be carried out by one of the researchers who&#xD;
      will review column by column categories, so that they are consistent with the predefined&#xD;
      rules for that range: Additionally, compatibility between these categories and other&#xD;
      categories of variables that must be compatible will be verified. For example, the hour of&#xD;
      completion of surgery is later than the start time, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Verification of data for Accuracy, Completeness and Representativeness i. Each instrument&#xD;
      collected will be verified, with surgical description carried out by the surgeon, anesthesia&#xD;
      report made by the anesthesiologist and medical developments made by the hospital physician&#xD;
      in charge of patient care in the postoperative period. In case of finding any inconsistency,&#xD;
      the confirmation of the information will proceed through an additional call to the patient&#xD;
      and the treating specialists if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Record of the patient's inclusion in the protocol of the clinical trial, guiding the&#xD;
      treating physicians in the active pursuit of the variables under study, will be included in&#xD;
      all electronic medical records.&#xD;

           e. Standard Operation Procedures: i. Registration operation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patient Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. All patients scheduled for inguinal herniorrhaphy by the surgeon, will be&#xD;
                     reported by the administrative programming group to the researchers who will&#xD;
                     attend the preoperative evaluation by anesthesiology to practice informed&#xD;
                     consent and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients that can continue with&#xD;
                     the protocol will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. The day of the surgery the surgical instrumentation group will perform the&#xD;
                     patients' randomization with a consecutive (identification number) and,&#xD;
                     without knowing the patient, will take to the operating room the substance to&#xD;
                     apply in the PAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. During surgery a research assistant who is blind to the applied substance,&#xD;
                     shall record the data collection instrument based on what he observes in the&#xD;
                     operating room and on what he questions in the first hour after the suspension&#xD;
                     of anesthetics in the post-anesthesia care room.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. After 24 hours of suspending the anesthetic, the research assistant will call&#xD;
                     the patient to question him about the necessary information to complete the&#xD;
                     data collection instrument of.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. The missing information in the database will be completed through review of&#xD;
                     medical records, interview with the surgeon, anesthesiologist and unit&#xD;
                     post-anesthesia care nurse. The information still needed, will be supplemented&#xD;
                     through a call to the patient. If despite the above it is not possible to get&#xD;
                     the required information, the case will be withdrawn for further analysis by&#xD;
                     intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Visits, audits and random checks to confirm the effectiveness of the data&#xD;
                     collection will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
                ii. Analysis Activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Information of the instruments will be typed for the development of a database&#xD;
                which will be complemented by the intervention variable the day determined to&#xD;
                collect the sample. After that it will be delivered to the researchers who will&#xD;
                undertake the analysis and interpretation so that later they can make the&#xD;
                socialization of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Adverse effects report:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Whenever an adverse outcome is evidenced, it will be reported to the researchers&#xD;
                and treating physicians (surgeon and anesthesiologist). Additionally the patient&#xD;
                will be informed. Likewise it will be notified on clinical trial data base.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Change management:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. If it is necessary to make a change to the protocol or data collection,&#xD;
                     researchers will meet to discuss the best option which does not affect the&#xD;
                     overall outcome of the investigation, but also which does not put in an&#xD;
                     additional hazard the patients' safety. When this aspect is defined a&#xD;
                     statement to the entire group of research will be issued.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. If a severe and frequent adverse reaction occurs, the possibility to suspend&#xD;
                     the controlled clinical trial will be determined between the researchers and&#xD;
                     the medical ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
                f. Evaluation of the sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
                i. Number of participants: The sample size was calculated using the formula for&#xD;
                mean difference in analytical studies with a confidence index of 95%, a margin of&#xD;
                error of 5%, a statistical power of 80%, a variance of 10% and a minimum&#xD;
                differential detection value of 2.8%, compared to which a sample of 40 patients was&#xD;
                obtained. With a loss rate of 10% the sample size was expanded to 44 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
                ii. Years participated: Since it is an acute pain study 24 hours were determined to&#xD;
                monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
                g. Missing data plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
                i. Missing data will be completed with clinical history, interview o professionals&#xD;
                involved with patient care, calls and / or visits to patients. If data loss remains&#xD;
                an analysis by intention to treat will proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                h. Statistic analysis plan: i. Frequency distribution and qualitative variables&#xD;
                association tables will be made, statistical significance for p values less than&#xD;
                0.05 will be determined, association between intervention variable and primary&#xD;
                outcome and secondary outcome variables will be sought using for t his purpose the&#xD;
                statistics analysis plan.&#xD;
