  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, we seek to elucidate the effects of aerobic exercise on fecal&#xD;
      microbiota following the aforementioned no exercise control group and two doses of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise training (the exercise training spans ~24 wks) in a cross-sectional sample.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will collect ancillary data for the ongoing Examination of Mechanisms of exercise-induced&#xD;
      weight compensation (E-Mechanic; RCT; Martin CK and Church TS Co-PI's; R01 HL 102166) to&#xD;
      investigate the independent aim and hypothesis of this pilot and feasibility (P &amp; F) grant&#xD;
      examining if there are differences in colonic microbial populations from a fecal sample&#xD;
      following supervised and controlled aerobic exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study seeks to better understand the role of colonic microbial populations as a&#xD;
      mechanism of change in body weight during aerobic exercise. E-Mechanic is examining the&#xD;
      effects of 2 tightly controlled and supervised doses of aerobic exercise, and a no-exercise&#xD;
      control group, on energy balance and body weight over 24 wks in overweight and obese persons.&#xD;
      The two aerobic exercise doses were: 1) 8 kcal/kg of body weight/week (KKW) (~900 kcal/wk)&#xD;
      and 2) 20 KKW (~2250 kcal/wk) compared to a no exercise control group. The low dose of&#xD;
      exercise (8 KKW) represents the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommendation for&#xD;
      overall health and the higher dose (20 KKW) the recommendation for weight loss and weight&#xD;
      loss maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 To investigate if colonic bacterial populations differ between the exercise groups and&#xD;
      the healthy living control group following aerobic exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that participants in the exercise group will have different bacterial&#xD;
      populations than those in the healthy living control group.&#xD;

    <description>The exercise expenditure goals were calculated by multiplying the participants' body weight by the exercise dose (8 or 20 KKW) divided by the number of sessions (3-5 sessions/wk). The speed and grade were monitored and documented to keep participant heart rate at 65-85% of tested VO2 peak and entered into ACSM equations for energy expenditure.</description>
