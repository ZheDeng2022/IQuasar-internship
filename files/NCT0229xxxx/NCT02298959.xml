  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ziv-aflibercept when given&#xD;
      together with pembrolizumab in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body (advanced). Ziv-afibercept works by decreasing blood and nutrient supply&#xD;
      to the tumor, which may result in shrinking the tumor. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving ziv-aflibercept&#xD;
      together with pembrolizumab may be a better treatment for patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety, tolerability and recommended phase II dosing for the combination&#xD;
      of ziv-aflibercept plus MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in patients with unresectable stage III or&#xD;
      stage IV melanoma, renal cell cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, or sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain preliminary estimates of progression-free survival at 6 months. II. To obtain&#xD;
      preliminary estimates of the rate of 1-year overall survival. III. To obtain preliminary&#xD;
      estimates of the response rate. IV. To obtain preliminary estimates of time to progression.&#xD;
      V. To perform correlative sciences that provide information regarding the mechanisms of&#xD;
      action for this combination treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation and dose expansion study of ziv-aflibercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 30 minutes and&#xD;
      ziv-aflibercept IV over 1-2 hours on day 1. Cycles repeat every 2 weeks for up to 2 years in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 12 weeks.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Dose escalation and dose expansion part 1 only: Has received prior therapy with an&#xD;
             anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or ziv-aflibercept (prior treatment&#xD;
             with bevacizumab is not an exclusion criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis,&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment; pregnant women are excluded&#xD;
             from this study because MK-3475 is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MK-3475,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475; these&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study; MK-3475 may have&#xD;
             adverse effects on a fetus in utero; furthermore, it is not known if MK-3475 has&#xD;
             transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm; patients are excluded from this&#xD;
             study if pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within&#xD;
             the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening&#xD;
             visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and non-pregnant, non-breast-feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to&#xD;
             use 2 methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive; highly&#xD;
             unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a&#xD;
             woman who is &gt;= 45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 2 years will&#xD;
             be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the&#xD;
             study; the two birth control methods can be barrier method or a barrier method plus a&#xD;
             hormonal method to prevent pregnancy; patients should start using birth control from&#xD;
             study visit 1 throughout the study period up to 120 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             therapy; the following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception:&#xD;
             diaphragm, condom (by the partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide;&#xD;
             appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed&#xD;
             contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including&#xD;
             oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents); patients should continue&#xD;
             contraceptive measures for 6 months from the last dose of all study medications;&#xD;
             patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks&#xD;
             to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study; in order to&#xD;
             participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement (described&#xD;
             above) for the duration of the study and during the follow-up period defined; if there&#xD;
             is any question that a patient will not reliably comply with the requirements for&#xD;
             contraception, that patient should not be entered into the study; pregnancy: If a&#xD;
             patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with MK-3475, the patient&#xD;
             will immediately be removed from the study; the site will contact the patient at least&#xD;
             monthly and document the patient's status until the pregnancy has been completed or&#xD;
             terminated; the outcome of the pregnancy will be reported without delay and within 24&#xD;
             hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion,&#xD;
             congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother&#xD;
             or newborn); the study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to&#xD;
             follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn;&#xD;
             if a male patient impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must&#xD;
             be informed immediately and the pregnancy reported and followed; it is unknown whether&#xD;
             MK-3475 is excreted in human milk; since many drugs are excreted in human milk, and&#xD;
             because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, patients&#xD;
             who are breast-feeding are not eligible for enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive may participate IF they&#xD;
             meet the following eligibility requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They must be stable on their anti-retroviral regimen, and they must be healthy&#xD;
                  from an HIV perspective&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They must have a cluster of differentiation (CD)4 count of greater than 250&#xD;
                  cells/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They must not be receiving prophylactic therapy for an opportunistic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or&#xD;
             hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is&#xD;
             detected)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History within 6 months prior to treatment of myocardial infarction, severe/unstable&#xD;
             angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), New York Heart Association&#xD;
             (NYHA) class III or IV congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke or transient ischemic&#xD;
             attack (TIA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History within 3 months prior to treatment of grade 3-4 gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
             bleeding/hemorrhage, treatment resistant peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis or&#xD;
             gastritis, infectious or in&#xD;
