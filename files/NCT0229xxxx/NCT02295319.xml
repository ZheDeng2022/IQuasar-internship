  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present non-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigates the effect of a&#xD;
      comprehensive discharge model in adult medical patients discharged directly home from an&#xD;
      Acute Admission Unit (AAU). In addition, eligible patients should have, at least, one&#xD;
      hospital admission 12 months prior to index hospitalization and be discharged for further&#xD;
      follow-up by general practitioner, home care nursing or in an out-patient clinic. The model&#xD;
      consists of 3 main steps during the short term stay in the AAU. First, patients are screened&#xD;
      for pre-hospital conditions that might have contributed to the index hospitalization i.e.&#xD;
      functional ability, ongoing treatment including drug treatment, need for additional&#xD;
      assistance to maintain daily living, relatives, and use of e.g. hearing aid, glasses, walker.&#xD;
      Second, at point of discharge there will be a thorough assessment of the discharge plan&#xD;
      focusing on the patients' comprehension of the discharge plan as well as accept of the&#xD;
      suggested treatment and follow-up. Third, within 2 days after discharge the patient will&#xD;
      receive a discharge letter by email or postal mail written in plain language and repeating&#xD;
      the information provided in the discharge summary to the general practitioner. Subsequently,&#xD;
      the patient will receive a telephone follow-up from the research nurse addressing the content&#xD;
      in the discharge letter and possible unresolved issues related to the index hospitalization.&#xD;
      Patients in the control group receives the usual discharge practice in the AAU which does not&#xD;
      include a discharge letter to the patient and telephone follow-up after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is number of readmissions within 72 hours and 30 days after discharge.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are healthcare service utilization within 30 days after discharge this&#xD;
      includes number of contacts to general practitioner, out-of-hours physicians, emergency&#xD;
      departments and if possible visits by home care nurses. Additionally, Quality-of-Life&#xD;
      measured 30 days after discharge by the questionnaire EQ5D and Patient Experience of the&#xD;
      discharge process is measured 7 days after discharge by a Danish national patient experience&#xD;
      survey - serves as secondary endpoints.&#xD;
