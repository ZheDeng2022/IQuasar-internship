  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is the most common cause of persistent regional pain&#xD;
      characterized by myofascial trigger points. Trigger point injection (TPI) using local&#xD;
      anesthetics is one of the most effective methods for treatment of MPS, and steroids or&#xD;
      botulinum toxin can be added to local injections .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent study suggested that the hyaluronan (HA) could be the basis of myofascial pain. HA&#xD;
      within the deep fascia facilitates the free sliding of two adjacent fibrous fascial layers.&#xD;
      If the HA assumes a more packed conformation, or more generally, if the loose connective&#xD;
      tissue inside the fascia alters its density, the behavior of the entire deep fascia and the&#xD;
      underlying muscle would be compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipated that hyaluronidase could decrease the viscosity of HA near the&#xD;
      muscle and fascia of trigger points. Meanwhile, hyaluronidase is thought to promote the&#xD;
      spread of local anesthetic solution by hydrolyzing glycosidic bonds within HA. Hyaluronidase&#xD;
      was shown to be effective in retro- and peribulbar block for ophthalmologic surgery or&#xD;
      reducing tissue edema in dermatology, and adhesiolysis for some interventional pain&#xD;
      managements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the effect of the addition of hyaluronidase to local anesthetics during TPI has not&#xD;
      been studied. The investigators aimed to compare the efficacy of TPI with the addition of&#xD;
      hyaluronidase compared to local anesthetic alone on pain and quality of life in MPS patients.&#xD;

      Study approval was obtained from Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Samsung medical center,&#xD;
      and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required sample size was determined by power analysis on the basis of a previous study.&#xD;
      The primary outcome was pain intensity in the posterior neck and upper back after TPI using&#xD;
      verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS). The standard deviation of VNRS was assumed to be 20.&#xD;
      Power calculations indicated that detecting 20 points difference in VNRS between the two&#xD;
      groups (with α = 0.05 and β = 0.1) would require a sample of 29 subjects for each group. To&#xD;
      account for dropouts, 33 subjects were recruited for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group L received TPI with a 3.2 ml of a 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine and 0.9% normal saline.&#xD;
      Group H received TPI with the same volume of solution supplemented with hyaluronidase&#xD;
      (H-LASE®, 1500 iu, L&amp;H Pharm., Seoul, Korea) 600 iu/ml. The investigators monitored vital&#xD;
      sign and any signs of complications such as bleeding, hematoma, allergic reactions for 30&#xD;
      minutes. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by one of the authors (J.W.C.) using VNRS. To&#xD;
      reduce bias, this evaluator and the participants were not informed of the assigned group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' characteristics such as age, height, weight, BMI and pretreatment neck disability&#xD;
      index (NDI) and brief pain inventory (BPI) were analyzed by independent t-test. The sex&#xD;
      distribution was analyzed by the chi-square test. P values were corrected by Bonferroni's&#xD;
      method. Pretreatment VNRS and the duration of pain were evaluated by the Wilcoxon two-sample&#xD;
      test. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare changes in the VNRS over time between the&#xD;
      two groups. Pre- and post-TPI changes in NDI and BPI were compared between the two groups&#xD;
      with the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the independent t-test, respectively. All analyses&#xD;
      were performed with SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) statistical software.&#xD;
      Significance was assumed for P values of less than 0.05.&#xD;
