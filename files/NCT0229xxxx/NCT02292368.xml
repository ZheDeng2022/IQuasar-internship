  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn which areas of the brain respond to&#xD;
      acupuncture that is designed to prevent xerostomia (dry mouth) in patients with head and neck&#xD;
      cancer. Researchers also want to learn if acupuncture can help prevent dry mouth and improve&#xD;
      patient quality of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry mouth is a common problem in cancer patients who have received radiation treatment to the&#xD;
      head and neck. Acupuncture is a technique that may treat symptoms by inserting very thin,&#xD;
      solid, sterile, stainless steel needles into the skin at specific points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) into 1 of 2 groups. You will have an equal chance of being in either&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive one type of acupuncture for one session and another type of acupuncture&#xD;
      for the second session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive one type of acupuncture for one session and another type of acupuncture&#xD;
      for the second session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will not know if you are assigned to Group 1 or Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your acupuncture treatments will be within 3 to 7 days of each other during Weeks 3-5 of your&#xD;
      regularly scheduled radiotherapy visits. It should take about 20 minutes to complete the&#xD;
      acupuncture session each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each acupuncture session, you will complete 3 questionnaires before each session that ask&#xD;
      about dry mouth, any other symptoms you may be having, and your treatment expectations. It&#xD;
      should take about 5 minutes total to complete these questionnaires. You will also complete&#xD;
      another brief questionnaire about dry mouth after each session. It should take about 1 minute&#xD;
      to complete this questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also have an EEG at each acupuncture treatment. The EEG will be recorded 5 minutes&#xD;
      before acupuncture, during acupuncture, and for 5 minutes after acupuncture. Total visit time&#xD;
      will last about 45-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will give a saliva sample before and after each acupuncture treatment to measure the&#xD;
      amount of saliva produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain on study for about 1 week. Your participation in the study will be over after&#xD;
      you complete the dry mouth questionnaire after your second acupuncture session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 30 will be enrolled at MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>Primary outcome variables include percentage changes of EEG scores at the medial frontal gyrus, precuneus, and anterior cingulate regions from pre- to post-acupuncture at each acupuncture session. Repeated measures ANOVA used for the analysis, with fixed effects of sequence (order of acupuncture sessions), treatment (each acupuncture group), and period (1st vs 2nd session), and random patient (nested within sequence) effects included. Adjustments for multiple testing made according to the method of Westfall and Young.</description>

    <measure>Symptoms of Xerostomia</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcomes are to determine between-acupuncture differences in radiation-induced xerostomia. Association examined between changes in neural outcomes and changes in salivary flow and self-report measures of xerostomia and other quality of life measures, controlling for the factors of acupuncture and period (1st vs 2nd) as appropriate.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of xerostomia prior to head and neck radiation therapy or history of Sjögren's&#xD;
             disease or another underlying systemic illness known to cause xerostomia.&#xD;

             insertion at the acupuncture points) that could interfere with accurate acupoint&#xD;
             location or alter the energy pathway as defined by traditional acupuncture theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Local skin infections at or near the acupuncture sites or are under treatment for&#xD;
