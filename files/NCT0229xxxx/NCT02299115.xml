    <textblock>
      Infantile Spasms, is an rare age-specific epilepsy of early infancy. A 2012 American Academy&#xD;
      Neurology/ Child Neurology Society practice parameter update on the medical treatment of&#xD;
      infantile spasms concluded: adrenocorticotrophic hormone or vigabatrin may be offered for&#xD;
      short-term treatment of infantile spasms. There was insufficient evidence to recommend the&#xD;
      use of prednisolone, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone. The cost of ACTH and the side&#xD;
      effects of vigabatrin have led to the consideration of alternative medications to treat&#xD;
      infantile spasms. The United Kingdom Infantile Spasms Study (UKISS) in 2004, comparing the&#xD;
      efficacy of intramuscular synthetic ACTH to high dose oral prednisolone, showed a response&#xD;
      rate of 74% for ACTH and 70% for prednisolone. Since the UKISS paper was published, many&#xD;
      institutions in the United States and Australia have used oral prednisolone instead of ACTH,&#xD;
      partly due to the exorbitant cost of intramuscular ACTH but also its ease of use and better&#xD;
      adverse event profile compared to ACTH. Prednisolone and vigabatrin are both oral&#xD;
      medications, which can be initiated promptly upon diagnosis of infantile spasms, expediting&#xD;
      treatment and shortening treatment lag time. Because the UKISS trial is the only Class 3&#xD;
      study providing evidence for oral prednisolone in the first-line treatment of infantile&#xD;
      spasms, further prospective studies are needed.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infantile spasms (IS) is a rare, catastrophic age-specific epilepsy syndrome with onset&#xD;
      within the first 12 months of life. The disorder is characterized clinically by epileptic&#xD;
      spasms, often accompanied by developmental regression and a characteristic interictal&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) pattern called hypsarrhythmia. When all these three features are&#xD;
      present, the term, &quot;West syndrome&quot; is commonly used. The catastrophic nature of the disorder&#xD;
      is due to the frequent sequelae of severe global neurodevelopmental delay and medically&#xD;
      refractory epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial age of onset in 90% of cases occur before 12 months of life, with peak onset at 6&#xD;
      months. The incidence is 2 to 3 per 10,000 live births with a lifetime prevalence of 1.5 to 2&#xD;
      per 10,000 children. It is slightly more common in males, and a family history exists in&#xD;
      3%-6% of cases.1,2,3 The etiology of IS has conventionally been divided into symptomatic or&#xD;
      cryptogenic, depending on whether the underlying cause is known. Conditions causing&#xD;
      symptomatic IS are diverse and can include focal or multifocal brain injuries, chromosomal&#xD;
      abnormalities and genetic mutations and inborn errors of metabolism. In about 20% of cases,&#xD;
      the identifiable cause remains unknown and these are defined as cryptogenic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spontaneous remission rate of IS in limited natural history studies is 30%.4,5 Although&#xD;
      the clinical spasms and typical EEG pattern disappear by 3 to 4 years of age, up to 60% of&#xD;
      children with IS will go on to develop other types of refractory seizures, including Lennox&#xD;
      Gastaut syndrome. The poor developmental outcome in IS is primarily due to the underlying&#xD;
      etiology, however, delay in diagnosis and treatment6 and the use of ineffective therapies are&#xD;
      also contributory factors. The hypsarrhythmia EEG pattern is a pattern of epileptic&#xD;
      encephalopathy and there is evidence that longer duration of epileptic encephalopathy&#xD;
      contributes to developmental delay and to the development of autism, especially in infants&#xD;
      with Down syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).7,8 Currently, there is still&#xD;
      considerable variation in the management of IS, as evidenced by the US Consensus Report and a&#xD;
      recent survey done on the current evaluation and treatment of IS among members of the Child&#xD;
      Neurology Society (CNS). Most neurologists use adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) as their&#xD;
      preferred, first-line treatment of IS, not caused by TSC and Vigabatrin (VGB) as the&#xD;
      first-line treatment of IS caused by TSC. 9,10 The 2004 American Academy of Neurology (AAN)&#xD;
      and CNS practice parameter on the medical treatment of IS and the 2012 update of this&#xD;
      evidenced-based guideline concluded that ACTH or VGB may be useful for the short-term&#xD;
      treatment of IS, with ACTH being more effective than VGB excluding cases with TSC. 11,12 The&#xD;
      2012 update also concluded that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether other&#xD;
      forms of corticosteroids are as effective as ACTH. There is also insufficient evidence to&#xD;
      recommend other agents, or combination therapy in the short-term treatment of IS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many conditions can cause IS, several hypotheses regarding the underlying mechanisms&#xD;
      have been proposed. The corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) hypothesis is one of the most&#xD;
      studied. Children with IS, have the common characteristic of excessive release of CRH.&#xD;
      Elevated CRH can cause seizures and neuronal death within the hippocampus and amygdala of&#xD;
      immature brains in animal studies. Elevated CRH also cause desensitization of CRH receptors&#xD;
      leading to decreased ACTH release and resulting in reduced ACTH levels in the cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (CSF). ACTH treatment, most likely suppresses the excessive production of CRH via&#xD;
      direct action on melanocortin receptors eliciting an antiepileptic effect.13 Prednisolone is&#xD;
      a primary metabolite of a synthetic glucocorticoid, prednisone. Corticosteroids can reduce&#xD;
      hippocampal excitability in vitro, increases gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and antagonize&#xD;
      5-hydroxytryptophan.14 VGB is an irreversible, enzyme-activated, selective inhibitor of&#xD;
      GABA-transaminase. By inhibiting its catabolism, there is increased availability of GABA&#xD;
      within the synaptic cleft, increasing its inhibitory effect.15 The mammalian target of&#xD;
      rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a key signaling pathway that is dysregulated in TSC. Animal&#xD;
      studies have shown that VGB partially inhibited mTOR pathway activity and glial proliferation&#xD;
      in the knock-out mice in vitro, as well as reduced mTOR pathway activation in cultured&#xD;
      astrocytes from both knock-out and control mice. This may account for the unique efficacy of&#xD;
      VGB in TSC.16&#xD;
&#xD;
      At our institution, VGB is the preferred first-line treatment for all newly diagnosed IS due&#xD;
      to its relative ease of use and fewer acute adverse events compared to ACTH. However,&#xD;
      concerns regarding retinal toxicity17 require regular monitoring with electroretinograms&#xD;
      (ERGs) performed under sedation.18 Also, VGB-related MRI changes are seen in 22-32% of&#xD;
      children treated for IS and although these changes are mostly asymptomatic and may resolve&#xD;
      even when VGB is continued, there is concern that the changes reflect a medication-related&#xD;
      neurotoxic effect.19,20 For patients who fail VGB, we use a 6-week course of synthetic ACTH&#xD;
      (Synacthen) given intramuscularly (IM) every other day as second-line agent. However, it is&#xD;
      associated with significant adverse events, which include infections from immunosuppression,&#xD;
      arterial hypertension, weight gain, severe irritability, gastric irritation, hyperglycemia,&#xD;
      electrolyte disturbances, cerebral atrophy, and behavioral changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The United Kingdom Infantile Spasms Study (UKISS) demonstrated the superiority of hormonal&#xD;
      therapy over VGB for cessation of spasms at 14 days in infants without TSC. The hormonal&#xD;
      therapy arm included patients allocated high-dose oral prednisolone and intramuscular ACTH&#xD;
      and the study showed that prednisolone was as effective as ACTH.21 Because this is the only&#xD;
      Class 3 study providing evidence for oral prednisolone in the first-line treatment of IS,&#xD;
      further prospective studies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2010, the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) started providing the option of either&#xD;
      IM ACTH or high-dose oral prednisolone as second-line treatments when patient failed VGB. Our&#xD;
      previous retrospective case review of twenty IS patients who had failed a 2-week course of&#xD;
      VGB showed an 80% response rate (12/15) to ACTH and only 20% (1/5) to prednisolone. 22. This&#xD;
      seemingly low response to prednisolone may be due to the underlying etiology, which made the&#xD;
      condition refractory to VGB in the first place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the UKISS paper was published, many institutions in the US and Australia have used oral&#xD;
      prednisolone instead of ACTH, partly due to the exorbitant cost of intramuscular ACTH&#xD;
      (US$70,000 per course for natural ACTH) but also its ease of use and better adverse event&#xD;
      profile compared to ACTH.23,24 A retrospective case series of 17 newly diagnosed IS given&#xD;
      high-dose oral prednisolone as first-line treatment showed clinical response of 100% in the&#xD;
      cryptogenic group, and 64% in the symptomatic (non-TSC) group.24 A retrospective case series&#xD;
      of 27 newly diagnosed IS given high dose prednisolone (8mg/kg/day) with a maximum daily dose&#xD;
      of 60 mg showed a 63% response rate (17/27) to prednisolone within 2 weeks. 25&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of the starting dose and 4 week, duration of treatment was based on the&#xD;
      previous studies, which used a dose range of 4-8 mg/kg/day and 8mg/kg/day respectively with 4&#xD;
      - 6 weeks duration of therapy. 21.23.24.25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We elected to use the higher end of the dose range previously reported to ensure maximum&#xD;
      efficacy, with the shorter length of 4 weeks of treatment to reduce the risk of medication&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relapse rate for infantile spasms in retrospective studies has ranged between 12-40%,&#xD;
      with time to relapse between 2-25 months. 24,25. We do not envisage using long-term treatment&#xD;
      or recurrent intermittent treatment with prednisolone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prednisolone and VGB are both oral medications, which can be initiated promptly upon&#xD;
      diagnosis of IS, expediting treatment and shortening treatment lag time. We propose that oral&#xD;
      prednisolone may be more effective than VGB when used as a first-line treatment in newly&#xD;
      diagnosed non-TSC IS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      and Objective of the study: Aim To compare the efficacy of prednisolone and VGB as 1st line&#xD;
      short-term treatment of IS as measured by clinical and EEG response at 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      More patients allocated to prednisolone therapy will have cessation of spasms and resolution&#xD;
      of hypsarrhythmia at 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single center, prospective, observational, open trial using high-dose oral prednisolone as&#xD;
      first-line treatment for newly diagnosed IS (non-Tuberous Sclerosis), with follow up at 2&#xD;
      weeks, the end of treatment and then 5 months later. All patients will undergo thorough&#xD;
      history, physical and neurological examination, metabolic, genetic, EEG and neuroimaging&#xD;
      studies as per the Hospital for Sick Children (HSC) Infantile Spasms Guidelines. 25 These&#xD;
      patients will be compared to our historical controls, composed of our cohort of non-TSC IS&#xD;
      patients from January 2010- September 2013 who received VGB as first-line treatment, met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and were followed up for at least 6 months from diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients and their families are under no obligation to be involved in the study and will&#xD;
      continue to receive care from their primary neurologists should they choose not to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: The length of the study for each patient will be approximately 6 months. The&#xD;
      total duration of the study is estimated at 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: A sample population of 70 patients in the retrospective VGB cohort and 35&#xD;
      patients in the prospective Prednisolone cohort with a 2:1 match are required to demonstrate&#xD;
      a statistically significant difference in efficacy of 25% between Prednisolone and&#xD;
      Vigabatrin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population: Children between the ages of 2-24 months with a clinical spasms and&#xD;
      hypsarrhythmia or modified hypsarrhythmia on initial EEG referred to the outpatient Neurology&#xD;
      clinic at Sickkids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Population: Historical controls will be composed of our cohort of non-TSC IS patients&#xD;
      from 2010-2013 who received VGB as first-line treatment and fulfill the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      for the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria: Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 2-24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical spasms&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Initial EEG with hypsarrhythmia or modified hypsarrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
        The inclusion criteria do not quantify the initial severity or frequency of infantile&#xD;
        spasms. Infantile spasms is a unique epileptic disorder characterized by clusters of brief&#xD;
        infantile spasms, where each one lasts a few seconds and cluster may last minutes. The&#xD;
        diagnosis of infantile spasms and response to medication depends on the presence or absence&#xD;
        of these events and the frequency of infantile spasms has not been used to determine&#xD;
        medication efficacy in previous studies. A seizure diary will be used to quantify the&#xD;
        seizure burden, however efficacy will depend on complete resolution of clinical spasms and&#xD;
        resolution of hypsarrhythmia on EEG -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age &lt;2months or older than 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Tuberous sclerosis (if known at the time of enrolment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Previous treatment (within 28 days) with VGB or hormonal treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Contraindications to hormonal therapy: This includes untreated systemic fungal&#xD;
             infections, known hypersensitivity to prednisolone or other corticosteroids, or to any&#xD;
             of the non-medicinal ingredients present in the solution. Active or latent&#xD;
             tuberculosis, ocular herpes simplex, hypothyroidism, hepatic cirrhosis, nonspecific&#xD;
             ulcerative colitis, abscess or other pyogenic infection, fresh intestinal anastomoses,&#xD;
             active or latent peptic ulcer, renal insufficiency, hypertension, osteoporosis,&#xD;
             cardiac disease, thromboembolic disorders and diabetes mellitus. All patients with&#xD;
             cardiac risk factors will receive an electrocardiogram (ECG), chest xray (CXR) and&#xD;
             cardiology referral if indicated. Patients diagnosed with cardiac disorders will be&#xD;
             excluded from the study since high dose steroids may exacerbate arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Inability of parents or guardians to give consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Enrolment in a concurrent treatment trial that might affect outcome measures of this&#xD;
             trial -&#xD;
