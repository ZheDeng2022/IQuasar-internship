  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newborn screening and early treatment prevent the most severe manifestations of&#xD;
      phenylketonuria (PKU). However, executive functioning deficits, attention deficit disorder,&#xD;
      slow processing speed, and visual-motor problems commonly occur. Many adults with this&#xD;
      disorder also suffer depression and anxiety. In this study the investigators will examine&#xD;
      adults with PKU on sapropterin dihydrochloride (Kuvan) treatment for PKU and compare their&#xD;
      results to those of subjects with PKU not on Kuvan. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      techniques, including novel MR spectroscopy (MRS) the investigators hope to discover why this&#xD;
      distinct constellation of deficits occurs in PKU. Adult subjects with PKU will undergo a&#xD;
      comprehensive MRI evaluations, including a novel method of MR spectroscopy to determine brain&#xD;
      phenylalanine levels. In addition, participants will receive neurological and&#xD;
      neuropsychological examinations and dietary evaluation.&#xD;

      Phenylketonuria (PKU, OMIM 261600), an autosomal recessive disorder, affects approximately&#xD;
      1:11,000 individuals in the United States. In PKU, mutations in the gene responsible for the&#xD;
      liver enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) result in reduced or absent conversion of&#xD;
      phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine (Tyr) and subsequently to elevated plasma concentrations of&#xD;
      Phe and reduced concentrations of Tyr (Scriver and Kaufman, 2001). Untreated PKU results in&#xD;
      progressive, neurological decline by 6-12 months of age (Koch et al, 1971). Even with early&#xD;
      detection and treatment with a Phe-restricted diet, patients experience neurocognitive&#xD;
      deficits (Waisbren et al, 1994) and psychiatric disturbances as they get older (Brumm et al,&#xD;
      2010; Bilder et al, 2013; Weglage et al, 2013) as well as white matter abnormalities detected&#xD;
      through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Mastrangelo et al, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In treated PKU, neuropsychological functioning is associated with exposure to elevated blood&#xD;
      phenylalanine levels (Jahja et a;. 2017; and decreased blood tyrosine (Luciana, Sullivan,&#xD;
      Nelson, 2001). However, the extent to which these biomarkers confer risks to cognitive and&#xD;
      emotional well-being varies dramatically, with some individuals experiencing serious deficits&#xD;
      and others functioning normally despite equally high phenylalanine or depleted tyrosine&#xD;
      levels in blood (Rajabi, Waisbren and Levy, 2016; Manti et al, 2017 ). One explanation is&#xD;
      that blood Phe and Tyr do not represent exposure in the brain (Diamond et al, 1997; Surtees&#xD;
      and Blau, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, we reported on an improved method for measuring brain Phe and brain Tyr in PKU&#xD;
      (Waisbren et al, 2016) using two dimensional shift correlated magnetic resonance spectroscopy&#xD;
      (COSY) (Thomas et al, 2001). This allows for the unambiguous identification of cerebral&#xD;
      metabolites that could not be detected using conventional MRS methods due to spectral&#xD;
      overlap. By obtaining multiple acquisitions at different echo times, a second chemical shift&#xD;
      domain allows for metabolites to be identified by two chemical shifts instead of just one&#xD;
      based on scalar coupling of different proton groups. The concentration of the metabolite is&#xD;
      therefore shown in the third dimension. By visualizing the COSY data in three dimensions,&#xD;
      smaller resonances that would have been obscured by larger resonances can be measured (Figure&#xD;
      1). Different brain regions, separating white and gray matter tissue, can be assessed with&#xD;
      this method as a smaller voxel can be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our previous study, we demonstrated that COSY could be used to quantify brain Phe and&#xD;
      brain Tyr in two brain regions in adults with treated PKU without the need for a&#xD;
      phenylalanine load. We also examined the relationship between these biomarkers and&#xD;
      neuropsychological functioning and found that associations were in the expected direction,&#xD;
      with higher brain Phe and lower brain Tyr related to poorer functioning (Waisbren et al,&#xD;
      2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study reported here were to examine the relationships between blood and brain&#xD;
      concentrations of Phe and Tyr in patients on sapropterin dihydrochloride (BH4 or Kuvan) and&#xD;
      to assess the relationships between these biomarkers and neuropsychological functioning.&#xD;
