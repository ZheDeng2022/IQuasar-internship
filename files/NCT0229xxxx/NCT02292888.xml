      Hypothesis: A validated technique to measure cardiac output (CO) using echocardiography is to&#xD;
      calculate stroke volume from the product of LVOT area and LVOT VTI and multiplying the&#xD;
      product with heart rate ( CO = SV x H/R; SV = LVOT area x LVOT VTI ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LVOT diameter for an individual is more or less a constant measurement. Therefore using&#xD;
      the formula mentioned above (SV = LVOT area x LVOT VTI), if the LVOT area is constant, then&#xD;
      SV should be proportional to the VTI. This means if a PLR manoeuvre or fluid bolus helps to&#xD;
      achieve a rise in SV, then it should be reflected in an increase in VTI as well. If this&#xD;
      assumption is true, then an increase in the value of VTI from baseline after fluid challenge&#xD;
      (10-15%), should identify a volume responsive patient.&#xD;

      Can changes in LVOT VTI before and after passive leg raising (PLR) test serve as a sensitive&#xD;
      indicator for changes in SV and CO and hence volume responsiveness ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is Doppler LVOT VTI? Placing a Pulsed Wave Doppler gate on the LVOT immediately below&#xD;
      the opening of the aortic valve while aligning the Doppler beam as parallel to the&#xD;
      LVOT/aortic axis as possible with an angle of Doppler alignment &lt;20˚, one may obtain Doppler&#xD;
      flow velocity measurements which can help measure the LVOT VTI (Velocity Time Integral). If&#xD;
      one integrates this velocity profile between two time points (i.e., calculates the area under&#xD;
      the curve), the distance traversed of &quot;a region of blood&quot; flowing during this period may be&#xD;
      estimated. Since flow velocity is not constant throughout a flow cycle, all of the flow&#xD;
      velocities during the entire ejection period is integrated to measure &quot;distance traversed&quot; of&#xD;
      this &quot;region of blood.&quot; This integration of flow velocities in a given period of time is&#xD;
      called the velocity-time integral (VTI)(1) and yields length or distance (measured in cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal: Whether VTI (LVOT) measured from the deep transgastric (deep TG) or transgastric long&#xD;
      axis (TG LAX ) views reflect changes in stroke volume(SV) and hence cardiac output (CO)&#xD;
      measured by the gold standard method (PA CCO by thermodilution) before and after passive leg&#xD;
      raising test (PLR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A validated technique to measure cardiac output (CO) using echocardiography is to&#xD;
      calculate stroke volume from the product of LVOT area and LVOT VTI and multiplying the&#xD;
      product with heart rate ( CO = SV x H/R; SV = LVOT area x LVOT VTI ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LVOT diameter for an individual is more or less a constant measurement. Therefore using&#xD;
      the formula mentioned above (SV = LVOT area x LVOT VTI), if the LVOT area is constant, then&#xD;
      SV should be proportional to the VTI. This means if a PLR manoeuvre or fluid bolus helps to&#xD;
      achieve a rise in SV, then it should be reflected in an increase in VTI as well. If this&#xD;
      assumption is true, then an increase in the value of VTI from baseline after fluid challenge&#xD;
      (10-15%), should identify a volume responsive patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why do the investigators wish to do the study? A significant improvement in the field of&#xD;
      anesthesiology would occur if we could have a simple yet accurate relatively non-invasive&#xD;
      tool to correctly assess fluid responsiveness. Excessive fluid infused in the operating room&#xD;
      would prolong mechanical ventilation and stay in the ICU and negatively affect the prognosis&#xD;
      of the patient. While monitoring with CCO PA catheter considerable adds to the expense, it&#xD;
      has its own complications and as may not be indicated in majority of operative cases. A&#xD;
      simple non invasive tool using TEE can significantly add to our understanding of hemodynamics&#xD;
      and help guide fluid therapy. If our assumption proves to be correct, then it could be a&#xD;
      simple, yet rapid bedside indicator of CO. It could be used as a simple tool to assess fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fundamental reason why a fluid challenge (PLR or fluid boluses) is used is to assess&#xD;
      whether there is an increase stroke volume in response to it (2). If the fluid loading fails&#xD;
      to improve the stroke volume the fluid challenge/loading serves no useful purpose. In normal&#xD;
      physiological conditions both the ventricles operate on the ascending limb of the&#xD;
      Frank-Starling curve. Once the left ventricle starts functioning on the 'flat' portion of the&#xD;
      Frank-Starling curve, fluid loading has little or no effect on stroke volume. If LVOT VTI&#xD;
      could be shown to reflect SV adequately then it will be a relatively simple non invasive&#xD;
      dynamic bedside tool to test if fluid boluses are resulting in an increase in VTI hence the&#xD;
      SV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volume responsiveness has been assessed in literature by measuring the response to fluid&#xD;
      boluses or to PLR. Thus a positive test where after a PLR, VTI increased significantly&#xD;
      reflecting a positive change in SV and CO, more fluid would be required. Whereas if during&#xD;
      PLR, CO and SV diminished reflected by a decrease in the VTI value compared to baseline, the&#xD;
      subject would be unlikely to respond to fluid therapy and probably would require inotropic&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why PLR ? A recent meta-analysis (3), which pooled the results of eight recent studies,&#xD;
      confirmed the excellent value of PLR to predict fluid responsiveness in critically ill&#xD;
      patients with a global area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations of using Doppler VTI: However, use of these equations entails a number of&#xD;
      assumptions, including (a) laminar blood flow in the area interrogated, (b) a flat or blunt&#xD;
      flow velocity profile such that the flow across the entire CSA interrogated is relatively&#xD;
      uniform, and (c) Doppler angle of incidence between the Doppler beam and the main direction&#xD;
      of blood flow is less than 20 degrees, so that the underestimation of the flow velocity is&#xD;
      less than 6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 50 adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Materials &amp;&#xD;
      Methods: After institutional ethics committee approval and personal informed consent, 50&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery would be included into the study.&#xD;
      Patients with significant arrhythmias, concomitant aortic aneurysms, and esophageal pathology&#xD;
      precluding the use of TEE would be considered ineligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be divided into two groups. Patients with normal LV function or mild LV&#xD;
      systolic dysfunction (LVEF &gt;40%)(4), assessed by preoperative echocardiography would comprise&#xD;
      Group 1, whereas those with preoperative LV moderate to severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF&#xD;
      &lt;40%)(4) would be designated to Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic protocol: Patients would be fasted for 8 hours preceding the operation. No i.v.&#xD;
      fluids would be administered during this period. Patients would be pre-medicated with their&#xD;
      usual cardiovascular medication and 1mg of Lorazepam the night before and would receive 1-2&#xD;
      mg of Midazolam at arrival to the operation theatre. After initiating standard monitoring&#xD;
      (ECG, Pulse oximetry, NBP) invasive lines would be introduced under local anesthetic&#xD;
      infiltration while the patient would receive supplemental oxygen via facemask. Induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia would include 0.05 mg kg_1 Midazolam and 5 mcg kg_1 Fentanyl in addition to&#xD;
      Sevoflurane 3-5% titrated to loss of eyelash reflex. Tracheal intubation would be facilitated&#xD;
      by Rocuronium 0.1 mg kg_1. Anaesthesia would be maintained by Sevoflurane 1.5-2% titrated to&#xD;
      an end tidal value of &gt;1.5%and above supplemented by additional doses of fentanyl up to a&#xD;
      total dose of 15-20 mg kg_1. All patients would receive 500 ml of lactated Ringer solution&#xD;
      during the induction period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic and Echocardiographic monitoring. A 7.0Fr triple lumen central line, a 8.5 Fr PA&#xD;
      sheath and 7.0 Fr CCO (Continuous Cardiac Output) PA catheter and a 16 G femoral arterial&#xD;
      canula would be introduced prior to induction of anesthesia under light sedation and local&#xD;
      anesthesia. ''''A Philips HD 11XE ultrasound machine (Andover, USA) and transesophageal&#xD;
      multiplane echocardiographic probe would be used in all patients. After a comprehensive TEE&#xD;
      examination the probe would be positioned to record images from either a deep TG or TGLAX&#xD;
      views. Images would be recorded for off-line evaluation. A Board certified echocardiographer&#xD;
      proficient in TEE would perform all echocardiographic measurements. Offline echocardiographic&#xD;
      measurements would be done by a trained echocardiographer who would be blinded to the study&#xD;
      protocol. All hemodynamic measurements will be recorded by a dedicated research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol: After the induction of anesthesia and initiation of hemodynamic&#xD;
      monitoring the patients would be stabilized as necessary and observed for 10-15 min. No&#xD;
      further interventions would be allowed during this period, including further fluid&#xD;
      administration, changes in anesthetic concentrations or manipulations with inotropic or&#xD;
      vasoconstrictor concentrations. A period of at least 5 min of stable BP, heart rate, CVP, and&#xD;
      continuous cardiac output would be required before obtaining the baseline set of hemodynamic&#xD;
      measurements. A passive leg raising (PLR) maneuver (45%) using protocol described before* in&#xD;
      literature would be performed and changes in hemodynamic and echocardiographic parameters&#xD;
      would be measured within 1 minute post PLR. The same sequence of PLR and echocardiographic&#xD;
      and hemodynamic measurements would be repeated after the end of the operation and before the&#xD;
      transfer to the ICU. No measurements would be carried out in the presence of hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability or immediately following changes of inotropic or anesthetic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first set of measurements (HR, MAP, VTI, SV, CO, LVEF and LVOT area ) would be obtained&#xD;
      in the semi-recumbent position (45°; designated 'baseline'). Then, the lower limbs would be&#xD;
      lifted while straight (45°) with the trunk lowered in the supine position. The second set of&#xD;
      measurements of (designated 'during PLR') was obtained during leg elevation, at the moment&#xD;
      when VTI plateaued at its highest value. The stroke volume with CCO monitor would be recorded&#xD;
      at the moment when it plateaued at its highest value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NB. Why record changes in VTI/SV etc . within 1 minute post PLR ? Because the maximal&#xD;
      hemodynamic effects of PLR occur within the first minute of leg elevation, it is important to&#xD;
      assess these effects with a method that is able to track changes in cardiac output or stroke&#xD;
      volume on a real-time basis.(5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      NB. Passive leg raising. The passive leg raising test consists in measuring the hemodynamic&#xD;
      effects of a leg elevation up to 45°. A simple way to perform the postural maneuver is to&#xD;
      transfer the patient from the semirecumbent posture to the passive leg raising position by&#xD;
      using the automatic motion of the bed.&#xD;
