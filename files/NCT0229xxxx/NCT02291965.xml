      The long-range goal of this work is to improve overall survival in hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (HCT) recipients by personalizing their conditioning regimen and/or intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) busulfan (BU) doses using metabolomics. BU is an essential part of the majority of HCT&#xD;
      conditioning regimens, but has a narrow therapeutic index; low BU plasma exposure (caused by&#xD;
      rapid clearance) is associated with an increased risk of rejection or relapse, while high BU&#xD;
      plasma exposure is associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Although&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK)-based dosing to a target BU exposure is often conducted, relapse and&#xD;
      toxicity continue to be problematic. Furthermore, shorter IV BU courses necessitate&#xD;
      alternative methods to personalize IV BU. IV BU clearance, however, is not associated with&#xD;
      polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase (GST) A1 and GSTM1, the predominant GSTs in BU&#xD;
      conjugation with glutathione. Therefore, investigators seek to test the working hypothesis&#xD;
      that metabolomic signature, which provides novel insight into the in vivo cellular response&#xD;
      and metabolite identification, is associated with IV BU clearance. Investigators will first&#xD;
      determine if endogenous metabolomics-based biomarkers obtained before BU administration can&#xD;
      predict IV BU clearance. Researchers will evaluate endogenous biomarkers using a targeted&#xD;
      (glutathione pathway) and global analyses via liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. In&#xD;
      addition, investigators seek to evaluate IV BU metabolism using metabolomics in parallel with&#xD;
      gas chromatography-mass selective detection in patients receiving PK-based IV BU. Researchers&#xD;
      will evaluate plasma concentrations of eight different metabolites, building upon their&#xD;
      experience with tetrahydrothiophene (THT+). To complement this metabolomic work,&#xD;
      investigators seek to validate covariates associated with IV BU PK, specifically age and body&#xD;
      size, to mitigate a typical challenge for metabolomics research: the lack of understanding of&#xD;
      potentially confounding factors. FHCRC has been a reference clinical laboratory for PK-based&#xD;
      BU dosing since 1996 and thus, FHCRC researchers have the largest database of IV BU PK. Using&#xD;
      population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis, investigators will validate covariates for IV BU&#xD;
      PK to guide future metabolomic studies. This popPK analysis can immediately improve patient&#xD;
      care by using covariates to more accurately estimate an IV BU starting dose (i.e., before&#xD;
      PK-based dosing) and by creating a limited sampling schedule to more efficiently use PK-based&#xD;
      dosing. These complementary aims, which seek to identify novel metabolomics-based biomarkers,&#xD;
      could overcome a critical barrier to HCT conditioning of balancing between response and&#xD;
      toxicity. Based on compelling preliminary data, researchers expect to identify an endogenous&#xD;
      metabolomic signature that will influence the choice of an IV BU starting dose with the&#xD;
      intention of improving overall survival for patients receiving IV BU-containing HCT regimens.&#xD;
