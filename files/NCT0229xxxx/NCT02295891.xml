  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary hyperhidrosis is a pathological condition characterized by the idiopathic and&#xD;
      excessive secretion of sweat beyond normal physiological demand and is localized at&#xD;
      particular foci such as the face, axilla, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. Patients&#xD;
      seeking medical attention for hyperhidrosis often report disruptions to their professional&#xD;
      and/or social lives due to sweating and subsequently experience many psychosocial&#xD;
      difficulties, such as anxiety, social phobia, and depression. Therefore, a psychiatric&#xD;
      explanation of causality is frequently offered for these patients during diagnosis. Excessive&#xD;
      sweating is often mistakenly interpreted as a symptom of an anxiety disorder and can be cause&#xD;
      for social embarrassment, exacerbating emotional stress and social avoidance. As currently&#xD;
      constituted, the treatment of secondary psychosocial symptoms in primary hyperhidrosis is&#xD;
      poorly understood and requires further investigation.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of the miraDry ® treatment system for psychosocial&#xD;
           functioning in patients heavily affected by axillary hyperhidrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the outcomes of and clinical response to the MiraDry ® treatment system&#xD;
           with respect to the aforementioned criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the results of non-invasive miraDry ® treatment system to the existing&#xD;
           surgical correction with respect to the aforementioned criteria.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the effectiveness of the miraDry ® treatment system for psychosocial functioning in patients heavily affected by axillary hyperhidrosis. Patients will be asked to complete the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) as a prescreening survey. The HDSS (below) is a diagnostic tool that qualitatively measures (Likert scaled 1-4) disease-specific severity of the patient's condition based on the degree to which daily activities are impacted. This will be done at baseline, during treatment, at the 6 month follow-up visit, and 1 year follow-up visit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study will recruit patients diagnosed with focal hyperhidrosis with a known diagnosis&#xD;
        of primarily axillary localization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will only enroll patients available for both treatment visits. Availability for&#xD;
        follow-up visit is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only patients between the ages of 18 and 29 years when the first HHIQ is administered will&#xD;
        be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The upper age limit was so determined because patients over 29 years often present with&#xD;
        psychopathology which is far more recalcitrant to correction of any kind regardless of&#xD;
        effectiveness because of the duration of the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The lower age limit was so determined because 18 years and up are the ages for which the&#xD;
        miraDry ® procedure has been approved for use by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants will be screened using the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only patients reporting their condition as a 3 out of 4 or higher on the HDSS will be&#xD;
        eligible for study because preliminary data suggests effective detection of psychological&#xD;
        changes only at higher reported levels of sweating severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patient's previous non-invasive treatment course, including but not limited to&#xD;
        prescription of psychiatric medication and topical therapies, will not justify exclusion&#xD;
        from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are unable to provide informed consent, have known allergies to lidocaine,&#xD;
        hibiclens with 4% chlorhexidine, and/or epinephrine, are pregnant (as determined by&#xD;
        self-reporting), are unable to take oral antibiotics or antiseptic washes, have heart&#xD;
        pacemakers or other electronic device implants, and who need supplemental oxygen are not&#xD;
        eligible to participate in this study&#xD;
