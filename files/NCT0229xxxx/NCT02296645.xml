      This is a randomized, paired-comparisons design where each subject receives two of the&#xD;
      planned treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ZuraPrep is being evaluated for safety and efficacy as a preoperative skin preparation&#xD;
      against the Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) 10-minute end point recently revised by the FDA&#xD;
      for the lower bound of a 95% confidence interval whereas there must be specific reductions of&#xD;
      normal flora in the abdomen and groin areas. A positive control will be evaluated as well.&#xD;
