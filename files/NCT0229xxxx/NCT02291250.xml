  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary strategies for alleviating health complications associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D)&#xD;
      are being pursued as alternatives to pharmaceutical interventions. Berries such as&#xD;
      blackcurrants that are rich in polyphenols may influence carbohydrate digestion and&#xD;
      absorption and thus postprandial glycaemia. In addition berries have been reported to alter&#xD;
      incretins as well as to have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may also&#xD;
      affect postprandial glycaemia. This study investigated the acute affect blackcurrants on&#xD;
      glucose metabolism in overweight/obese volunteers .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixteen overweight/obese volunteers from the Aberdeen area will be recruited into a&#xD;
      randomised controlled study. Volunteers will be randomised into four groups matched for BMI&#xD;
      and age and given 200 grams of blackcurrants (which contain anthocyanins) or greencurrants&#xD;
      (which naturally contain no anthocyanins), followed by an OGTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consumption of the currants will be followed by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)&#xD;
      with Polycal (complex carbohydrate) or glucose (simple carbohydrate) as the carbohydrate&#xD;
      load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a one week minimum wash out period between each intervention. All interventions&#xD;
      will be randomised and blinded as far as possible in a cross-over design where the volunteers&#xD;
      are acting as their own control. The volunteers will be asked to consume a low phytochemical&#xD;
      diet three days prior to taking the currants all occasions. In addition, they will be asked&#xD;
      to record what they ate over the same period in a simple food diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following intervention will be carried out on 16 overweight/obese male/postmenopausal&#xD;
      female non-smoker volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control: sugar matched (matched to currant sugar content) water with polycal (complex&#xD;
           carbohydrate load)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blackcurrants (which contain anthocyanins; 200grams) with polycal (complex carbohydrate&#xD;
           load)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blackcurrants (which contain anthocyanins; 200grams) with glucose (simple carbohydrate&#xD;
           load)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Greencurrants (which naturally contain no anthocyanins; 200grams) with polycal (complex&#xD;
           carbohydrate load)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: the polycal will contain the equivalent glucose load as given in intervention 3&#xD;
      assuming complete hydrolysis of all carbohydrates.&#xD;
