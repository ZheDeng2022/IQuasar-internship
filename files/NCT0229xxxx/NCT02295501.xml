      The objective of this Phase 1 safety study is to provide access to the potential therapeutic&#xD;
      benefit of EBOV convalescent plasma containing antibodies to EBOV. The risk of exposure to&#xD;
      plasma from donors who may be infected with other transfusion-transmitted pathogens, not&#xD;
      detectable by current licensed donor testing procedures, will be mitigated by using pathogen&#xD;
      inactivation to minimize the risk of the TTI from these donors, who would otherwise be&#xD;
      deferred and ineligible for blood donation.&#xD;

      The objective of this Phase 1 safety study is to provide access to the potential therapeutic&#xD;
      benefit of EBOV convalescent plasma containing antibodies to EBOV. The risk of exposure to&#xD;
      plasma from donors who may be infected with other transfusion-transmitted pathogens, not&#xD;
      detectable by current licensed donor testing procedures, will be mitigated by using pathogen&#xD;
      inactivation to minimize the risk of the TTI from these donors, who would otherwise be&#xD;
      deferred and ineligible for blood donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a prospective, open label, multi-center, single arm study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of INTERCEPT plasma prepared from EBOV convalescent donors&#xD;
      for passive immune therapy in subjects with acute EVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected to assess the safety of this intervention by monitoring adverse events&#xD;
      in the immediate 24-hour post transfusion period. Efficacy will be assessed by monitoring the&#xD;
      clinical status of treated subjects with respect to clearance of EBOV by using nucleic acid&#xD;
      assays to measure pre and post treatment viral titers. A number of clinical parameters&#xD;
      indicative of end-organ damage during acute EVD will be monitored to determine if passive&#xD;
      immune therapy affects the onset and duration of renal failure and acute lung injury. In&#xD;
      addition, blood samples will be collected pre and post transfusion of convalescent EBOV&#xD;
      INTERCEPT plasma to determine if biomarkers of endothelial injury are impacted, and if they&#xD;
      can be used to guide plasma transfusion therapy to establish a dosing regimen and duration of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        EBOV Convalescent Donor Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recovered from Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) by clinical criteria and declared clinically&#xD;
             asymptomatic of active EVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Twenty-eight (28) days from hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Two negative test results for EBOV nucleic acid by a sensitive nucleic acid test&#xD;
             method with blood samples drawn at least 48 hours apart.&#xD;

             test results for these pathogens will be at the discretion of treating physicians,&#xD;
             with respect to the relative benefit of donor subject convalescent plasma treated with&#xD;
             INTERCEPT pathogen inactivation, compared to the risk to recipients of not receiving&#xD;
             EBOV convalescent plasma transfusion therapy.&#xD;

             plasma.&#xD;
