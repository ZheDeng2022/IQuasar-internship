      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroporation or electropermeabilisation is a novel technique with the potential to&#xD;
      overcome the main disadvantages of thermal ablation. It utilizes electric pulses, traveling&#xD;
      between two or more electrodes, to create 'nanopores' in the cell membrane. If the applied&#xD;
      current reaches a certain threshold these 'nanopores' become permanent resulting in cell&#xD;
      death. The use of electric current means that IRE is not susceptible to 'thermal sink'&#xD;
      leading to consistent ablation results. IRE ablation targets the cell membrane, sparing&#xD;
      tissue architecture and minimizing damage to blood vessels, nerves and the renal collecting&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first in human studies have proven the safety of IRE for the ablation of small renal&#xD;
      masses. However the efficacy of IRE through histopathological examination of an ablated renal&#xD;
      tumour has not yet been studied, compromising the correct and scientific evaluation of this&#xD;
      new technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of IRE ablation of renal masses , measured by histopathologic&#xD;
           examination of the targeted tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of IRE ablation of renal masses, by evaluating device and&#xD;
           procedural adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of MRI in the imaging of ablation success, extend of the&#xD;
           ablation zone, one and four weeks post IRE ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of CEUS in the imaging of ablation success, extend of the&#xD;
           ablation zone, one and four weeks post IRE ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 patients, age ≥ 18 years, presenting with a solid enhancing mass, who are candidates for&#xD;
      radical nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive IRE ablation of their renal mass 4 weeks prior to radical&#xD;
      nephrectomy. Follow-up at one and four weeks post IRE will be performed using MRI and CEUS&#xD;
      imaging. After radical nephrectomy histopathological examination will be performed to&#xD;
      evaluate IRE ablation success.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The past decades have shown an increase in the incidence of small renal masses (SRM). At the&#xD;
      moment laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is the 'golden standard' in treatment of SRMs.&#xD;
      Thermal ablation techniques are indicated in patients who are poor surgical candidates or who&#xD;
      have a predisposition to develop multiple tumours. Recent studies have shown thermal ablation&#xD;
      techniques to have similar long-term oncologic results. Downsides to thermal ablation are the&#xD;
      possible damage to vital structures in the vicinity of the ablation zone, e.g. collecting&#xD;
      system or intestine, and unpredictable results due to difficulty in monitoring the ablation&#xD;
      zone and 'thermal sink'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroporation or electropermeabilisation is a novel technique with the potential to&#xD;
      overcome the main disadvantages of thermal ablation. It utilizes electric pulses, traveling&#xD;
      between two or more electrodes, to create 'nanopores' in the cell membrane. If the applied&#xD;
      current reaches a certain threshold these 'nanopores' become permanent resulting in cell&#xD;
      death. The use of electric current means that IRE is not susceptible to 'thermal sink'&#xD;
      leading to consistent ablation results. IRE ablation targets the cell membrane, sparing&#xD;
      tissue architecture and minimizing damage to blood vessels, nerves and the renal collecting&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first in human studies have proven the safety of IRE for the ablation of small renal&#xD;
      masses. However the efficacy of IRE through histopathological examination of an ablated renal&#xD;
      tumour has not yet been studied, compromising the correct and scientific evaluation of a new&#xD;
      technology. This is the primary objective of this research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of IRE ablation of renal masses , measured by histopathologic&#xD;
           examination of the targeted tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of IRE ablation of renal masses, by evaluating device and&#xD;
           procedural adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of MRI in the imaging of ablation success, extend of the&#xD;
           ablation zone, one and four weeks post IRE ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of CEUS in the imaging of ablation success, extend of the&#xD;
           ablation zone, one and four weeks post IRE ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, human, in-vivo pilot study. Study population: 10 patients, age ≥ 18&#xD;
      years, presented with a solid enhancing RM , who are candidates for radical nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive IRE ablation of the RM, performed under general anaesthesia, 4 weeks&#xD;
      before radical nephrectomy. Follow-up at one and four weeks post IRE will be performed using&#xD;
      MRI and CEUS imaging. After radical nephrectomy histopathological examination will be&#xD;
      performed to evaluate IRE ablation success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The efficacy of IRE ablation of renal masses , measured by histopathologic examination&#xD;
           of the targeted tumour by an experienced genitourinary pathologist. Using&#xD;
           immunehistochemical staining to evaluate cell viability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The safety of IRE ablation of renal masses, by evaluating device and procedural adverse&#xD;
           events using CTCAE v4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The efficacy of MRI in the imaging of ablation success, extend of the ablation zone, one&#xD;
           and four weeks post IRE ablation. By comparing MRI imaging to the histopathological&#xD;
           examination results of the resected material.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The efficacy of CEUS in the imaging of ablation success, extend of the ablation zone,&#xD;
           one and four weeks post IRE ablation. By comparing CEUS imaging to the histopathological&#xD;
           examination results of the resected material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no benefits for patients that participate in this study. Study participants will be&#xD;
      exposed to additional risk when compared to standard treatment. They will have to undergo an&#xD;
      additional procedure under general anaesthesia with muscle relaxation. The exposure to&#xD;
      ionizing radiation during the procedure has been estimated at 32 mSv. Patients have to be&#xD;
      informed about the risks of procedural complications. Information on the efficacy of IRE,&#xD;
      proven histopathologically, is a vital step in order to progress to long term follow-up&#xD;
      studies without tumour excision. So far no study has investigated the efficacy of IRE for the&#xD;
      ablation of renal tumours in this manner.&#xD;
