      This is an open-label, Phase I/II study evaluating intravitreal ranibizumab (R) vs.&#xD;
      intravitreal Triesence (triamcinolone acetonide) (T) in subjects with acute pseudophakic&#xD;
      cystoid macular edema (CME). Twenty consented patients with acute CME after&#xD;
      phacoemulsification cataract surgery with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation&#xD;
      (PE/PCIOL) will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with R or T. R patients will receive three&#xD;
      monthly R injections, followed by PRN dosing. T patients will receive PRN injections every 3&#xD;
      months. Clinical CME is defined as clinically evident CME, with visual acuity (VA) typically&#xD;
      in the 20/40 to 20/200 range. Re-treatment criteria will include clinically evident worsening&#xD;
      of CME, combined with any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any increase in spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (OCT) central macular&#xD;
           thickness (CMT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any observable fluid on OCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any qualitatively increased perifoveal leakage/pooling on fluorescein angiography (FA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed monthly through 12 months.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
           Despite improved cataract surgery instrumentation and techniques, the incidence of&#xD;
           clinical CME remains 1 - 3% following uncomplicated PE/PCIOL. CME remains the most&#xD;
           common cause of suboptimal post-operative visual acuity (VA) after uncomplicated&#xD;
           PE/PCIOL. 1% clinical CME incidence represents 30,000 new cases annually in the USA.&#xD;
           Clinical CME is defined as clinically evident CME, with VA typically 20/40 - 20/200.&#xD;
           Diagnostic testing can confirm CME by FA leakage and increased CRT on OCT. If left&#xD;
           untreated, chronic photoreceptor degeneration and irreversible VA loss can occur, even&#xD;
           if the macular edema was to eventually resolve.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 TREATMENT OF PSEUDOPHAKIC CYSTOID MACULAR EDEMA Several treatment options for CME&#xD;
           have been investigated, including topical, oral, periocular and intravitreal&#xD;
           corticosteroids. Corticosteroids inhibit phospholipase A2, inhibiting production of&#xD;
           arachidonic acid, precursor of the lipo-oxyenase (LOX) and cyclo-oxygenase (COX)&#xD;
           pathways. Because corticosteroids inhibit both the LOX and COX pathways, corticosteroids&#xD;
           may be expected to be more effective than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
           in decreasing inflammation. However, corticosteroids have side effects, including the&#xD;
           potential for increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in susceptible patients, and require&#xD;
           additional treatment for secondary glaucoma. NSAIDs specifically inhibit COX-2, and&#xD;
           therefore avoid potential complications of corticosteroids. NSAIDs may be a good option&#xD;
           for CME treatment of patients who are known corticosteroid responders. However, corneal&#xD;
           stromal melting is a rare but serious potential side-effect of topical NSAIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 RANIBIZUMAB (R) AND PSEUDOPHAKIC CYSTOID MACULAR EDEMA Numerous studies, such as&#xD;
           ANCHOR, MARINA, and PIER, have shown that R effectively reduces perifoveal capillary&#xD;
           leakage and CMT, when used as treatment for exudative age-related macular degeneration&#xD;
           (AMD). BRAVO and CRUISE data have shown similar reduction in perifoveal capillary&#xD;
           leakage and CMT when used as treatment for retinal vein occlusions (RVO).&#xD;
&#xD;
           To date, there is no published study reporting efficacy of R monotherapy for acute&#xD;
           pseudophakic CME. This study will assess R monotherapy, and eliminate any possible&#xD;
           confounding effect of prior or concurrent treatment with either corticosteroids, NSAIDs,&#xD;
           or both. Intravitreal R injections may avoid the potential for IOP elevation common with&#xD;
           topical, periocular and intravitreal corticosteroids. R would also avoid corneal stromal&#xD;
           melting, a rare but serious potential side-effect of topical NSAIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.5 CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH RANIBIZUMAB R has been studied in more than 5000 subjects&#xD;
           with neovascular AMD in a number of Phase I, I/II, II, III, and IIIb clinical trials.&#xD;
           Serious adverse events related to the injection procedure have occurred in &lt;0.1% of&#xD;
           intravitreal injections, including endophthalmitis, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment&#xD;
           (RD), and iatrogenic traumatic cataract. Other serious ocular adverse events observed&#xD;
           among R-treated subjects and occurring in &lt;2% of subjects include intraocular&#xD;
           inflammation and increased IOP. The most common adverse reactions (reported &gt; 6% higher&#xD;
           in R-treated subjects than control subjects) were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain,&#xD;
           vitreous floaters, increased IOP, and intraocular inflammation. Although there was a low&#xD;
           rate (&lt;4%) of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) observed in the R clinical trials,&#xD;
           there is a potential risk of ATEs following intravitreal use of vascular endothelial&#xD;
           growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVES To assess the safety and efficacy of intravitreal ranibizumab (R) and&#xD;
           triamcinolone acetonide (T) for treatment of acute pseudophakic CME.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective of the study is to assess the SAFETY of intravitreal R and T for&#xD;
           acute pseudophakic CME treatment, by evaluating:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incidence and severity of ocular adverse events, as identified by eye examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incidence and severity of other adverse events, as identified by physical&#xD;
                examination, subject reporting, and changes in vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary objectives of the study are to determine EFFICACY of intravitreal R and T&#xD;
           for acute pseudophakic CME treatment, by evaluating:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mean change in spectral domain OCT CMT from baseline (microns)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mean change in ETDRS letters from baseline (letters)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proportion of patients with 3 line or better ETDRS letter improvement (%)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to 3 line ETDRS letter improvement (days)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mean number of R or T injections (#)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mean IOP (mm Hg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN 3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY This is an open-label, Phase I/II study&#xD;
           evaluating intravitreal R vs. intravitreal T in subjects with acute pseudophakic CME.&#xD;
           Twenty patients with acute CME after uneventful PE/PCIOL will be randomized 1:1 to&#xD;
           treatment with R or T. R patients will receive three monthly R injections, followed by&#xD;
           PRN dosing. T patients will receive PRN injections every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Re-treatment criteria will include clinically evident worsening of CME, combined with&#xD;
           any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any increase in spectral domain OCT CMT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any observable fluid on OCT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any qualitatively increased perifoveal leakage/pooling on FA. Patients will be&#xD;
                followed monthly for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN To date, there is no published study reporting efficacy&#xD;
           of R monotherapy for acute pseudophakic CME. The proposed study would eliminate possible&#xD;
           confounding effect of prior or concurrent treatment with steroids, NSAIDs, or both.&#xD;
           Intravitreal R injections may avoid IOP elevation common with topical, periocular and&#xD;
           intravitreal T injections.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
           3.4 SAFETY PLAN All subjects will be queried as to systemic adverse events (AE).&#xD;
           Potential ocular AE's predicted from common knowledge and historical data about R and T&#xD;
           include: ocular injection, pain, discharge, redness, visual changes, floaters, IOP&#xD;
           elevation, allergic reaction, infection, inflammation, RD, choroidal detachment,&#xD;
           vitreous hemorrhage, and endophthalmitis. Potential systemic AE's include and are not&#xD;
           limited to: stroke, heart attack, transient ischemic attack, reversible ischemic&#xD;
           neurological defect, blood pressure elevation, weakness, headache, nausea, and malaise.&#xD;
           AE incidence will be obtained by close examination and query of all subjects. All&#xD;
           patients will be unmasked, so that any AEs will be readily apparent as to the causative&#xD;
           drug. Testing and treatment recommendations will be made appropriate to the specific AE.&#xD;

&#xD;
      4.3 STUDY TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.1 Formulation R is formulated as a sterile solution aseptically filled in a sterile,&#xD;
      single use 2 mL stoppered glass vial. Each single use vial is designed to deliver 0.05 mL of&#xD;
      10 mg/mL ranibizumab aqueous solution with 10 mM histidine HCI, 10% trehalose dihydrate, and&#xD;
      0.01% polysorbate 20, pH 5.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T injectable suspension 40 mg/mL is a single use synthetic corticosteroid with&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory action. Each mL of the sterile, aqueous suspension provides 40 mg of&#xD;
      triamcinolone acetonide, with sodium chloride for isotonicity, 0.5% (w/v)&#xD;
      carboxymethylcellulose sodium and 0.015% polysorbate 80. It also contains potassium chloride,&#xD;
      calcium chloride (dihydrate), magnesium chloride (hexahydrate), sodium acetate (trihydrate),&#xD;
      sodium citrate (dihydrate) and water for injection. Sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid&#xD;
      may be present to adjust pH to a target value 6 - 7.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.2 Dosage and Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Dosage Patients on R will receive 3 initial injections monthly followed by monthly PRN.&#xD;
      Patients on T will receive an initial injection followed by PRN injections every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-treatment criteria include clinically evident worsening of CME, combined with any of the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any increase in spectral domain OCT CMT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any observable fluid on OCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any qualitatively increased perifoveal leakage/pooling on FA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intravitreal injection procedure will be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions.&#xD;
      0.5 mL of R will be given by intravitreal injection 3.0 to 3.5 mm posterior to the surgical&#xD;
      limbus inferiorly. Similar technique will be used for T intravitreal injections, with two&#xD;
      exceptions: one, a sterile 27-gauge ½ inch needle will be used for the intravitreal&#xD;
      injection; and two, 4 mg T/0.1 mL volume will be injected intravitreally. Following the&#xD;
      intravitreal injection, patients will be monitored for elevation in IOP and for&#xD;
      endophthalmitis. Patients will be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of&#xD;
      endophthalmitis without delay.&#xD;
