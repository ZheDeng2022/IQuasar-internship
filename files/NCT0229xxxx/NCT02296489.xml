  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common chronic disorder of the airways characterized by periods of reversible&#xD;
      airflow obstruction known as asthma episodes or attacks. Asthma attacks are caused by&#xD;
      chronically hyperactive (contraction of the muscles surrounding the airways) and inflamed&#xD;
      airways, leading to airflow obstruction, and may be mild, moderate, or severe enough to&#xD;
      become life-threatening events. Severity of asthma exacerbation is assessed through medical&#xD;
      history and lung function measurements with Spirometer and requires full cooperation of the&#xD;
      patient. Thus, in uncooperative populations or during emergency medical situations the&#xD;
      spirometer cannot be used. As an alternative, capnography data has been proposed as an&#xD;
      indicator of bronchospasm in asthma. Previous studies found correlations between the&#xD;
      capnography parameters and methacholine challenge in asthma patients. However, the&#xD;
      relationship between capnography parameters and severity of asthma or severity of asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation have not been well characterized. The study hypothesis is that within the&#xD;
      clinical population that is invited to do the methacholine challenge, a different waveform&#xD;
      pattern in asthma patients will be detected and possibly a correlation between the severity&#xD;
      of obstruction and pattern of waveform during the methacholine challenge. In this proposed&#xD;
      feasibility observational study, sixty subjects, both men and women, who will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the methacholine challenge in the Institute of Pulmonary Medicine at Rabin&#xD;
      Medical Center, will be recruited to the study. Respiratory information will be recorded&#xD;
      using the CapnostreamTM20p while the subjects will wear the non-invasive Smart CapnoLineÂ®&#xD;
      Plus sampling line. Additionally, FeNO will be measured using a DENOX 88 device during the&#xD;
      methacholine challenge.&#xD;
