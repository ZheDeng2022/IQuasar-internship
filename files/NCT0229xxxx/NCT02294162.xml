  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is an unpleasant sensory experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage.&#xD;
      Acute pain management is an important aspect of perioperative anesthetic care. Moreover, it&#xD;
      is the most important factor related to patient discomfort after surgery. Adequate pain&#xD;
      management, ideally resulting in the complete absence of postoperative pain, not only&#xD;
      provides comfort to patients, but may also contribute to improved healing and a reduction in&#xD;
      the incidence of postoperative complications. Inadequate postoperative analgesia has been&#xD;
      shown to contribute to adverse outcomes, including, but not limited to, immunosuppression,&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, poor rehabilitation, and progression to chronic pain.&#xD;

      Patients who are scheduled for submucosal resection of nasal septum with or without&#xD;
      turbinectomy will be recruited for the study The patients will be will be assigned to either&#xD;
      the treatment group who will be administered ketamine prior to the operation or the control&#xD;
      group who will receive a normal saline injection, both in identicle syringes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be operated on by the same surgoens and by the same method of dissection&#xD;
      and hemostasis (2-5 2 ml lidocadrain carpules, monopolar suction-cautery set on 25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients folow-up will be reported in their medical charts. The post operative analgetic&#xD;
      effect will be assessed by the amount of analgesia required in the post-operative period and&#xD;
      by regular pain measurements using VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) - at 0.5 hours post operation&#xD;
      in the recovery room, 8 hours post operation and the morning of first post operative day in&#xD;
      the otolaryngology - head and neck department&#xD;
