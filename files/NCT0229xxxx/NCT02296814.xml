      Study to verify the efficacy and tolerability of Sinusitis Hevert SL tablets compared to&#xD;
      placebo in adult patients with acute, uncomplicated rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the nasal&#xD;
      and paranasal sinuses).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common diseases worldwide with a prevalence of 6-15%&#xD;
      and a large impact on quality of life and socioeconomics. The majority of infections are of&#xD;
      viral origin, while acute bacterial infection occurs in only 0.5-2% of cases. Currently&#xD;
      available treatment includes a variety of remedies, like analgesic, inhalation with water&#xD;
      steam of diluted drugs, nasal douche or spray, decongestant and mucolytic remedies as well as&#xD;
      antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sinusitis Hevert SL is registered since 2003 for the treatment of inflammation of the nose&#xD;
      and throat region and the sinuses (sinusitis) and contains eleven homeopathic single&#xD;
      substances which are classically used in homeopathy for this condition, but has not been&#xD;
      evaluated in a randomized controlled clinical trial. In this multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group phase IV study the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Sinusitis Hevert SL tablets compared to placebo in adult patients with acute, uncomplicated&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis shall be demonstrated.&#xD;
