      Study rationale: Children admitted to intensive care are often chronically ill and the&#xD;
      intensive care setting may upset the balance between nutritional intakes and needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As malnutrition is a key factor in the morbidity/mortality on pediatric intensive care units&#xD;
      (PICUs), screening for malnutrition and the individualized adaptation of nutritional support&#xD;
      are important elements of patient care. Yet no recent study has evaluated the nutritional&#xD;
      status of children admitted to PICUs in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Determine the prevalence of malnutrition in the population of children&#xD;
      admitted to intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the children's nutritional status on admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the profile of malnourished patients compared with those not malnourished&#xD;
           (sex, age, history, chronic disease, usual dietary habits, reason for admission,&#xD;
           scheduled/unscheduled admission, surgery/medication, seriousness, seasonality).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the practices regarding nutritional care in each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: All children (1 month to 18 years) admitted to all PICUs in France during three&#xD;
      one-week periods (February, June, October) in the course of a year.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Describe the practices regarding nutritional care in each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of study: Observational, descriptive, transversal, and multicentric.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Population: All children (1 month to 18 years) admitted to all PICUs in France during&#xD;
           three one-week periods (February, June, October) in the course of a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary assessment parameter: Malnutrition, as defined by the body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
           value &lt;-2 SD, according to the WHO Child Growth Standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factors studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nutritional status on admission based on the measurement of simple anthropometric&#xD;
                parameters: weight (W), height (H), head circumference (HC) and mid-upper arm&#xD;
                circumference (MUAC), which are then used to calculate malnutrition indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Profile of malnourished patients in relation to hospitalization parameters (age,&#xD;
                sex, reason for admission, history, dietary habits).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nutritional practices in PICUs assessed with two questionnaires (medical and&#xD;
                nursing) sent to all participating hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size: Number of subjects needed to estimate the prevalence of malnutrition, based&#xD;
           on the data in the literature with a confidence interval of 95%±3.2%: 600.&#xD;
