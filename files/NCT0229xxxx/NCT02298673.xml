    <textblock>
      Mucolipidoses (ML) are a group of inherited metabolic diseases in which both&#xD;
      glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and another group of substances called sphingolipids build up in&#xD;
      the body. GAGs are long, repeating chains of complex sugar molecules, and sphingolipids are&#xD;
      fats. ML disorders may also be referred to as &quot;targeting defects&quot; because affected&#xD;
      individuals are lacking the enzyme (a protein that produces chemical reactions in the body)&#xD;
      that &quot;targets&quot; other enzymes to the lysosome (a sac-like structure found in a cell).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of ML can be congenital (present at birth) or begin in early childhood or&#xD;
      adolescence. Early symptoms can include vision problems and developmental delays. Over time,&#xD;
      many children with ML develop poor mental capacities, have difficulty reaching normal&#xD;
      developmental milestones, and, in many cases, eventually die of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in specific genes results in the deficiency or absence of the targeting enzyme. The&#xD;
      ML disorders are categorized into four groups based on the clinical features and enzyme&#xD;
      deficiencies. ML-II and ML-III are the more common forms of ML. An individual is usually&#xD;
      suspected of having an ML disorder based on clinical features. The diagnosis is further&#xD;
      confirmed by laboratory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mucolipidoses are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, that is, they occur only&#xD;
      when a child inherits two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent. When both&#xD;
      parents carry a defective gene, each of their children faces a one in four chance of&#xD;
      developing one of the MLs. At the same time, each child also faces a one in two chance of&#xD;
      inheriting only one copy of the defective gene. People who have only one defective gene are&#xD;
      known as carriers. These individuals do not develop the disease but they can pass the&#xD;
      defective gene on to their own children. Because the defective genes involved in certain&#xD;
      forms of ML are known, tests can identify people who are carriers in some instances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four types of ML are Sialidosis (sometimes referred to as ML I), and types II, III, and&#xD;
      IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Mucolipidosis type I (Sialidosis) The Sialidoses are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage&#xD;
      disorders resulting from mutations in the NEU1 gene (6p21.3) which lead to an intracellular&#xD;
      accumulation of glycoproteins containing sialic acid residues. Both types I and II are caused&#xD;
      by mutations in the same gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ML1 (NEU1 deficiency) is a neurodegenerative disorder with progressive deterioration of&#xD;
      muscle and central nervous system functions. Myoclonus, mental deterioration,&#xD;
      hepatosplenomegaly, muscle weakness and atrophy are common. The defect in neuraminidase&#xD;
      activity leads to abnormal amounts of sialyl-oligosaccharides in the urine. Spinal&#xD;
      deformities such as kyphosis are common. Deep tendon reflexes are exaggerated. Ataxia and&#xD;
      hearing loss may be present. Coarse facies, a barrel chest, and short stature are&#xD;
      characteristic. Hepatic cells contain numerous vacuoles and numerous inclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cherry red spot is may be seen in late childhood or early adolescence. It occurs in nearly&#xD;
      100% of patients with type I while only 75% of type II patients have this feature possibly&#xD;
      because their early death from the more severe systemic disease prevents full ascertainment.&#xD;
      Visual acuity is reduced, sometimes severely. Some but not all individuals have corneal and&#xD;
      lens opacities. A subtle corneal haze has also been seen. Nystagmus has been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sialidosis types I and II are both caused by mutations in the neuraminidase gene. Type I is&#xD;
      associated with milder disease than type II which has an earlier age of onset and may present&#xD;
      in infancy or even begin in utero. Early death within two years of age is common in the&#xD;
      congenital or infantile forms. There is, however, significant variability in age of onset and&#xD;
      the course of disease among types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Mucolipidosis type II (I-Cell Disease) I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II) is a rare&#xD;
      inherited metabolic disorder characterized by coarse facial features, skeletal abnormalities&#xD;
      and mental retardation. The symptoms of I-cell disease are similar to but more severe than&#xD;
      those of Hurler syndrome. The symptoms associated with this disorder typically become obvious&#xD;
      during infancy and may include multiple abnormalities of the skull and face and growth&#xD;
      delays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This disorder belongs to a group of diseases known as lysosomal storage disorders. Lysosomes&#xD;
      are particles bound in membranes within cells that break down certain fats and carbohydrates.&#xD;
      Multiple enzyme deficiencies associated with I-cell disease lead to the accumulation of&#xD;
      certain fatty substances (mucolipids) and certain complex carbohydrates (mucopolysaccharides)&#xD;
      within the cells of many tissues of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-cell disease is caused by a mutation in the GNPTAB gene that leads to a deficiency in the&#xD;
      enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucoseamine-1-phosphotransferase. I-cell disease is inherited as an&#xD;
      autosomal recessive genetic trait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Mucolipidosis type III (Pseudo-Hurler Polydystrophy) Mucolipidosis III alpha/beta is a&#xD;
      slowly progressive disorder that affects many parts of the body. Signs and symptoms of this&#xD;
      condition typically appear around age 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with mucolipidosis III alpha/beta grow slowly and have short stature. They also&#xD;
      have stiff joints and dysostosis multiplex, which refers to multiple skeletal abnormalities&#xD;
      seen on x-ray. Many affected individuals develop low bone mineral density (osteoporosis),&#xD;
      which weakens the bones and makes them prone to fracture. Osteoporosis and progressive joint&#xD;
      problems also cause pain in people with mucolipidosis III alpha/beta, which becomes more&#xD;
      severe over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with mucolipidosis III alpha/beta often have heart valve abnormalities and mild&#xD;
      clouding of the clear covering of the eye (cornea). Their facial features become slightly&#xD;
      thickened or &quot;coarse&quot; over time. Affected individuals may also develop frequent ear and&#xD;
      respiratory infections. About half of people with this condition have mild intellectual&#xD;
      disability or learning problems. Individuals with mucolipidosis III alpha/beta generally&#xD;
      survive into adulthood, but they may have a shortened lifespan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucolipidosis III alpha/beta is a rare disorder, although its exact prevalence is unknown. It&#xD;
      is estimated to occur in about 1 in 100,000 to 400,000 individuals worldwide Mutations in the&#xD;
      GNPTAB gene cause mucolipidosis III alpha/beta. This gene provides instructions for making a&#xD;
      part (subunit) of an enzyme called GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. This enzyme helps prepare&#xD;
      certain newly made enzymes for transport to lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments within the&#xD;
      cell that use digestive enzymes to break down large molecules into smaller ones that can be&#xD;
      reused by cells. GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase is involved in the process of attaching a&#xD;
      molecule called mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) to specific digestive enzymes. Just as luggage is&#xD;
      tagged at the airport to direct it to the correct destination, enzymes are often &quot;tagged&quot;&#xD;
      after they are made so they get to where they are needed in the cell. M6P acts as a tag that&#xD;
      indicates a digestive enzyme should be transported to the lysosome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutations in the GNPTAB gene that cause mucolipidosis III alpha/beta result in reduced&#xD;
      activity of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. These mutations disrupt the tagging of digestive&#xD;
      enzymes with M6P, which prevents many enzymes from reaching the lysosomes. Digestive enzymes&#xD;
      that do not receive the M6P tag end up outside the cell, where they have increased activity.&#xD;
      The shortage of digestive enzymes within lysosomes causes large molecules to accumulate.&#xD;
      Conditions that cause molecules to build up inside lysosomes, including mucolipidosis III&#xD;
      alpha/beta, are called lysosomal storage disorders. The signs and symptoms of mucolipidosis&#xD;
      III alpha/beta are most likely due to the shortage of digestive enzymes inside lysosomes and&#xD;
      the effects these enzymes have outside the cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutations in the GNPTAB gene can also cause a similar but more severe disorder called&#xD;
      mucolipidosis II alpha/beta. These mutations completely eliminate the function of&#xD;
      GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. Mucolipidosis III alpha/beta and mucolipidosis II alpha/beta&#xD;
      represent two ends of a spectrum of disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Mucolipidosis type IV Mucolipidosis type IV (caused by mutations in the MCOLN1 gene) is an&#xD;
      inherited disorder characterized by delayed development and progressive vision loss. The&#xD;
      severe form of the disorder is called typical mucolipidosis type IV, and the mild form is&#xD;
      called atypical mucolipidosis type IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 95 percent of individuals with this condition have the severe form. People with&#xD;
      typical mucolipidosis type IV have delayed development of mental and motor skills&#xD;
      (psychomotor delay). Motor skills including: sitting, standing, walking, grasping objects,&#xD;
      and writing. Psychomotor delay is moderate to severe and usually becomes apparent during the&#xD;
      first year of life. Affected individuals have intellectual disability, limited or absent&#xD;
      speech, difficulty chewing and swallowing, weak muscle tone (hypotonia) that gradually turns&#xD;
      into abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity), and problems controlling hand movements. Most&#xD;
      people with typical mucolipidosis type IV are unable to walk independently. In about 15&#xD;
      percent of affected individuals, the psychomotor problems worsen over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vision may be normal at birth in people with typical mucolipidosis type IV, but it becomes&#xD;
      increasingly impaired during the first decade of life. Individuals with this condition&#xD;
      develop clouding of the clear covering of the eye (cornea) and progressive breakdown of the&#xD;
      light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye (retina). By their early teens, affected&#xD;
      individuals have severe vision loss or blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with typical mucolipidosis type IV also have impaired production of stomach acid&#xD;
      (achlorhydria). Achlorhydria does not cause any symptoms in these individuals, but it does&#xD;
      result in unusually high levels of gastrin in the blood. Gastrin is a hormone that regulates&#xD;
      the production of stomach acid. Individuals with mucolipidosis type IV may not have enough&#xD;
      iron in their blood, which can lead to a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). People with&#xD;
      the severe form of this disorder usually survive to adulthood; however, they may have a&#xD;
      shortened lifespan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 5 percent of affected individuals have atypical mucolipidosis type IV. These&#xD;
      individuals usually have mild psychomotor delay and may develop the ability to walk. People&#xD;
      with atypical mucolipidosis type IV tend to have milder eye abnormalities than those with the&#xD;
      severe form of the disorder. Achlorhydria also may be present in mildly affected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucolipidosis type IV is estimated to occur in 1 in 40,000 people. About 70 percent of&#xD;
      affected individuals have Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutations in the MCOLN1 gene cause mucolipidosis type IV. This gene provides instructions for&#xD;
      making a protein called mucolipin-1. This protein is located in the membranes of lysosomes&#xD;
      and endosomes, compartments within the cell that digest and recycle materials. While its&#xD;
      function is not completely understood, mucolipin-1 plays a role in the transport&#xD;
      (trafficking) of fats (lipids) and proteins between lysosomes and endosomes. Mucolipin-1&#xD;
      appears to be important for the development and maintenance of the brain and retina. In&#xD;
      addition, this protein is likely critical for normal functioning of the cells in the stomach&#xD;
      that produce digestive acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most mutations in the MCOLN1 gene result in the production of a non-functional protein or&#xD;
      prevent any protein from being produced. A lack of functional mucolipin-1 impairs transport&#xD;
      of lipids and proteins, causing these substances to build up inside lysosomes. Conditions&#xD;
      that cause molecules to accumulate inside the lysosomes, including mucolipidosis type IV, are&#xD;
      called lysosomal storage disorders. Two mutations in the MCOLN1 gene account for almost all&#xD;
      cases of mucolipidosis type IV in people with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. It remains unclear&#xD;
      how mutations in this gene lead to the signs and symptoms of mucolipidosis type IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic&#xD;
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future&#xD;
      the Disorder earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from&#xD;
      the plasma of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose&#xD;
      and thereby with an earlier treatment. Examining blood samples will allow determining whether&#xD;
      measurement is feasible in blood samples and will further promote early detection of&#xD;
      mucolipidosis disorder type I, II, III or IV.&#xD;
