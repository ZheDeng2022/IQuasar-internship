      Brief Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Context. Sleep disorders complaints are common in elderly and hypnosedative drugs are widely&#xD;
      prescribed in community-dwelling elderly. Furthermore, acute hospitalisation may induce sleep&#xD;
      disorders and hypnosedative initiation occurs in 14 to 29% of elderly during a hospital stay.&#xD;
      These hospital-induced sleep disorders should spontaneously disappear after discharge and,&#xD;
      because of their potential impact on falls, hip fractures, psychiatric side effects and&#xD;
      induced dependence, hypnosedative drugs should therefore be discontinued at discharge in&#xD;
      these naïve-treated patients. Adhesion to this recommendation is poor. Recent and on-going&#xD;
      research on this topic mostly concerns adverse effects although these are already&#xD;
      substantially documented and evidence-based, while there is a poor interest on developing&#xD;
      research on potential strategies susceptible to practically improve the current adhesion to&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and objectives. This project proposes multi-component intervention and is directed&#xD;
      towards hospital prescribers, patients, and their general practitioner. It aims at&#xD;
      discontinuing, at hospital discharge, the hypnosedative treatment that was initiated during&#xD;
      hospitalization in naïve-treated elderly (age≥65) patients. The value of the intervention, as&#xD;
      compared to usual care management, will be estimated in a multicentre (6 hospitals gathering&#xD;
      8 centres: 5 internal medicine departments, 3 cardiology departments) randomised, cross-over,&#xD;
      two-period trial. Two hospitals will gather 2 centres (2x2 centres) and 4 hospitals will&#xD;
      gather only 1 centre (4x1 centres). An equilibrated randomization will be applied to the 8&#xD;
      centres, making sure that, in hospitals gathering 2 centres, these 2 centres will apply the&#xD;
      same strategy in a given period and that the 2 hospitals will apply alternative strategies.&#xD;
      This randomisation is set up to avoid the risk of a potential contamination between the 2&#xD;
      strategies from one centre to the other within the same hospital. As a result, 3 hospitals&#xD;
      (including 4 medical departments) will apply the intervention during the first 11-month&#xD;
      period, while the 3 others (including 4 medical departments) will apply usual care during&#xD;
      this period, as a result of an equilibrated hospitals randomization. During the second&#xD;
      11-month period, each hospital will apply the alternative management. The two periods will be&#xD;
      separated by a 1-month wash-out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all 240 patients (15 patients / centre) will be enrolled (120 in the intervention group&#xD;
      and 120 in the usual care group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up duration will be 12 months after discharge. Patient status in regards with&#xD;
      quality of sleep (study primary objective), hypnosedative consumption and frequency of falls&#xD;
      (secondary objectives) will be collected by telephone interviews 1, 3, 6 12 months after&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results. The results of the study should contribute to guide research and public&#xD;
      decisions to practically decrease hypnosedative prescription and consumption, and associated&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;

      Context&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypnosedative prescriptions in hospital can be either the continuation of the drug already&#xD;
      prescribed before admission or result from an initiation during hospitalization. In the&#xD;
      hospitalised population, 36.7% to 62.7% of the patients indeed complain of significant&#xD;
      insomnia. Furthermore, it has been clearly established that a number of factors associated&#xD;
      with hospitalization such as the effects of illness and new medications, environmental&#xD;
      factors including noise and disruption of usual sleeping schedules induce insomnia and a&#xD;
      decrease in the quality of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, up to 33% to 60% of hospitalised patients are treated with hypnosedatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital initiation of hypnosedatives was reported in 14% to 29% of the patients who were not&#xD;
      taking a hypnosedative before hospitalization. Unfortunately, only a very few studies have&#xD;
      been made on the discontinuation of such drugs at hospital discharge, still they showed that&#xD;
      the drug was maintained in 20 to 36% of the initiated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the elderly, hypnosedatives provide only a small improvement in the quality of sleep while&#xD;
      falls and cognitive disorders are significantly increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to dependence to benzodiazepines, a withdrawal syndrome may occur at discontinuation&#xD;
      after a long term treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the benefit/risk balance of hypnosedative is not in favour of their use in&#xD;
      elderly. Moreover, sleep disturbances appearing during an acute hospital stay are most of the&#xD;
      time transient and the continuation should be systematically debated. However, to our best&#xD;
      knowledge, no data has yet reported the evaluation of an intervention aiming at discontinuing&#xD;
      the prescription at discharge from hospital in formerly hypnosedative-naïve patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HYPAGE study is a multicentre, cluster-randomized, two-period cross-over study that will&#xD;
      test an intervention (compared to usual care) for discontinuing hypnosedative prescription at&#xD;
      the time of hospital discharge in patients aged 65 years and over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six hospitals gathering 8 centres (5 internal medicine departments, 3 cardiology departments)&#xD;
      located in the Paris area will participate in the study. Two hospitals will gather 2 centres&#xD;
      (2x2 centres) and 4 hospitals will gather only 1 centre (4x1 centres). An equilibrated&#xD;
      randomization will be applied to the 8 centres, making sure that, in hospitals gathering 2&#xD;
      centres, these 2 centres will apply the same strategy in a given period and that the 2&#xD;
      hospitals will apply alternative strategies. This randomisation is set up to avoid the risk&#xD;
      of a potential contamination between the 2 strategies from one centre to the other within the&#xD;
      same hospital. As a result, 3 hospitals (including 4 medical departments) will apply the&#xD;
      intervention during the first 11-month period, while the 3 others (including 4 medical&#xD;
      departments) will apply usual care during this period, as a result of an equilibrated&#xD;
      hospitals randomization. During the second 11-month period, each hospital will apply the&#xD;
      alternative management. The two periods will be separated by a 1-month wash-out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention under study includes two components involving a local hospital pharmacist,&#xD;
      the first component towards physicians, and the second towards patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention towards physicians is composed of the following items:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A written and oral information will be delivered to the hospital physicians. Such&#xD;
           information includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Place of hypnosedatives among drugs at risk in elderly&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adverse drug events induced by hypnosedatives: prevalence of falls in elderly,&#xD;
                psychiatric adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Procedures of hypnosedative withdrawal (French recommendations, HAS 2007)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The oral presentation will be presented during a staff meeting to the physicians in&#xD;
                every centre entering the study at the beginning of the intervention period. The&#xD;
                oral presentation will be delivered by local pharmacist in all centres entering the&#xD;
                trial, according to the standardized slide show (i.e. slides + accompanying talk)&#xD;
                prepared by the scientific committee of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In patient in whom a hypnosedative has been initiated, medication reconciliation at&#xD;
           discharge will involve the local hospital pharmacist. Medication reconciliation refers&#xD;
           to the process of reviewing the patient's complete medication regimen at the time of&#xD;
           admission, transfer, and discharge and comparing it with the regimen being considered&#xD;
           for the new setting of care. The pharmacist will compare the medication list during the&#xD;
           hospital stay with the discharge prescription. If the hypnosedative is maintained at&#xD;
           discharge, after discussion with the physician on the opportunity of the hypnosedative&#xD;
           continuation, two alternative decisions may be chosen:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the physician decides to maintain the hypnosedative drug, the reason will be&#xD;
                registered&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the physician decides to stop the hypnosedative, a standardized text will be&#xD;
                included in the usual letter transmitted to the patient's general practitioner&#xD;
                after hospital discharge. It will indicate that the hypnosedative initiated in&#xD;
                patient during hospitalization was stopped at discharge (or progressively decreased&#xD;
                with the aim of discontinuation), and will briefly mention the adverse effects&#xD;
                related to continuation of hypnosedative use, advocating that any reintroduction&#xD;
                should be based on sound arguments. Therefore, the intervention includes a&#xD;
                component oriented towards the continuity of care after discharge, this component&#xD;
                being directed towards general practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention towards patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention towards patients consists in the delivery of a written information. The written&#xD;
      information and the accompanying talk of the pharmacist during this delivery both heighten&#xD;
      awareness about the hypnosedative-related risks of adverse drug events: relation between&#xD;
      hypnosedatives and falls, uselessness of hypnosedatives at home after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included the day of discharge and will be followed-up up to 12 months. A&#xD;
      study pharmacist will be enrolled and will be in charge for collecting follow-up data of all&#xD;
      patients, whatever their admission centre. The study pharmacist will call (phone calls) the&#xD;
      patient or the surrogate, the general practitioner and the community pharmacist 1, 3, 6, and&#xD;
      12 months after hospital discharge. He will assess the current treatment and will collect&#xD;
      data concerning:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The quality of sleep (Insomnia Severity Index score)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The current hypnosedative treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency of falls will be assessed by a fall diary. This fall diary will be provided to the&#xD;
      patient at discharge and will be filled by the patient. The diary will be sent to the study&#xD;
      pharmacist on a monthly basis (envelopes and stamps will be provided at hospital discharge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess if the intervention does not produce a&#xD;
      deterioration of the quality of sleep quality (non-inferiority design) compared to usual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary criterion will be the quality of sleep in the patients 1, 3, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
      after hospital discharge. The Insomnia Severity Index score should not differ by more than&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing the frequency of falls in the intervention and usual care groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measuring the frequency of hypnosedative reintroduction 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
           discharge when hypnosedative prescription is stopped at hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing the Insomnia Severity Index score in treated and untreated patients with an&#xD;
           hypnosedative drug at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing the frequency of falls in treated versus untreated patients with an&#xD;
           hypnosedative drug at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no formula for non inferiority design in cluster cross-over trials, therefore we&#xD;
      chose to calculate the sample size for a traditional parallel group design and have applied&#xD;
      the design effect linked with the clustering in centres and over periods. The calculation is&#xD;
      based on the following hypotheses: a mean ISI score in patients treated with hypnosedative&#xD;
      medications of 8 and a standard deviation of 5, a non inferiority limit of 3, a power of 90%&#xD;
      and a one-sided type I error of 0.025. The sample size for a non inferiority trial without&#xD;
      accounting for intra-cluster and interperiod correlations, is 63 per arms, i.e. 126 patients&#xD;
      in total. With a hypothesized intracluster correlation of 0.03 and an interperiod correlation&#xD;
      of 0.01 (NB: in cross-over clustered trials, it is widely accepted that the intracluster&#xD;
      correlation should be at least twice the interperiod correlation, and these values should be&#xD;
      low), the design effect is 1.29 [36]. The resulting calculated sample size is 162, rounded to&#xD;
      180 in order to take into account the patients lost to follow up. Based on the participation&#xD;
      of 6 centres (original number of centres), this results in 15 patients per period and per&#xD;
      centre. We kept this number of 15 patients per period per centre after the addition of 2&#xD;
      centres (8 including centres) in order to achieve at least the same power. This leads to 240&#xD;
      patients in all. With regards to the average length of stay and the number of beds, we&#xD;
      estimate that such a number of patients can be enrolled during one semester in each center&#xD;
      (worst case calculation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results on quantitative variables will be provided as means and standard deviations or median&#xD;
      and interquartile, results on qualitative variables will be provided as numbers and&#xD;
      percentages. A type I error is set at 0.05. To account for clustering and the cross-over&#xD;
      matching, the comparison between groups will be made using Mantel-Haenszel and Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed rank tests. Confidence intervals will be calculated using resampling bootstrap&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis set. The primary analysis will be conducted according to the intent-to-treat&#xD;
      principle (ITT), at the individual level, considering every patient included irrespective of&#xD;
      the patient's follow-up and will take into account the clustering nature of data. Due to the&#xD;
      non-inferiority design, secondary sensitivity analyses in the per-protocol population will&#xD;
      also be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing values in the ITT analysis: we will check whether the proportion of missing values&#xD;
      does not differ from one arm to the other. For patients with a missing endpoint we will&#xD;
      assume there was no modification of the quality of sleep after discharge (i.e. a variation of&#xD;
      the ISI score of 0). More conservative sensitivity analyses will be conducted, with an&#xD;
      imputed increase of the ISI score above 3 (non inferiority limit) in the intervention arm vs&#xD;
      imputed increase of the ISI score of 0 in the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods for Main endpoint analysis. The analysis will be performed at the individual level. A&#xD;
      comparison will be made of the mean ISI score for the two arms. We will use a linear mixed&#xD;
      effect model to perform the comparison, in which the fixed effects are: the period, the arm,&#xD;
      the cluster, and the random effects are: the order of strategies and individual residual&#xD;
      error. The conclusion of non inferiority will be based by the confrontation of the lower&#xD;
      limit of the confidence interval and the pre-specified non inferiority limit (3 points).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods for Secondary endpoint analyses. The analysis of secondary endpoints will be&#xD;
      performed using the same methodological framework taking into account the clustering and the&#xD;
      period effect. For binomial variables, alternating logistic regression models will be used.&#xD;
