      This study evaluates the combination of BYL719, cisplatin and cetuximab as induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy prior to minimally-invasive transoral surgery (TORS or TLM) and selective lymph&#xD;
      node dissection (SLND), followed by risk-adapted intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)&#xD;
      in patients with transorally resectable, Stage III-IVa, HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (OPSCC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HPV status and tobacco use are the major independent prognostic factors for patients with&#xD;
      OPSCC. Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC have a favorable prognosis when treated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy, radiation, and/or surgery. This has resulted in national trials investigating&#xD;
      de-intensification strategies for good-risk patients with HPV-associated OPSCC, where current&#xD;
      multimodality paradigms may represent overtreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling network, a mitogenic pathway regulating cellular metabolism,&#xD;
      proliferation and survival, plays a major role in HPV biology. Starting with early infection,&#xD;
      activation of PI3K suppresses autophagy and induces functional protein translational&#xD;
      machinery. Activation of the pathway is a nearly universal aspect of mammalian viral&#xD;
      infection, and is of particular importance for dsDNA viruses such as HPV. The oncoproteins&#xD;
      E5, E6 and E7 also have direct roles in pathway activation. Moreover, HPV-associated OPSCC&#xD;
      demonstrates a strikingly high prevalence of genomic activation of the PI3K pathway,&#xD;
      including activating PIK3CA mutations (27-31%), PIK3CA amplification (20%), and loss of PTEN&#xD;
      (30%), the negative regulator of PI3K. Overall genomic events hypothesized to result in PI3K&#xD;
      pathway activation are present in approximately 45-60% of HPV-transformed OPSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BYL719 is an oral, small molecule, alpha-specific inhibitor of PI3-Kinase. Because&#xD;
      HPV-associated OPSCC demonstrates a high rate of both genomic and non-genomic PI3K pathway&#xD;
      activation, we hypothesize that adding BYL719 to platinum-taxane induction chemotherapy in&#xD;
      HPV-associated OPSCC will increase clinico-radiologic complete response relative to&#xD;
      historical control. In this phase I/II trial, eligible patients wiht HPV-associated OPSCC&#xD;
      will be treated with 3 cycles of induction BYL719, cisplatin and paclitaxel. Induction will&#xD;
      be followed by minimally-invasive, transoral surgery (TORS or TLM) then risk-adapted IMRT.&#xD;

                  and for 12 weeks after completion of all protocol treatment and should not father&#xD;

                       lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                       symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                       methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or&#xD;
                       without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking&#xD;
                       study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                       status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Male partner sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For&#xD;
                       female subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the&#xD;

                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not&#xD;
                  allowed as BYL719 may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if&#xD;
                  they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have&#xD;
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six&#xD;
                  weeks ago.&#xD;
