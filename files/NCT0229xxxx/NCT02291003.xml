      Circadian clocks are not only found in discrete areas of the brain, but are found in&#xD;
      virtually every organ in our bodies, including the heart, lungs and immune system.&#xD;
      Disruptions in circadian clocks, or chronopathology, may underlie various forms of&#xD;
      cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic disorders. Over the past two decades, molecular&#xD;
      geneticists have &quot;cracked&quot; the clock to reveal its core biochemical mechanisms evident in&#xD;
      organisms from fruit flies to humans. These mechanistic insights have led to the discovery of&#xD;
      links between clock function and an ever-expanding array of prevalent diseases, including&#xD;
      heart, lung, metabolic and sleep disorders. Yet the prevalence of circadian disruption in&#xD;
      these patient populations is unclear because current tests are not easily applied in clinical&#xD;
      settings or have yet to be developed. Here the investigators exploit our newfound&#xD;
      understanding of clock mechanisms and the development of new genomic technologies to identify&#xD;
      novel complements of clock-regulated genes (&quot;signatures&quot;) that will reveal the state of the&#xD;
      internal biological clock. This approach will allow us to take a genomic snapshot of clock&#xD;
      status from a single blood draw, substantially easing the diagnosis of these individuals with&#xD;
      evidence of circadian disruption or misalignment, i.e., chronopathology.&#xD;

      Circadian clocks are not only found in discrete areas of the brain, but are found in&#xD;
      virtually every organ in our bodies, including the heart, lungs and immune system.&#xD;
      Disruptions in circadian clocks, or chronopathology, may underlie various forms of&#xD;
      cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic disorders. Over the past two decades, molecular&#xD;
      geneticists have &quot;cracked&quot; the clock to reveal its core biochemical mechanisms evident in&#xD;
      organisms from fruit flies to humans. These mechanistic insights have led to the discovery of&#xD;
      links between clock function and an ever-expanding array of prevalent diseases, including&#xD;
      heart, lung, metabolic and sleep disorders. Yet the prevalence of circadian disruption in&#xD;
      these patient populations is unclear because current tests are not easily applied in clinical&#xD;
      settings or have yet to be developed. Perhaps the major limitation of these techniques is the&#xD;
      need for serial sampling over extended periods of at least 24 hours and in some cases longer.&#xD;
      The development of an assay from a single blood draw would represent a major step forward,&#xD;
      facilitating assessments of circadian disruption in a range of diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative strategy to existing assays is to use genomic microarrays to analyze circadian&#xD;
      rhythms. Many studies in a number of organisms as well as multiple organs and tissues have&#xD;
      found that substantial fractions of the genome (2-10%) are under robust circadian clock&#xD;
      control. Importantly, these hundreds of rhythmic genes exhibit expression peaks at all times&#xD;
      throughout the day, presumably reflecting their time-of-day specific functions. Using this as&#xD;
      a foundation, Ueda and colleagues proposed an alternative strategy that would allow&#xD;
      assessment of circadian time from a single blood draw allowing more routine assessments of&#xD;
      circadian clock state. In brief, they identified the complement of rhythmic genes in livers&#xD;
      of mice. They then selected a set of approximately 50 genes with unique peak times as&#xD;
      &quot;time-indicating genes.&quot; They then assessed the transcript levels of these time-indicating&#xD;
      genes at a single time of day and found that they could accurately determine the time of day&#xD;
      that the liver was taken based on the relative expression levels of the time-indicating&#xD;
      genes. These studies provide proof-of-principle for the approach that we propose here.&#xD;
      Establishing a molecular assay in humans for circadian rhythms from a single time point will&#xD;
      allow us to identify circadian rhythm disorders, and to assess internal biological time to&#xD;
      deliver therapies at their most efficacious time.&#xD;
