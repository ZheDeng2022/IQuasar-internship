      This is an open label, long-term extension study in approximately 24 male DMD subjects&#xD;
      consisting of children (ages 4-12, inclusive) and adolescents (ages 13-16, inclusive) who&#xD;
      participated in the MP-104-CL-005 PK study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may have received up to 8 (+2 days) doses of deflazacort during the MP-104-CL-005 PK&#xD;
      study, at which point treatment will be continued at the same dose and frequency until such&#xD;
      time that deflazacort becomes commercially available or the study is terminated. Concomitant&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy will be prohibited during the study while the subject is taking&#xD;
      deflazacort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be given medication to take at home for once-daily, morning dosing following&#xD;
      the 8 hour PK sample on Day 8 (+2 days) of the MP-104-CL-005 PK study. Subjects will begin&#xD;
      dosing at home the day following Day 8 (+2 days) of the MP-104-CL-005 PK study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and laboratory evaluations&#xD;
      every 3 months for the first year, and then every 3 or 6 months, depending on subjects'&#xD;
      disease status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be contacted via telephone between study visits to determine if any adverse&#xD;
      events (AE) have occurred since the last study visit. Subjects who terminate the study early&#xD;
      will be contacted if the Principal Investigator (PI) deems necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be continued for a maximum of three years or until such time that deflazacort&#xD;
      becomes commercially available or the study is terminated.&#xD;
