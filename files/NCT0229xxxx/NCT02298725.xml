      To determine if consumption of different diet plans that both are nutritionally-adequate and&#xD;
      provide energy to maintain body weight, alters fasting insulin concentrations, shifts other&#xD;
      common clinical markers of metabolic disease risk, and affects metabolomic profiles that&#xD;
      reflect glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Western Human Nutrition Research Center (WHNRC) scientists have observed rapid and&#xD;
      substantial improvements in metabolic health indices in non-diabetic obese persons who&#xD;
      undergo a weight-maintenance diet including prepared meals that were aligned with current&#xD;
      dietary recommendations, including those of the Institute of Medicine and the United States&#xD;
      Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Dietary&#xD;
      Guidelines for Americans. For instance, marked reductions and often normalization of&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia were observed within days of provision of a controlled nutrient-dense high&#xD;
      quality diet, and LDL was reduced by 20-30% or more within 2 weeks or possibly earlier. This&#xD;
      indicates that change in diet alone would benefit many at-risk persons with respect to&#xD;
      normalizing metabolic parameters and disease risk markers. Yet, surprisingly little formal&#xD;
      research has focused on how a high quality, weight maintaining diet impacts health over a&#xD;
      short-term period in at-risk individuals. The overall objective of this study is to determine&#xD;
      if a nutrient-adequate diet closely aligned with food group recommendations set in the 2010&#xD;
      Dietary Guidelines for Americans elicits a superior metabolic profile in persons at-risk for&#xD;
      metabolic disease, compared to a nutrient-adequate containing foods closely aligned with the&#xD;
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) &quot;What We Eat In America&quot; report.&#xD;
      Further, the investigation will include effect modification of stress-related cortisol&#xD;
      measures on change in cardiometabolic risk factors.&#xD;
