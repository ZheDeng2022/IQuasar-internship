  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single center trial investigating the effects of prospectively&#xD;
      measuring packing density prior to choosing Target Coils for the treatment of intracranial&#xD;
      saccular aneurysms. Up to 25 eligible subjects with ruptured or unruptured intracranial&#xD;
      saccular aneurysms between 4-20mm (maximum dimension), who consent to study participation,&#xD;
      will be treated with Stryker Target Detachable Coils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historical data from patients enrolled in the MAPS trial at the single center will be the&#xD;
      control arm of the trial and reviewed for comparison to the prospective arm. In the control&#xD;
      arm, the subjects received Stryker Matrix2 Detachable Coils and Guglielmi Detachable Coils&#xD;
      and packing density was not measured prior to these procedures. The Pro-Pack Trial will&#xD;
      evaluate the outcomes of the subjects treated with Target Coils, in whom the packing density&#xD;
      will be actively calculated prior to coil selection. This will serve to establish that a&#xD;
      higher packing density can be obtained by the change in methodology of coil selection and a&#xD;
      higher packing density with lower recurrence rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Pro Pack Trial will evaluate the outcomes of subjects treated with Target Coils, in whom&#xD;
      the packing density is actively calculated prior to coil selection. Selecting the coil with&#xD;
      the best volumetric filling has been shown to increase overall packing density. Each coil&#xD;
      thereafter will be evaluated prior to placement to assess the resultant packing density. An&#xD;
      initial goal of 10% or greater packing density with the first coil will be used as a guide to&#xD;
      coil selection. A final packing density of greater than 25% should be attempted as feasible.&#xD;
      Currently, a maximum packing density is not defined. While theoretically a packing density&#xD;
      may approach 100%, in reality the spaces between the coil loops occupy a large percentage of&#xD;
      the coil mass, and packing densities rarely reach 50% or greater. As such, the final packing&#xD;
      density is left to the operator, and is based on ability to place coils safely by the&#xD;
      operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be screened, consented, imaged, and evaluated in order to obtain 25&#xD;
      patients with complete 12-month follow-up. Baseline patient data will be collected at the&#xD;
      time of the procedure; follow-up information will be collected within 48 hours of the&#xD;
      procedure, and at approximately 12 months (±3 months) after the procedure. The anticipated&#xD;
      study duration is approximately 24 months: 12 month recruitment, 12 month primary endpoint&#xD;
      and closeout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment in the study occurs after a signed Informed Consent form has been obtained, all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria have been met, aneurysm volume has been calculated, and the procedure to&#xD;
      place Target Coils with prospective density measurements has begun, i.e., at the time of&#xD;
      target procedural angiography. From the moment of placement of the first coil, the patient is&#xD;
      considered in the study whether they receive Target Coils or not, and will be followed up and&#xD;
      included in the final analysis. Patients enrolled in the trial will be followed for&#xD;
      approximately 12 months after the index embolization procedure. This will allow evaluation of&#xD;
      the primary and secondary study endpoints. Targeted enrollment is 25 patients with complete&#xD;
      12 month follow-up evaluations. Every effort will be made to follow the progress and monitor&#xD;
      the safety of patients who have been treated with Target® Coils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embolization utilizing Target® Coils may proceed at the time of diagnostic angiography for&#xD;
      eligible patients who have signed an Informed Consent form. The investigator must perform the&#xD;
      embolization procedure. Framing, filling, and finishing should be done with Target Coils. In&#xD;
      the event of aneurysms with wide necks or unfavorable anatomy, adjunctive therapy, Neuroform&#xD;
      Stent may be used to ensure the best clinical and angiographic results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The site will enter ongoing, real time information into an electronic imaging database and&#xD;
      track outcomes during the follow-up angiographic evaluations. The degree of occlusion, by&#xD;
      coils and/or thrombus, will be measured post procedurally and at 12 +/- 3 months post&#xD;
      procedure by the Angiographic Core Laboratory using a 3 point categorical scale: complete,&#xD;
      residual neck/dog ear or residual aneurysm. Additionally, for the final angiogram, a same/&#xD;
      better / worse scale shall be applied.&#xD;
