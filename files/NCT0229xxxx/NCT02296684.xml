  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this trial is to test the ability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) to improve&#xD;
      locoregional recurrence and distant metastatic rates in high-risk patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) that are treated with current&#xD;
      standard of care surgical approaches.&#xD;

risk-based intensity modulated radiation therapy consisting of 60 Gy in 2 Gy once-daily fraction size (total of 30 fractions)once-daily fraction size (total of 30 fractions)&#xD;
optional image-guided radiation therapy&#xD;

MK-3475 will be given intravenously once every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 doses if participant is considered high-risk based on 's surgical pathology from standard of care surgery shows high risk features (positive margins or extracapsular extension). These doses of MK-3475 will be given after surgery and after all acute toxicities of post-operative standard of care chemotherapy and radiation have resolved to grade 1 or less.</description>
