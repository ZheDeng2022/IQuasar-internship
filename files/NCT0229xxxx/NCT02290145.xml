      Induction chemotherapy is regarded as an effective way to reduce or downgrade the locally&#xD;
      advanced or aggressive cancers, and to improve the chance of eradication of the locoregional&#xD;
      lesions by radical surgery and/or radiotherapy. However, there are still debates on the&#xD;
      clinical value of induction chemotherapy for patients with advanced and resectable oral&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma. A prospective, open label, parallel, interventional, randomized&#xD;
      control trial on TPF induction chemotherapy indicate there is no difference in overall&#xD;
      survival, disease free survival, local regional recurrence free survival and metastasis free&#xD;
      survival between experimental group and control group, however, the subgroup analysis proves&#xD;
      that the induction chemotherapy of TPF protocol could benefit the patients with cyclinD1 high&#xD;
      expression and cN2 locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma. （Zhong et al, Randomized&#xD;
      Phase III Trial of Induction Chemotherapy With Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and Fluorouracil&#xD;
      Followed by Surgery Versus Up-Front Surgery in Locally Advanced Resectable Oral Squamous Cell&#xD;
      Carcinoma, J Clin Oncol 2013）The previous study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov website&#xD;
      with NCT01542931 identification number.This prospective, interventional, randomized control&#xD;
      trial was to evaluate the TPF induction chemotherapy have a better effects in the cyclin D1&#xD;
      high expression and cN2 patients with locally advanced and resectable OSCC. The patients&#xD;
      would receive TPF induction chemotherapy followed by radical surgery and post-operative&#xD;
      radiotherapy (the experimental group) or radical surgery and post-operative radiotherapy (the&#xD;
      control group). The primary endpoint is overall survival and the second endpoint is local&#xD;
      control and distant control.The study had a power of 80% on the basis of an assumed 2-year&#xD;
      survival rate of 67% in the experiment group and 25% in the control group, with use of a&#xD;
      two-sided log-rank test at a level of significance of 0.05. The recruitment period would be 2&#xD;
      years, and the follow-up period would be 2 years, and 15% of patients would drop out early or&#xD;
      be lost to follow-up. A maximum of 24 patients per group were to be recruited with stplan 4.5&#xD;
      software calculation. （Department of Biostatics, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of&#xD;
      Texas，USA）The patients in the experimental group received the TPF induction chemotherapy for&#xD;
      2 cycles followed by radical surgery and post-operative radiotherapy. The palpable edges of&#xD;
      the primary lesion (both the longest and shortest axis) were marked before induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy by at least four points, which were 0.5cm away. The patients in the control&#xD;
      group received the radical surgery and post-operative radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction chemotherapy: For the patients who were randomly assigned to receive TPF induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy, peripherally inserted central catheter was firstly inserted before intravenous&#xD;
      infusion, docetaxel(at a dose of 75mg/m2 of body surface area) was administered as a 2-hour&#xD;
      intravenous infusion, followed by intravenous cisplatin(75 mg/m2), administered during a&#xD;
      period of 2 to 3 hours. Then, 5-Fu(5 - Fluorouracil) (750 mg/m2/day) was administered as a&#xD;
      120-hour continuous intravenous infusion for 5 days. Induction chemotherapy was given every 3&#xD;
      weeks for 2 cycles, unless there was disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent by the patients. Dexamethasone was given before docetaxel infusion to&#xD;
      prevent docetaxel-related hypersensitivity reactions, skin toxic effects, and fluid&#xD;
      retention; prophylactic antibiotics were also given starting on day 5 of each cycle for 3&#xD;
      days. Hydration with diuretic and antiemetic treatment was also performed. Primary&#xD;
      prophylaxis with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was not suggested.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy dose reductions were allowed for grade 3/4 toxicities occurring after cycle 1:&#xD;
      25% and 50% dose reductions of the three chemotherapy agents were suggested for grade 3 and&#xD;
      grade 4 hematologic toxicities or gastrointestinal toxicities, respectively; 25% and 50%&#xD;
      cisplatin dose reductions were suggested for grade 3 and grade 4 renal toxicities,&#xD;
      respectively. Surgery was performed at least 2 weeks after completion of induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery: Radical resection of the primary lesion and full neck dissection(functional or&#xD;
      radical) with proper reconstruction(pedicle or free flap) were performed. The safety margins&#xD;
      of the primary lesion were 1.0-1.5cm far away from the palpable margins of the lesion; for&#xD;
      patients who received induction chemotherapy, the safety margins were 1.0cm away from the&#xD;
      marks that were placed before induction chemotherapy, to ensure the same extent surgery in&#xD;
      both arms. Frozen sections during surgery were performed to confirm adequate margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative radiotherapy: Radiotherapy was arranged 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. Routine&#xD;
      external beam radiotherapy, such as conformal or intensity modulated radiotherapy was&#xD;
      performed, and the dose was 1.8-2 Gy/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks, and totally 54-60 Gy, in&#xD;
      the patient with high risk features, such as positive surgical margin, extra capsular nodal&#xD;
      spread, vascular embolism, concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin 80mg/m2 was suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete medical history was obtained and tumor assessment was performed at baseline.&#xD;
      Clinical tumor response was assessed by clinical evaluation and imaging study and was&#xD;
      characterized according to the criteria of response evaluation criteria in solid tumors&#xD;
      (version 1.1) before surgery. Post-operative pathologic response was assessed by&#xD;
      post-operative pathologic examination as good and bad response. A good response was defined&#xD;
      as absence of any tumor cells (pathologic complete response) or presence of scattered foci of&#xD;
      a few tumor cells (minimal residual disease with &lt;10% viable tumor cells); otherwise, a bad&#xD;
      pathologic response was defined. Toxic effects were assessed weekly during and after&#xD;
      completion of induction chemotherapy and radiotherapy according to the common terminology&#xD;
      criteria for adverse events (version 3.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death; disease&#xD;
      free survival was calculated from the date of randomization to tumor recurrence or distant&#xD;
      metastasis or death from any cause; locoregional recurrence/distant metastasis free survival&#xD;
      was calculated from the date of randomization to locoregional recurrence/distant metastasis&#xD;
      of tumor or death from any cause. Time to locoregional recurrence/distant metastasis was&#xD;
      calculated from the date of finishing treatment to tumor locoregional recurrence/distant&#xD;
      metastasis. Patients were monitored by every three months in the first two years, every six&#xD;
      months in the next 2 years, and once a year thereafter until death or data censoring.&#xD;
