  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2618960 is a humanized Immunoglobulin G 1 ( IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to&#xD;
      the alpha component (CD127) of the heterodimeric Interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R). It is being&#xD;
      developed for the treatment of autoimmune indications. This study is intended to further&#xD;
      explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of single ascending doses GSK2618960 in healthy volunteers beyond those&#xD;
      already evaluated in I7R116702 (First Time In Human study). The study is anticipated to enrol&#xD;
      18 subjects in total, with 9 subjects in each of the two cohorts.&#xD;

             informed consent OR females of non-child bearing potential aged between 18 and 65&#xD;
             years of age at the time of signing the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-childbearing potential defined as:- pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal&#xD;
        ligation or hysterectomy, or post-menopausal defined as 24 months of spontaneous amenorrhea&#xD;
        [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#xD;
        &gt;40 milli-international units (MIU) per millilitre (mL) and oestradiol &lt;40 picograms (pg)&#xD;
        /mL (&lt; 140 picomole/liter) is confirmatory. [Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)&#xD;
        and whose menopausal status is in doubt must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of&#xD;
        postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks&#xD;
        will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on&#xD;
        the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can&#xD;
        resume use of HRT during the study.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of&#xD;
