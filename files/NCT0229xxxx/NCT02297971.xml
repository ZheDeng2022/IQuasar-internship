  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When ticagrelor should be discontinued prior to elective surgery is unclear. The risks of&#xD;
      bleeding when it is continued peri-operatively have to be weighed against the risk of&#xD;
      coronary artery thrombosis when stopped. This study aims to assess coagulation and&#xD;
      thrombocyte function every other day in patients who are taking ticagrelor after coronary&#xD;
      artery stents and discontinue therapy at the end of one year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have an acute coronary syndrome are today often treated by percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) and insertion of one or several coronary stents. Subsequently, these&#xD;
      patients are treated with oral anti-platelet (OAP) drugs, usually a combination of acetyl&#xD;
      salicylic acid (aspirin) and clopidogrel/ticagrelor. Although aspirin is continued for a&#xD;
      life-long period, clopidogrel/ticagrelor are used for a variable period of time, often from 3&#xD;
      months - 1 year after PCI, depending on the type of stent. Interventional elective&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery during the time of clopidogrel/ticagrelor therapy is not recommended&#xD;
      except for life-threatening (acute surgery) or life-prolonging (cancer surgery) procedures.&#xD;
      Specifically for life-prolonging procedures, surgery can be planned, and therefore the&#xD;
      question often arises as to when OAPs should be terminated prior to planned surgery. This&#xD;
      decision rests on balancing the risks of bleeding (when continued) or coronary stent&#xD;
      thrombosis (when stopped). Certainly, because of the small risk of severe bleeding when using&#xD;
      aspirin, this drug should be continued throughout the perioperative period in patients with&#xD;
      coronary stents. However, continuing clopidogrel/ticagrelor is more controversial since&#xD;
      severe perioperative bleeding is difficult to reverse in these patients. Therefore, surgeons&#xD;
      would normally discontinue clopidogrel/ticagrelor prior to surgery, specifically when the&#xD;
      potential for bleeding is high, and the consequences major. The exact duration for which&#xD;
      these drugs should be discontinued remains unclear and, depending on the drug used, a period&#xD;
      of 3 - 5 days is generally recommended, based on the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of&#xD;
      clopidogrel/ticagrelor in otherwise healthy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was done to better understand coagulation and thrombocyte function immediately&#xD;
      before discontinuation of ticagrelor and at regular intervals after termination, in patients&#xD;
      who have previously undergone PCI, have coronary stents, are taking ticagrelor but&#xD;
      discontinue it after one-year of therapy in accordance with hospital routines. No surgical&#xD;
      intervention was planned in these patients after termination of ticagrelor.&#xD;
