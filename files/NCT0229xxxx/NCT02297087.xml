      Aim 1 - Launch Pilot Study. In this aim, the investigators seek to launch a pilot study and&#xD;
      enroll 12 eligible patients with advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and to obtain the&#xD;
      necessary tumor biopsies to yield sufficient DNA and RNA for Genome-Wide Sequencing (GWS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 - Treatment Selection. Completion of this study aim will provide a new clinical&#xD;
      paradigm in the treatment of SCLC such that each individual patient would be treated with a&#xD;
      single-agent or combination therapy of commercially available agents that relates to&#xD;
      particular target(s) that have been identified via GWS.&#xD;

      Participants will be consented into the study after they are found to meet the study&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. The clinical staff will schedule a tissue biopsy and a blood draw for the&#xD;
      participant. Blood will be sent to Ashion for DNA extraction. Tumor specimens will be shipped&#xD;
      to Ashion for DNA and RNA extraction. Ashion will process the samples for DNA and RNA&#xD;
      Sequencing in their CLIA certified laboratory. A portion of the nucleic acid will be stored&#xD;
      in Ashion and used to confirm actionable targets. Results will be submitted to the physician&#xD;
      for possible inclusion in the treatment regimen. After sequencing analysis has been&#xD;
      performed, a report will be provided to the treating oncologist. The PI and the treating&#xD;
      oncologist may review the results to identify potential treatment. The treating oncologist&#xD;
      may use this information at their discretion, and is not required to treat the patient based&#xD;
      on the targets identified by the GWS analysis.&#xD;
