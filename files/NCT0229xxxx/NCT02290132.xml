      The clinical application and effect of ATG based myeloablative conditioning regimen after&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in adult patients with aggressive T-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aggressive T-cell lymphomas (ATCLs), including peripheral T-cell lymphoma and T&#xD;
      lymphoblastoid cell lymphoma/leukemia, represent 10% to 15% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs)&#xD;
      in adults(1). ATCLs show a worse prognosis than that of B-cell lymphomas. Myeloablative&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) may be the only way to cure these patients,&#xD;
      but the recurrence of the primary disease after transplantation is still an important&#xD;
      prognostic factor (2). Optimizing the conditioning regimen is always the research hot topics&#xD;
      in hematology fields. Polyclonal anti-thymocyte globulin (rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin,&#xD;
      r-ATG) are currently used to prevent graft-versus -host(GVHD) disease in allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation, and also widely used for the prevention and treatment of acute rejection&#xD;
      after solid organ transplant because of its strong immunomodulatory effects. ATG is used in&#xD;
      allogeneic SCT for the prophylaxis of graft versus host disease by in vivo T cell depletion,&#xD;
      including the complement-dependent cytotoxic response, antibody-dependent cell-mediated&#xD;
      cytotoxicity, the opsonophagocytic role of phagocytic cells and induced apoptosis(3). But&#xD;
      some scholars reported the ATG delayed immune reconstitution and hematologic reconstitution&#xD;
      and leaded to the increase of the incidence of virus and fungal infections after&#xD;
      transplantation. But it is often curable and does not affect the overall survival and quality&#xD;
      of life of the patients (4). Because of its strong immune suppression and regulation, also on&#xD;
      the basis of the above facts, ATG as GVHD prophylaxis is generally limited to the unrelated&#xD;
      donor, or human leukocyte antigen（HLA）-mismatched related donor transplantation. But There&#xD;
      are many issues still need to be studied. ATG has shown efficacy in preventing acute&#xD;
      GVHD（aGVHD) in allo-SCT, but its efficacy in chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and long-term outcomes&#xD;
      remains controversial. A systematic review and meta-analysis from Du k et al（5） reported that&#xD;
      prophylactic use of ATG exerted a favorable effect in reducing cGVHD without survival&#xD;
      impairment in a long term, although a higher relapse rate is a major threat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the ATG also have the killing effect on the tumor cells of the lymphatic system? The&#xD;
      vitro studies have confirmed this point recently. Grüllich(6) et al and the investigators&#xD;
      study(7) both found that ATG can inhibit the proliferation and induce high level of apoptosis&#xD;
      in the human lymphoblastic cell lines, such as Jurkat, Daudi, DG-75 , and myeloblastic cell&#xD;
      lines K562, HL-60, KG1, and U937. ATG also has pro-apoptotic activity against the majority of&#xD;
      primary leukemia cells, particularly those cells from lymphatic origin. In addition, ATG will&#xD;
      not result in apoptosis of normal hematopoietic cells. Low-dose ATG can also stimulate normal&#xD;
      hematopoietic colony growth. Therefore, ATG may be used as anti-lymphocyte tumor&#xD;
      bio-therapeutics (such as rituximab) to increase the role of chemo-radiotherapy in the&#xD;
      conditioning regimen. And ATG can remove the residual tumor lesions, which reduced the rate&#xD;
      of tumor recurrence after transplantation. Although the vitro studies have clarified the role&#xD;
      of ATG on the tumor cells of the lymphatic system, but no relevant reports on the anti-tumor&#xD;
      effect of ATG in allo-SCT have been published. Further clinical observation need to be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As noted earlier, a higher relapse rate may be a major threat after ATG use（5）.In China, the&#xD;
      conventional dose of 2.5mg/kg/day, 2-3 days of Thymoglobulin is commonly used as GVHD&#xD;
      prophylaxis in the unrelated donor, or HLA-mismatched related donor transplantation but not&#xD;
      in the HLA matched related donor transplantation (8). In order to observe the anti-tumor&#xD;
      effect of this conditioning regimen in the aggressive T-cell lymphomas patients(including&#xD;
      peripheral T-cell lymphoma and T lymphoblastoid cell lymphoma/leukemia, complete remission,&#xD;
      partial remission, relapse after remission or refractory recurrent invasive patients), the&#xD;
      investigators improved the drugs of conditioning regimen and increased the Thymoglobulin dose&#xD;
      in the conditioning regimen for four days 10mg/kg total even in the HLA matched related donor&#xD;
      transplantation. The purpose of this clinical trial is to reduce the incidence of GVHD at the&#xD;
      same time does not increase the recurrence of the primary disease. The investigators expect&#xD;
      that this ATG based conditioning regimen does play anti-tumor effect, reduce primary disease&#xD;
      recurrence after transplantation, improve disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival&#xD;
      rate (OS) , as well as reduce the incidence and severity of GVHD, but the incidence of&#xD;
      infection need to be observed.&#xD;
