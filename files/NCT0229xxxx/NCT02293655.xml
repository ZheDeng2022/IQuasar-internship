    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of receiving and then discontinuing methylphenidate (MPH) in&#xD;
      children with ADHD. After receiving MPH for 8 weeks, participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      either discontinue MPH (and receive placebo) OR remain on MPH for 4 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The stimulant methylphenidate (MPH) is the most commonly prescribed psychoactive medication&#xD;
      in children. An abundance of studies attest to the efficacy of MPH for attenuating&#xD;
      inattentive, hyperactive, and impulsive symptoms in children with ADHD. Despite its efficacy,&#xD;
      most children with ADHD who are prescribed MPH have poor continuity of treatment for a&#xD;
      variety of reasons, including forgetting to administer the medication and delays obtaining&#xD;
      refills. In addition, it is an accepted clinical practice for physicians to omit MPH for&#xD;
      periods of time, such as during the summer or on weekends (i.e., drug holidays). Since MPH&#xD;
      discontinuation is considered to be benign, many clinicians do not employ any special&#xD;
      procedures or inform families of any special precautions in regard to its cessation. However,&#xD;
      increasing evidence suggests that the pharmacological effects of MPH cause lasting changes in&#xD;
      brain neurochemistry that persist beyond medication discontinuation. Moreover, these&#xD;
      neurobiological effects of discontinuation appear to have neurobehavioral consequences. There&#xD;
      is a critical need to better understand the breadth and magnitude of the neurobehavioral&#xD;
      effects caused by MPH discontinuation as well as to better understand the temporal trajectory&#xD;
      of these deleterious effects. Hence, the primary goal of the proposed research is to conduct&#xD;
      the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial specifically designed to study&#xD;
      the negative effects of MPH discontinuation at multiple time points. 180 children diagnosed&#xD;
      with ADHD will participate across two recruitment sites. After undergoing a 4-week MPH&#xD;
      titration trial and 4-week MPH maintenance phase, participants will be randomized to either&#xD;
      discontinue MPH (and receive placebo) OR remain on MPH for 4 weeks. Comprehensive multi-time&#xD;
      point, multi-informant (parents, teachers, study staff) and multi-modal (behavior/mood/affect&#xD;
      ratings scales, direct behavior observations, standardized testing) assessments will be used&#xD;
      to assess a broad range of neurobehavioral outcomes. We will examine the magnitude and time&#xD;
      course of effects of MPH discontinuation on behavioral as well as cognitive and academic&#xD;
      functioning in children with ADHD. Furthermore, we will examine moderators of the adverse&#xD;
      effects of MPH discontinuation on these outcomes to aid in the identification of those who&#xD;
      are at increased risk.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. ADHD Diagnostic Status: Meets DSM-V criteria for ADHD, with Clinical Global Impression&#xD;
             (CGI) rating corresponding to at least &quot;moderately ill.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Cognitive and Academic Functioning: Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of &gt;80 as estimated by&#xD;
             Vocabulary and Block Design subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for&#xD;
             Children-4th Edition and scaled scores &gt;80 on the Wechsler Individual Achievement&#xD;
             Test-2nd edition Reading and Math subtests&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Physical Health: Physical exam and ECG findings are judged to be normal for age and&#xD;
             sex by study physician and/or medical consultant, and there is no co-existing&#xD;
             condition for which MPH is contraindicated 4. School: Enrolled in a school setting&#xD;
             rather than a home-school program. This ensures that we can obtain parent and teacher&#xD;
             ratings from separate individuals for diagnosis and outcome assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Psychiatric Medications: Current or prior use of any medication for&#xD;
             psychological/psychiatric problems&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Behavioral Interventions: Current active participation in ADHD-related behavioral&#xD;
             interventions, given that improvements due to these interventions may confound our&#xD;
             group comparisons&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Psychiatric or Neurobehavioral Conditions: Children with mania/hypomania,&#xD;
             schizophrenia, or severe depressive disorder, as determined by the K-SADS, will be&#xD;
             excluded since ADHD medications may not be an appropriate first line of treatment for&#xD;
             children with these comorbid disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Organic Brain Injury: History of head trauma, neurological disorder (including&#xD;
             epilepsy), or other disorder affecting brain function due to potential differences in&#xD;
             neurophysiology of ADHD phenotype&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Children with a personal history or family history of&#xD;
             cardiovascular risk factors will be excluded, or given the option of participating in&#xD;
             the study after obtaining an EKG and verification from a pediatric cardiologist&#xD;
             regarding the safety of their participation in a trial of methylphenidate. In this&#xD;
             case, families will be responsible for the costs of EKG and any necessary cardiologist&#xD;
             evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnancy: The safety of MPH use during pregnancy has not been established&#xD;
