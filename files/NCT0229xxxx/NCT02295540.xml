  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies how well hypofractionated radiation therapy followed by surgery&#xD;
      works in treating patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity that has spread to&#xD;
      other places in the body. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of&#xD;
      radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer&#xD;
      side effects. Giving hypofractionated radiation therapy before surgery may shrink the tumor&#xD;
      making it easier to be removed, may reduce the risk of the cancer coming back, and may be a&#xD;
      better treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. 2 year locoregional control for advanced oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated&#xD;
      with preoperative hypofractionated radiation followed by surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Rate of pathologic complete response after preoperative hypofractionated radiation at both&#xD;
      the primary site and lymph nodes (LN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Rate of radiologic complete and partial response (computed tomography [CT] neck with&#xD;
      intravenous [IV] contrast performed before and after radiation therapy, judged per Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Grade III/IV/V toxicity both short term (from start of radiation to 60 days after&#xD;
      surgery) and long term (more than 60 days after surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Rate of flap complications: Rate of flap revisions, and complete revisions required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Molecular correlates. VI. Quantitative imaging correlates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) every other&#xD;
      day for up to 5 treatments. Patients then undergo surgery 7-14 days after the last radiation&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
