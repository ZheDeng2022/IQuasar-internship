  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to compare the efficacy of 2 treatment strategies, catheter ablation of&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation versus optimized pharmacological therapy, in patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a randomized, prospective, controlled, open-label multicentre, parallel-group study&#xD;
      including 116 patients. Inclusion criteria are patients aged 30-70 years with symptoms&#xD;
      related to atrial fibrillation and who have failed or been intolerant to at least one&#xD;
      anti-arrhythmic drug, with at least one atrial fibrillation episode documented on ECG during&#xD;
      the previous 12 months and at least one symptomatic episode during the previous 2 months or&#xD;
      at least 2 symptomatic episodes of persistent AF in the previous 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main exclusion criteria are patients who have tested 2 or more anti-arrhythmic drugs for&#xD;
      rhythm control, uncontrolled hypertension, valvular disease requiring anticoagulation,&#xD;
      planned valve surgery within 2 years, contraindication to treatment with anticoagulants,&#xD;
      heart failure, left atrial diameter &gt; 60 mm, unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
      within the last 3 months, cardiac revascularization procedure within the last 6 months, prior&#xD;
      cardiac surgery or planned cardiac corrective surgery within 1 year, prior AF ablation&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is general health-related quality of life at 12 months follow-up. The&#xD;
      main secondary endpoints are morbidity and mortality as composite outcome, cardiovascular&#xD;
      hospitalization, symptoms, heart failure, left atrial and ventricular function and diameters,&#xD;
      exercise capacity, health care economics, rhythm, atrial fibrillation burden, successful&#xD;
      versus failed treatment, safety and &quot;cross-overs&quot; over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a cardiac monitor, implanted subcutaneously, which will monitor the&#xD;
      heart rhythm during a two month &quot;Run-in&quot; period, for the definition of the basic atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation burden. Patients will be randomly assigned to an antiarrhythmic drug (for rhythm&#xD;
      or rate control) or to left atrial catheter ablation. Evaluation of outcome is at 12, 24, 36&#xD;
      and 48 months of follow-up, while health economy will be evaluated at 24 and 48 months of&#xD;
      follow-up.. In case of documented disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, subjects will&#xD;
      be switched to the alternative regimen. The main statistical analysis of the primary endpoint&#xD;
      will be based on the intention-to-treat population. The trial duration is 48 months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized, open-label, multi-centre trial in which patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation will be randomized to treatment with either&#xD;
      catheter ablation for pulmonary vein isolation or optimized conventional pharmacological&#xD;
      therapy. Patients will receive an implantable cardiac monitor, Reveal XT, implanted&#xD;
      subcutaneously, before a two month &quot;Run-in&quot; period from which the basic atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      burden will be defined, which will provide an objective basis to assess the AF burden for 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initiation of randomized therapy, patients will be followed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30,&#xD;
      36 and 48 months. In case of intolerable symptomatic atrial fibrillation despite allocated&#xD;
      treatment, subjects will be switched to the alternative regimen, on patient's request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ablation will consist of pulmonary vein isolation for both paroxysmal and persistent&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation. A linear lesion at the left atrial roof is optional for patients with&#xD;
      recurrence after a first procedure or primarily for patients with persistent atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation only. A second ablation procedure may be undertaken at earliest 3 months after&#xD;
      the first procedure, if symptoms persists or recurs. Epicardial off-pump ablation may be&#xD;
      offered after failed attempts of transvenous catheter ablation at earliest 3 months after&#xD;
      latest procedure. If the second transvenous ablation procedure fails, patients may be offered&#xD;
      i) a third transvenous ablation procedure or ii) an epicardial off-pump procedure. In case&#xD;
      the patient declines a third intervention despite recurrence, the patient should continue on&#xD;
      the same anti-arrhythmic drugs. If new previously untested drugs are prescribed, the patient&#xD;
      will be defined as a change of treatment (and failed ablation). Ablation may be performed&#xD;
      using radiofrequency energy with irrigated tip or with cryo-energy using the Arctic Frontâ„¢&#xD;
      Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter. A complete pulmonary vein isolation will be defined by&#xD;
      documenting PV entrance block in each vein using a circular mapping catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-arrhythmic drugs remaining to be tested for rate and rhythm control may include&#xD;
      previously tested tolerable antiarrhythmic drugs if dosages were inadequate. Optimized&#xD;
      anti-arrhythmic drug therapy includes testing of all available anti-arrhythmic drugs at&#xD;
      adequate dosages, including amiodarone 600 mg once daily for 7-10 days, and 100-200 mg once&#xD;
      daily thereafter; sotalol: 80-160 mg twice daily; flecainide 100 to 150 mg twice daily or the&#xD;
      entire dose as slow-release formula once daily; propafenone 300 mg twice daily; and&#xD;
      disopyramide 250-375mg twice daily, and potentially new antiarrhythmic drugs commercially&#xD;
      available during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A monitor will verify that data recorded on the procedure forms are correct through quarterly&#xD;
      communication, review of catheterization reports and medical records. In accordance with&#xD;
      applicable regulations a monitor (study nurse from Uppsala) will contact the site prior to&#xD;
      the start of the study to review with the site staff protocol, study requirements and their&#xD;
      responsibilities to satisfy study requirements, if needed. When reviewing data collection&#xD;
      procedures the discussion will also include identification, agreement and documentation of&#xD;
      data items for which the case record forms (CRF), patient files (paper or database), tracings&#xD;
      of investigations, and questionnaires, will serve a source document. The investigator and the&#xD;
      head of the medical institution agrees should allow the monitor direct access to all relevant&#xD;
      documents whenever needed and in an event of an audit. To ensure compliance the monitor may&#xD;
      conduct a quality assurance audit, which can occur at any time during or after completion of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Biometrics section at Uppsala Clinical Research Centre is responsible for the Data&#xD;
      Management. All data will be recorded in the CRFs and entered via eCRF directly into a web&#xD;
      based data capturing system except for electronically available data that will be loaded&#xD;
      directly into the study database. Each investigational site will have authorized site&#xD;
      personnel responsible for entering the data, as well as for changing and correcting the data&#xD;
      according to instructions provided by Uppsala Clinical Research Centre (UCR) and the&#xD;
      coordinating centre. All changes will be tracked by an audit trail. The site specific&#xD;
      investigator will sign the eCRF electronically when the data have been reviewed and edited,&#xD;
      and Source Data Verification has been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Database Closure will be performed in three steps, the first one when all data from the&#xD;
      first 12 months are entered, the second one when all data from the 24 months period are&#xD;
      entered and the third when the complete study period of 48 months are entered. All datasets&#xD;
      used for the 12- and 24 months analyses will be locked separately. Procedures: When all data&#xD;
      are entered into the database and all queries solved, the Database Closure procedures will&#xD;
      start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications are defined as acute if occurring within 1 week after initialized therapy, and&#xD;
      late if occurring one week after initialized therapy. All &quot;Serious adverse events&quot; should be&#xD;
      documented on the &quot;Adverse events Form&quot; AND &quot;Serious adverse events Form&quot;. All &quot; Adverse&#xD;
      events&quot; should be documented in the &quot;Adverse events Form&quot;. All events which are part of&#xD;
      performing a catheterization procedure will be reported. All serious unanticipated events&#xD;
      whether or not they are considered to be related to the procedure but which have some&#xD;
      association with the catheterization either by timing or physiology, will be reported. Other&#xD;
      bleedings than major bleeding events should be reported as minor bleeds. All events related&#xD;
      to pharmacological therapy will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedural complications are defined as those arising during or within 1 month of the&#xD;
      procedure, including death, major bleeding, vascular injury, cerebrovascular accident,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, pericardial effusion with or without tamponade, venous or systemic&#xD;
      embolism, phrenic nerve paralysis, and heart block. Events occurring later than 1 month after&#xD;
      the procedure and defined as related to the procedure are pulmonary vein stenosis, tamponade,&#xD;
      retroperitoneal haematoma, and atrio-esophageal fistula (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relation to Device Procedure or drug, Intensity, Outcome and Actions taken will be described&#xD;
      according to international regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods. All continuous variables will be presented per treatment group using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics by mean, SD, max and min values, in addition medians, 25th and 75th&#xD;
      percentiles will be presented when suitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of mean change in the primary endpoint will be two-sided and performed as an&#xD;
      unpaired t-test at 5% significance level. The difference between the treatment groups with&#xD;
      corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval based on a normal approximation will be&#xD;
      presented. The continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed in the same way as the primary&#xD;
      endpoint, but the results will be interpreted descriptively. Kaplan-Meier estimates and&#xD;
      log-rank test will be used to determine the occurrence of the secondary endpoints over time.&#xD;
      All categorical secondary endpoints will be compared between treatment groups with frequency&#xD;
      tables and Fisher's Exact Test including 95% confidence intervals where possible. Adverse&#xD;
      Events will be summarized per treatment group by body system/system organ class, preferred&#xD;
      terms, intensity, seriousness and relationship. Laboratory data for efficacy will be&#xD;
      presented in mean change tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis (H0) is that the difference in the mean change from baseline to 12 months&#xD;
      after baseline in General Health between the two treatments is zero;- mean change for the&#xD;
      treatment group catheter ablation (Î¼ 1) and - mean change for the treatment group optimized&#xD;
      conventional pharmacological therapy (Î¼ 2) Safety - All randomized patients will be included&#xD;
      in the safety analysis. Only observed observations are used in the safety analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention to treat (ITT) - All randomized patients. The main analysis will be performed on&#xD;
      the ITT-population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per protocol (PP) - All randomized patients completing the study treatment period of 12&#xD;
      months without any major protocol violation (for example ineligibility, early withdrawals,&#xD;
      poor compliance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subgroup analysis will determine whether sinus rhythm obtained by AF ablation is superior&#xD;
      to sinus rhythm obtained by pharmacological therapy for rate and/or rhythm control. In&#xD;
      addition a comparison will be done between patients with sinus rhythm and patients with&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation irrespective of allocated therapy. Both analyses will be performed with&#xD;
      regard to quality of life, morbidity (composite, see secondary endpoint 1), cardiovascular&#xD;
      hospitalizations, exercise/ physical capacity, safety, and health economy at 12 and 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All continuous variables will be presented per treatment group using descriptive statistics&#xD;
      by mean, standard deviation, max and min values, in addition medians, 25th and 75th&#xD;
      percentiles will be presented when suitable. The analysis of mean change in the primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be two-sided and performed as an unpaired t-test at 5% significance level. The&#xD;
      difference between the treatment groups with corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      based on a normal approximation will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed in the same way as the primary endpoint,&#xD;
      but the results will be interpreted descriptively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank test will be used to determine the occurrence of the&#xD;
      secondary endpoints over time. All categorical secondary endpoints will be compared between&#xD;
      treatment groups with frequency tables and Fisher's Exact Test including 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals where possible. Adverse Events will be summarized per treatment group by body&#xD;
      system/system organ class, preferred terms, intensity, seriousness and relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size considerations: The primary endpoint is the change in General Health from&#xD;
      baseline to 12 months after baseline. Based on previous studies it is assumed that the&#xD;
      variable is normally distributed with a standard deviation for the change in General Health&#xD;
      of 20 units and an expected difference between groups of at least 10.5 units. To detect a&#xD;
      difference of 10.5 units in General Health (corresponding to an improvement of 15%, assuming&#xD;
      a mean General Health of 70 units in the conventional pharmacological therapy group) with a&#xD;
      power of 80% and a type I error of 5% (two-sided alternative), a sample size of approximately&#xD;
      58 subjects in each treatment group is required, i.e. a total number of 116 patients. Another&#xD;
      20 patients are added to ensure calculated number of patients for analysis at 12 months. The&#xD;
      power to detect a difference of 10.5 for 136 (116+20) and 140 (the minimum expected total&#xD;
      number) patients is 85% and 86%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 1:1 block randomization will be used within each centre, stratifying patients between&#xD;
      paroxysmal and persistent AF.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with symptoms related to atrial fibrillation (AF), who have failed or been&#xD;
             intolerant to at least one drug used for either rate or rhythm control (Vaughan&#xD;
             Williams class I, II, or III anti-arrhythmic drug) thus excluding digitalis and&#xD;
             Calcium channel inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The first diagnosis of AF must have been first noted more than 6 months prior to&#xD;
             consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least one AF episode documented on 12-lead ECG or 2-channel telemetry/ Holter&#xD;
             recording during the previous 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Paroxysmal AF (AF is self-terminating within 7 days of recognized onset) with&#xD;
             occurrence of at least one symptomatic episodes (patient history) in the previous 2&#xD;
             months that merits non-pharmacological intervention (see classification), or&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Persistent AF (AF is not self-terminating within 7 days or is terminated electrically&#xD;
             or pharmacologically) with occurrence of at least 2 symptomatic episodes of AF in the&#xD;
             previous 12 months, necessitating pharmacological or electrical cardioversions (CV),&#xD;
             on or off antiarrhythmic drugs that merits non-pharmacological intervention. Upon&#xD;
             cardioversion, it must be documented that sinus rhythm can be maintained for at least&#xD;
             1 hour, to distinguish from permanent AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have tested 2 or more anti-arrhythmic drugs for rhythm control at highest&#xD;
             tolerable dosages (Vaughan Williams class I or III anti-arrhythmic drug; flecainide,&#xD;
             propafenone, disopyramide, sotalol or amiodarone).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. AF secondary to a transient or correctable abnormality including electrolyte&#xD;
             imbalance, trauma, recent surgery, infection, toxic ingestion, and uncontrolled&#xD;
             thyroid disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Atrial fibrillation episodes triggered by another uniform supraventricular&#xD;
             tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Untreated or uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Valvular disease requiring chronic anticoagulation or planned valve surgery within 2&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Contraindication to treatment with Warfarin or other anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Heart failure with New York Heart Association (NYHA ) class III or IV or left&#xD;
             ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 35 %, which is not secondary to AF with&#xD;
             inadequate rate control, according to the judgement of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Left atrial diameter &gt; 60 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction within last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Cardiac revascularization procedure within last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Prior cardiac surgery or planned cardiac corrective surgery within 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Prior AF ablation procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, biventricular pacing device, Dual chamber- and&#xD;
             single chamber -pacemaker if needed for ventricular pacing, as well as&#xD;
             Atrioventricular (AV) block II-III and sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with intra-atrial thrombus, tumor, or another abnormality in whom transseptal&#xD;
             catheterization or appropriate vascular access is precluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Renal failure requiring dialysis or abnormalities of liver function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Participant in investigational clinical or device trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Unwilling or unable to give informed consent or inaccessible for follow-up. Specify if&#xD;
             implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) was not accepted by the patient to be implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Psychological problem that might limit compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Active abuse of alcohol or other substance which may be causative of AF and/or might&#xD;
             affect compliance.&#xD;
