      The purpose of this 12 week feasibility study is to see how much more accurate a continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitor (CGM) might be in individuals with type 1 diabetes if the investigators&#xD;
      personalize sensor calibrations to the user, based on previous wear.&#xD;

      The purpose of this 12 week study is to see how much more accurate a continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitor (CGM) might be if we personalize the sensor calibration algorithm for each&#xD;
      individual. The calibration algorithm is a mathematical calculation built into the CGM.&#xD;
      Currently, the CGM asks for a regular blood test (finger stick) measurement twice a day in&#xD;
      order to make its calibration algorithm more accurate. Our goal is to keep refining the&#xD;
      calculating ability so that it will provide personalized blood sugar control throughout the&#xD;
      day for each individual using the sensor with the CGM.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is based on the investigator's judgment; C peptide&#xD;
             level and antibody determinations are not needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Actively using an insulin pump (CSII therapy) for the last 6 months, and will continue&#xD;
             to use an insulin pump throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 to 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For females, not currently known to be pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HbA1c &lt; 9.5%, as measured with DCA2000 or equivalent device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to perform the calibration of the study CGMs using a finger stick only and&#xD;
             willing to follow instructions for CGM wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to and agrees to avoid the following medication starting 24 hours before sensor&#xD;
             wear through completion of the study: acetaminophen, prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An understanding of and willingness to follow the protocol and sign the informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (as determined by a positive blood pregnancy test performed in females of&#xD;
             childbearing capacity during screening visit and before phase II) or nursing mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetic ketoacidosis in the past 6 months prior to enrollment requiring emergency&#xD;
             room visit or hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe hypoglycemia resulting in seizure or loss of consciousness in the 6 months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current treatment for a seizure disorder: Subjects with a history of seizures may be&#xD;
             included in the study if they receive written clearance from their neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A known medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator might interfere&#xD;
             with the completion of the protocol such as cognitive deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate&#xD;

             modified or more data is needed to update the calibration algorithm, subjects will be&#xD;
             allowed to re-consent for additional studies at the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
             Similarly, if there is missing data from the data collection due to device failure,&#xD;
             transmission errors or other problems, the subject will be allowed to extend the time&#xD;
