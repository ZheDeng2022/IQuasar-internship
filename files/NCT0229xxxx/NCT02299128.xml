    <textblock>
      Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) on physical therapist treatment for dizziness after&#xD;
      sports-related concussion. The specific research question for this pilot RCT is: What is the&#xD;
      feasibility of conducting a RCT on athletes who have dizziness 10 or greater days after a&#xD;
      sports-related concussion to explore the effectiveness of directed vestibular rehabilitation,&#xD;
      neuromotor retraining, and/or manual physical therapy (PT) when compared to sham treatment?&#xD;
      The findings of this study (for both feasibility and effect size) will be used to inform and&#xD;
      direct revisions to the methods for a larger RCT on this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Assess the feasibility of the following: recruitment and retention of&#xD;
      participants, required resources for project management, and assessment of patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Estimate the size of the effect between skilled physical therapist&#xD;
      intervention and a sham treatment for the recovery rate for athletes with a concussion who&#xD;
      have dizziness 10 - 14 days post-concussion.&#xD;

      Study design: This study will be a pilot feasibility study of a RCT, randomized at the&#xD;
      individual level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population of interest includes athletes who are seen by the physicians from a Sports&#xD;
      Medicine Center (on site at Akron Children's Hospital (ACH) or at proxy locations, e.g. Walsh&#xD;
      University or North Canton Children's Hospital Clinic) with a sports-related concussion. The&#xD;
      specific population of interest is concussed patients who present for a medical assessment&#xD;
      with dizziness as measured by the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Sampling: Because this is a pilot study exploring the feasibility of the&#xD;
      recruitment, retention and methods for a larger RCT, the sample is not intended to power a&#xD;
      full scale study. It is standard for a pilot study to include at least 12 participants per&#xD;
      arm of the study, however, because of the potential for loss to follow up the investigators&#xD;
      plan to enroll 20 subjects per treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Subject Selection and Definitions: All patients who present to a Sports Medicine Center&#xD;
      after an acute concussion (defined as any time between the event causing the concussion and&#xD;
      up to 14 days after concussion) will complete the PCS. Within this 22 item scale, 7 items&#xD;
      specify physical symptoms as components of the migraine cluster. These symptoms include:&#xD;
      headaches, visual problems, dizziness, noise-light sensitivity, nausea/vomiting, balance&#xD;
      problems, numbness/tingling. Although dizziness is the primary patient complaint being&#xD;
      targeted, these other symptoms within the migraine cluster may also be present in addition to&#xD;
      dizziness and may implicate a cervical, proprioceptive, and/or vestibular injury. For this&#xD;
      reason, patients who report symptoms in the migraine cluster with one of the following&#xD;
      criteria will be asked to enroll in the study at the initial assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An initial score of at least 3 on the 7 point Likert scale for dizziness as a singular&#xD;
           symptom OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A score of 10 across the 7 items within the migraine cluster including a complaint of&#xD;
           dizziness with at a score of at least 1 on the 7 point Likert scale OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If findings from the objective assessment conducted by the physician indicate that&#xD;
           postural/vestibular/ocular perception is abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Allocation: At day10 after concussion, patients who enrolled in the study at their&#xD;
      initial medical visit will be contacted by e-mail through Qualtrics and will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the PCS a second time (if the patient sees the medical provider from Sports Medicine&#xD;
      between day 10 and day 14, this will done on that same day). If at day 10 - 14 after the&#xD;
      concussion was sustained, the patient continues to report dizziness with a score of at least&#xD;
      3 or a total score in the migraine cluster of at least 10 (including a score of at least 1&#xD;
      for dizziness) he/she will be randomized into one of the treatment groups using a random&#xD;
      allocation sequence generator. If the patient does not meet the threshold of symptoms at day&#xD;
      10 - 14, they will receive standard medical care from the Sports Medicine physicians but will&#xD;
      not be randomized into one of the PT treatment arms. One study investigator will be&#xD;
      responsible for assignment into the treatment groups using a 1:1 allocation ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: This study will be conducted as a double-blind trial whereby the physicians in the&#xD;
      sports-medicine center, the patient participants, and their families will be blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment allocation (sham or skilled) of patients throughout the study time. Blinding here&#xD;
      is important to limit study bias because the physicians will determine one key outcome, the&#xD;
      timeframe for return to play, and the athletes will report on the second key outcome, symptom&#xD;
      severity on the PCS. The PTs performing the assessment and treatments will not be blinded to&#xD;
      the allocation of the patients as they will be delivering the intervention. The same&#xD;
      therapists will deliver both treatments (sham and skilled) based on allocation. Because the&#xD;
      PTs cannot be blinded to the allocation of treatment, they will not determine the timeframe&#xD;
      for return to play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up: All patients allocated into one of the treatment arms will be followed for&#xD;
      4 consecutive weeks or until they are released for return to play by the sports medicine&#xD;
      physician. All patients will continue to be followed by physicians in the sports medicine&#xD;
      practice (as that is the standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient safety: Because this study is challenging the rest paradigm and using a progressive&#xD;
      and active treatment to manage acute dizziness, it is not without risk. Patients will be&#xD;
      carefully monitored during each visit to determine their response to treatment. Since the&#xD;
      sham treatment incorporates no actual therapeutic activities, an exacerbation in symptoms is&#xD;
      not expected. The skilled treatment group is pragmatic, allowing the treating therapists to&#xD;
      determine the type and aggressiveness of each treatment session. This gives therapists the&#xD;
      ability to modify the activity using their expert clinical judgment. For all subjects in the&#xD;
      study, patient response between PT sessions will be monitored at the beginning of each PT&#xD;
      treatment. If patient symptoms increase between therapy sessions, greater than the standard&#xD;
      error of measure 6.3 points, treatment will be ceased and patients will be referred back to&#xD;
      Sports Medicine for follow up. All adverse events will be recorded.&#xD;
