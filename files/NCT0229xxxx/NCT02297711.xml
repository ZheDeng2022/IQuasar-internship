    <textblock>
      Sportsman's hernia is defined as a weakness or disruption of the posterior wall of the&#xD;
      inguinal canal. Open hernia repair with or without mesh or laparoscopic techniques with mesh&#xD;
      have been advocated in the treatment of sportsman's hernia and associated athletic pubalgia.&#xD;
      The results of the operative treatment from single centers are reported to be good to&#xD;
      excellent in between 70 - 90% of patients with the most promising results reported using an&#xD;
      open minimal repair (OMR) technique. There are no randomized trials comparing open versus&#xD;
      laparoscopic techniques regarding time for recovery and relief of pain. The aim of this&#xD;
      randomized study is to compare the effectiveness of OMR technique in local or spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia to endoscopic Total ExtraPeritoneal (TEP) technique in general anesthesia for the&#xD;
      treatment of Sportsman´s hernia/athletic pubalgia. The primary endpoint is patient being free&#xD;
      from intractable groin pain during sports activity or daily work four weeks after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of chronic groin pain in athletes and physically active adults is between 5&#xD;
      and 10 % (1-3). The groin area is vulnerable in contact sports such as soccer, ice hockey,&#xD;
      and rugby that require sudden muscle contraction around the hip and lower abdomen, repetitive&#xD;
      kicking and side-to-side motion. Common causes for chronic groin pain in such sports include&#xD;
      adductor tendonitis, musculus rectus abdominis tendopathy, osteitis pubis (edema on MRI scans&#xD;
      at pubic symphysis) or disruption of the posterior wall of inguinal canal, which are all&#xD;
      referred to as athletic pubalgia (1-3). No exact pathophysiological mechanism for pain has so&#xD;
      far been identified in sportsman's hernia (posterior inguinal wall deficiency). A tear of the&#xD;
      abdominal wall in posterior inguinal canal or conjoined tendon (tendinopathy), with or&#xD;
      without bulging of a hernia, is suggested to be typical for a sportsman's hernia (4-6). The&#xD;
      tissue damage is similar as in an incipient direct inguinal hernia with or without bulge.&#xD;
      Diagnosis of a sportsman's hernia can only be set in patients having a typical history and&#xD;
      having a suspected posterior inguinal wall deficiency on careful clinical examination.&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed to exclude other injuries in the groin&#xD;
      area. Sometimes also ultrasonography (US) would be added in the diagnostic work-up. Although&#xD;
      presenting with similarly symptoms, the clinical entity of ''sportsman's hernia'' is&#xD;
      exclusively distinct from athletic pubalgia (7), which includes a more wide range of groin&#xD;
      injuries, such as adductor tendonitis and/or inflammation of the pubic symphysis (8,9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of chronic groin pain is aimed toward its specific pathology (1-3). The first line&#xD;
      of management includes rest, muscle strengthening and stretching exercises, physiotherapy,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory analgesics, as well as local anesthetic and/or corticosteroid injections.&#xD;
      In resistant cases, operative treatment might be considered. Various operative approaches in&#xD;
      athlete's pubalgia have been proposed depending on the suspected nature of injury. These&#xD;
      operative approaches include open (5,10) and laparoscopic methods of hernia repair (11-12),&#xD;
      tenotomies of muscle tendons close to the pubic bone (13,14), as well as release or&#xD;
      neurectomies of nearby nerves (6-7). The results of operative treatment are good to excellent&#xD;
      in 70 to 90% of patients (1-3). There is no evidence-based consensus available to guide&#xD;
      surgeons for choosing between various operative treatments of sportsman's hernia/athletic&#xD;
      pubalgia (1). Both conventional open and laparoscopic repairs produce good results, although&#xD;
      the latter may allow the patient to an earlier return to full sports activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open minimal repair (OMR) technique in local or spinal anesthesia seems to be a promising&#xD;
      surgical approach in the treatment of posterior inguinal wall deficiency (10). Recent&#xD;
      one-center analysis of this technique reported full freedom of pain in 91% four weeks after&#xD;
      operation, full recovery to sports after 2 weeks and good patient's satisfaction in 100%. The&#xD;
      laparoscopic techniques are reported to give an excellent outcome in 80-90% of patients.&#xD;
      These methods are more expensive and need to be performed under general anesthesia. The&#xD;
      studies are also heterogeneous concerning the use of different types of mesh and fixation&#xD;
      techniques (11-12). Comparative studies between the OMR technique and laparoscopic treatment&#xD;
      of sportsman's hernia/athletic pubalgia are lacking. The OMR technique is developed solely to&#xD;
      strengthen the posterior inguinal wall weakness using non-absorbable sutures, but&#xD;
      theoretically the TEP technique may heal a wider area in groin utilizing a 10x15 cm mesh&#xD;
      placed in the preperitoneal space behind the pubic symphysis and posterior inguinal canal&#xD;
      (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized study is to compare the effectiveness of OMR technique in local or&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia to TEP technique in general anesthesia for treatment of Sportsman´s&#xD;
      hernia/athletic pubalgia with the primary endpoint; patients being totally free from groin&#xD;
      pain during sports activity four weeks after surgery.&#xD;

    <description>This is a keyhole operation which will use one small incision at the 'belly button' followed by two small incisions of approximately 5mm in diameter below the 'belly button' . A lightweight mesh is then placed over the inguinal ligament to reinforce the weakness. This approach is keyhole in nature with visualisation of the inguinal canal from behind - posteriorly.</description>

    <description>This is best described as open minimal repair and involves a small incision into the groin of the affected side. Once the inguinal canal is exposed the back wall is repaired using a simple suture to reinforce the weakness. This approach is open surgery in nature with visualisation of the inguinal canal from in front - anteriorly.</description>
