    <textblock>
      To assess the early histological outcomes of tissue ablation, adverse events and&#xD;
      genitourinary side-effect profile of focal radiofrequency ablation using a coiled bipolar&#xD;
      device to treat localized prostate cancer in men with clinically significant prostate cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess the ability of focal therapy using coiled bipolar radiofrequency&#xD;
      device to ablate a pre-defined target tissue zone as well as assess side-effects. The medical&#xD;
      device has a coiled configuration and creates thus a &quot;Faraday cage&quot; effect, preventing&#xD;
      surrounding tissue damage and the bipolar configuration produces complete tissue thermo&#xD;
      coagulation within the limits the coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereof it is proposed to conduct a prospective development study, offering focal therapy&#xD;
      coiled bipolar radiofrequency ablation to men with histologically proven localized prostate&#xD;
      cancer which is clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Localization and characterization of the disease will be established using multi-parametric&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) and transperineal prostate biopsies. Magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (MR)-visible, clinically significant disease will be targeted and focally treated with a&#xD;
      margin of normal tissue as big as anatomically possible to obtain an adequate margin of&#xD;
      normal tissue around the lesion for effective ablation. Secondary lesions meeting criteria&#xD;
      for clinical insignificance will be left untreated and undergo surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative and all post operative imaging will be performed using a scanner and a pelvic&#xD;
      phased array receiver, with a pelvic coil. A full protocol of T1 and T2 weighted turbo-spin&#xD;
      echo images and a dynamic post gadolinium volume acquisition will be used for both&#xD;
      pre-operative diagnostic and planning scans and post-operative assessment by use of the&#xD;
      medical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial transperineal biopsy will already have been performed, prior to invitation to&#xD;
      participate in the study, and demonstrating eligibility for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process will involve targeted or mapping biopsies which are concordant with the lesion&#xD;
      seen on MRI. In both cases, transperineal biopsies will be taken from the prostate using a&#xD;
      brachytherapy grid placed over the perineal skin whilst the man is in the lithotomy position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be given as much time as they need to consider whether or not patients wish to&#xD;
      participate. The ones who wish to participate after reading the patient information sheet&#xD;
      will undergo a screening visit (first visit) to ascertain whether or not they are eligible&#xD;
      for the trial. If so, they will proceed to focal radiofrequency ablation using a coiled&#xD;
      bipolar device(second visit), and will be seen at further follow-up visits.&#xD;
