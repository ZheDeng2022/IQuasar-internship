      Hypoglycaemia is the most common acute complication of diabetes and can limit therapeutic&#xD;
      efforts to improve glycaemic control. It is a potential side effect of drugs used to treat&#xD;
      diabetes, particularly with the use of sulfonylurea (SU) treatment. It has been demonstrated&#xD;
      that hypoglycaemia causes the prolongation of corrected QT (QTc) interval, which is&#xD;
      associated with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Hypoglycaemia in T2DM has recently&#xD;
      come into focus with the results of the ACCORD, ADVANCE and VADT trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to examine the association of hypoglycaemia and glucose&#xD;
      fluctuations on QT-interval and QT variability in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with&#xD;
      SU. Patients will be studied using simultaneous Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) and&#xD;
      ambulatory ECG monitoring (Holter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be recruited from the Diabetes Centre, RPAH or from specialist&#xD;
      consulting rooms. They will be required to attend the Diabetes Centre on two occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, blood will be collected and CGM and Holter monitoring commenced. At Visit&#xD;
      2, i.e. two days later, the patient will return to the Diabetes Centre to have the equipment&#xD;
      removed. The data obtained from the CGM and Holter monitor will then be downloaded for review&#xD;
      and analysis.&#xD;

      Background/Scientific Basis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemia is the most common acute complication of diabetes and can limit therapeutic&#xD;
      efforts to improve glycaemic control. It is a potential side effect of the drugs used to&#xD;
      treat diabetes, particularly with the use of exogenous insulin or insulin secretagogues, such&#xD;
      as sulfonylurea (SU) treatment. As many people are prescribed these agents, hypoglycaemia is&#xD;
      frequent in clinical practice, particularly as treatment targets have become more stringent.&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated that insulin-induced hypoglycaemia causes prolongation of&#xD;
      corrected QT (QTc) interal (Chugh et al), which is associated with ventricular arrhythmias&#xD;
      and sudden death, perhaps as a result of hypokalaemia and an increase in serum&#xD;
      catecholamines. Cardiac effects of hypoglycaemia are usually associated with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      and insulin therapy. Hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) on oral agents has not, until&#xD;
      recently, been considered to be as serious. Recently, hypoglycaemia in T2Dm has come in into&#xD;
      focus since the salutary results of the ACCORD, ADVANCE and VADT trails, each of which&#xD;
      implicated hypoglycaemia as a cause for increased death. The majority of excess deaths in the&#xD;
      intensive treatment group of ACCORD were classified as sudden cardiac death. There is now a&#xD;
      growing body of evidence that hypoglycaemia is a pro-arrhythmic event via QT prolongation and&#xD;
      particularly in the context of myocardial ischemia which reduces the tolerance of myocardial&#xD;
      tissue for the further pro-arrhythmic action of hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is notable that hypoglycaemia occurs commonly in those using SU. For example in the UK&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemia Study (UK Hypoglycaemia Study Group) , 7% of individuals treated with SUs had&#xD;
      at least one episode of severe (requiring external assistance) hypoglycaemia and the&#xD;
      proportion reporting at least one mild (symptomatic, self-treated) episode was 39%, a rate&#xD;
      comparable to insulin treatment. Furthermore, the SU receptor functions as the regulatory&#xD;
      subunit of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel. KATP channels&#xD;
      are widely expressed in the heart and vascular smooth muscle cells. There have been long-held&#xD;
      concerns that SU effects on these channels may affect ischaemic preconditioning (Cleveland et&#xD;
      al), a protective mechanism in the myocardium. This may represent an additive deleterious&#xD;
      impact specific to SUs in a hypoglycaemic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these theoretical concerns associated with SU treatment the pro-arrhythmic effects of&#xD;
      SU induced hypoglycaemia have not previously been easy to study in ambulatory patients. Now&#xD;
      the dual ambulatory technologies of CGMS (Maia et al) and ambulatory ECG (Holter) monitoring&#xD;
      provide an opportunity to examine this potential association under real life conditions. Even&#xD;
      in the absence of absolute QT prolongation, there is evidence that beat-to-beat QT&#xD;
      variability is also a risk marker for sudden death and ventricular arrhythmia (Piccirillo et&#xD;
      al). Additionally, glucose variability may also have an impact on cardiac tissue. Habituation&#xD;
      to chronic hyperglycaemia could lead to a situation where a sudden decrease to plasma glucose&#xD;
      leads to changes in QT interval, even when the glucose falls within the normal range&#xD;
      (&quot;relative hypoglycaemia&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study in our institution of 14 individuals on insulin (3 with T1DM and 11 with T2DM)&#xD;
      showed statistically significant prolongation of QTc during periods of hypoglycaemia. The&#xD;
      mean difference in QTc during hypos was 7.8ms (p&lt;0.05). An inverse relationship between the&#xD;
      magnitude of increase in QTs during hypoglycaemia and baseline QTc was found. The limitations&#xD;
      of the pilot study are that it was restricted to those subjects treated with insulin and that&#xD;
      relative hypoglycaemia and QT variability were not analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sulfonylurea induced hypoglycaemia and/or fluctuations in glucose are pro-arrhythmic by&#xD;
      prolonging the QTc interval and/or increasing beat-to-beat QTc variability. It is expected&#xD;
      that the QT interval will be significantly longer during the hypoglycemic periods compared to&#xD;
      the non-hypoglycemic periods in patients in T2DM treated with SU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the association of hypoglycaemia and glucose fluctuations on QT-interval and QT&#xD;
      variability in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with SU. Patients will be studied using&#xD;
      simultaneous Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) and ambulatory ECG monitoring (Holter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information gained from this study has the potential to improve our understanding of the&#xD;
      relationship between hypoglycaemia and cardiac arrhythmia in patients with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with type 2 diabetes attending the Diabetes Centre, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital who&#xD;
      fulfils the entry criteria will be approached to participate in this study. They will be&#xD;
      approached either when they attend the Diabetes Centre for treatment, or by means of a&#xD;
      telephone call. The requirements of the study will be discussed with each potential&#xD;
      participant and they will be given a copy of the Participant Information Sheet and Consent&#xD;
      Form to take home and read. The proposed number of participants for this study is&#xD;
      approximately 30 individuals.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the Corrected QT-interval During Nocturnal Hypoglycemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Nocturnal time period (2300-0700) during the 48 hours of Holter monitoring</time_frame>
    <description>The nocturnal time period for the study spanned from 11 pm in the evening until 7 am the following morning on two consecutive days. The change in the corrected QT interval during nocturnal hypoglycemia was determined by calculating the difference between the average QTc interval length during periods of hypoglycemia (blood glucose level &lt;3.5 mmol/L) and the average QTc interval length during periods of normoglycemia (blood glucose level &gt;3.5 mmol/L) for the nocturnal time period. The average QTc interval was calculated using an individually optimised correction formula. If the result of average QTc (hypoglycemia) - average QTc (normoglycemia) was positive, the participant experienced QTc prolongation during hypoglycemia. If the result of average QTc (hypoglycemia) - average QTc (normoglycemia) was negative, the participant experienced QTc shortening during hypoglycemia.</description>

        <title>Change in the Corrected QT-interval During Nocturnal Hypoglycemia</title>
        <description>The nocturnal time period for the study spanned from 11 pm in the evening until 7 am the following morning on two consecutive days. The change in the corrected QT interval during nocturnal hypoglycemia was determined by calculating the difference between the average QTc interval length during periods of hypoglycemia (blood glucose level &lt;3.5 mmol/L) and the average QTc interval length during periods of normoglycemia (blood glucose level &gt;3.5 mmol/L) for the nocturnal time period. The average QTc interval was calculated using an individually optimised correction formula. If the result of average QTc (hypoglycemia) - average QTc (normoglycemia) was positive, the participant experienced QTc prolongation during hypoglycemia. If the result of average QTc (hypoglycemia) - average QTc (normoglycemia) was negative, the participant experienced QTc shortening during hypoglycemia.</description>
