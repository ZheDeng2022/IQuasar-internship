  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, single dose study to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of GX-E2 in healthy male subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      GX-E2 when given as single dose (GX-E2 8 ug/kg) to healthy male subjects. Additionally,&#xD;
      Immunogenecity will be evaluated to investigate antibody production.&#xD;
