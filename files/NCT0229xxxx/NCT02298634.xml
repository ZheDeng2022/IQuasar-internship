      Farber disease (FD), also known as Farber's lipogranulomatosis, is an autosomal recessive&#xD;
      lysosomal storage disease marked by a deficiency in enzyme ceramidase which causes a&#xD;
      progressive accumulation of fatty material lipids leading to abnormalities in the joints,&#xD;
      liver, throat, tissues and central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FD is an extremely rare disorder, with a prevalence of less than 1/1000000. Currently only&#xD;
      about 80 cases are reported worldwide. Disease onset is typically in early infancy but may&#xD;
      occur later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FD is caused by a mutation in the ASAH1 gene, situated on the short arm of chromosome 8. This&#xD;
      gene codes for acid ceramidase, a lysosomal heterodimeric enzyme that hydrolyzes ceramide&#xD;
      into sphingosine and fatty acid. To date, less than 25 distinct mutations have been&#xD;
      identified in Farber patients, but no large deletions have yet been reported. It is inherited&#xD;
      with an autosomal recessive pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical presentation of FD is characterized by the appearance of subcutaneous skin&#xD;
      nodules, ordinarily near the joints, most often interphalangeal, wrist, elbow and ankle&#xD;
      joints, or over points of mechanical pressure. These manifestations are very painful and lead&#xD;
      to progressive joint stiffness, limitation of motion by contractures and finally to&#xD;
      immobilization and deformation of joints. Also, a characteristic sign of FD is the&#xD;
      development of a progressive hoarseness due to laryngeal involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside these major manifestations seven phenotypes have been described which differ in&#xD;
      severity and additional organ involvement, like the lungs, nervous system, heart and lymph&#xD;
      nodes. Dependent on residual lysosomal ceramidase turnover, patients have a variable degree&#xD;
      of central nervous system disease, leading to progressive neurologic deterioration. In most&#xD;
      cases the neuronal dysfunction rather than the general physical dystrophy seems to limit the&#xD;
      duration of FD. As well, patients with FD may die due to pulmonary disease with interstitial&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First symptoms usually appear between the newborn period and the first birthday. Milder forms&#xD;
      of type 3 were described with onset at 20 months of age. Clinical manifestation in type 5 of&#xD;
      FD, dominated by neurologic deterioration, begins at 1 to 2 1/2 years of life. Patients&#xD;
      mainly die within the first years of life, but prolonged courses in patients without severe&#xD;
      nervous disease may also be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 1 is the most common or classical form of this condition and is associated with the&#xD;
      classic signs of voice, skin, and joint problems that begin a few months after birth.&#xD;
      Developmental delay and lung disease also commonly occur. Infants born with type 1 FD usually&#xD;
      survive only into early childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types 2 and 3 generally have less severe signs and symptoms than the other types. Affected&#xD;
      individuals have the three classic signs and usually do not have developmental delay.&#xD;
      Children with these types of FD typically live into mid- to late childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types 4 and 5 are associated with severe neurological problems. Type 4 usually causes&#xD;
      life-threatening health problems beginning in infancy due to massive lipid deposits in the&#xD;
      liver, spleen, lungs, and immune system tissues. Children with this type typically do not&#xD;
      survive past their first year of life. Type 5 is characterized by progressive decline in&#xD;
      brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) function, which causes paralysis of the arms&#xD;
      and legs (quadriplegia), seizures, loss of speech, involuntary muscle jerks (myoclonus), and&#xD;
      developmental delay. Children with type 5 FD survive into early childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types 6 and 7 are very rare, and affected individuals have other associated disorders in&#xD;
      addition to FD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic&#xD;
      alterations in the blood of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future the disease&#xD;
      earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from&#xD;
      the blood of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose and&#xD;
      thereby with an earlier treatment.&#xD;

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectometry, a blood&#xD;
      sample will be taken via using a dry blood spot filter card. To proof the correct Farber&#xD;
      diagnosis in those patients where up to the enrolment in the study no genetic testing has&#xD;
      been done, sequencing of Farber will be done.&#xD;
