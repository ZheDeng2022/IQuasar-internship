  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess whether a 5 week intake of a probiotic (Lpc-37) can&#xD;
      modulate stress and anxiety experienced by healthy subjects during and after an acute&#xD;
      stressor compared to placebo. To measure stress and anxiety, markers of the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and questionnaires will be assessed&#xD;
      before, during and after the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). The results of this study&#xD;
      indicate if the chosen study design is suitable to discover stress-related effects of&#xD;
      probiotics.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total mass of microorganisms residing within the human intestine is approximately the&#xD;
      same as that of the human brain. Of late, these &gt;1000 species and &gt;7000 strains have been&#xD;
      described as the &quot;brain in our belly&quot; because of the essential role they play in&#xD;
      physiological and psychological health and disease. The gut-brain axis describes the&#xD;
      bidirectional communication that exists between the brain and the gut and the&#xD;
      microbiota-gut-brain axis supports the role of the gut microbiome in this communication&#xD;
      system. Emotional and routine daily life stress can disrupt digestive function, but&#xD;
      increasing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota exert a profound influence on brain&#xD;
      physiology, psychological responses and ultimately behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A plethora of literature to date, albeit predominantly preclinical, have demonstrated&#xD;
      evidence to support the role of the gut microbiome in regulating stress-related changes in&#xD;
      physiology, behavior and brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress is an individual process to deal with external and internal challenges that ranges&#xD;
      from behavioral to molecular adaptations. The HPA axis and its release of stress hormones&#xD;
      plays a major role in stress adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether a single strain of bacteria&#xD;
      derived from the species Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Lpc-37 (Lpc-37), formerly Lactobacillus&#xD;
      paracasei Lpc-37, can modulate stress experienced by healthy subjects exposed to the TSST&#xD;
      measured by HPA axis activation markers and self-report questionnaires.&#xD;

The CAR is summarized in the variables AUCg, AUCi, mean increase and peak value. These cortisol indices are frequently used to describe hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and represent information either of the total cortisol production or of the change in cortisol levels. AUCg is the total area under the curve of all measurements (i.e., the intensity or magnitude of the response).&#xD;
Efficacy for the CAR variables AUCg is defined in terms of a normalization: Number of participants with normal values (between first and third quantile of reference measures) and numbers of participants with low or high values are compared before treatment and after treatment. More participants in the normal range after treatment is defined as efficacy.</description>

The CAR is summarized in the variables AUCg, AUCi, mean increase and peak value. These cortisol indices are frequently used to describe hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and represent information either of the total cortisol production or of the change in cortisol levels. AUCi is calculated with reference to the baseline measurement and it ignores the distance from zero for all measurements and emphasizes the changes over time. Efficacy for the CAR variables AUCi is defined in terms of a normalization: Number of participants with normal values (between first and third quantile of reference measures) and numbers of participants with low or high values are compared before treatment and after treatment. More participants in the normal range after treatment is defined as efficacy.</description>

        <description>Efficacy of the intake of Lpc-37 on the reduction of Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) depression scores compared to placebo.&#xD;
Measured with the german version of the DASS as a 42-item self report instrument designed to measure negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress during the past week. The DASS includes three scales (depression, anxiety and stress) of which each scale includes 14 items that are divided into subscales of 2-5 items of similar content.&#xD;
Items are answered on a four point rating scale ranging from 0 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 3 = &quot;very much&quot;. Scores of each scale are calculated by summing the scores for the relevant items.&#xD;
The Depression scale assesses dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest/involvement, anhedonia, and inertia. The items are 3, 5, 10, 13, 16, 17, 21, 24, 26, 31, 34, 37, 38, 42 and individual scores can range from 0 to 42 with higher scores indicating greater severity of the symptoms.</description>

        <title>Changes in Pre and Post Treatment DASS Stress Scores</title>
        <description>Efficacy of the intake of Lpc-37 on the reduction of Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) stress scores compared to placebo.&#xD;
Measured with the german version of the DASS as a 42-item self report instrument designed to measure negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress during the past week. The DASS includes three scales (depression, anxiety and stress) of which each scale includes 14 items that are divided into subscales of 2-5 items of similar content.&#xD;
Items are answered on a four point rating scale ranging from 0 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 3 = &quot;very much&quot;. Scores of each scale are calculated by summing the scores for the relevant items.&#xD;
The stress scale (items) is sensitive to levels of chronic non-specific arousal.The stress scale items are 1, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 18, 22, 27, 29, 32, 33, 35, 39 and individual scores can range from 0 to 42 with higher scores indicating greater severity of the symptoms.</description>

        <title>Changes in Pre and Post Treatment VAS Insecurity Scores</title>
        <description>Efficacy of the intake of Lpc-37 on the reduction of VAS insecurity scores compared to placebo.&#xD;
Measured with a german version of the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) as a 10cm bipolar scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;highly&quot;. The participant indicated his/her actual perception by placing a mark on a line. VAS scores were obtained by using a ruler and measuring the position of the participants's mark with millimeter precision. To control for possible variations due to printing, the total length of the line was also measured and percentage scores for each participant were computed. Percentage scores range from 0-100. Higher scores indicating greater insecurity.</description>
        <time_frame>Before and after 5 weeks of study product intake.</time_frame>
        <population>PerProtocol population included all randomized participants that satisfied inclusion/exclusion criteria and had no major protocol deviations (total 113; Lpc-37 n=55; placebo n=58). For individual endpoints, participants were excluded if they showed deviations that were considered to possibly affect the endpoint in question (number analyzed varies).</population>

          <description>Efficacy of the intake of Lpc-37 on reduction of the increase of STAI-State scores in response to the TSST compared to placebo.&#xD;
Measured with the german version of the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory, scale anxiety as a temporary emotional state (STAI-X1). Answers are given on a four-point rating scale ranging from 1=&quot;not at all&quot; to 4=&quot;very true&quot;. The score range is 20-80; Higher scores indicate more anxiety.</description>

Measured with a german version of the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) as a 10cm bipolar scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;highly&quot;. The participant indicated his/her actual perception by placing a mark on a line. VAS scores were obtained by using a ruler and measuring the position of the participants's mark with millimeter precision. To control for possible variations due to printing, the total length of the line was also measured and percentage scores for each participant were computed. Percentage scores range from 0-100. Higher scores indicating higher perceived stress.</description>

        <title>Change of VAS Insecurity Scores in Response to the TSST</title>
        <description>Efficacy of the intake of Lpc-37 on reduction of the increase of VAS insecurity scores in response to the TSST compared to placebo.&#xD;
Measured with a german version of the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) as a 10cm bipolar scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;highly&quot;. The participant indicated his/her actual perception by placing a mark on a line. VAS scores were obtained by using a ruler and measuring the position of the participants's mark with millimeter precision. To control for possible variations due to printing, the total length of the line was also measured and percentage scores for each participant were computed. Percentage scores range from 0-100. Higher scores indicating greater insecurity.</description>

        <description>Efficacy of the intake of Lpc-37 on the decrease of sleep disruptions over the course of the treatment measured with a daily online diary (Proportion (yes/total)).&#xD;
Sleep disruptions were monitored through the wash-out phase and the subsequent treatment phase for each week. In the binary version, the value is either Yes or No for each day and each participant.&#xD;
Efficacy is defined as a decrease, or (in case of a general increase) reduced increase for the active treatment group as compared to the placebo group and operationalized as the interaction between time and treatment group. Time is coded as a continuous variable with one value for each day and participant.&#xD;
The proportion of participants with at least one sleep disruption by treatment group is given, treatment commenced after week 2. Data listed here reflect the proportion of participants who answered &quot;Yes&quot; (e.g. 0,477 * 44 = 20.99 participants answered with &quot;Yes&quot; in week 1 in the Lpc-37 group).</description>

        <population>PerProtocol population included all randomized participants that satisfied inclusion/exclusion criteria and had no major protocol deviations (total 113; Lpc-37 n=55; placebo n=58). For individual endpoints, participants were excluded if they showed deviations that were considered to possibly affect the endpoint in question (number analyzed varies and is listet for each endpoint).</population>

        <description>Efficacy of the intake of Lpc-37 on the decrease of reported number of sleep disruptions over the course of the treatment measured with a daily online diary (mean of week summary).&#xD;
Sleep disruptions were monitored through the wash-out phase (Week 1 and 2) and the subsequent treatment phase (Weeks 3-7). In the count version, the value can be 0 or a natural number for each day and each participant. Efficacy is defined as a decrease, or (in case of a general increase) reduced increase for the active treatment group as compared to the placebo group and operationalized as the interaction between time and treatment group. Time is coded as a continuous variable with one value for each day and participant.

        <description>Efficacy of the intake of Lpc-37 on the increase of perceived health status scores over the course of the treatment.&#xD;
Measured with a daily online diary. Health status was rated by participants on an 11-point scale (0-10; &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very&quot;) and monitored through the wash-out phase (week 1 and 2) and the subsequent treatment phase (weeks 3-7). Higher scores indicate a high perceived health.Efficacy is defined as an increase, or (in case of a general decrease) reduced decrease for the active treatment group as compared to the placebo group and operationalized as the interaction between time and treatment group. Time is coded as a continuous variable with one value for each day and participant. Values reflect summary measures for perceived health status on a scale from 0 to 10 for the averaged ratings per participant and week.</description>
        <time_frame>Daily for 2 weeks before treatment intake and 5 weeks during treatment intake</time_frame>
        <population>PerProtocol population included all randomized participants that satisfied inclusion/exclusion criteria and had no major protocol deviations (total 113; Lpc-37 n=55; placebo n=58). For individual endpoints, participants were excluded if they showed deviations that were considered to possibly affect the endpoint in question (number analyzed varies).</population>

        <title>The Change of the Difference From Baseline and 5 Weeks of Treatment to the Respective Mean of CAR AUCg Measures</title>
        <description>Efficacy of the intake of Lpc-37 on the reduction of the difference of Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) area under the curve with respect to the ground (AUCg) values to the respective mean before and after 5 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
The CAR is summarized in the variables AUCg, AUCi, mean increase and peak value. These cortisol indices are frequently used to describe hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and represent information either of the total cortisol production or of the change in cortisol levels. AUCg is the total area under the curve of all measurements (i.e., the intensity or magnitude of the response).&#xD;
Efficacy for the CAR variables AUCg is defined in terms of a normalization: Number of participants with normal values (between first and third quantile of reference measures) and numbers of participants with low or high values are compared before treatment and after treatment. More participants in the normal range after treatment is defined as efficacy.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (average of 2 days before first product intake) and end of study (average of 2 days before last product intake)</time_frame>
        <population>PerProtocol population included all randomized participants that satisfied inclusion/exclusion criteria and had no major protocol deviations (total 113; Lpc-37 n=55; placebo n=58). For individual endpoints, participants were excluded if they showed deviations that were considered to possibly affect the endpoint in question (number analyzed varies).</population>

        <description>Efficacy of the intake of Lpc-37 on the reduction of the difference of Cortisol at Awakening values to the respective mean before and after 5 weeks of treatment&#xD;
Efficacy for the CAR variable cortisol at awakening is defined in terms of a normalization: Number of participants with normal values (between first and third quantile of reference measures) and numbers of participants with low or high values are compared before treatment and after treatment. More participants in the normal range after treatment is defined as efficacy.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (average of 2 days before first product intake) and end of study (average of 2 days before last product intake)</time_frame>
        <population>PerProtocol population included all randomized participants that satisfied inclusion/exclusion criteria and had no major protocol deviations (total 113; Lpc-37 n=55; placebo n=58). For individual endpoints, participants were excluded if they showed deviations that were considered to possibly affect the endpoint in question (number analyzed varies).</population>
