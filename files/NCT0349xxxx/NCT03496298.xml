      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate that efpeglenatide 4 and 6 mg was noninferior to placebo on 3-point major&#xD;
      adverse cardiac events (MACE) in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) participants at high&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CV) risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate that efpeglenatide 4 and 6 mg was superior to placebo in T2DM participants&#xD;
      with high CV risk on the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3-point MACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expanded CV outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Composite outcome of new or worsening nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and tolerability of efpeglenatide 4 and 6 mg, both added to standard of&#xD;
      care in T2DM participants at high CV risk.&#xD;

    <measure>Time to First Occurrence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE): Event Rate Per 100 Participant-years for First Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular (CV) Event - Non-Inferiority Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 until the date of first adjudicated and confirmed occurrence of major CV event (maximum duration: up to 31.5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>All MACE positively adjudicated by the clinical endpoint committee (CEC) were used in the analysis of the composite outcome of first occurrence to CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke. Kaplan-Meier curves of the cumulative event rate by treatment groups were used to depict the first occurrence of MACE over time. The event rate per 100 participant-years (calculated by 100*number of participants with events/sum of time at risk (days) over all participants/365.25) measured in terms of number of events per 100 participant-years was reported.</description>

    <time_frame>From Day 1 until the date of first adjudicated and confirmed occurrence of major CV event (maximum duration: up to 31.5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>All MACE positively adjudicated by the CEC were used in the analysis of the expanded outcome of first occurrence to CV death (including fatal MI and fatal stroke), non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, coronary revascularization or hospitalization for unstable angina. Kaplan-Meier curves of the cumulative event rate by treatment groups were used to depict the first occurrence of MACE over time. The event rate per 100 participant-years (calculated by 100*number of participants with events/sum of time at risk (days) over all participants/365.25) measured in terms of number of events per 100 participant-years was reported. Data analysis was also performed independently by external steering committee for the publication.</description>

    <measure>Time to First Occurrence of Composite Renal Endpoint: Event Rate Per 100 Participant-years for First Occurrence of Composite Renal Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 until the confirmed occurrence of composite renal endpoint (maximum duration: up to 31.5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Composite renal endpoint included the following: incident macroalbuminuria (defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of greater than (&gt;) 300, as measured in mg of albumin to grams of creatinine, or &gt;33.9, as measured in mg of albumin to millimoles of creatinine), plus an increase in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of at least 30% from baseline, a sustained decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 40% for 30 days or more, renal-replacement therapy for 90 days or more, and a sustained eGFR of less than 15 ml per minute per 1.73 m^2 for 30 days or more. Kaplan-Meier curves of the cumulative event rate by treatment groups were used to depict the first occurrence of renal endpoint over time. The event rate per 100 participant-years (calculated by 100*number of participants with events/sum of time at risk (days) over all participants/365.25) measured in terms of number of events per 100 participant-years was reported.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 344 active sites in 28 countries. Overall, 5732 participants were screened between 27 April 2018 and 25 April 2019; of whom 4076 participants were randomized by interactive response technology (1:1:1 ratio) to receive placebo, efpeglenatide 4 milligrams (mg) or efpeglenatide 6 mg. Screen failures were mainly due to inclusion criteria not met.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization was stratified by the current or potential future use of a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor: current use; potential future use; neither current nor potential future use.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>All MACE positively adjudicated by the CEC were used in the analysis of the expanded outcome of first occurrence to CV death (including fatal MI and fatal stroke), non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, coronary revascularization or hospitalization for unstable angina. Kaplan-Meier curves of the cumulative event rate by treatment groups were used to depict the first occurrence of MACE over time. The event rate per 100 participant-years (calculated by 100*number of participants with events/sum of time at risk (days) over all participants/365.25) measured in terms of number of events per 100 participant-years was reported. Data analysis was also performed independently by external steering committee for the publication.</description>
          <population>Analysis was performed on ITT population. Data for this OM was planned to be collected and analyzed for pooled population of participants who received Efpeglenatide (at any dose: 4 mg and 6 mg) as pre-specified in the protocol.</population>

        <description>Composite renal endpoint included the following: incident macroalbuminuria (defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of greater than (&gt;) 300, as measured in mg of albumin to grams of creatinine, or &gt;33.9, as measured in mg of albumin to millimoles of creatinine), plus an increase in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of at least 30% from baseline, a sustained decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 40% for 30 days or more, renal-replacement therapy for 90 days or more, and a sustained eGFR of less than 15 ml per minute per 1.73 m^2 for 30 days or more.
