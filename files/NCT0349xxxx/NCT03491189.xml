      This study evaluates the rate of cut-out and fixation failures in helical blade fixation&#xD;
      versus lag screw fixation for cephalomedullary nailing of peritrochanteric femur fractures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the population ages, the prevalence of peritrochanteric femur fractures continues to&#xD;
      increase each year. An increase in the use of intramedullary devices as treatment has&#xD;
      accompanied this increase in peritrochanteric femur fractures. Intramedullary devices are now&#xD;
      used more frequently than plate and screw constructs nationwide to treat peritrochanteric&#xD;
      femur fractures1. While the prognosis following intramedullary device placement remains&#xD;
      favorable compared to other treatment options, there are still complications that exist.&#xD;
      Cut-out of the cephalomedullary implant through the femoral head has long been one of the&#xD;
      more prevalent complications when using an intramedullary device.2 To address the&#xD;
      shortcomings that cause lag screw cut-out, the helical blade was designed. In theory, it&#xD;
      provides improved fixation over the lag screw by compacting cancellous bone as it is inserted&#xD;
      and may also be more effective at supporting torsional loading.3 Additionally, the helical&#xD;
      blade has been shown to require less operation time and less fluoroscopy time during&#xD;
      implantation.4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is a lack of a randomized prospective study comparing the rates of cut-out&#xD;
      in lag screw fixation and helical blade fixation of peritrochanteric femur fractures using&#xD;
      third generation cephalomedullary femoral nails. A recent retrospective study by Stern et al&#xD;
      analyzed the rate of cut-out of helical blades and lag screws in peritrochanteric femur&#xD;
      fractures treated with cephalomedullary nails and found that the helical blade was much more&#xD;
      prone to cut-out than the lag screw. Cut-out rates were 15.1% and 3.0% for the implants&#xD;
      respectively.5 While this study seems to suggest that, in terms of cutout, the helical blade&#xD;
      is inferior to the lag screw, there are many factors that limit its validity and&#xD;
      applicability. First, the study was a retrospective study which inherently induces some level&#xD;
      of bias. Next, the study recorded a cut-out rate for the helical blade that is much higher&#xD;
      than and not consistent with studies that have been previously reported. Flores et al&#xD;
      reported a cut-out rate of 3.4% in 258 patients treated with the helical blade, Gardner et al&#xD;
      reported a cut-out rate of 5.15% in 97 patients treated with the helical blade, and Liu et al&#xD;
      reported a cut-out rate of 6.7% in 223 patients treated with the helical blade.6,7,8 These&#xD;
      numbers are all drastically lower than the rates of cut-out reported by Stern et al. Another&#xD;
      limitation to their study was that 26 surgeons operated on the 362 patients that were&#xD;
      included in the study. This large number of surgeons introduced a significant amount of&#xD;
      variability that could not be controlled for. While this study provides some evidence that&#xD;
      the helical blade may be inferior to the lag screw in terms of cut-out, it is not definitive&#xD;
      and a prospective study is needed to truly validate this claim. Additionally, factors such as&#xD;
      tip-apex distance, time to cut-out, direction of cut-out reduction quality, and fracture&#xD;
      pattern must be analyzed to accurately assess the usefulness of the helical blade compared to&#xD;
      the lag screw and determine predictors for cut-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the primary purpose of this study will be to analyze rates of cut-out between the two&#xD;
      fixation devices, we are also interested in determining a threshold tip-apex distance that is&#xD;
      predictive of cut-out. While Stern et al reported data that supported the hypothesis that&#xD;
      increased tip-apex distance is predictive of cut-out, they did not identify a threshold that,&#xD;
      itself, is predictive of cut-out.5 It was previously thought that a tip-apex distance greater&#xD;
      than 25mm is predictive of cut-out.4 Other studies, however, have shown that tip-apex&#xD;
      distances that are too small are also predictive of cutout.8 It will be our goal to measure&#xD;
      tip-apex distance in all patients and attempt to determine if there is a threshold that is&#xD;
      predictive of cut-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another factor of importance that we will investigate is the direction of cut-out of the two&#xD;
      implants. Previous comparisons have found that while the lag screw tends to cutout&#xD;
      superiorly, the helical blade is much more likely to cutout medially.5,8 This is thought to&#xD;
      be due to the compaction of bone that occurs when the helical blade is inserted and also why&#xD;
      there appears to be greater rates of cut-out with smaller tip-apex distances.8 By gaining a&#xD;
      further understanding of the direction that these implants typically fail we hope to have&#xD;
      another predictor of cut-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, it will be our goal to attempt to assess reduction quality and fracture pattern to&#xD;
      determine each factor's predictive value of cut-out. It has already been suggested that&#xD;
      non-anatomical reduction and complex fracture patterns increase the likelihood of cut-out.9&#xD;
