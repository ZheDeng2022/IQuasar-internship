  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a single&#xD;
      6-hour intravenous infusion of AMO-01 to treat adolescents and adults with PMS and co-morbid&#xD;
      epilepsy. Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a&#xD;
      chromosomal deletion or mutation at 22q13.3 that contains the SHANK3/ProSAP2 gene. A key&#xD;
      co-morbidity in PMS is the presence of epilepsy. Currently there are no approved treatments&#xD;
      for PMS. Furthermore, there has been relatively little clinical study of pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions for PMS. AMO-01 may provide benefit to PMS patients exhibiting behavioral&#xD;
      abnormalities and seizures.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject, temporally associated with the use of the experimental medication, whether or not considered related to the medication. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the experimental medication. Adverse events will be monitored throughout all 8 weeks of study participation.</description>

    <measure>Change in CGI - Improvement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Rating Scales are commonly used to measure symptom severity and global improvement in treatment studies of patients with developmental disorders. There Severity Scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of illness at the time of assessment. The Improvement Scale (CGI-I) is a 7-point scale (1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.) that requires the clinician to assess how much the illness has improved or worsened relative to baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician-completed PMS Domain Specific Causes for Concerns Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>9 item visual analogue scale completed by the clinician that scores the severity of concerns in domains that are clinically relevant in PMS. For each subject, the clinician is instructed to identify the top 4 or 5 that are of particular concern and that the clinician would most like to see change during the course of treatment with the study medication. The severity of the clinician's concern in each domain is scored by using a 10 cm visual analogue scale, with anchors of 0 &quot;not at all severe&quot; at the left and 100 &quot;very severe&quot; at the right end.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Top 3 Caregiver Concerns VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Top 3 concerns visual analogue scale allows caregivers to identify their main three causes of concern, related to the subject's PMS. Caregivers will be asked to rate each of the three causes for concern by drawing a vertical mark on a 10 cm long visual analogue scale, with anchors of 0 &quot;not at all severe&quot; at the left end and 100 &quot;very severe&quot; at the right end.</description>

It takes 15-30 minutes to complete. 16 items, Each item is scored as 0 (never a problem), 1 (slight problem), 2 (moderately serious problem), or 3 (severe problem). with total from 0 to 48.</description>

It reports on the severity of repetitive behaviors. each item scored on 4-point scale: 0-Behavior does not occur, 1-Behavior occurs and is a mild problem, 2-Behavior occurs and is a moderate problem, 3-Behavior occurs and is a severe problem. with total score from 0 (mild) to 126 (severe).</description>

&#xD;
          1. Subjects under study must have a diagnosis of Phelan McDermid syndrome (PMS) with&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be post pubertal males or females aged ≥12 years and ≤45 years at&#xD;

        <title>Number of Adverse Events</title>
        <description>An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject, temporally associated with the use of the experimental medication, whether or not considered related to the medication. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the experimental medication. Adverse events will be monitored throughout all 8 weeks of study participation.</description>

        <title>Change in CGI - Improvement Scale</title>
        <description>Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Rating Scales are commonly used to measure symptom severity and global improvement in treatment studies of patients with developmental disorders. There Severity Scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of illness at the time of assessment. The Improvement Scale (CGI-I) is a 7-point scale (1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.) that requires the clinician to assess how much the illness has improved or worsened relative to baseline.</description>

        <description>9 item visual analogue scale completed by the clinician that scores the severity of concerns in domains that are clinically relevant in PMS. For each subject, the clinician is instructed to identify the top 4 or 5 that are of particular concern and that the clinician would most like to see change during the course of treatment with the study medication. The severity of the clinician's concern in each domain is scored by using a 10 cm visual analogue scale, with anchors of 0 &quot;not at all severe&quot; at the left and 100 &quot;very severe&quot; at the right end.</description>

        <title>Top 3 Caregiver Concerns VAS</title>
        <description>The Top 3 concerns visual analogue scale allows caregivers to identify their main three causes of concern, related to the subject's PMS. Caregivers will be asked to rate each of the three causes for concern by drawing a vertical mark on a 10 cm long visual analogue scale, with anchors of 0 &quot;not at all severe&quot; at the left end and 100 &quot;very severe&quot; at the right end.</description>
