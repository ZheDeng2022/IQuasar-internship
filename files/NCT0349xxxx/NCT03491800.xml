  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot study in 30 Heart Failure (HF) patients and&#xD;
      visit companions (i.e., a family member who accompanies the patient to medical visits), to&#xD;
      evaluate a pre- visit question/topic prompt list, designed to enhance patient and family&#xD;
      member engagement during visits by providing a list of questions or topics that they may want&#xD;
      to discuss with their health care provider.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will include 30 HF patients or dyads (i.e., a patient and family&#xD;
      member who accompanies the patient into the examination room at a visit). While our study&#xD;
      primarily will target HF dyads, if the investigators encounter recruitment difficulties,&#xD;
      unaccompanied HF patients (i.e., HF patients who do not have a family member who can&#xD;
      participate in the study with them) will also be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Single group pre-post study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing informed consent, HF patients or dyads will receive the prompt list while in&#xD;
      the waiting room prior to their visit. Completing the prompt list involves two steps. In step&#xD;
      1, participants will independently select from a predetermined list of questions (within&#xD;
      topic areas) that they would like to ask their health care provider. The questions/topics&#xD;
      were developed by other HF patients and family members in another phase of the study. Also,&#xD;
      patients will be asked to choose behaviors they would like their family member to engage in&#xD;
      during the visit (e.g., write down the provider's instructions, ask questions), from a&#xD;
      structured list developed based on prior research. Family members will identify which&#xD;
      behaviors they are willing to perform. In step 2, patients or dyads will collectively&#xD;
      prioritize which questions/topics to discuss during the visit. Each dyad member will receive&#xD;
      a prompt list to complete in the clinic waiting room immediately before their appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All visits will be audio-taped to assess effects of the intervention on communication&#xD;
      behaviors during the visit. All participants will complete a questionnaire at baseline, 2&#xD;
      days after the audio-taped clinic visit, and at 3 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Acceptability Checklist Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 2 days after receiving checklist</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess the perceived value of the checklist using a series of 11 questions developed for this study. Each question is scored using a 6-point Likert response scale where 1 = strongly disagree and 6 = strongly agree. Higher scores mean higher perceived value of the checklist.</description>

    <measure>Mean Score on the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) - Management Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 month after clinic visit</time_frame>
    <description>The SCHFI was used to measure self-care management. The 10-item self-care management scale assesses decision-making in response to HF symptoms. Of note, the self-care management questions are answered and scored only if the respondent endorses having experienced dyspnea or ankle swelling within the past month.The subscale score is standardized, with scores ranging from 0-100 (higher scores indicate greater self-care management). Scores ≥ 70 are reflective of &quot;adequate&quot; self-care management. A change in scale score of one-half of a standard deviation or more is considered clinically significant. Measured at Baseline and during the 1 Month Follow-Up.</description>

          <description>The Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) was used to measure self-care maintenance. The 10-item self-care maintenance scale assesses behaviors used to maintain physiologic stability (e.g., adherence to medications, frequent weighing).This subscale score is standardized, with scores ranging from 0-100 (higher scores indicates greater self-care confidence). Scores ≥ 70 are reflective of &quot;adequate&quot; self-care maintenance. A change in scale score of one-half of a standard deviation or more is considered clinically significant</description>

          <description>The SCHFI was used to measure self-care management. The 10-item self-care management scale assesses decision-making in response to HF symptoms. The self-care management questions are answered and scored only if the respondent endorses having experienced dyspnea or ankle swelling within the past month. The subscale score is standardized, with scores ranging from 0-100 (higher scores indicates greater self-care management). Scores ≥ 70 are reflective of &quot;adequate&quot; self-care management. A change in scale score of one-half of a standard deviation or more is considered clinically significant.</description>

          <description>The Caregiver Contribution to Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (CC-SCHFI) is a 22-item measure (across 3 sub-scales) that assesses the contribution of caregivers to the self-care maintenance and self-care management of HF patients as well as their confidence in their ability to contribute to the patients' HF self-care. This 10- item subscale uses a 4-point Likert scale (never or rarely, sometimes, frequently, always or daily), with a standardized score from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate higher contribution to self-care maintenance.</description>

        <title>Mean Score on the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) - Management Subscale</title>
        <description>The SCHFI was used to measure self-care management. The 10-item self-care management scale assesses decision-making in response to HF symptoms. Of note, the self-care management questions are answered and scored only if the respondent endorses having experienced dyspnea or ankle swelling within the past month.The subscale score is standardized, with scores ranging from 0-100 (higher scores indicate greater self-care management). Scores ≥ 70 are reflective of &quot;adequate&quot; self-care management. A change in scale score of one-half of a standard deviation or more is considered clinically significant. Measured at Baseline and during the 1 Month Follow-Up.</description>

        <population>This measure is completed by Accompanied and Unaccompanied patients only. Companion responses are not applicable here and are captured in a separate outcome measure. Data are missing for 11 Accompanied patients and 3 Unaccompanied patients.</population>

        <description>The 6-item subscale of the SCHFI was used to assess self-confidence in performing behaviors and making decisions to control heart failure symptoms. The subscale score is standardized, with scores ranging from 0-100 (higher scores indicates greater self-care confidence). Scores ≥ 70 are reflective of &quot;adequate&quot; self-care confidence. A change in scale score of one-half of a standard deviation or more is considered clinically significant. Measured at Baseline and during the 1 Month Follow-Up.</description>

          <title>Mean Score on Caregiver Contribution to Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (CC-SCHFI) - Management Subscale</title>
          <description>The CC-SCHFI is a 22-item measure (across 3 sub-scales) that assesses the contribution of caregivers to the self-care maintenance and self-care management of HF patients as well as their confidence in their ability to contribute to the patients' HF self-care. This 6-item subscale uses a 4-point Likert scale (never or rarely, sometimes, frequently, always or daily), with a standardized score from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate higher contribution to the patient's self-care management. Measured at Baseline and during the 1 Month Follow-Up.</description>
          <population>This measure is completed by Companions only. Accompanied and Unaccompanied responses are not applicable here and are captured in a separate outcome measure. Data are missing for 14 Companions.</population>
