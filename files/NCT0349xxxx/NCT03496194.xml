  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the current organization and management of postoperative pain&#xD;
      in Denmark, especially for invasive pain treatment modalities (epidural infusions, PCA and&#xD;
      regional blocks), in a national survey covering the activities in Danish Hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an electronic questionnaire survey, that aim to describe and map the foundation&#xD;
      for future developments within, and improvement of, postoperative pain management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is one of the major challenges in postoperative care and several studies&#xD;
      continue to demonstrate that postoperative pain is generally undertreated. A key focus for&#xD;
      postoperative pain is to identify gold standards within procedure-specific pain treatment.&#xD;
      However, results from single randomized trials do not per se lead to better treatment, as&#xD;
      this requires both efforts within implementation of best evidence, quality control of&#xD;
      efficacy, including efficacy on the individual level, and education of staff and physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested, that a way forward must include changes at the organizational level.&#xD;
      For basic postoperative pain treatment, the major responsibility for planning and execution&#xD;
      often rests on the surgical departments. For invasive pain treatment methods, e.g. epidural&#xD;
      analgesia with continual infusion, patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA), patient&#xD;
      controlled analgesia (PCA), and regional blocks, both single and continuing, this treatment&#xD;
      is instituted at the departments of anaesthesia, but the responsibility for follow up is&#xD;
      rarely described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, epidural analgesia is widely recommended because of superior benefits in reducing&#xD;
      postoperative pain, pulmonal complications and surgical stress, as compared to systemic&#xD;
      opioid treatment. However, epidural analgesia is not without complications especially not for&#xD;
      abdominal and thoracic surgery. The accompanying unwanted motor blockade may delay recovery&#xD;
      and recent studies question this treatment. Likewise, up to 20 % percent of patients will not&#xD;
      receive adequate analgesia for the first 48 hours postoperative with this method. Finally, it&#xD;
      is possible, that adverse effects and complications from epidural treatment are currently&#xD;
      being underestimated, due to lack of routine monitoring and missing protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides epidural analgesia, the use of Patient controlled analgesia (PCA), Patient controlled&#xD;
      epidural analgesia (PCEA) and regional blocks have gained ground the last decades. With these&#xD;
      techniques it might be possible to reduce overall opioid requirements. Nevertheless, a daily&#xD;
      evaluation of benefits and harms of such analgesic techniques may be required to justify&#xD;
      these treatment modalities. It is suggested, that regularly monitoring of invasive analgesic&#xD;
      methods is of great concern when it comes to optimal postoperative pain management and&#xD;
      reduction of adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A structured organizational approach has the potential to improve benefit and harm of&#xD;
      postoperative pain management. A number of studies argues that in order to obtain optimal&#xD;
      postoperative pain treatment there need to be regular monitoring, and optimization of the&#xD;
      analgesic regimens and techniques, preferably in a clinical setting with either an Acute Pain&#xD;
      Service (APS) or a similar setup. With the decline of the use of APS's in Denmark it seems&#xD;
      that the organization and management around postoperative pain treatment in general, and for&#xD;
      invasive pain treatment methods in particular, needs to be investigated. As of today, it is&#xD;
      not known how patients with such pain treatment are monitored and taken care of after leaving&#xD;
      the post anaesthesia care unit, and where the responsibility for this pain treatment lies&#xD;
