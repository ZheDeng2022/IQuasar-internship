    <description>Measure Description: Subject's level of hair loss at baseline based on the Norwood Hamilton Scale for male subjects.&#xD;
Type I: Minimal or no recession of the hairline Type II: Triangular areas of recession at the frontotemporal hairline Type III: Deep symmetrical recession at the temples are bare or only sparsely covered by hair Type IV: Frontotemporal recession is more severe than in Type III with sparse or no hair on the vertex Type V: The vertex hair loss region is separated from the frontotemporal region but is less distinct Type VI: Sparse hair remaining Type VII: The most severe form of hair loss. Lower scores represent better outcomes.</description>

    <description>Treating investigators will be required to rate the subject's level of hair loss at baseline based on the Sinclair scale for women.&#xD;
Grade 1: is normal. This pattern is found in all girls prior to puberty but in only forty-five percent of women aged eighty or over.&#xD;
Grade 2: shows a widening of the central part. Grade 3: shows a widening of the central part and thinning of the hair on either side of the central part.&#xD;
Grade 4: reveals the emergence of a diffuse hair loss over the top of the scalp.&#xD;
Grade 5: indicates advanced hair loss. Lower grades represent better outcomes.</description>

Grade 1: is normal. This pattern is found in all girls prior to puberty but in only forty-five percent of women aged eighty or over.&#xD;
Grade 2: shows a widening of the central part. Grade 3: shows a widening of the central part and thinning of the hair on either side of the central part.&#xD;
Grade 4: reveals the emergence of a diffuse hair loss over the top of the scalp.&#xD;
Grade 5: indicates advanced hair loss.</description>

        <description>Treating investigators will be required to rate the subject's level of hair loss at baseline based on the Sinclair scale for women.&#xD;
Grade 1: is normal. This pattern is found in all girls prior to puberty but in only forty-five percent of women aged eighty or over.&#xD;
Grade 2: shows a widening of the central part. Grade 3: shows a widening of the central part and thinning of the hair on either side of the central part.&#xD;
Grade 4: reveals the emergence of a diffuse hair loss over the top of the scalp.&#xD;
Grade 5: indicates advanced hair loss. Lower grades represent better outcomes.</description>
