      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy drugs help the body to fight cancer. Scientists think that combining some of&#xD;
      these drugs will make them work better than when used alone. This may be true for many types&#xD;
      of cancer, including castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if the combination of the drugs BN-brachyury, M7824, N-803, and Epacadostat is safe&#xD;
      and shrinks tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with CRPC or another metastatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT or MRI scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible bone imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible tumor biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be treated with a 2-, 3- or 4-drug combinations of the following study&#xD;
      drugs in 2-week cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive M7824 by IV once every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive N-803 by injection once every 2 weeks. They will record any&#xD;
           skin changes at the injection site in a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive BN-brachyury as 4 injections to different limbs. They will get&#xD;
           the first 3 doses 2 weeks apart. Then they will get doses every 4 weeks for 6 months,&#xD;
           then every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take Epacadostat orally every 12 hours. They will keep a pill diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have physical exams and blood and urine tests at the start of each cycle.&#xD;
      They may have scans every 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue treatment until their disease gets worse or they cannot tolerate&#xD;
      the side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 4-5 weeks after they stop treatment. They will have&#xD;
      a physical exam and blood tests. They may be asked to return for scans every 3 months.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PD-1/PD-L1 signaling appears to be a major inhibitor of activated T cell anti-tumor&#xD;
           immune responses. The rapid, deep and durable responses seen in various malignancies&#xD;
           with PD-1/PD-L1 targeted agents demonstrate that blockade of this axis is key to&#xD;
           facilitating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate cancer is poorly recognized by T cells. Lack of an immune response is one&#xD;
           explanation for the lower response rates (&lt;15%) observed with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies&#xD;
           for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increasing response rates will likely require therapeutic nullification of multiple&#xD;
           immune deficits by combining immunotherapies that generate tumor-specific T cells&#xD;
           (vaccine), dampen the inhibitory milieu of the TME, and enhance T and NK cell activity&#xD;
           within the TME.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A quick efficacy seeking trial, utilizing sequential arms offers a means to identify&#xD;
           signals of activity for combinations of immunotherapy, added sequentially, in castration&#xD;
           resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BN-Brachyury is a novel recombinant vector-based therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to&#xD;
           induce an enhanced immune response against brachyury, which is overexpressed in many&#xD;
           solid tumor types, including prostate adenocarcinoma. BN-Brachyury collectively refers&#xD;
           to the priming doses (MVA-BN-Brachyury) and the boost doses (FPV-Brachyury) of the&#xD;
           vaccine platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  M7824 is a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of an anti-programmed death ligand 1&#xD;
           (PD-L1) antibody and the extracellular domain of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-&#xD;
           beta) receptor type 2, a TGF-beta trap. M7824 can also mediate antibody-dependent&#xD;
           cellular cytotoxicity in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  N-803 is an IL-15/IL-15R alpha superagonist complex that can enhance NK cell mediated&#xD;
           ADCC and T-cell cytotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Synergistic anti-tumor effects have been observed in vitro when combining M7824 and&#xD;
           N-803, and in vivo when combining these agents with tumor vaccine in animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IDO1 is overexpressed in many solid tumors and can contribute to immune escape by tumor&#xD;
           cells. INCB024360 (Epacadostat) is an IDO1 inhibitor under investigation in combination&#xD;
           with different immunotherapies in treatment of various malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In treating of CRPC, we hypothesize that these agents and their effects will be&#xD;
           complementary. Tumor-specific T cells generated by vaccine may become more functional in&#xD;
           a TME following treatment with M7824 and Epacadostat. N-803 can further enhance the&#xD;
           activity of antigen-specific T cells as well as NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine if there is clinical benefit to any of a set of 3 possible treatments for&#xD;
      participants with CRPC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BN-Brachyury + M7824&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BN-Brachyury + M7824 + N-803&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BN-Brachyury + M7824 + N-803 + Epacadostat&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults with histologically proven CRPC, or metastatic solid tumor of any type for which&#xD;
           there is no standard treatment or standard treatment has failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function as defined by liver, kidney, and hematologic laboratory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with acquired immune defects, active systemic autoimmune disease, history&#xD;
           of organ transplant, history of chronic infections, or history of active inflammatory&#xD;
           bowel disease are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open label Phase I/II trial with following randomization during the expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Cohort 1, Arm 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Up to 18 participants with any solid tumor will be enrolled in dose escalation Cohort 1 for&#xD;
      treatment in Arm 1.1 (flat dose of M7824 + different dose levels of N-803).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IIA: expansion with sequential enrollment into Cohort 2A, Arms 2.1A, 2.2A and 2.3 A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concurrently with the enrollment to Arm 1.1, 13 participants with CRPC will start&#xD;
           enrollment in Cohort 2A for treatment in Arm 2.1A (M7824 + BN-Brachyury).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When safe dosing of N-803 is identified during Phase I, 13 participants have enrolled in&#xD;
           arm 2.1A and the first 6 participants, treated in Arm 2.1A, have met safety&#xD;
           requirements, 13 participants with CRPC will start enrollment in Cohort 2A for treatment&#xD;
           in Arm 2.2A (M7824 + BN-Brachyury + N-803).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When 13 participants have enrolled in Arm 2.2A and the first 6 participants, treated in&#xD;
           Arm 2.2A, have met safety requirements, 13 participants with CRPC will start enrollment&#xD;
           in Cohort 2A for treatment in Arm 2.3A (M7824 + BN-Brachyury + N-803 + Epacadostat).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IIB: expansion with randomized enrollment into Cohorts 2D and 2R, Arms 2.1B, 2.2B. and&#xD;
      2.3B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each Arm in Cohorts 2D and 2R: 2.1B, 2.2B and 2.3B will be open for additional&#xD;
           enrollment (25 evaluable participants total) when the initial 13 participants have&#xD;
           accrued, safety requirements are meet and a positive signal (defined as Objective&#xD;
           Response by RECIST 1.1 or sustained PSA decrease &gt;= 30% sustained for &gt; 21 days) in &gt;= 2&#xD;
           participants is shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If only one arm is open for additional enrollment, participants will be directly&#xD;
           assigned to this arm. If 2 arms are open for additional enrollment, participants will be&#xD;
           randomized between these 2 open arms. If 3 arms are open for additional enrollment,&#xD;
           participants will be randomized among these 3 open arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are &gt;= 6 of 25 participants with a positive signal of activity in any expansion arm,&#xD;
      that arm will be considered of interest for future studies.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed any solid tumor (Cohort 1)&#xD;
        or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC, Cohorts 2A, 2D and 2R). No prior treatment&#xD;
        other than testosterone lowering therapy for CRPC is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the Cohort 1, eligible participants must have a histologically, cytologically or&#xD;
        radiographically proven metastatic or locally advanced solid tumor of any type, for which&#xD;
        there is no curative standard therapy or standard therapy has failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Castrate testosterone level (less than 50ng/dl or 1.7nmol /L). (Participants with a&#xD;
        malignancy other than prostate cancer are excluded from this criterion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Radiological confirmation of metastatic disease, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        Progressive disease at study entry defined as one or more of the following criteria&#xD;
        occurring in the setting of castrate levels of testosterone:&#xD;
&#xD;
        --Radiographic progression defined as any new or enlarging bone lesions or growing lymph&#xD;
        node disease, consistent with prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        --PSA progression defined by sequence of rising values separated by greater than 1 week (2&#xD;
        separate increasing values over a minimum of 1 ng/ml (PCWG3 PSA eligibility criteria). If&#xD;
        participants had been on flutamide, PSA progression is documented 4 weeks or more after&#xD;
        withdrawal. For participants on bicalutamide or nilutamide disease progression is&#xD;
        documented 6 or more weeks after withdrawal. The requirement for a 4-6 week withdrawal&#xD;
        period following discontinuation of flutamide, nilutamide or bicalutamide only applies to&#xD;
        participants who have been on these drugs for at least the prior 6 months. For all other&#xD;
        participants they must stop bicalutamide, nilutamide or flutamide the day prior to&#xD;
        enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic form prostate cancer; no use of regularly scheduled&#xD;
        opiate analgesics for prostate cancer-related pain. (Participants with a malignancy other&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits; in participants with Gilbert s,&#xD;
             less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL&#xD;

             ALT less than or equal to 3.5 (SqrRoot) ULN, and bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0&#xD;
             is acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine within 1.5X upper limit of normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
        The effects of BN-Brachyury, M7824, N-803, and Epacadostat on the developing human fetus&#xD;
        are unknown. For this reason, men and women must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
        (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, during the&#xD;
        study and maintain such contraception until 4 months following the last dose of any study&#xD;
        agent. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner&#xD;
        is participating in this study, she should inform her partner s treating physician&#xD;
        immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
        document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with successfully treated HCV are eligible if HCV viral load is undetectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who are immunocompromised as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus positivity due to the potential for decreased tolerance,&#xD;
             and potential to be at risk for severe side effects with immunotherapies. These&#xD;
             concerns are relevant to all drugs, as drug-drug interactions among antiretrovirals&#xD;
             and immunotherapies are yet uncharacterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic administration (defined as daily or every other day for continued use greater&#xD;
             than 14 days) of systemic corticosteroids or other immune suppressive drugs, within 28&#xD;
             days before treatment on study. Nasal, or inhaled steroid, topical steroid creams and&#xD;
             eye drops for small body areas are allowed. Physiologic doses of steroids are&#xD;
             permitted, e.g. a participant taking hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency or a&#xD;
             patient recently on abiraterone (administered with 10 mg of prednisone daily) who is&#xD;
             tapering off of prednisone is allowed to continue that taper.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have undergone allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation, or&#xD;
             solid organ transplantation requiring immunosuppression&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active autoimmune disease, except participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
                  vitiligo, psoriasis, hypo- or hyperthyroid disease not requiring current&#xD;
                  immunosuppression, or with other endocrine disorders on replacement hormones or&#xD;
                  are not excluded if the condition is well controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prostate cancer participants with a history of brain/leptomeningeal metastasis, since these&#xD;
        participants have a very poor prognosis and immunotherapy may take time to lead to&#xD;
        beneficial clinical effects. Participants with brain or CNS metastases enrolling to arm 1.1&#xD;
        are eligible if they are status post definitive radiotherapy or surgery, and are&#xD;
        asymptomatic&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
        composition to study agents to be used in the cohort the subject will be enrolled into.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known allergy to eggs, egg products, aminoglycoside antibiotics (for example, gentamicin or&#xD;
        tobramycin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent full participation&#xD;
        in this trial (including the long-term follow-up), or would interfere with the evaluation&#xD;
        of the trial endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with prior investigational drug, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or any prior&#xD;
        radiotherapy (except for palliative bone directed therapy) within the past 28 days prior to&#xD;
        enrollment, except if the investigator has assessed that all residual treatment-related&#xD;
        toxicities have resolved or are minimal and feel the participant is otherwise suitable for&#xD;
        enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Uncontrolled intercurrent acute or chronic illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
        or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (&gt;New York Heart Association&#xD;
        Class I), hepatic disease, unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmia, requiring&#xD;
        medication, uncontrolled hypertension (SBP&gt;170/ DBP&gt;105) or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
        situations within 12 months that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of herbal products that may decrease PSA levels (e.g. saw palmetto)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who have had cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant&#xD;
        prostate cancer within the past 3 months. (Participants who have had docetaxel for&#xD;
        metastatic castration sensitive per CHAARTED data may enroll as long as they did not have&#xD;
        progressive disease while on docetaxel and are 3 months removed from treatment, with all&#xD;
        treatment related toxicities resolving to at least grade 1.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who have undergone major surgery within 4 weeks of enrollment. A biopsy will&#xD;
        not preclude a participant from starting study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with a history of hepatitis B (HBV) are excluded due to potential risk for&#xD;
        viral reactivation and resulting liver injury in persons with latent HBV&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects unwilling to accept blood products or blood transfusions as medically indicated.&#xD;
        As there is a risk of severe bleeding with M7824, participants must be willing to receive&#xD;
        blood transfusions if medically necessary for their own safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        For participants enrolling in Arm 2.3A and for participants who may be randomized to Arm&#xD;
        2.3B, the following additional exclusion criteria will apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) or a drug which has&#xD;
             significant MAOI activity (meperidine, linezolid, methylene blue) within the 21 days&#xD;
             before initiation of study therapy are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Since epacadostat s metabolism may be altered by drugs that inhibit UDP-&#xD;
             glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A9 (see Appendix D), Participants receiving such drugs&#xD;
             within 21 days of initiation of study therapy are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving agents that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19 or&#xD;
             affected by OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 within 21 days of initiation of study therapy or 5 half&#xD;
             lives of the agent (whichever is shorter) are excluded. Participants receiving&#xD;
             medications that are substrates of these enzymes/transporters but are not listed in&#xD;
             the appendix or participants receiving substrates of CYP2B6 and CYP3A will be&#xD;
             evaluated on a case-by-case basis prior to enrollment. Participants who consume&#xD;
             caffeine are eligible but must agree to moderate consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving coumarin-based anticoagulants (e. Coumadin) are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects having any history of Serotonin Syndrome (SS) after receiving serotonergic&#xD;
             drugs are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             --Participants with a QTcF interval &gt; 480 milliseconds at the screening are excluded.&#xD;
             In the event that a single QTcF is &gt; 480 milliseconds, the subject may enroll if the&#xD;
             average QTcF for the 3 ECGs is &lt; 480 milliseconds. For subjects with an&#xD;
             intraventricular conduction delay (QRS interval &gt; 120 milliseconds), the JTc interval&#xD;
             may be used in place of the QTc. The JTc must be &lt; 340 milliseconds if JTc is used in&#xD;
             place of the QTc. QTc prolongation due to pacemaker may enroll if the JTc is normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with left bundle branch block are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because investigational agents used in&#xD;
             this study (BN-Brachyury, M7824, N-803, and/or Epacadostat) could have teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these&#xD;
             investigational agen s, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with either of them.&#xD;
