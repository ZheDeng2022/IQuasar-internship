      Over the past few years, significant advances have begun to be made in the development of&#xD;
      particular measures as valid biomarkers or surrogate markers for the presence of acute and&#xD;
      chronic pain. Many of these advances have been made because of the development of new and&#xD;
      improved technologies, for example in the fields of imaging and genetics. Research is now&#xD;
      showing brain activity and brain organizational changes associated with the presence of pain.&#xD;
      Various factors have been found in the blood that is associated with the presence of pain.&#xD;
      Research is also suggesting that pupil responses to a variety of stimuli may predict the&#xD;
      presence of pain. And machine learning analysis of videos has found facial movement patterns&#xD;
      in both animals and humans that are correlated with the presence of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to investigate whether components of a person's electrical brain&#xD;
      activity do reflect pain sensation.&#xD;

      Over the past few years, significant advances have begun to be made in the development of&#xD;
      particular measures as valid biomarkers or surrogate markers for the presence of acute and/or&#xD;
      chronic pain. Many of these advances have been made because of the development of new and&#xD;
      improved technologies, for example in the fields of imaging and genetics. Research is now&#xD;
      showing brain activity and brain organizational changes associated with the presence of pain.&#xD;
      Various factors have been found in the blood that is associated with the presence of pain.&#xD;
      Research is also suggesting that pupil responses to a variety of stimuli may predict the&#xD;
      presence of pain and machine learning analysis of videos has found facial movement patterns&#xD;
      in both animals and humans that are correlated with the presence of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The establishment of a biomarker of pain is a key requirement for understanding the&#xD;
      person-specific effects of anesthetic and analgesic drugs. An objective pain measure will be&#xD;
      an integral part in the planning of an anesthetic and potentially enable the researchers to&#xD;
      answer the question whether proper matching of the anesthetic or analgesic dose to a person's&#xD;
      individual profile will result in better cognitive recovery from anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several approaches to quantifying pain in an objective fashion. These approaches&#xD;
      are based on the observation of afferent signals to the brain, brain integration of&#xD;
      nociceptive signals or secondary responses to nociceptive signals (ocular, facial, autonomic&#xD;
      or behavioral responses). Pain has been studied extensively with fMRI. Several other methods&#xD;
      have been proposed: pain behavior, pupillary responses, and autonomic responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatosensory evoked electrical potentials (SSEP) are routinely recorded to assess the&#xD;
      integrity of sensory pathways during spine surgery. Our primary study aim is to correlate the&#xD;
      neuronal (EEG) signal (Y1) and/or Î³ - band power (Y2) with both the stimulus intensity (X1,&#xD;
      the voltage of constant current stimulator output) and the perceived pain intensity (X2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to test the hypothesis that the gamma frequency range (30 -100 Hz) of&#xD;
      standard EEG or somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) correlate with intensity of an&#xD;
      experimental pain stimulus and perceived (self-rating, subjective) pain intensity.&#xD;
