    <textblock>
      Primary central nervous system lymphomas are rare aggressive malignancies, usually treated in&#xD;
      two steps: an induction phase (where a combination of chemotherapy is given) followed by a&#xD;
      consolidation phase (where patients usually receive one of the following: whole-brain&#xD;
      irradiation, chemotherapy supported by autologous stem-cell transplantation, other type of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, or are just observed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of this overall strategy, for several reasons, is limited in elderly patients&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves patients aged ≥70 years. The more fit patients will receive the standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy combination (high-dose methotrexate, procarbazine and rituximab) as induction.&#xD;
      Responding patients will receive either procarbazine or lenalidomide as maintenance therapy;&#xD;
      the aim is to evaluate the efficacy of these two drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The more fragile patients will receive a less aggressive therapy consisting of concomitant&#xD;
      whole-brain radiotherapy, temozolomide and rituximab as induction therapy, followed by&#xD;
      temozolomide as maintenance treatment; the aim is to evaluate the efficacy of this&#xD;
      combination of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) are rare aggressive malignancies, mostly of&#xD;
      B-cell origin, representing 4% of intracranial neoplasms and 4-6% of extranodal non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphomas (NHL). Despite improvements in treatment, PCNSL is associated with an aggressive&#xD;
      course and unsatisfactory outcome. The median age at diagnosis is 61 years and age over 60&#xD;
      years has been reported to be an independent factor for a poorer outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modern treatment of PCNSL includes two phases: induction and consolidation. The induction&#xD;
      phase usually consists of a polychemotherapy combination, including high-dose methotrexate as&#xD;
      a critical drug, while there are at least four different strategies that can be used as&#xD;
      consolidation: whole-brain irradiation, myeloblative chemotherapy supported by autologous&#xD;
      stem-cell transplantation, non-myeloblative chemotherapy, observation (only in patients who&#xD;
      achieve complete remission after induction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of this overall strategy is limited, for several reasons, in elderly patients&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed PCNSL. High-doses of antimetabolite-based chemotherapy, the standard&#xD;
      induction for patients younger than 70 years, is often not feasible in elderly patients.&#xD;
      Among maintenance strategies, simple observation results in unacceptably high relapse rate&#xD;
      and associated mortality while whole-brain irradiation and aggressive chemotherapies are&#xD;
      associated with unacceptable toxicity and poor outcome. Thus, new strategies aimed at&#xD;
      obtaining durable responses with an acceptable tolerability and reduced risk of&#xD;
      neurocognitive decline are needed and these strategies should be tailored not only based on&#xD;
      the patients' age but also on their specific co-morbidities and general health conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the present trial, all patients aged ≥70 years taken into care at the participating sites&#xD;
      will be invited to participate and after informed consent signature their baseline data will&#xD;
      be collected in the trial database, including data of patients resulting in screening&#xD;
      failure. This will allow to verify any potential screening bias by comparing the&#xD;
      characteristics of included and excluded patients. Patients fulfilling the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria are then screened for their suitability to receive a more or less aggressive&#xD;
      anticancer treatment and assigned to two different treatment strategies accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The more fit patients are assigned to the trial Part A and will receive the standard&#xD;
      combination of high-dose methotrexate, procarbazine and rituximab as induction. Responding&#xD;
      patients will subsequently be randomized to receive either procarbazine or lenalidomide as&#xD;
      maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procarbazine is a lipophilic oral alkylating agent, easily crossing the blood brain barrier&#xD;
      (up to 100% of plasma levels). There is no known cumulative toxicity for procarbazine and it&#xD;
      is therefore currently in use as a viable maintenance treatment option aimed at eliminating&#xD;
      residual lymphoma cells in the CNS and reduce the risk of relapse. Lenalidomide is an oral&#xD;
      immunomodulatory agent, active against diffuse large B cell lymphoma, the most common&#xD;
      category in PCNSL, which can be taken for years, showing an excellent safety profile. On this&#xD;
      background, the Part A of the present trial consists of a randomized phase II trial conducted&#xD;
      in elderly patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL responsive to high-dose methotrexate-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy, comparing two different maintenance strategies: the oral chemotherapeutic drug&#xD;
      procarbazine and the oral immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The more fragile patients are assigned to the trial Part B and will receive a less aggressive&#xD;
      therapy consisting of concomitant whole-brain radiotherapy, temozolomide and rituximab as&#xD;
      induction therapy, followed by temozolomide single-agent as maintenance treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole-brain radiotherapy is the main therapeutic choice for patients with contraindications&#xD;
      to chemotherapy and in particular for elderly patients. Brain irradiation is usually&#xD;
      associated with transient disruption of the blood-tumor barrier, occurring from 1 week after&#xD;
      the initiation of radiotherapy to 1 month after its completion, during which pharmaceutical&#xD;
      agents have maximum access to tumor tissue. Concomitant delivery of active cytostatics,&#xD;
      therefore, could result in increased tumor uptake. Concomitant delivery of radiotherapy and&#xD;
      temozolomide is currently used as standard approach for the treatment of high-grade gliomas,&#xD;
      with acceptable toxicity despite the use of a larger irradiation dose. Based on the above, in&#xD;
      the Part B of the present trial, temozolomide and rituximab, two agents active against PCNSL,&#xD;
      are delivered concomitantly to whole-brain radiotherapy to obtain a synergistic effect of&#xD;
      radiation damage, antineoplastic effect of rituximab and cytostatic and radiomimetic effects&#xD;
      of temozolomide. Finally, temozolomide maintenance has shown to be beneficial regarding&#xD;
      sustained remission after initial response to induction therapy and its suitability to&#xD;
      improve disease control in responding patients not fit for more aggressive therapies will&#xD;
      therefore be tested in the Part B of this trial.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Multicenter open label phase II trial. The patients will be stratified according to their suitability to tolerate an induction chemo-immunotherapy regimen containing high-dose methotrexate.&#xD;
Patients eligible for high-dose methotrexate-based induction chemotherapy will enter the run-in phase of Part A of the study and after the induction phase will be randomly assigned to procarbazine or lenalidomide maintenance monotherapy. Forty assessable patients per treatment arm are required.&#xD;
Patients ineligible for high-dose methotrexate-based induction chemotherapy will be treated în Part B with concomitant whole-brain radiotherapy, temozolomide and rituximab and will receive temozolomide as maintenance.According to the Simon's two-stage minimax design, 46 patients will be treated in the first stage. If ≤ 16 patients will be progression-free at 2 years from maintenance treatment start, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 19 additional patients will be treated for a total of 65</intervention_model_description>
