  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of severely obese patients who has knee replacement surgery is rising. Obesity&#xD;
      increases the risk of the postoperative swelling. A complication which can cause pain and&#xD;
      discomfort as well as complicate and prolong rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present pilot study is to examine the effect of a compression stocking on&#xD;
      postoperative swelling and pain among patients with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2, after total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty. The hypothesis is that the use of a medical elastic compression stocking for 14&#xD;
      days postoperatively may reduce postoperative swelling by two cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study will furthermore provide useful information for feasibility which will be&#xD;
      used to decide whether or not a larger study should be initiated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark approximately 9000 knee replacements were performed in 2015. Almost 7000 of the&#xD;
      procedures performed were total knee arthroplasties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total knee arthroplasty is a common procedure performed as treatment for knee arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, 39,9% of the patients in Denmark who had knee replacement surgery were severely&#xD;
      obese with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of severely obese patients who has knee replacement surgery is rising and&#xD;
      studies have shown that obesity increases the risk of postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A danish cross-sectional study found that swelling with a prevalence of 90,7% was the most&#xD;
      frequent patient-reported complication after knee arthroplasty. A common postoperative&#xD;
      complication after total knee arthroplasty and severe obesity increases the risk of&#xD;
      postoperative swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative swelling may impair movement of the knee, cause pain and discomfort as well as&#xD;
      complicate and prolong rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite that a BMI 30 kg/m2 causes more postoperative complications, obese patients&#xD;
      experience the same quality of life and improvement of function after total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      as patients with a BMI ≤30 kg/m2. The higher complication rate among the obese patients has&#xD;
      socioeconomic consequences due to readmission and unscheduled outpatient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study found that in the first 30 days postoperative after total knee arthroplasty 2,9&#xD;
      percent of the patients were readmitted. In 2015 7,3% of the patients who had primary knee&#xD;
      replacement surgery in Denmark were readmitted within 30 days after the operation.&#xD;
      Unscheduled outpatient visits 30 days post-surgery, is related to swelling in the operated&#xD;
      leg. There is a need for further research on interventions that may prevent postoperative&#xD;
      swelling after knee replacement surgery. A compression stocking is a feasible intervention&#xD;
      and an effective treatment in the prevention of swelling. The stocking provides measured&#xD;
      pressure against the leg which helps the blood to move up toward the heart. By improving the&#xD;
      blood flow, swelling is prevented and reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Danish randomized controlled study (RCT), that investigated the effect of a compression&#xD;
      stocking when used for four weeks postoperatively found that the stocking did not have a&#xD;
      clinical effect on postoperative swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However the stocking was the day after the surgery, where seventy percent of the&#xD;
      postoperative swelling already had occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is relevant to investigate whether a compression stocking has an effect on&#xD;
      postoperative swelling, when applied immediately after the operation has ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present pilot study is to examine the effect of a compression stocking on&#xD;
      postoperative swelling and pain among patients with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2, after total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty. The aim of the pilot study is furthermore to provide useful information for&#xD;
      feasibility which will be used to decide whether or not a larger RCT should be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be recruited at Department for planned Orthopaedic Surgery, Naestved&#xD;
      Hospital, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: planned for total knee arthroplasty, BMI ≥30 kg/m2, aged 18 or older,&#xD;
