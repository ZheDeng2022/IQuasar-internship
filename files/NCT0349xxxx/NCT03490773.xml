      Type I diabetes(T1D)T occurs when an individual loses the ability to make enough insulin to&#xD;
      control their blood sugar levels. They need insulin injections to replace the insulin&#xD;
      production that has been lost. Traditionally people with T1D are thought to make none of&#xD;
      their own insulin after diagnosis, but we have recently identified that there are some people&#xD;
      who have T1D but go one making insulin for many years. We would like to explore this in more&#xD;
      depth and understand why some people with T1D go on making insulin and some do not. This will&#xD;
      help us understand the causes of T1D and may help work out ways to protect this remaining&#xD;
      insulin production, with improved blood sugar control, and reduced long-term complications of&#xD;
      diabetes We aim to explore genetic and immunological factors which impact on the ability of&#xD;
      an individual diagnosed with Type I diabetes (T1D) to produce their own insulin. We aim to&#xD;
      study individuals who have been diagnosed with T1D with variable duration and assess the&#xD;
      genetic and immunological profile of those whose are thought to be producing significant&#xD;
      amounts of insulin despite a long duration and those who despite a very short duration, lose&#xD;
      insulin production very quickly.&#xD;

      Background &amp; Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a disease caused by the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta&#xD;
      cells. It commonly presents in childhood with elevated blood sugars and long-term insulin&#xD;
      treatment is required. People diagnosed with T1D have some pancreatic beta cells remaining at&#xD;
      diagnosis and these remaining insulin producing cells were thought to be lost within the&#xD;
      first few months or years after diagnosis. The underlying mechanism for destruction of beta&#xD;
      cells is T-cell driven autoimmunity with genetic, environmental and immune associations that&#xD;
      point towards the immune system as being the key to pancreatic beta cells loss. Extensive&#xD;
      research has focussed on trying to prevent, halt or reverse immune attack in T1D using&#xD;
      immunosuppression or immunomodulation with a variety of drugs and vaccines. These efforts&#xD;
      have been largely unsuccessful and demonstrate that although we know that autoimmunity is&#xD;
      critical to the development of T1D we still do not know enough about specific mechanisms to&#xD;
      successfully stop this process. By better understanding the role of the immune system in T1D,&#xD;
      this may ultimately lead to better treatments or reversal of T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrary to conventional understanding, not all people with T1D lose insulin production soon&#xD;
      after diagnosis. Modern assays that can detect low levels of endogenous insulin have shown&#xD;
      that many people with T1D make low levels of insulin for many years after diagnosis. There&#xD;
      are also a smaller group of patients who make significant amounts of insulin despite having&#xD;
      T1D for many years. Conversely, there are some patients who seem to lose all endogenous&#xD;
      insulin very quickly after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine C-peptide Creatinine ratio is a new technique that allows assessment of endogenous&#xD;
      insulin production in a urine sample that is posted from home. This has allowed the&#xD;
      assessment of insulin production in over 1000 patients with T1D in the South West of England&#xD;
      with identification of patients still making significant amounts of insulin after years of&#xD;
      T1D, and other patients who have lost insulin production very rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retained endogenous insulin production may represent a slower autoimmune process, with a&#xD;
      dampening of the immune response by regulation within the autoimmune system (tolerance), or a&#xD;
      &quot;burning out&quot; of the process of autoimmunity as can happen in some other autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
      Similarly, very rapid loss of insulin production may represent the opposite, more aggressive&#xD;
      end of the spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to study this by comparing immunological characteristics of patients with T1D, with a&#xD;
      range of diabetes duration, and still making significant insulin with similar groups who are&#xD;
      making none.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with long duration T1D and maintained endogenous insulin production have an altered&#xD;
      balance of islet destructive T cells (islet-specific auto reactive CD4 helper and CD8 killer&#xD;
      T cells) and islet protective T cells (regulatory T-cells) and may have different genetic&#xD;
      risk factors for autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve our understanding of insulin production in individuals diagnosed with Type 1&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIGI is an observational case control study. All potential participants will be identified&#xD;
      from either routine clinical care or from existing research cohorts managed by the Peninsula&#xD;
      Research Bank as part of the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility (ECRF). Potential&#xD;
      participants who appear to meet the entry criteria will be given written information on the&#xD;
      project, followed by the opportunity to discuss the project in more detail with a member of&#xD;
      the research team. The research team will be responsible for the recruitment process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited under UK wide ethics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (or their legal guardians) will be required to provide written informed&#xD;
      consent and will be informed of their right to withdraw from the stud at any time with&#xD;
      prejudice or jeopardy to any future clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to attend the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility for a single&#xD;
      appointment, having fasted overnight. To reduce patient burden, participants who are unable&#xD;
      to visit the research facility will be offered an appointment locally (e.g. home or GP&#xD;
      surgery). They will have been asked to provide a urine sample to be collected 2 hours after&#xD;
      their main meal on the day before the study visit (for analysis of UCPCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected at baseline (fasting) and at 0, 30,60, 90 &amp; 120 minutes post&#xD;
      meal for adult participants attending the research facility. For children under 16 years of&#xD;
      age and all participants recruited at home, samples will be collected at 90 minutes post meal&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will include: Height (m), weight (kg), age of diagnosis, current and previous&#xD;
      insulin treatment and family history of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected for Serum C-peptide and other routine biochemistry, DNA&#xD;
      extraction (for HLA typing and T1D risk SNP typing), Peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      (PBMCs) for analysis of auto reactive and regulatory T-cells, and plasma and serum samples&#xD;
      for storage for future analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples will be appropriately labelled in accordance with the 1998 Data Protection Act.&#xD;
      Biological samples collected from participants will be transported, stored, accessed and&#xD;
      processed in accordance with national legislation relating to the use and storage of human&#xD;
      tissue for research purposes. Participants will have the opportunity to consent to gift&#xD;
      samples at the end of the study for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Blood samples will be collected by staff trained in venepuncture. Any potential&#xD;
      discomfort or side -effects will be equivalent to that experienced in routine clinical care.&#xD;
      Risk of hyperglycemia (from having a meal without their usual mealtime insulin): Participants&#xD;
      will be closely monitored during and after their visit by the diabetes specialist research&#xD;
      team. Appropriate advice/support will be given if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefit: In the short term we hope to gain an improved understanding of the causes&#xD;
      of T1D. In the longer term this work may lead to improved therapeutic, vaccine and&#xD;
      transplantation treatments for T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Effects: Should any unforeseen adverse events arise that possibly, probably or&#xD;
      definitely related to a study procedure, they wil be reported to the Sponsor and CI within 24&#xD;
      hours of the research team becoming aware of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality: All information related to study participants will be kept confidential and&#xD;
      managed in accordance with the Data Protection Act, NHS Caldicott Guardian, The Research&#xD;
      Governance Framework for Health &amp; Social Care and Research Ethics Committee Approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant date will be held in link-anonymised format, with personal identifiable data only&#xD;
      accessible to personnel with training in data protection who require this information to&#xD;
      perform their study role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record Retention &amp; Archiving: When the research study is complete, it is a requirement of the&#xD;
      Research Governance Framework and Sponsor Trust Policy that the records are kept for a&#xD;
      further 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics &amp; Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main analysis will be to assess if there is a difference in the immune phenotype of&#xD;
      patients with the most (High C-peptide) and the least (Low C-peptide) persistent endogenous&#xD;
      insulin relative to duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit at least 110 patients in each group in keeping with previous recruitment in&#xD;
      Exeter. We predict a minimum of 100 will have confirmed extreme C-peptide in each group. This&#xD;
      will give 90% power to detect at p&lt;0.01, a difference of 0.6 standard deviation in measures&#xD;
      of immune function and a difference in proportions of 30 (50 v 80)%. Previous studies have&#xD;
      shown differences of &gt;1 SD in the mean suppressive function of autoreactive T cells and a&#xD;
      difference in proportion of 39%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total sample size for this project will be at least 250, to achieve the required number&#xD;
      of patients with extreme C-peptide as detailed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will have a range of diabetes duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of this study will ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practice. The&#xD;
      Investigators will permit monitoring, audits, REC review and regulatory inspections by&#xD;
      providing the Sponsor(s), Regulators and REC direct access to source data and other&#xD;
      documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NHS indemnity will apply to participants and UK public liability insurance is provided by the&#xD;
      University of Exeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project development and user involvement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will have access to the user representative group of the NIHR Exeter Clinical&#xD;
      Research Facility (ECRF). In keeping with the NHS Patient Carer and Public Involvement (PCPI)&#xD;
      strategy the ECRF invites user representatives to contribute to the development of various&#xD;
      projects within its portfolio. These individuals have agreed to maintain contact and regular&#xD;
      meetings have been established at which researchers discuss the development of current&#xD;
      projects within the ECRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work is funded by a patient-focused diabetes charity, JDRF. On completion of the study,&#xD;
      the data will be analysed and a final study report will be prepared and submitted to the&#xD;
      funder, sponsor and ethics committee. Results will be written up and submitted for&#xD;
      publication in peer reviewed journal(s). Abstracts will be submitted to national and&#xD;
      international conferences. Written information in the form of a letter/newsletter outlining&#xD;
      the key findings of the study will be posted on the study web page.&#xD;
