      Study Type: Interventional Study Design: Intervention Model: Single Group Assignment Masking:&#xD;
      Open Label Primary Purpose: Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy-five (75) treatment-naïve subjects with chronic HCV GT1b infection (without&#xD;
      cirrhosis) with or without glucose abnormalities such as insulin resistance and or diabetes&#xD;
      will be consecutively enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators decided to include also patients with glucose abnormalities at baseline&#xD;
      screening since data on these patients are scanty, and inclusion of this subgroup of patients&#xD;
      better reflects the clinical practice. The study will consecutively enroll patients, without&#xD;
      fixing a specific rule (e.g. sample allocation ratio) for recruitment of patients with and&#xD;
      without glucose abnormalities. This will allow to evaluate the proportion of patients with&#xD;
      and without glucose abnormalities at baseline (a useful approach to understand the impact of&#xD;
      patients with glucose abnormalities in real life) and to perform explorative analyses to&#xD;
      compare patients with or without glucose abnormalities according to SVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be one treatment group with EBV/GZR (50/100 mg) once daily without regards to food&#xD;
      for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBV/GZR is manufactured as a 50/100 mg tablet for oral administration. Subjects will take 1&#xD;
      tablet daily without regards to food.&#xD;
