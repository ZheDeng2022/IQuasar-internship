  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy and radiation for cancer and other conditions can cause infertility. Several&#xD;
      centers around the world are cryopreserving ovarian tissue from these patients though an&#xD;
      experimental protocol, including the Fertility Preservation Program in Pittsburgh (protocol&#xD;
      PRO08050491). The objective of this study is to study the efficacy and safety of autologous&#xD;
      tissue transplantation in patients diagnosed with primary ovarian insufficiency after&#xD;
      chemotherapy and/or radiation treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This investigation involves patient enrollment, thaw and surgical transplantation of&#xD;
      previously collected cryopreserved ovarian cortical tissue, a series of follow-up assessments&#xD;
      during the first 2 years after transplantation and an annual survey after year 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit (standard fertility consultation):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The subject will complete a medical and reproductive history to document menstrual&#xD;
           function and suitability for pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The subject will have standard fertility testing (including but not limited to serum&#xD;
           Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Estradiol (E2), and Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH),&#xD;
           luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone and progesterone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vaginal ultrasound will be performed for measures of ovarian volume and antral follicle&#xD;
           counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A pregnancy test will be performed to rule out pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Each potential subject will undergo a comprehensive fertility consult including&#xD;
           counseling regarding the extent to which participation in this study might be of&#xD;
           ultimate benefit. Alternatives to participation include: continuing to try to conceive&#xD;
           on her own, use of donor oocytes or embryos, or adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The subject will have to obtain clearance from her oncologist and will be counseled by a&#xD;
           reproductive endocrinologist to determine whether she is healthy enough to consider&#xD;
           pregnancy and to discuss the potential risks and benefits of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #1 - pre-op visit (can be combined with initial screening visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be consented by the study physician and complete the same infectious&#xD;
      disease testing as was performed at the time of ovarian tissue freezing (including but not&#xD;
      limited to HIV 1&amp;2, HTLV 1&amp;2, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, CMV,&#xD;
      West Nile virus). The subjects will also complete Fertility quality of life survey&#xD;
      (FertiQoL). FertiQoL is a validated measure of quality of life in people experiencing&#xD;
      fertility problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only after confirming eligibility, obtaining informed consent and completing baseline&#xD;
      measures, ovarian tissue thawing and transplantation will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #2 - Ovarian tissue transplantation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of ovarian tissue thawing, an outpatient laparoscopy (or minilaparotomy if the&#xD;
      patient is not deemed to be a good candidate for laparoscopic surgery) will be performed&#xD;
      under general anesthesia. Ovarian cortical tissue will be transplanted within the pelvis&#xD;
      according to the most effective available techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #3: Post-operative assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within six weeks of transplant, a postoperative follow-up assessment will be conducted to&#xD;
      ensure adequate patient recovery and emotional well-being. Blood tests (including but not&#xD;
      limited to serum FSH, E2, and AMH, LH, testosterone and progesterone), pelvic ultrasound and&#xD;
      FertiQoL survey, will be conducted to assess reproductive hormone levels, menstrual function,&#xD;
      complications from surgery, pregnancy, medical and medication history, and cancer relapse.&#xD;
      Referral to the clinical counselor may be made, if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits #4, #5, #6, #7 and #8 at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months post-op:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of 5 additional follow-up assessments will be conducted during the first 2 years&#xD;
      after transplant with Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility to assess reproductive&#xD;
      hormone levels, menstrual function, complications from surgery, pregnancy, changes in medical&#xD;
      and medication status, and cancer relapse. A visit may be added at the time menstruation is&#xD;
      restored if this occurs between regularly scheduled visits. At each follow up visit hormone&#xD;
      testing is performed, vaginal ultrasound and FertiQoL survey will be administered. Additional&#xD;
      clinical follow-up and testing may be determined in consultation with the subject's&#xD;
      oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual Survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting year 3 post-transplantation, each subject will be surveyed annually. The survey is&#xD;
      voluntary and confidential and will be conducted by scripted phone interview or&#xD;
      self-administered survey through secure email. The survey will include questions about&#xD;
      menstrual/pregnancy history, new diagnoses or treatments, and feelings about participating in&#xD;
      the study. Detailed information about pregnancy and birth outcomes will be collected by a&#xD;
      combination of survey and chart review. Outcome data including remission, relapse or death,&#xD;
      will be collected. Contact information will also be updated.&#xD;
