  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) is an important tool for the assessment of the&#xD;
      efficacy of novel malaria vaccines and drugs prior to field trials. CHMI also allows for the&#xD;
      evaluation of immunity to malaria and parasite growth rates in vivo and thus allows for the&#xD;
      assessment of the natural acquisition and loss of malaria immunity. This may be particularly&#xD;
      useful in individuals from endemic areas with changing levels of exposure and immunity to&#xD;
      malaria. Thus, CHMI in individuals with prior exposure to malaria could be a valuable tool to&#xD;
      accelerate malaria vaccine development and inform malaria control programs of changing&#xD;
      immunity levels and related disease presentations. In this trial, the investigators intend to&#xD;
      study the effect of pre-exposure to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) on parasite kinetics, clinical&#xD;
      symptoms and immunity after CHMI by PfSPZ Challenge in Gambian adults. Based on a&#xD;
      well-defined sero-profile representing the extremes of current malaria exposure in The&#xD;
      Gambia, two cohorts will be identified to study the impact of naturally acquired immunity on&#xD;
      susceptibility for a Controlled Human Malaria Infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis is that cumulative exposure to natural Pf infections, as defined by the&#xD;
      antibody profile to a defined panel of Pf antigens, is associated with an increasing&#xD;
      pre-patent period and/or a reduced parasite growth rate in the CHMI after PfSPZ Challenge.&#xD;
      The Primary objectives are to assess safety of PfSPZ Challenge administration in Gambian&#xD;
      adults and to determine parasite kinetics in the CHMI model after PfSPZ Challenge in&#xD;
      naturally exposed Gambian adults. The Secondary objective is to analyse humoral and cellular&#xD;
      immune responses before and after CHMI in Gambian adults with different serological profiles&#xD;
      to a panel of defined Pf-antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a single centre open-label clinical trial. The study population will be adult&#xD;
      (aged 18 to 35 years) male, healthy subjects with at least 4 years of secondary school&#xD;
      education. A total of 30 individuals will be enrolled to participate in the study; 15 with&#xD;
      intense previous and recent exposure to malaria infections and 15 with very limited historic&#xD;
      exposure to malaria and no evidence of recent malaria infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be checked for parasitaemia by qPCR before inclusion. Two subsequent&#xD;
      negative qPCRs are needed before enrolment in the study to assure the absence of a&#xD;
      P.falciparum infection. If one of the participants is not fit to participate in the study,&#xD;
      another participant who fulfilled enrolment criteria will be included as replacement. For&#xD;
      this purpose, two to four additional participants will be screened as back up. Subsequently,&#xD;
      all participants will be subjected to a standard controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) by&#xD;
      IV administration of a dose of 3.2 x 10^3 PfSPZ Challenge. After CHMI, participants will be&#xD;
      closely followed with regular visits to the clinical trial centre (twice daily until day 15,&#xD;
      and daily until day 28 or treatment) consisting of periodic physical examinations, frequent&#xD;
      blood sampling and recording of adverse events in their diary. All relevant investigations&#xD;
      will be carried out on an outpatient basis, including frequent safety analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants should have access to a mobile phone upon which they can be reached 24 hours per&#xD;
      day and 7 days per week. As additional safety precaution, participants are required to stay&#xD;
      in a hotel/hostel close to the study facility from day 5 post-infection until 3 days after&#xD;
      treatment. This mandatory stay in a hotel/hostel is to ensure study participants can be&#xD;
      observed at all times and have excellent access to the clinical team. All participants will&#xD;
      be treated with a curative regimen of artemether-lumefantrine that radically clears asexual&#xD;
      parasites and developing gametocytes. The criteria for treatment post-CHMI will include&#xD;
      positive thick smear during follow-up, decision of the study clinician or the local safety&#xD;
      monitor, on request of the participant or on day 28 post-CHMI. All participants will be&#xD;
      checked for parasites by thick smear at least twice after treatment.&#xD;

    <description>this is a basic sciences protocol designed to study the effect of pre-exposure to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) on malaria parasite kinetics, clinical symptoms and immunity after Controlled Human Malaria Infection by administration of an injection PfSPZ Challenge in Gambian adults. Based on a well-defined serological profile representing the extremes of current malaria exposure in The Gambia, two cohorts will be identified to study the impact of naturally acquired immunity on susceptibility for a Controlled Human Malaria Infection. The classification as a clinical trial results from the administration of the PfSPZ Challenge to the healthy volunteers</description>
