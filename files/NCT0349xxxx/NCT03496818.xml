  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is often suggested that lymphatic vessels are ineffective in transporting cargo in Crohn's&#xD;
      disease. Our own work on surgically resected tissue supports this concept (1), but the&#xD;
      concept has not been directly tested. Chylomicrons are packaged lipids from the diet with an&#xD;
      obligatory absorption route through the lymphatic vasculature to reach host plasma. This&#xD;
      protocol takes an approach to directly quantify chylomicron secretion using a fatty meal that&#xD;
      incorporates stable isotopic tracers for trioleate and cholesterol in the meal. We will&#xD;
      collect baseline plasma and then plasma every 30 minutes for 6 hours to chart the kinetic and&#xD;
      magnitude of chylomicron secretion and transport in all subjects using mass spectrometry&#xD;
      analysis. We will characterize a wide variety of parameters on the chylomicrons as well using&#xD;
      ELISA. Infusions i.v. of stable isotope labeled triglyceride and glycerol will allow us to&#xD;
      consider whether there are changes in VLDL metabolism that could account for differences in&#xD;
      chylomicron handling once the chylomicrons are secreted into plasma. Collection and analysis&#xD;
      of breath samples will also be carried to normalize against possible incomplete lipid&#xD;
      absorption in some subjects.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B1 Prior Literature and Studies Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by spontaneous, chronic&#xD;
      relapsing and remitting inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The underlying etiology&#xD;
      of the disease is unknown but it likely develops secondary to an environmental stimulus in a&#xD;
      genetically predisposed person that results in a dysregulated immune response to the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiome. Considerable effort has been paid to understanding the role of the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiome, the genetic susceptibilities at play, and the immunology behind the&#xD;
      condition to tailor treatments aimed at reducing inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the advent of current medical therapies a defining characteristic of CD noted by&#xD;
      early pathologists evaluating tissue specimen's was a significant alteration of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal lymphatic system with lymphocytic thrombi, aggregates of lymphocytes and&#xD;
      granuloma-obstructed lymphatics consistent with chronic lymphangitis (2). Furthermore, early&#xD;
      researchers showed that obstructing segments of the regional lymphatics of the small&#xD;
      intestine resulted in a segmental intestinal disease similar to CD (3). Immunohistochemical&#xD;
      staining has confirmed the presence of lymphangiectasias, lymphocytic perilymphangitis,&#xD;
      lymphocyte or granuloma obstructed lymphatics and inflammatory lymphoid follicles in patients&#xD;
      with CD (4). Upstream of these obstructed lymphatics the vessels remain distended with&#xD;
      lymphocytes (5). More recent studies have shown that lymphatic density is also significantly&#xD;
      increased in the ileal and colonic tissue of patients with CD (6). Furthermore, the&#xD;
      relationship between intestinal health and lymphatics has been highlighted in studies that&#xD;
      found certain types of bacteria and viruses had resulted in a profoundly remodeled mesenteric&#xD;
      lymphatic system. Findings included the development of chronic lymphadenopathy and increased&#xD;
      permeability, similar to what is seen in CD (7). Given the prominent structural changes that&#xD;
      occur to the mesenteric lymphatic system in CD (1), studies are needed to evaluate if&#xD;
      lymphatic function is altered as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chylomicrons are cholesterol and triacylglycerol rich lipoproteins synthesized by the small&#xD;
      intestine and transported through the lymphatics. Thus, oral uptake of trioleate and&#xD;
      cholesterol will lead to incorporation of the tracers into chylomicrons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using ELISA and mass spectrometric analysis these labelled chylomicrons can be quantitated in&#xD;
      the serum, thus serving as a marker of absorption and transit through the lymphatics. Studies&#xD;
      of healthy subjects have utilized this validated means to assess lymphatic uptake and&#xD;
      transport. After ingestion, there is a delay of &lt;60 minutes in the appearance of 13C labelled&#xD;
      chylomicrons in the serum, with a peak occurring between 180 and 240 minutes. Our protocol is&#xD;
      designed to take advantage of the knowledge that other oral tracer studies at Washington&#xD;
      University have learned in optimizing such studies, including ongoing studies by Dr. Todd&#xD;
      Cade that focuses on chylomicron secretion in pre-diabetic patients. Our study will evaluate&#xD;
      patients with significant small bowel CD and compare them to healthy controls using a similar&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study would be the first to evaluate the quantitative function of lymphatics in&#xD;
      CD. It would provide the basis for further studies evaluating the mesenteric lymphatics and&#xD;
      their role in the pathogenesis of CD and as a treatment target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      C1 Primary Aim Follow lymphatic vessel transported cargo in Crohn's disease patients with&#xD;
      small bowel involvement as a way to assess possible defects in the lymphatic system in&#xD;
      patients compared with healthy control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C2 Secondary Aim Characterize changes in pre- and post-prandial lipid metabolism resulting&#xD;
      from Crohn's disease affecting the small bowel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C3 Tertiary Aim Carry out lipidomic analyses to determine if chylomicrons absorbed from the&#xD;
      small bowel carry distinct microbial lipid signatures compared with healthy control subjects&#xD;
      (eg., LPS, commendamide (8)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C4 Quaternary Aim Measure lipid absorption from the intestine using 13CO2 breath analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      D1 Overview or Design Summary This study will utilize a 2-group trial design in which 40&#xD;
      participants (20 CD patients and 20 controls) will visit once for this feeding (oral tracer)&#xD;
      and infusion study, following an overnight fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the Washington University School of Medicine IBD Center,&#xD;
      Washington University's Volunteers for Health, the Center for Community Based Research, and&#xD;
      IBD clinics affiliated with Washington University in the surrounding St. Louis community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator, collaborating physicians, and study coordinator(s) will be&#xD;
      responsible for identifying participants through the use of posters, email, and existing&#xD;
      participant databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      E1 Screening for Eligibility IBD Center staff will identify eligible subjects from the&#xD;
      patient arm. By phone, each participant will be asked a series of preliminary screening&#xD;
      questions to determine immediate expulsion from the study based on exclusion and inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The purpose of the study, and a brief overview of the procedures, time-commitment,&#xD;
      and compensation will be discussed over the phone prior to the individual agreeing to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E2 Study Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 7:00 AM: Subject reports to the Clinical Research Unit at Washington University School&#xD;
           of Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The subject will be asked to skip breakfast and report to the Clinical Research&#xD;
                Unit after an overnight fast (&gt; 8 hours) with nothing taken by mouth except water.&#xD;
                Subjects will be asked to avoid caffeine and alcohol for at least 24 h before&#xD;
                admission for the study visit. The day prior to the study visit, subjects will be&#xD;
                provided instructions for a standardized meal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner&#xD;
                containing a total of 2,165 calories (46% of total energy from carbohydrates, 40%&#xD;
                from fat, and 14% from protein). A liquid formula (Ensure; Ross Laboratories,&#xD;
                Columbus, OH) containing 250 kcal (40 g carbohydrates, 6.1 g fat, and 8.8 g&#xD;
                protein) to ensure complete filling of hepatic glycogen stores as a snack before&#xD;
                bedtime. This snack is included in the total calories stated above.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The participant will have his/her height and weight measured using the electronic&#xD;
                weight scale and stadiometer within the Clinical Research Unit. BMI will be&#xD;
                calculated from height and weight using the formula: [mass(kg)/[height(meters)2].&#xD;
                Blood pressure will be measured and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The participant will complete a medical history questionnaire, which includes&#xD;
                obtaining a list of current medications. Completion of the questionnaire may occur&#xD;
                following the baseline blood draw and meal administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A catheter will be inserted into the other antecubital vein to obtain blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 8 AM: Metabolism Study: Baseline Period: Baseline blood and breath samples to determine&#xD;
           background enrichment of isotopes. Then the subject will then consume a liquid test meal&#xD;
           prepared by CRU nutrition staff consisting of 27 g Sol Carb, 1032 g Boost Plus, 3.2 g&#xD;
           canola oil, 0.2 g lecithin, 5 mg/kg of [1,2, 3, 7, 8-13C8] glyceryl trioleate, and 40 g&#xD;
           of water. Participants will be asked to consume the liquid meal within 20 minutes for&#xD;
           consistency, with the sides of the container scraped to ensure maximal ingestion.&#xD;
           Additionally, 30 minutes after consuming the meal a 75 micromol/kg bolus infusion of&#xD;
           (1,1,2,3,3-2H5)glycerol will be initiated to track VLDL catabolism. Blood and breath&#xD;
           samples will be collected at 0, 15. 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300, and 360&#xD;
           minutes post-meal ingestion. Indirect calorimetry will also be administered using the&#xD;
           ventilated hood technique for 10 minutes prior to each breath sample collection to&#xD;
           determine resting metabolic rate for tracer calculations and measurement of total fatty&#xD;
           acid oxidation. Blood samples will be analyzed for tracer enrichment and total&#xD;
           concentration of free fatty acids, triglycerides, and cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 2 pm: Lunch will be served by CRU, prepared by CRU kitchen. End of Study Visit.&#xD;
