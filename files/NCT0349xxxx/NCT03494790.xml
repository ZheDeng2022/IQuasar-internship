  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with suspected or confirmed infection and who will be sampled for blood&#xD;
      culture will be recruited. Blood samples are collected for the analysis of matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinases (MMP) and their inhibitors. We also aim to analyse metabolic changes and&#xD;
      use the samples for analysis of blood lactate, metabolomics, and fibroblast growth factor 21&#xD;
      (FGF-21) as well. The primary aim of the study is to test the performance of MMP-8 in finding&#xD;
      severely ill patients who will need treatment in high dependency unit or intensive care. The&#xD;
      secondary aim is to study the metabolic changes in acutely ill patients with infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with suspected or confirmed infection and who will be sampled for blood&#xD;
      culture (a surrogate for suspected severe infection) will be recruited from three large&#xD;
      emergency departments in a University hospital. Two blood samples will be collected: one for&#xD;
      the analysis of matrix metalloproteinases, their inhibitor tissue inhibitor of&#xD;
      metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), FGF-21 and metabolomic analyses. Another blood sample is for&#xD;
      the analysis of blood lactate. Clinical data will be collected to calculate quick SOFA&#xD;
      (qSOFA), in order to test whether lactate and/or MMP-8 will improve the prognostic model if&#xD;
      they are added to qSOFA. The primary outcome measure is the number of days alive without the&#xD;
      need for ICU or high dependency unit treatment. The ability of MMP-8 to discriminate severe&#xD;
      infection from uneventful course of the disease will be studied. The secondary aim is to&#xD;
      study the metabolic changes in acutely ill patients with infection and compare these&#xD;
      variables between survivors and non-survivors. The planned number of patients recruited is&#xD;
      924. During this study the feasibility of a bedside rapid analysis of MMP-8 will be tested in&#xD;
      30 patients and the results obtained using the rapid analyser compared with laboratory&#xD;
      results obtained using ELISA.&#xD;
