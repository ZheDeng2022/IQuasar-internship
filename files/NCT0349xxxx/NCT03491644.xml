    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to investigate whether treatment with oxygen in the early&#xD;
      phases after a trauma plays a role in recovery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxygen is probably the most frequently used drug both in the prehospital and emergency&#xD;
      setting. It is cheap, easily administered, and, at least for shorter time frames, widely&#xD;
      believed to be without any risk of harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with oxygen is indicated in the state of hypoxemia in order to prevent hypoxic&#xD;
      organ damage, however, oxygen is administered in many other situations too, sometimes in a&#xD;
      non-consistent manner and very often without even being prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notably, administration of un-titrated oxygen, introduces a risk of hyperoxia which has been&#xD;
      associated with serious adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective studies on patients with cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction (MI) and&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury have found hyperoxia to be associated with increased mortality and ICU&#xD;
      length of stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized trial also found an increased rate of recurrent myocardial infarction in a&#xD;
      high-concentration oxygen group. Furthermore, in patients undergoing surgery, high&#xD;
      intraoperative FiO2 has been associated with major respiratory complications and with 30-day&#xD;
      mortality. In ICU patients, an observational study as well as a randomized trial found high&#xD;
      levels of oxygen to be associated with higher mortality compared to conservative oxygen&#xD;
      treatment. In particular, the randomized trial found that patients with PaO2 between 70 and&#xD;
      100 mmHg had a mortality of 11.6% compared to 20.2% in patients managed in accordance with&#xD;
      standard ICU practice (which allows PaO2 up to 150mmHg) (p=0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For people between the ages of 5 and 44 years, trauma is one of the top three causes of&#xD;
      death. Almost twice as many men as women die as a result of trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Victims of trauma are often healthy individuals prior to the incident, but acquire numerous&#xD;
      complications including sepsis and pulmonary complications as well as long-term complications&#xD;
      and diminished quality of life after the trauma. Understanding the reasons behind these&#xD;
      complications and poor outcomes and optimizing care is therefore essential to increase&#xD;
      survival rates and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the trauma population, oxygen administration is often standard of care. However, the&#xD;
      evidence supporting oxygen administration in this population appears to be extremely limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, absorption atelectases have been shown to develop within minutes under an&#xD;
      oxygen fraction of 1.0, and are strongly related to the development of pneumonia. Indeed, a&#xD;
      recent retrospective study found hyperoxemia to be an independent risk factor for ventilator&#xD;
      associated pneumonia (VAP). As the incidences of hyperoxemia in mechanically ventilated&#xD;
      patients range from 16-50% and the incidence of pneumonia in general in the Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (ICU) is close to 26%, and reported to be up to twice as high in the trauma population,&#xD;
      studies are warranted to establish the impact of a restricted, but sufficient, oxygen&#xD;
      strategy vs a liberal oxygen strategy in the trauma population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate whether the maintenance of pragmatic&#xD;
      normoxia, avoiding both hyperoxic and hypoxic phases, is feasible within the first 24 hours&#xD;
      after trauma, as it may result in a reduction of 30-day mortality and major respiratory&#xD;
      complications within 30 days (respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and pneumonia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will therefore conduct a pilot study, where 40 evaluable patients are&#xD;
      randomized to 24 hours of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A. Restrictive, but sufficient oxygen treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Lowest oxygen delivery that obtains a saturation of ≥ 94% (within the low limits of&#xD;
           standard of care and does thus not put patients at risk of receiving worse treatment.&#xD;
           Hypoxic phases will be avoided.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B. Liberal oxygen treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  15 L/min oxygen flow initially/ FiO2 ≥0.8. (Considered as close as possible to the&#xD;
                standard of care. As no precise guidelines on oxygen delivery for trauma patients&#xD;
                within the first 24 hours exist, this will however inevitably vary in practice. We&#xD;
                have therefore set the delivery to be in the high end of the varying standard of&#xD;
                care.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that hospitalized trauma patients treated with liberal oxygen&#xD;
      therapy during the first 24 hours after trauma will have a greater risk of death and major&#xD;
      respiratory complications compared to trauma patients treated with restrictive oxygen. The&#xD;
      investigators realize that this cannot be assessed in this pilot study, but it is crucial to&#xD;
      know if the study is feasible before doing a large and adequately powered trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Composite Primary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • 30-day mortality and major respiratory complications within 30 days (pneumonia, acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury (ALI)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intensive Care Unit length of stay (ICU LOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital length of Stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days on ventilator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 days post-trauma (through telephone follow-up if discharged)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pneumonia&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Intervention: restrictive oxygen treatment for the first 24 hours. This implies administration of the lowest dosage of oxygen possible in order to achieve a saturation of 94%, using mechanical ventilation (intubated patients), a nasal cannula, a non-rebreather or nothing. A saturation above 94% shall not be aimed for using supplemental oxygen, and thus only patients without oxygen requirement shall have saturations above 94%.&#xD;
Control: liberal oxygen treatment for the first 24 hours. In the trauma bay and during intrahospital transportation this implies an FiO2 of 1.0 for intubated patients and an oxygen flow on a non-rebreather with reservoir of 15 l/min for non-intubated patients. In the OR, patients will receive a FiO2 of ≥ 0.8 to obtain a saturation of ≥ 98%. Patients admitted to the ICU/PACU/floor will receive and FiO2 of ≥ 0.8 or more to obtain a saturation of ≥ 98% when intubated and for non-intubated patients a non-rebreather with reservoir will be set to 15 l/min.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The study will be an open-label randomized clinical trial with regards to treatment: treating staff will be aware of the patient's randomization group.&#xD;
Outcome assessors (attending anesthesiologist for pneumonia and research assistant for long term outcomes (GOSE after 30 days, ARDS* within 30 days, pneumonia diagnosed after discharge within 30 days)) will be blinded to the patients' randomization.&#xD;
To ensure blinding, prior to assessing the outcomes, all information indicative of the allocation will be censured by the PI.&#xD;
To validate the blinding, the attending anesthesiologist and research assistant assessing outcome variables will be asked to guess which group of randomization the patient is in.&#xD;
ARDS: PaO2/FiO2 will be calculated for the assessor in order to maintain blinding.</masking_description>

    <description>Liberal oxygen administration (to mimic current practice) for the first 24 hours without interruption.&#xD;
In the trauma bay and during intrahospital transportation this implies administration of a FiO2 of 1.0 for intubated patients and an oxygen flow on a non-rebreather with reservoir of 15 l/min for non-intubated patients. In the operating room, patients will receive a FiO2 of ≥ 0.8 to obtain a saturation of ≥ 98%. Patients admitted to the ICU/PACU/floor will receive and FiO2 of ≥ 0.8 or more to obtain a saturation of ≥ 98% when intubated and for non-intubated patients a non-rebreather with reservoir will be set to 15 l/min.</description>

    <description>Titrated oxygen administration for the first 24 hours without interruption. Lowest dosage of oxygen possible in order to achieve a saturation of at least 94%, either using mechanical ventilation (intubated patients), a nasal cannula, a non-rebreather or nothing.&#xD;
A saturation above 94% shall not be aimed for using supplemental oxygen, and thus only patients without oxygen requirement shall have saturations above 94%.&#xD;
The intervention will only be interrupted in case the saturation becomes unmeasurable - if this happens, the treating physician shall treat the patient as he/she judges best fit. As soon as the saturation is measurable again, the intervention will resume. The treating physician must document and explain the situation.</description>
