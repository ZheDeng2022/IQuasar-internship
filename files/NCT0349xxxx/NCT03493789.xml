  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well fludeoxyglucose F-18 - positron emission tomography (PET) works&#xD;
      in planning radiation therapy in participants with early non-small cell lung cancer, early&#xD;
      stage lung cancer, or cancer that has spread to lungs from other parts of the body. Using PET&#xD;
      in addition to the standard computed tomography to plan radiation therapy for cancer may help&#xD;
      doctors to maximize the dose to the cancer and minimize the dose to normal tissues.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum inter-fraction variability of fludeoxyglucose F-18 (18-F FDG)-PET&#xD;
      activity of thoracic tumor treatment volumes through a 5-fraction stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy (SBRT) course as it relates to the planning feasibility of emission-guided radiation&#xD;
      therapy, or biologically-guided radiation therapy (BgRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare similar inter-fraction variability of FDG-PET activity for non-thoracic SBRT&#xD;
      target volumes for the purpose of determining the feasibility of BgRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare dosimetric endpoints for primary tumor coverage and dose to organs at risk&#xD;
      between conventional SBRT planning and simulated BgRT, or emission-guided radiation therapy&#xD;
      planning for thoracic and non-thoracic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare dosimetry for primary tumor coverage and dose to organs at risk between&#xD;
      adaptive cone beam computed tomography (CT) planning, and simulated adaptive emission-guided&#xD;
      radiation therapy (BgRT) planning for thoracic and non-thoracic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare variability of 18-F FDG-PET in patients undergoing immunotherapy&#xD;
      simultaneously during SBRT, or within 4 weeks of SBRT treatment with patients undergoing SBRT&#xD;
      but not receiving immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive fludeoxyglucose F-18 intravenously (IV) and after 60 minutes undergo PET&#xD;
      within 4 weeks of the first planned SBRT fraction, prior to the second planned fraction, and&#xD;
      prior to the fifth planned fraction.&#xD;
