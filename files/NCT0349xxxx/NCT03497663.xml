    <textblock>
      This RCT aims to investigate the effect of an early family-based intervention (VIA Family)&#xD;
      focusing on reducing risk and increasing resilience for children in families where at least&#xD;
      one parent has a severe mental illness.The study is a randomized clinical trial including 100&#xD;
      children age 6-12 with familial high risk.The children and their parents will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and thereafter randomized and allocated to either Treatment as Usual or VIA Family.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background: Children born to parents with severe mental illness like schizophrenia, bipolar&#xD;
      disorder or major recurrent depression have an increased risk of developing a mental illness&#xD;
      themselves during life. These children are also more likely to display developmental delays,&#xD;
      cognitive disabilities, social problems and may have a higher risk than background population&#xD;
      of experiencing adverse life events. This is due to both genetic and environmental factors,&#xD;
      but in spite of the well documented increased risk for children with familial high risk no&#xD;
      family-based early intervention has been developed. This study aims to investigate the effect&#xD;
      of an early intervention model focusing on reducing risk and increasing resilience for&#xD;
      children in families where at least one parent has a severe mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study is a randomized clinical trial including 100 children age 6-12 with&#xD;
      familial high risk. Families will be recruited from registers or be referred from the primary&#xD;
      sector or from hospitals. The children and their parents will be assessed at baseline and&#xD;
      thereafter randomized and allocated to either Treatment as Usual or VIA Family. In the VIA&#xD;
      Family group the families will be offered regular contact with a case manager. A&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team of specialists from Adult Mental Health Services, Child and Adolescent&#xD;
      Mental Health Services and Social Services will be responsible for providing the basic&#xD;
      treatment elements that are: case management, psychoeducation for the whole family, parental&#xD;
      training (Triple P) and early intervention for mental problems of the child. The study period&#xD;
      is 18 months for both groups and all participants will be assessed at baseline and after 18&#xD;
      months. Primary outcome measure will be daily functioning of the child (CGAS), and secondary&#xD;
      measures are psychopathology in the child and days of school absence, family functioning and&#xD;
      child's home environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This study is to the investigators knowledge the first to explore the effects on&#xD;
      children with familial high risk for severe mental illness of a multidisciplinary team&#xD;
      intervention providing an intensive and flexible support matching the families' needs. The&#xD;
      study will provide important knowledge about the possibilities of increasing resilience and&#xD;
      reducing risk of a child by supporting the whole family. However, longer follow-up time may&#xD;
      be needed.&#xD;
