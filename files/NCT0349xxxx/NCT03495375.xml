  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicentre randomized double-blind placebo controlled parallel design (10 weeks) study&#xD;
      investigating probiotic supplementation in highly impulsive adults (18-65 yrs; N=180). The&#xD;
      probiotic studied is Synbiotic2000Forte that contain three well-studied anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      lactic acid bacteria (LABs) and four fermentable fibers: Pediococcus pentosaceus 5-33:3,&#xD;
      Lactobacillus paracasei subsp paracasei 19, and Lactobacillus plantarum 2362 in combination&#xD;
      with the following four fermentable fibres: betaglucan, inulin, pectin and resistant starch.&#xD;
      With this study we aim to detect, whether treatment with probiotics is effective in adults&#xD;
      with high levels of impulsivity, compulsivity, and aggression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impulsivity is a cross-disorder trait relevant in several psychiatric disorders, e.g.&#xD;
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).&#xD;
      They place a significant burden on patients, families and society in general. Only adults&#xD;
      (aged 18 - 65 years) with a diagnosis of ADHD and/or BPD will be included in this study. We&#xD;
      will also try to include at least 30% female participants to gender-balance the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and treatment of participants will be provided at three trial centres: Vall&#xD;
      d'Hebron Research Institute (VHIR), Goethe University Frankfurt (GU), Semmelweis University&#xD;
      (SU), each enrolling 60 participants. Randomization to receive either Synbiotic2000Forte or&#xD;
      placebo will be performed when signed informed assent by the participant has been obtained,&#xD;
      eligibility checks have been conducted and at baseline assessment. An independent&#xD;
      randomization service (www.randomization.com) will be used to ensure reliability and&#xD;
      credibility in the randomization process. The study is double-blinded; neither the&#xD;
      participants nor the clinicians involved in the study will have access to the randomization&#xD;
      list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this placebo-controlled 10-week, we will evaluate a probiotic formula for oral&#xD;
      administration called Synbiotic2000Forte (SF). Participants will take the probiotic once&#xD;
      daily in the form of a powder that can be spread on top of cold foods such as muesli, salad,&#xD;
      or yoghurt. Placebo will be a non-digestable carbohydrate with similar texture and flavor to&#xD;
      the SF. Participants will be assessed at baseline before treatment is started (baseline&#xD;
      demographics and primary- and secondary outcome measures will be collected and then monitored&#xD;
      every five weeks for a total of 5 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper conduct of data collection in the trial will be monitored by on-site visits of a&#xD;
      monitoring staff throughout the study, and quality of data collected will further be&#xD;
      monitored regularly by a statistical supervision team. Questionnaire data will be collected&#xD;
      through Castor. All information collected in this study will remain strictly confidential.&#xD;
      Data of participants will be coded in such a way that participants cannot be identified from&#xD;
      the corresponding data according to the regulations (unique pseudocode identifier).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki,&#xD;
      version of 2008 and in accordance with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act&#xD;
      (WMO, as well as according to the ICH GCP Guideline E6 (1996), EU Directive 2001/20/EC and&#xD;
      applicable regulatory requirements and guidelines in the participating countries/regions.&#xD;
      Before the first subject has been enrolled in the trial, all ethical and legal requirements&#xD;
      were met.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline assessment and again at weeks 5 and 10.</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by Conners' Continuous Performance Test II (CPTII). Assessment duration: 14min.&#xD;
Physicological parameter assessed:&#xD;
- Detectability (d'): this is a measure of how well the respondent discriminates non-targets (i.e. the letter X) from targets (i.e. all the other letters). This variable is also a signal detection statistic that measures the difference between the signal (targets) and noise (non-targets) distributions. On the Conners CPT-II, d' is reverse scored so that higher raw score and T-score values indicate worse performance (i.e. poorer discrimination)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in neurocognitive measure: Omissions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment and again at weeks 5 and 10.</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by Conners' Continuous Performance Test II (CPTII). Assessment duration: 14min.&#xD;
Physicological parameter assessed:&#xD;
- Omissions (%): Omissions are missed targets. High omissions error rates indicate that the respondent was not responding to the target stimuli due to a specific reason (e.g. difficulty focusing). Omission errors are generally an indicator of inattentiveness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in neurocognitive measure: Commissions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment and again at weeks 5 and 10.</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by Conners' Continuous Performance Test II (CPTII). Assessment duration: 14min.&#xD;
Physicological parameter assessed:&#xD;
- Commissions (%): Commissions are incorrect responses to non-targets. Depending on the respondent's HRT, high commission error rates may indicate either inattentiveness or impulsivity. If high commission error rates are coupled with slow reaction times, then the respondent was likely inattentive to the stimulus type being presented and thus responded to a high rate of non-targets. If high commission error rates are combined with fast reaction times, the respondent was likely rushing to respond and failed to control his or her impulses when responding to the non-targets. In the latter case, high commission error rates would reflect impulsivity rather than inattentiveness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in neurocognitive measure: Perseverations</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment and again at weeks 5 and 10.</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by Conners' Continuous Performance Test II (CPTII). Assessment duration: 14min.&#xD;
Physicological parameter assessed:&#xD;
- Perseverations (%): Perseverations are responses that are made in less than 100 milliseconds following the presentation of a stimulus. Normal expectations of physiological ability to respond make it virtually impossible for a respondent to perceive and react to a stimulus so quickly. Perseverations are unusually either slow responses to a preceding stimulus, a random response, an anticipatory response, or a repeated response without consideration of the task requirements. Perseverations may be related to impulsivity or an extremely liberal response style. Perseverations are, therefore, likely the result of anticipatory, repetitive, or impulsive responding.</description>

    <measure>Change in neurocognitive measure: Hit Reaction Time (HRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment and again at weeks 5 and 10.</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by Conners' Continuous Performance Test II (CPTII). Assessment duration: 14min.&#xD;
Physicological parameter assessed:&#xD;
- Hit Reaction Time (HRT): HRT is the mean response speed, measured in milliseconds, for all non-perseverative responses made during the entire administration. An atypically slow HRT may indicate inattentiveness (especially when error rates are high), but it may also be the results of a very conservative response style. Alternatively, a very fast HRT, when combined with high commission error rates, may indicate impulsivity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in neurocognitive measure: Hit Reaction Time Standard Deviation (HRT SD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment and again at weeks 5 and 10.</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by Conners' Continuous Performance Test II (CPTII). Assessment duration: 14min. .&#xD;
Physicological parameter assessed:&#xD;
- Hit Reaction Time Standard Deviation (HRT SD): HRT SD measures the consistency of response speed to targets for the entire administration. A high HRT SD indicates greater inconsistency in response speed. Response speed inconsistency is sometimes indicative of an inattentiveness, suggesting that the respondent was less engaged and processed stimuli less efficiently during some parts of the administration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in neurocognitive measure: Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment and again at weeks 5 and 10.</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by Conners' Continuous Performance Test II (CPTII). Assessment duration: 14min.&#xD;
Physicological parameter assessed:&#xD;
- Variability: Variability, like HRT SD, is a measure of response speed consistency, however, Variability is a &quot;within respondent&quot; measure (i.e. the amount of variability the respondent showed in 18 separate sub-blocks of the administration in relation to his or her overall HRT SD score). Although Variability is a different measure than HRT SD, the two measures typically produce comparable results and are both related to inattentiveness. High response speed variability indicates that the respondent's attention and processing efficiency varied throughout the administration.</description>
