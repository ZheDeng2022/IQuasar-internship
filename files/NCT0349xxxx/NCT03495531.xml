  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if non-invasive distracting devices (Virtual&#xD;
      Reality headset) are more effective than the standard of care (i.e., no technology based&#xD;
      distraction) for preventing anxiety and pain scores in women who are undergoing child&#xD;
      laboring procedures. The anticipated primary outcome will be a reduction of pregnant females&#xD;
      overall anxiety and pain scores before and after such procedure(s), including but not limited&#xD;
      to epidural/combined spinal epidural (CSE), IV placement and/or labor.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Phase 1 There will be 3 stages that are sequentially and chronologically timed in order to&#xD;
      asses the efficacy of Virtual Reality (VR) in the reducing epidural/combined spinal-epidural&#xD;
      (CSE) related pain and anxiety at every stage. Phase 1 is the development phase where the&#xD;
      focus is primarily on feasibility for Phase 2. The exclusion criteria will remain the same&#xD;
      for all the stages and includes (i) participants and patients who do not consent (ii) have&#xD;
      significant cognitive impairment (iii) have a history of severe motion sickness (iv)&#xD;
      currently have nausea (v) currently experiencing seizures (vi) have visual problems(vii) are&#xD;
      clinically unstable or require urgent/emergent intervention and/or (viii) are Non-English&#xD;
      Speaking. Inclusion criteria is that females are (i)18 years or older and (ii) who had either&#xD;
      have a history of, planning to have, or currently having an child laboring related procedures&#xD;
      such as IV placement, epidural/CSE placement and/or labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Stage 1) The first stage will include 10 females who are not pregnant, but have previously&#xD;
      have at least undergone one labor epidural/CSE in the past. These mothers will be approached&#xD;
      by a clinician or healthcare provider at Lucille Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH)&#xD;
      outpatient surgical procedures as they wait for their child. If they are interested, the&#xD;
      healthcare provider will let the research staff know of the eligible participant. During the&#xD;
      mother's wait time, the research assistant will review the study, go over the consent forms&#xD;
      and answer any questions in regards to their participation in the study. Once the participant&#xD;
      is consented into the study, the research assistant will provide the participant with a&#xD;
      survey regarding their recall pain and anxiety (refer to section 16) during their most recent&#xD;
      epidural (if participant has had previously had more than one). The research assistant will&#xD;
      then provide the participant with a VR headset and guide them through a series of VR scenery,&#xD;
      shortly after the VR simulation the participant will be given a feedback survey in regards to&#xD;
      their VR experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Stage 2) The second stage will include 10 different females who are currently either in&#xD;
      their second or third trimester of pregnancy. These mothers will be approached by a clinician&#xD;
      or healthcare provider during their visits to obstetrics clinic at LPCH and Stanford Health&#xD;
      Care (SHC) facilities. If they are interested, the healthcare provider will let the research&#xD;
      staff know of the eligible participant. During the patients wait time, the research assistant&#xD;
      will review the study, go over the consent forms and answer any questions in regards to their&#xD;
      participation in the study. Once the participant is consented into the study, the research&#xD;
      assistant will provide the participant with a survey regarding their current anxiety about&#xD;
      labor and epidural/CSE placement. The research assistant will then provide the participant&#xD;
      with a VR headset and guide them through a series of VR scenery, shortly after the VR&#xD;
      simulation the participant will be given a feedback survey in regards to their VR experience.&#xD;
      Since this cohort can give the investigators better guidance of intolerance (i.e nausea and&#xD;
      dizziness) during VR simulation, the clinicians and research providers have come up with a&#xD;
      safety threshold: if more than 20 percent of patients answer to a score of 4 or higher on&#xD;
      questions regarding nausea and dizziness, the clinicians and health care providers will have&#xD;
      to go back and iterate on VR software and repeat the previous stage before moving on stage 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Stage 3) If stage 2 outcomes meet the investigator's criteria, the clinical team will move&#xD;
      on to the last stage of 10 different females who are currently in labor and planning on&#xD;
      undergoing an epidural for child-laboring. These mothers will be approached by their&#xD;
      obstetric anesthesiologist during their first anesthesia consult after being admitted into&#xD;
      LPCH labor and delivery facilities. If they are interested, the anesthesiologist will let the&#xD;
      research staff know of the eligible participant. During the patients wait time, the research&#xD;
      assistant and/or anesthesiologist will review the study, go over the consent forms and answer&#xD;
      any questions in regards to their participation in the study. Once the patient is consented&#xD;
      into the study, the research assistant and/or anesthesiologist will provide the participant&#xD;
      with a survey regarding their pre-epidural anxiety and pain scores. The anesthesiologist&#xD;
      and/or research assistant will then provide the laboring mother with a VR headset during&#xD;
      epidural/CSE placement by anesthesiologist. Depending on the mother's laboring timeline, if&#xD;
      possible, mother will receive VR feedback survey and post-epidural anxiety and pain scores.&#xD;
      If not, mothers will receive post-epidural anxiety and pain scores where they recall these&#xD;
      scores and fill out VR feedback survey postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on preliminary and feasibility data from Phase 1, if the clinicians and study personnel&#xD;
      find it appropriate, the study will move on to Phase 2, a randomized prospective clinical&#xD;
      trial focused more broadly on technology based distractions (VR headsets) in comparison to&#xD;
      standard of care (no VR use) in obstetric patients for preventing anxiety and pain during&#xD;
      various laboring procedures. These laboring procedures include but are not limited to IV,&#xD;
      epidural/CSE placement and/or child-labor. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will remain the&#xD;
      same as Phase 1. For Phase 2, the study personnel expect to enroll 200 mothers who've been&#xD;
      admitted into LPCH labor and delivery services. These mothers will be approached by their&#xD;
      obstetric anesthesiologist during their first anesthesia consult after being admitted into&#xD;
      LPCH labor and delivery facilities. If they are interested, the anesthesiologist will let the&#xD;
      research staff know of the eligible participant. During the patients wait time, the research&#xD;
      assistant and/or anesthesiologist will review the study, go over the consent forms and answer&#xD;
      any questions in regards to their participation in the study. Once the patient is consented&#xD;
      into the study, the research assistant and/or anesthesiologist will provide the participant&#xD;
      with a survey regarding their pre-procedure anxiety and pain scores. Depending on a&#xD;
      randomized generator, mothers will either be placed into VR use group during procedure or&#xD;
      standard of care (no VR use). If mother falls under VR group, the anesthesiologist and/or&#xD;
      research assistant will then provide the laboring mother with a VR headset during procedure&#xD;
      by anesthesiologist. Depending on the mother's laboring timeline, if possible, mother will&#xD;
      receive VR feedback survey and post- procedure anxiety and pain scores. If not, mothers will&#xD;
      receive post-epidural anxiety and pain scores where they recall these scores and fill out VR&#xD;
      feedback survey postpartum. If mother falls under control group, mother will undergo standard&#xD;
      of care and receive pre and post- pain and anxiety surveys regarding procedure.&#xD;
