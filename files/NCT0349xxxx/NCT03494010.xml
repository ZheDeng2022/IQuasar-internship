  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' primary aim is to determine the impact of using hybrid closed-loop (HCL)&#xD;
      system in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) prior to&#xD;
      kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also determine whether HCL, by improving glucose control, will affect&#xD;
      short-term (1 month) and long-term (12 months) complications after kidney transplantation in&#xD;
      patients with T1D.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to recruit up to 25 patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) being&#xD;
      evaluated for a living donor kidney transplantation. These patients will be followed up to 1&#xD;
      year after the surgery. Participants will be recruited from the Yale Transplantation Center.&#xD;
      Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) and T1D referred to the pre-transplantation&#xD;
      clinic who have a living kidney donor and who are being considered candidates for a hybrid&#xD;
      closed-loop (HCL) system as part of routine care, will be asked to participate in this study.&#xD;
      Patients who show interest in the HCL system are already being referred to the Yale&#xD;
      Transplant-Endocrine Clinic and/or the Yale Diabetes Center to be evaluated for feasibility&#xD;
      of using the HCL. Patients will also be approached about the study, once prescribed the HCL&#xD;
      670G system, to be used until the surgery, as standard of care (SOC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HCL system will be prescribed as part of a standard care for patients with T1D willing to&#xD;
      optimize their glucose control prior to surgery. The HCL system will not be provided by the&#xD;
      research investigators. Also as part of SOC, MedtronicÂ® will provide initial training (1st&#xD;
      month) and technical support for the patients. Plan for routine care use: The HCL system will&#xD;
      be removed during the hospital admission for the transplantation surgery and restarted after&#xD;
      hospital discharge. Participants will be followed at the Yale Diabetes Center (YDC) and/or&#xD;
      the Yale Transplant-Endocrine Clinic (YTEC) for management of diabetes and management of HCL&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen monthly prior to the kidney transplantation. After the surgery, they&#xD;
      will come to the YDC/YTEC clinics monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months&#xD;
      afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information to be collected as part of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood glucose control test results: hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Other blood and urine test results pertinent to the protocol, such as: complete blood&#xD;
           count (CBC), chemistry, kidney and liver function tests, glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
           (GFR), urinary protein/albumin&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. HCL system and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) report: average glucose, standard&#xD;
           deviation (SD), indices of glucose variability (coefficient of variation), in target&#xD;
           glucose levels, auto-mode, frequency of hypo and hyperglycemia, insulin dose and&#xD;
           duration of use&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hospitalizations: peri- and post-op hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, infections, graft&#xD;
           rejection, other complications/morbidity, length of stay, readmissions, mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from this cohort of patients with T1D treated with the HCL undergoing kidney&#xD;
      transplantation will be compared to a retrospective cohort of up to 25 patients. This control&#xD;
      cohort will be identified through a Joint Data Analytics Team (JDAT) query of patients&#xD;
      followed at the Yale Transplant Center aged between 18-65 year, with T1D and who had received&#xD;
      a living donor kidney transplantation in the last 3 years prior to the start date of this&#xD;
      protocol. Medical records from these patients will be reviewed by the PI and/or&#xD;
      co-investigators. Pertinent demographic and medical information will be recorded, as&#xD;
      described above for the HCL treated group.&#xD;
