  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to find out if using additional MRIs and biomarker testing&#xD;
      can help researchers learn to predict how the tumor may change during radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to participant's reaction to&#xD;
      treatment. Biomarker testing in the study may include genetic biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. MRIs on this study are performed using FDA-approved and&#xD;
      commercially available methods. Having added scans and blood tests is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study (up to 80 patients and up to 20 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers in another part of the study). All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the prognostic value of pretreatment volumetric tumor growth velocity (TGV),&#xD;
      weekly tumor kinetics (TK), and blood biomarkers of mucosal head and neck cancers during&#xD;
      radiation therapy (RT), using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess functional imaging kinetics as a marker of tumor locoregional control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate blood biomarkers with tumor kinetics during treatment. III. To generate&#xD;
      preliminary data for future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo MRI scans and collection of blood samples for biomarker testing&#xD;
      pre-radiation therapy, weekly during radiation therapy, and at 2-3 months post-radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up weekly.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor growth velocity (TGV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 2-3 months after completion of radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>TGV is the calculated daily increase in tumor size from diagnosis to immediately before first radiotherapy (RT) treatment as measured via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Will use graphs and descriptive statistics to evaluate the relationship between TGV, tumor kinetics (TK), and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with response.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in TK</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 2-3 months after radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor kinetics is the weekly decrease or increase in tumor volume after initiation of radiotherapy, evaluated using MRI. Will also use generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to evaluate TK over time and to assess whether a difference exists between patients with complete response (CR) and those without CR. Will use graphs and descriptive statistics to evaluate the relationship between TGV, TK, and CTCs with response.</description>

    <measure>Change in Blood Biomarkers of Mucosal Head and Neck Cancers During Radiation Therapy (RT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 2-3 months after completion radiation treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Will use GLMMs to evaluate CTCs over time and to assess whether a difference exists between patients with CR and those without CR. Will use graphs and descriptive statistics to evaluate the relationship between TGV, TK, and CTCs with response.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Locoregional control</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of first treatment to date of death, disease progression or recurrence, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Locoregional control is defined as 2-year disease-free survival (DFS). Proportional hazards models will be created to examine the trajectory and intercept of TK and CTCs during radiation therapy with DFS. Time-varying covariates longitudinal modeling will be used to assess the relationship between TK and CTCs.</description>
