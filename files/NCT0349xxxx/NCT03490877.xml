  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic type of eczema affecting approximately 10% of adults and&#xD;
      12% of children in the US. The intense itching (pruritus) associated with AD can be&#xD;
      significantly disruptive to sleep and quality of life for both the patients and their&#xD;
      caregivers. AD is challenging to describe and measure. The purpose of this study is to see if&#xD;
      we can reliably measure how much people with AD scratch and how scratching interferes with&#xD;
      sleep and quality of life by using digital sensors, sleep studies and patient-reported&#xD;
      information.&#xD;

      Wrist worn accelerometers, sleep sensors, polysomnography (PSG), and associated data analysis&#xD;
      platforms would provide quantitative and qualitative knowledge regarding the action of&#xD;
      scratching and sleep quantity in a symptomatic atopic dermatitis (AD) population. Our overall&#xD;
      aim is to validate the use of accelerometry technology and digital measures to quantitatively&#xD;
      and qualitatively evaluate scratch and sleep in AD patients in a home environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accelerometry devices appear similar to a wristwatch. The subject will be asked to wear an&#xD;
      accelerometry device on each wrist during the study. The accelerometry device provides&#xD;
      continuous measures of wrist activity and will be used to quantify nocturnal scratching and&#xD;
      sleep behaviors to be compared to videography (annotated for scratch), sleep sensor, PSG and&#xD;
      traditional patient-reported outcome (PRO) and Quality of Life (QoL) measures [Peak Pruritus&#xD;
      Numerical Scale, Severity of Pruritus Scale (SPS), Patient Global Impression of Severity&#xD;
      (PGIS), Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale, Itch and Sleep Diary, Patient-Oriented&#xD;
      Eczema Measure (POE), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-pain&#xD;
      interference, PROMIS- anxiety, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Family Dermatology Life&#xD;
      Quality Index (FDLQI), Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI), Device and Device&#xD;
      Comfort Questionnaire] in patients with AD in a clinic and home setting in a well-controlled&#xD;
      clinical study.&#xD;
