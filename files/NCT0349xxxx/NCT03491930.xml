  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a weight loss app (VA MOVE!® Coach App) along&#xD;
      with regularly scheduled telephone counseling, will motivate obese people with metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome to lose weight and improve the symptoms of the metabolic syndrome, compared to usual&#xD;
      weight loss approaches. This study will randomly assign participants to one of two groups,&#xD;
      interventional or control. The interventional group will use the app with phone coaching and&#xD;
      standard of care for weight loss. The control group will receive standard weight loss care&#xD;
      without the app and phone coaching. Weight loss motivation to adopt life-style changes to&#xD;
      maintain weight loss and quality of life between the two groups will be compared. The&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of disorders including high blood pressure,&#xD;
      pre-diabetes, the tendency to carry body weight around the waist, and increased fat in the&#xD;
      blood. When these problems happen together, there is an increased risk for heart attack,&#xD;
      stroke, diabetes and certain cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the metabolic syndrome is a serious condition, it can be treated with diet, weight&#xD;
      loss and increased activity. It can even be reversed using these lifestyle changes. Due to&#xD;
      poor success with routine short-term weight loss treatment (group and one-on-one counseling),&#xD;
      it is time to address the problem by a different method. Studies have shown feedback devices&#xD;
      and weight loss apps have been successful in weight loss and weight maintenance. They are&#xD;
      economical (many apps are free), and convenient to use, without attendance at group sessions.&#xD;
      Since weight loss is the corner stone for improvement in the symptoms of the MetS, this study&#xD;
      will offer a unique approach to support individuals who are committed to losing weight and&#xD;
      adopting a healthier lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies demonstrated that feedback via text messaging, and interaction through&#xD;
      social networking support groups, in addition to iPhone apps, are all more effective in&#xD;
      weight loss measures than group sessions at a hospital site. (Duncan et al., 2011; Greene,&#xD;
      Sacks, Piniewski, Kil, &amp; Hahn, 2012; Shaw et al., 2013; Spring et al., 2013). The benefit of&#xD;
      these various methods is that they appear to accelerate weight loss and prevent weight&#xD;
      re-gain if employed long-term. With technology changing daily, these approaches must be&#xD;
      considered an essential adjunct to, or replacement for, traditional group counselling&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;

      Obesity rates in the United States have steadily increased since the 1980's, doubling between&#xD;
      1980 and 2010 from 15.0% to 36.1% (Cefalu et al., 2015). The prevalence rate of obesity in&#xD;
      adults in the U.S. in 2014 was 37.7%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (Ogden, Carroll, Fryar, &amp; Flegal,&#xD;
      2015) resulting in a rising incidence of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and&#xD;
      some cancers (American Society of Clinical Oncology, 2014). Many contributors to the rise in&#xD;
      obesity rates are cited in the literature: socio-economic, urbanization, sedentary behavior&#xD;
      (Hruby &amp; Hu, 2015), psychological and motivational factors (Byrne, Cooper, &amp; Fairburn, 2003),&#xD;
      and ethnicity and gender (Ogden et al., 2015). ). According to research done by The Pew&#xD;
      Research Center (DeSilver, 2016), daily caloric intake by the average American in 2010 was&#xD;
      2,481 calories, about 23% more than in 1970.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As research into obesity continues, contributing factors include more than excessive dietary&#xD;
      intake and decreased physical activity. Obesity scientists and medical specialists view the&#xD;
      disorder as a systemic dynamic involving the brain, gut, liver, adipose tissue, hormones,&#xD;
      inflammation, and heredity (Cefalu et al., 2015). The condition, recognized by the American&#xD;
      Medical Association as a disease in 2011, resulted in obesity specialists and medical board&#xD;
      certification (American Board of Obesity Medicine, ABOM, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though considered a disease in itself, obesity is a major contributor to preventable&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, as well as to enormous health care costs (American Nurse&#xD;
      Practitioner Foundation, 2013). The estimated cost of obesity and the resultant&#xD;
      co-morbidities in the U.S. in 2015 was $190 billion. This figure represented 21% of total&#xD;
      U.S. healthcare costs (Hruby &amp; Hu, 2015). Furthermore, the excess cost incurred by obese&#xD;
      individuals annually over the non-obese was $1,152 for obese men (for prescription drugs and&#xD;
      hospitalizations), and $3,613 for obese women (Hruby &amp; Hu, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nearly 35% of all adults and 50% of those over 60 years of age in the United States, have the&#xD;
      Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) (Aguilar et al 2015). This is especially disturbing since the&#xD;
      population over 60 years of age increases annually, due to the aging of America. Obesity and&#xD;
      the MetS are the underlying factors in most of the chronic illnesses prevalent today:&#xD;
      diabetes, cancer, inflammatory diseases, reduced immunity, heart disease, stroke, and&#xD;
      disability. It is clear that new, pragmatic, cost effective treatment to control the risk&#xD;
      factors and resultant morbidity and mortality, caused by this epidemic, must be aggressively&#xD;
      investigated. Employing apps developed for mobile phones is an obvious choice, if the data&#xD;
      can show evidence that this approach is effective. This is a prime area for nurse&#xD;
      practitioners to initiate research and to add to the scientific knowledge of obesity and its&#xD;
      sequelae (American Nurse Practitioner Foundation, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first study of its kind to examine changes in the metabolic markers of the&#xD;
      MetS, body composition and biometrics using a feedback device in the form of a weight loss&#xD;
      app. As such, it has the potential to provide clinicians with evidence based, adjunctive&#xD;
      treatment for this population. This study will provide the seeds for a longer study to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of using feedback devices to reinforce healthy life styles and&#xD;
      continue or maintain the weight loss. In this way, the participant will be able to achieve&#xD;
      true health benefits and reduced risks of co-morbidities due to obesity and the MetS.&#xD;
      Comparison with a control group will determine if the treatment is more effective than&#xD;
      standard of care for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivation and readiness to change:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to assess motivation and readiness to change in individuals who wish to&#xD;
      achieve significant life style behavior changes (Ceccarini, M., et al., (2015). Studies have&#xD;
      shown that risk of disease development can motivate people to adopt new habits. In a&#xD;
      randomized study of weight loss in women at high risk for breast cancer, Hartman, et al&#xD;
      (2016) found that women at risk of developing breast cancer were motivated to improve health&#xD;
      through weight loss. Using weight loss technology (My Fitness Pal) and phone contact, this&#xD;
      intervention resulted in greater weight loss that that of the control group. They concluded&#xD;
      that combining technology supported by phone counselling was effective in weight loss as a&#xD;
      treatment for women at increased risk for breast cancer. There are no current studies of the&#xD;
      effect of motivation on weight loss in people with the metabolic syndrome. However, it is&#xD;
      plausible that given the risks of developing diabetes or heart disease, these people may be&#xD;
      more motivated to use the app and pursue weight loss to prevent complications of the MetS.&#xD;
