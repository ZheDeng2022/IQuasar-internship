      Demonstrate that maintenance of systolic blood pressure between 140 and 160 mm Hg during the&#xD;
      acute phase of ischemic stroke is more effective than management according to the&#xD;
      International Guideline (treat when systolic blood pressure exceeds 185 mm Hg)&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Control of blood pressure figures remains one of the most important risk factors in primary&#xD;
      and secondary prevention in patients with stroke. The current strategy for the hypertensive&#xD;
      treatment of patients during the acute phase of ischemic stroke within the first 72 hours&#xD;
      remains a highly debated and unclear issue, with no consensus on the range or appropriate&#xD;
      blood pressure ranges to be handled (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Team study working hypothesis focuses on the study of blood pressure (for 72 hours), through&#xD;
      its intensive control (recording and adjustment every four hours), in the acute phase of&#xD;
      ischemic stroke. Specifically, it is based on the monitoring and maintenance of systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure between 140 and 160 mm Hg in patients with acute ischemic stroke; And this can&#xD;
      lead to a better functional prognosis, measured at 90 days, compared with the functional&#xD;
      prognosis of patients treated according to the recommendations of the current Clinical&#xD;
      Guidelines, which propose to act on systolic blood pressure only when it exceeds 185 mm Hg&#xD;
      (13,22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the intense decrease in blood pressure during the acute phase of stroke has the&#xD;
      potential risk of decreasing cerebral perfusion in the area of ischemic penumbra, in recent&#xD;
      observational studies (19), a worse functional prognosis has not been found in those patients&#xD;
      With systolic blood pressure above 140 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no previous evidence from other intervention studies related to blood pressure&#xD;
      control and a benefit to patients with acute ischemic stroke. Comparison using a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial of a group of patients with blood pressure control following current&#xD;
      guidelines with a group of patients with systolic blood pressure between 140 and 160 mm Hg&#xD;
      may allow a simple, rapidly applicable therapeutic alternative to Clinical practice, low cost&#xD;
      and extrapolable to a wider population, such as patients with stroke of any etiology.&#xD;

    <description>Study of functional prognosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke using modified Rankin scale measured at 90 ± 15 days will compared between the two branches.Rankin Scale: It is a scale that evaluates the patient's functional situation. The full name is &quot;modified Rankin Scale&quot;, and the abbreviated name is &quot;mRS&quot;. The range of the scale is from 0 to 6, where 0 is the best score (the patient is asymptomatic) and 6 is the worst score (mortality). Up to 2 the patient is considered independent, and from 3 the patient needs help for the activities of daily life.</description>
