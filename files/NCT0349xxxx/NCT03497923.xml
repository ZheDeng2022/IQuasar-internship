  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium sulphate is regularly used in perioperative medicine. During and after general&#xD;
      anesthesia, it enhances the effect of muscle relaxants because it reduces the liberation of&#xD;
      acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. When administered immediately after spontaneous&#xD;
      recovery of a neuromuscular block (NMB), magnesium may cause a recurrence of NMB and&#xD;
      compromise patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rocuronium is a neuromuscular blocking agent which is frequently used to facilitate&#xD;
      intubating and surgical conditions. At the end of the procedure, there are two ways to&#xD;
      accelerate the reversal of a neuromuscular block induced by rocuronium: 1. Administration of&#xD;
      neostigmine, an anticholinesterase agent and competitive antagonist; 2. Administration of&#xD;
      sugammadex, a γ-cyclodextrin compound and specific encapsulator of rocuronium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is done in patients receiving rocuronium and either neostigmine or sugammadex for&#xD;
      reversal of NMB. It is hypothesized that when sugammadex is used as an antagonist of a&#xD;
      rocuronium-induced NMB, it prevents the reappearance of NMB when magnesium is injected,&#xD;
      because sugammadex should inactivate all remaining rocuronium molecules and restore&#xD;
      neuromuscular reserve of the neuromuscular junctions. Further more it is hypothesized that&#xD;
      reversal with neostigmine will not prevent a magnesium-induced recurrence of NMB to the same&#xD;
      extent. The primary objective of the study is to show that after reversal with sugammadex&#xD;
      there is no or only very little re-occurrence of neuromuscular block after a magnesium&#xD;
      perfusion. Furthermore we want to show that after reversal with neostigmine there is a&#xD;
      re-occurrence of neuromuscular block.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) is regularly used in perioperative medicine. For instance,&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia and eclampsia have been successfully treated with intravenous magnesium. Also,&#xD;
      MgSO4 has been used for the control of life threatening cardiac arrhythmias, bronchial asthma&#xD;
      or as an anticonvulsant. Finally, magnesium has been found to alleviate postoperative pain&#xD;
      and to exert morphine sparing effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium plays a role in nearly every physiological system. In the nervous system, magnesium&#xD;
      has a depressant effect related to the inhibition of transmitter release from presynaptic&#xD;
      sites by competing with calcium and due to the antagonism at NMDA receptors. The presynaptic&#xD;
      inhibition of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction by magnesium has been well&#xD;
      described. In addition, an excess of magnesium ions diminishes the depolarizing action of&#xD;
      acetylcholine at the end-plate, and depresses the excitability of the muscle fiber membrane.&#xD;
      Magnesium per se causes significant neuromuscular blockade (NMB) in high concentrations (≥ 5&#xD;
      mmol L-1). In the presence of curare-like agents, however, very low concentrations of&#xD;
      magnesium (≥1 mmol L-1) inhibit neuromuscular transmission since in this case much more&#xD;
      acetylcholine is needed to produce a magnitude of depolarization of the end-plate compared&#xD;
      with normal conditions. Consequently, magnesium enhances the effect of muscle relaxants&#xD;
      during and after general anesthesia. The prolongation of the duration of NMB by magnesium may&#xD;
      increase the incidence of a residual postoperative neuromuscular block, and consequently may&#xD;
      compromise patient safety. In addition, magnesium, when administered immediately after&#xD;
      spontaneous recovery of a NMB, may cause recurrence of the NMB (&quot;recurarisation&quot;). Under&#xD;
      clinical conditions this may happen whenever magnesium is used in the immediate postoperative&#xD;
      period, for instance, for postoperative pain alleviation or for treatment of postoperative&#xD;
      cardiac arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known, however, whether pharmacological reversal of a NMB prior to magnesium&#xD;
      treatment prevents the recurrence of NMB. Recovery after neostigmine (an anticholinestherase&#xD;
      agent) administration was approximately 30% less in patients pretreated with MgSO4 compared&#xD;
      with those without MgSO4 pretreatment. Sugammadex, a γ-cyclodextrin compound, is a new&#xD;
      reversal agent. It is a specific encapsulator of steroidal muscle relaxants such as&#xD;
      rocuronium. We have demonstrated that magnesium pretreatment did not prolong the reversal of&#xD;
      deep or moderate rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade when standard doses of sugammadex&#xD;
      were used for reversal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sugammadex causes a rapid and complete reversal of the neuromuscular blockade by reducing the&#xD;
      action of rocuronium on the prejunctional and postjunctional nicotinic acetylcholine&#xD;
      receptors (nAChRs). Unlike neostigmine, sugammadex is efficacious in reversing moderate (2&#xD;
      twitches to train-of-four [TOF] stimulation, TOF-count two [TOFC-2]) and deep (post-tetanic&#xD;
      count [PTC] of 1 or 2) rocuronium-induced NMB in doses of 2.0 mg kg-1 and 4.0 mg kg-1,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The suggested cause of return of NMB (&quot;recurarisation&quot;) subsequent to magnesium&#xD;
      administration is the absence of a functional reserve of the neuromuscular junction (safety&#xD;
      margin, 70% of receptor capacity) despite a complete recovery of the TOF ratio and twitch&#xD;
      amplitude (T1) (main variables of neuromuscular monitoring). It is important to know that the&#xD;
      actually available neuromuscular monitoring methods are insensitive to measure the safety&#xD;
      margin of the neuromuscular transmission, thus they cannot provide information about the&#xD;
      likelihood of block recurrence. Theoretically, recurrence of a NMB due to clinical doses of&#xD;
      magnesium happens only in cases where the safety margin is reduced or abolished by a NMB&#xD;
      agent. Therefore, to prevent recurrent muscle weakness ideally all relaxant molecules should&#xD;
      be eliminated from the neuromuscular synapse before magnesium is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological reversal of NMB reduces neuromuscular receptor occupancy and thereby&#xD;
      increases the safety margin. Neostigmine augments the amount of acetylcholine at the&#xD;
      neuromuscular junction, which competitively antagonizes the NMB and liberates at least&#xD;
      partially the synaptic receptor reserves. However, neostigmine is not reliable to completely&#xD;
      re-establish neuromuscular function. When sugammadex is administered, the free rocuronium&#xD;
      plasma concentration rapidly declines near to zero (like a washout) and consequently the&#xD;
      safety margin isincreased. In this context, one can speculate that sugammadex is an ideal&#xD;
      antagonist when magnesium treatment is associated with the use of rocuronium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is still unknown whether the administration of magnesium sulphate immediately&#xD;
      after pharmacological reversal of the TOF ratio to a normalized 0.9 value (i.e. adequate&#xD;
      reversal) re-induces a clinically relevant NMB. If magnesium is used in the immediate&#xD;
      postoperative period, we need to know whether, and how, postoperative muscle paralysis as a&#xD;
      consequence of the magnesium treatment can be prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that when sugammadex is used as an antagonist of a&#xD;
      rocuronium- induced NMB, the neuromuscular junction will be liberated from almost all&#xD;
      rocuronium molecules and no recurrent NMB will occur. Furthermore it is hypothesized that&#xD;
      reversal with neostigmine will not prevent to the same extent magnesium-induced recurrence of&#xD;
      NMB. In addition, the magnitude and time course of the magnesium induced neuromuscular block&#xD;
      will be measured.&#xD;
