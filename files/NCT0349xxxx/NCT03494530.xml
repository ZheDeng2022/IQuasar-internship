      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lixiana Acute Stroke Evaluation Registry (LASER) is a randomized controlled trial with an&#xD;
      associated registry. Patients with previously known or newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      (AF) and acute ischemic stroke within five days will be randomized 2:1 to early (≤ 5 days) or&#xD;
      delayed (6-14 days) edoxaban initiation. Ischemic stroke will be defined as evidence of acute&#xD;
      focal cerebral infarction confirmed on CT/MRI and/or focal hypoperfusion/vessel occlusion on&#xD;
      multimodal CT, or by sudden focal and objective neurological deficits (i.e NIHSS ≥ 1) of&#xD;
      presumed ischemic origin persisting &gt; 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of LASER is to demonstrate the safety of edoxaban initiation within five days&#xD;
      of cardioembolic stroke. Secondary aim is to determine predictors of hemorrhagic&#xD;
      transformation (HT) after cardioembolic stroke. Investigators will systematically assess&#xD;
      prospectively collected Computed Tomography (CT) scan images for evidence of HT and&#xD;
      re-infarction.&#xD;

      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that edoxaban initiation within five days of ischemic stroke will&#xD;
      not be associated with increased HT rates, relative to patients in whom anticoagulation is&#xD;
      delayed. Serial imaging using CT will be utilized to determine the rate of radiological HT&#xD;
      after edoxaban initiation. Incident radiological HT rates will be assessed as objective&#xD;
      performance criteria for the safety of early versus delayed edoxaban initiation.&#xD;
      Investigators also hypothesize that RNA expressed in leukocytes at time of stroke can&#xD;
      stratify risk of HT in patients treated with edoxaban. Investigators will assess the rate of&#xD;
      recurrent ischemic stroke, but recognize any differences between groups will be hypothesis&#xD;
      generating only due to the small trial sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LASER is a randomized controlled, parallel-group, two-arm, assessor-blinded trial with an&#xD;
      associated registry. Patients with previously known or newly diagnosed AF-related ischemic&#xD;
      stroke within five days will be randomized 2:1 to early (≤ 5 days) or delayed (6-14 days)&#xD;
      edoxaban initiation. Ischemic stroke will be defined as evidence of acute focal cerebral&#xD;
      infarction confirmed on CT/MRI and/or focal hypoperfusion/vessel occlusion on multimodal CT,&#xD;
      or by sudden focal and objective neurological deficits (i.e NIHSS ≥ 1) of presumed ischemic&#xD;
      origin persisting &gt; 24 hours. A total of one hundred fifty patients from a comprehensive&#xD;
      Canadian stroke center will be enrolled. Eligible patients will be randomized within five&#xD;
      days of symptom onset after baseline imaging. Patients with spontaneous parenchymal&#xD;
      hemorrhage (PH) (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) grade PH1 or PH2 on the&#xD;
      baseline imaging will not be eligible for randomization. These patients will be included in&#xD;
      the registry portion of LASER and follow-up will be identical to that in the trial. The&#xD;
      timing of edoxaban initiation in these patients will be at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized 2:1 following open label simple randomization procedure&#xD;
      to early (≤ 5 days) or delayed (6-14 days) edoxaban initiation via a centralized web-based&#xD;
      randomization process, Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap, Vanderbilt university).&#xD;
      After randomization to early or delayed arms, the decision to time the edoxaban initiation&#xD;
      within the specific arm will be at the treating physician's discretion. The rationale for the&#xD;
      specific timing of treatment, within the randomization window, will also be recorded by&#xD;
      surveying the treating physician in each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All randomized patients will be followed for 90 days after edoxaban initiation. A National&#xD;
      Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score will be assessed at baseline, 7 and 90 days&#xD;
      after edoxaban initiation. Functional outcome will be assessed with a modified Rankin Scale&#xD;
      (mRS) score at baseline, 7 and 90 days after edoxaban initiation. Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment (MoCA) will be performed at baseline, and day 90 after edoxaban initiation. RNA&#xD;
      will be used to stratify risk of HT. Functional outcome at 90 days will be dichotomized as&#xD;
      favourable (mRS score 0-2) and unfavourable (mRS score 3-6). Quality of life will be assessed&#xD;
      with the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at day 90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to diagnostic imaging, all patients will have a non-contrast, axial CT scan at&#xD;
      baseline (within 24 hours from study recruitment) and at 7±2 days after edoxaban initiation.&#xD;
      Therefore, all patients will have a minimum of two scans (diagnostic and&#xD;
      pre-randomization).In the event of clinical deterioration, CT scans will be repeated. The&#xD;
      original LASER protocol included MRI acquisition in all patients. Following diagnostic CT,&#xD;
      all patients were to undergo MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI to assess the&#xD;
      acute infarct volume), Fluid Attenuated Inverse Recovery (FLAIR to assess chronic infarct and&#xD;
      white matter ischemic change volumes) and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI to assess for&#xD;
      acute HT and chronic cerebral microbleeds) prior to randomization. Shortly after trial&#xD;
      initiation, however, COVID-19 restrictions limited access to research MRI protocols. The&#xD;
      protocol was therefore amended and both baseline and day 7 imaging data are limited to CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administrative Structure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case report forms and data monitoring will be completed on site. All imaging data will be&#xD;
      read centrally at the Stroke Imaging Laboratory at the University of Alberta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized patients will be treated with edoxaban 60 mg once daily. The edoxaban dose will be&#xD;
      reduced to 30 mg once daily if any of the following characteristics are present at the time&#xD;
      of randomization or during the study: estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 to 50 ml&#xD;
      per minute using Cockcroft-Gault Equation or body weight ≤ 60 kg. Prior to edoxaban&#xD;
      initiation, all patients will be treated as per the clinical standard of care using&#xD;
      antiplatelet(s) and anticoagulation for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. Any&#xD;
      antithrombotic therapy prior to randomization will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Procedures and Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymized dicom CT data will be assessed by two independent raters, blinded to treatment&#xD;
      group, for the presence, number and total volume of regions with infarction. Infarct volumes&#xD;
      will be measured using planimetric techniques. Any HT, as well as other intracranial&#xD;
      hemorrhage, seen at baseline and day 7 will be graded using the Heidelberg Bleeding&#xD;
      Classification (HBC). Incident HT seen on follow-up CT scan is defined as new or progressive&#xD;
      HT. Progressive HT will be defined as any increase in the severity grade between the baseline&#xD;
      and follow-up scan. Two raters will rate the HT using the Heidelberg criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample will be drawn into a PAXgene tube for RNA analysis at the time of the baseline&#xD;
      CT. RNA will be isolated and measured by RNA sequencing and reverse transcription polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (RT-PCR). Genes different between patients who develop HT compared to those&#xD;
      without HT will be identified by analysis of variance adjusted for covariates as previously&#xD;
      described. A prediction model will be developed using the identified genes. The ability of&#xD;
      the developed gene model to predict HT will be compared to other factors associated with HT&#xD;
      including age, stroke severity, infarct volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study endpoint is the rate of incident (new or progressive) radiological HT. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoint is the rate of symptomatic HT, defined as intracerebral hemorrhage within&#xD;
      and beyond infarcted brain tissue with PH &gt;1/3 the volume of the ischemic infarct (Class 2 in&#xD;
      HBC) associated with clinical deterioration (worsening of NIHSS score by ≥ 4 points) within&#xD;
      30 days of treatment initiation. Other secondary endpoints are recurrent ischemic stroke&#xD;
      within 90 days of randomization, recurrent sub-clinical infarcts on follow up CT at 7±2 days&#xD;
      post edoxaban initiation, systemic hemorrhagic complication rate within 90 days of&#xD;
      randomization, NIHSS at day 7 and 90, mRS score at day 7 and 90, favourable mRS at day 90,&#xD;
      and mortality within 90 days, quality of life at 90 days assessed by (EQ-5D) and Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale (VAS), and ability of leukocyte RNA to predict HT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will report serious adverse events (SAE) within the study period using&#xD;
      standardized event, resolution and association codes, and they will be reported to the local&#xD;
      Human Research Ethics Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous open label studies of DOAC use in acute stroke, the rate of symptomatic HT&#xD;
      is likely to be nil, which is why we have made this a secondary endpoint. We have previously&#xD;
      demonstrated the rate of asymptomatic HT in serial imaging studies to be as lower as 3% in&#xD;
      CT-based studies and up to 13% in MRI based studies. There are no data related to the&#xD;
      difference in asymptomatic HT rates in patients randomized to early versus late DOAC&#xD;
      initiation. Our aim is to determine the event rates in these two groups with reasonable&#xD;
      precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 150 patients, randomized 2:1 (≤5 days:6-14 days) will allow detection of an&#xD;
      asymptomatic hemorrhage rate of 3% (95% CI 0.6-8.5%) in the early treatment arm (n=100) and&#xD;
      4% (95% CI 0.5-13.7%) in the late treatment arm (n=50). Thus, we will have confidence&#xD;
      interval width of a maximum of 13.7%, allowing enough precision to demonstrate the safety of&#xD;
      early treatment. The rationale for adopting a 2:1 randomization approach is to increase the&#xD;
      precision around the estimate of safety in the early treatment arm, without substantively&#xD;
      losing power.&#xD;
