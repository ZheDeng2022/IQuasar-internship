  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with B-cell&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoproliferative diseases that have not been treated. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for up to 18 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
