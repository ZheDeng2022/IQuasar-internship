      This study will implement an intervention in a two-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) to&#xD;
      establish efficacy on viral suppression as a biological endpoint, compare the effectiveness&#xD;
      of two different modes of implementation (including one entirely based on readily available&#xD;
      clinic data), and investigate cost-effectiveness. Participants in the first intervention&#xD;
      group (T1, n=110) will be eligible for small lottery prizes based on timely clinic visits,&#xD;
      and qualify for an annual lottery conditional if demonstrating viral suppression; those in&#xD;
      the second group (T2, n=110) will draw prizes conditional on electronically measured&#xD;
      adherence at each clinic visit, and also participate in an annual lottery that is conditional&#xD;
      on high adherence throughout the year. The control group (n=110) will receive the usual&#xD;
      standard of care. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and then every six months.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes are undetectable viral load and electronically measured adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is imperative to find ways to boost ART adherence in sub-Saharan Africa where adherence&#xD;
      rates have been found to decline over time, and where treatment options such as second-line&#xD;
      regimens are limited. A promising tool is the use of incentives based on insights from&#xD;
      behavioral economics (BE) for healthy HIV-related behavior. The proposed R01 study is based&#xD;
      on the results of the PI's R34 'Rewarding Adherence Program (RAP)' [R34 MH096609] that&#xD;
      demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of incentives allocated by a drawing for&#xD;
      HIV-related behaviors, and established preliminary efficacy. The current R01 study builds on&#xD;
      these promising results with the aim to a) use viral loads as biological endpoints that were&#xD;
      not included in the R34 for cost reasons; b) establish efficacy in a fully powered&#xD;
      intervention as well as comparative efficacy of two different ways of implementing the&#xD;
      incentives including one arm that has been adapted to changing clinical guidelines and can be&#xD;
      implemented with readily available data from clinic records; and c) assess the cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of these two implementation modes as a further input for policy-makers. The&#xD;
      intervention is targeted at increasing the motivation of HIV clients who have been on ART for&#xD;
      several years through the benefit and joy of prize drawings, thereby attempting to overcome&#xD;
      the treatment 'fatigue' that can develop in the context of mundane, daily pill taking over&#xD;
      the course of life-long treatment. Insights from behavioral economics suggest that such an&#xD;
      intervention may be particularly effective for people with present bias (those who have a&#xD;
      tendency to give in to short-term temptation at the cost of more long-term benefits) that was&#xD;
      found to be prevalent among HIV clients in the R34 study. The intervention will be&#xD;
      implemented among 330 adult clients in three groups: for the first intervention group, timely&#xD;
      clinic attendance will constitute the eligibility criteria for participating in a prize&#xD;
      drawing at each scheduled clinic visit; participants are also eligible for an annual prize&#xD;
      drawing based on showing viral suppression. The second treatment group will be incentivized&#xD;
      on demonstrated high ART adherence between clinic visits that also determine the winning&#xD;
      chances at an annual prize drawing. The control group will receive the usual standard of&#xD;
      care. All participants will receive MEMS caps to record adherence and assessments over 24&#xD;
      months (at baseline and every 6 months thereafter). The first Specific Aim will be to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention; the second aim is to compare the relative&#xD;
      effectiveness of the adherence-based arm and the arm directly incentivizing viral suppression&#xD;
      that uses only data readily available in the clinic. The third Specific Aim is to perform a&#xD;
      comparative cost-effectiveness analysis of the two intervention arms as a further policy&#xD;
      input. If proven efficacious, the intervention as implemented in the newly adapted arm based&#xD;
      on viral load suppression can be readily taken over by the clinic and scaled at low cost to&#xD;
      other clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study also 70 treatment initiating clients (in addition to the 330 treatment mature&#xD;
      clients described above) will be recruited, but they will be excluded from the main analysis.&#xD;
      [Note on 9/7/2019: due to funding, we will not recruit this additional sample of treatment&#xD;
      initiating clients]&#xD;
