  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent global need to decrease the high mortality of tuberculosis (TB) in persons&#xD;
      with HIV as TB is the leading cause of death among persons with HIV worldwide. The DIPT&#xD;
      (Drinkers' Intervention to Prevent TB) study is a randomized, 2x2 factorial trial among&#xD;
      HIV/TB co-infected adults in Uganda with heavy alcohol use (n=680 persons, 340 each U01). The&#xD;
      goal of the study is to determine whether economic incentive interventions can promote both&#xD;
      reduced alcohol use and isoniazid (INH) pill taking among HIV/TB co-infected adult heavy&#xD;
      drinkers, during isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT: a six-month course of INH) at HIV clinics&#xD;
      in southwestern Uganda. Participants will be randomized to one of four arms: Arm 1: no&#xD;
      incentives (control); Arm 2: economic incentives for decreasing alcohol use only; Arm 3:&#xD;
      economic incentives for IPT adherence only; Arm 4: economic incentives for decreasing alcohol&#xD;
      use and for IPT adherence (rewarded independently).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TB is the leading cause of death among persons with HIV worldwide, and HIV-infected drinkers&#xD;
      are at very high risk for TB disease and mortality. Globally, an estimated 25% of persons&#xD;
      with HIV are heavy drinkers, and the risk of TB disease is 3-fold higher among heavy drinkers&#xD;
      compared to non-drinkers. Six months of isoniazid (INH) preventive therapy (IPT) reduces TB&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality by 30-50% above the benefit of antiretroviral therapy (ART). However,&#xD;
      INH can be toxic to the liver, and as a result in many high TB/HIV prevalence settings, such&#xD;
      as east Africa, heavy drinkers are not offered IPT. Thus interventions to reduce alcohol use&#xD;
      are needed to decrease INH toxicity during IPT among HIV/TB infected drinkers. It is also&#xD;
      well established that heavy drinkers have poorer ART adherence, and there is growing evidence&#xD;
      of reduced IPT adherence in drinkers. However, interventions to reduce drinking have had&#xD;
      limited impact on ART adherence, and further interventions to increase IPT adherence among&#xD;
      HIV/TB infected drinkers are likely needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of incentives to promote healthy behavior is a highly effective approach for reducing&#xD;
      substance use and for improving adherence to HIV and TB regimens in resource-rich settings.&#xD;
      Economic incentives to reduce alcohol use may create a window for safe and effective IPT use&#xD;
      over six months by decreasing hepatotoxicity. Decreases in alcohol use may also improve IPT&#xD;
      adherence, or additional incentives for IPT adherence may be needed. Such strategies to&#xD;
      reduce alcohol use have not been studied in low-income countries and the effectiveness of&#xD;
      incentives to optimize IPT in HIV/TB co-infected drinkers is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Alcohol Reduction Intervention: Determine the effectiveness of economic incentives&#xD;
      contingent on point-of-care (POC) urine ethyl glucuronide (EtG) &lt;300 ng/mL (Arms 2 &amp; 4)&#xD;
      versus no alcohol incentives (Arms 1 &amp; 3) to reduce heavy drinking over 6 months, among&#xD;
      HIV/TB co-infected adult drinkers receiving IPT. The investigators will randomize&#xD;
      participants to low-cost escalating prize incentives for EtG negative urine tests at IPT&#xD;
      refill visits (Arms 2+4), versus no incentives (Arms 1+3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: INH Adherence Intervention: Determine the effectiveness of economic incentives&#xD;
      contingent on POC (IsoScreen) INH urine positive tests (Arms 3 &amp; 4) versus no INH incentives&#xD;
      (Arms 1 &amp; 2) on INH adherence among HIV/TB co-infected adult drinkers. The investigators will&#xD;
      randomize participants to low-cost escalating prize incentives for INH positive urine tests&#xD;
      at IPT refill visits (Arms 3+4), versus no incentives (Arms 1+2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Impact Assessment of Intervention: Assess the impact of economic incentives on HIV&#xD;
      virologic suppression and explore their mechanisms of action, six months after trial&#xD;
      completion. The investigators will follow all study participants for six months after trial&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the impact of the 3 separate incentive interventions (Arms 2, 3, 4) vs. no&#xD;
           incentives (Arm 1) on HIV virologic suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore the mechanisms that may drive the economic incentives to increase virologic&#xD;
           suppression. Potential mediators will be reductions in alcohol use and level of IPT&#xD;
           adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will leverage new low-cost POC tests for alcohol use and INH pill-taking for the&#xD;
      first study of incentive-based alcohol and adherence interventions in low-resource settings;&#xD;
      these interventions may improve the safety and effectiveness of life-saving medications for&#xD;
      heavy alcohol users in many settings.&#xD;
