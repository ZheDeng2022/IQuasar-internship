  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shivering during a cesarean section can be quite uncomfortable for the patient as well as&#xD;
      make it difficult for the anesthesiologist to obtain vital signs. The researchers will&#xD;
      investigate whether or not applying pressure to the P6 acupressure point during a cesarean&#xD;
      section can treat shivering. The hypothesis is that shivering will be alleviated with&#xD;
      acupressure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether applying pressure to the left and right P6&#xD;
      acupoints can treat shivering in a patient undergoing a cesarean section. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that bilateral stimulation of P6 with pressure can stop or alleviate shivering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is resolution of shivering within 15 minutes of applying bilateral&#xD;
      pressure to P6 acupoints during a cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Time to resolution of shivering&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Degree of patient-reported improvement in shivering&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Degree of practitioner-reported improvement in shivering&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessment of skin irritation and/or pain at the site of acupressure vs control&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information will be stored in a locked cabinet on labor and delivery, and that&#xD;
      cabinet will be located in a T3-locked office. The link between subject ID and patient ID&#xD;
      will be stored in a different office on labor and delivery, also under a T3 lock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are laboring with an epidural catheter and subsequently require a cesarean&#xD;
      section will be selected. This patient population has a MUCH higher rate of shivering during&#xD;
      the cesarean section as compared to patients who undergo elective scheduled cesarean sections&#xD;
      under spinal anesthesia. By selecting this group, the investigators are not only increasing&#xD;
      chances of identifying shivering but also decreasing variability between patient&#xD;
      characteristics by limiting it to one type (only epidural and not spinal) and limiting the&#xD;
      number of screen failures.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Once an obstetrician determines that a patient laboring with an epidural catheter should have a non-emergent cesarean section instead of continuing labor, the clinical anesthesiologist will contact the research team. A member of the research team will contact the patient while she is still in the labor and delivery room, at which time informed consent would be obtained.</intervention_model_description>
