    <measure>Change From Baseline (CFB) at Week 12 in the Average Number of Micturitions Per 24 Hours in All Overactive Bladder (OAB) Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (BL); Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A micturition/void is defined as &quot;Urinated in Toilet&quot; as indicated on the Patient Voiding Diary (PVD). The number of micturitions is defined as the number of times a participant voided in the toilet as indicated on the PVD. The average daily number of micturitions was calculated using the daily entries in the PVD (which was to be completed prior to each study visit) as the total number of micturitions that occurred on a Complete Diary Day (CDD) divided by the number of CDDs in the PVD. CFB was calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. &quot;Per 24 hours&quot; corresponds to one Diary Day (i.e., time between when the participant got up for the day each morning and time the participant got up for the day the next morning as recorded in the PVD). Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures are study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), OAB type (wet/dry), sex, region (U.S./non-U.S.), BL number of micturitions, and treatment by study visit interaction.

    <measure>CFB at Week 12 in the Average Number of Urge Urinary Incontinence (UUI) Episodes Per 24 Hours in OAB Wet Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The number of UUI episodes is defined as the number of times a participant had checked &quot;urge&quot; as the main reason for the leakage in the PVD, regardless of whether more than one reason for leakage in addition to &quot;urge&quot; was checked. The average daily number of UUI episodes was calculated using the daily entries in the PVD (which was to be completed prior to each study visit) as the total number of UUI episodes that occurred on a CDD divided by the number of CCDs in the PVD. CFB was calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. &quot;Per 24 hours&quot; corresponds to one Diary Day (i.e., time between when participant got up for the day each morning and time participant got up for the day the next morning as recorded in the PVD). Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures were study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), sex, region (U.S./non-U.S.), BL number of UUI episodes and treatment by study visit interaction.

    <measure>CFB at Week 12 in the Coping Score From the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Long Form (OAB-q LF, 1-week Recall) in All OAB Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The OAB-q LF is a validated patient-reported outcome. 8 questions of the OAB-q LF ask participants how well they have coped with their bladder symptoms during the previous week, as a measure of quality of life. Each question has a response ranging from &quot;not coping&quot; (= 1) to &quot;coping well&quot; (= 6). These questions make up the coping scale. The raw score (sum of question scores [ranging from 8 to 48]) is transformed to a unified score, ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores correspond to a higher quality of life, and lower scores represent a lower quality of life. CFB is calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures were study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), sex, region (U.S./non-U.S.), OAB type (wet/dry), BL score, and treatment by study visit interaction.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A micturition/void is defined as &quot;Urinated in Toilet&quot; as indicated on the PVD. The number of micturitions is defined as the number of times a participant voided in the toilet as indicated on the PVD. CFB is calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures were study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), OAB type (wet/dry), sex, region (U.S./non-U.S.), BL volume (milliliters [mL]), and treatment by study visit interaction.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The OAB-q LF is a validated patient-reported outcome. The 25 questions comprising the Coping, Concern, Sleep and Social Interaction subscales of the OAB-q LF ask participants how much their symptoms have affected their life over the last week. Each question has a response ranging from &quot;None of the time&quot; (= 1) to &quot;All of the time&quot; (= 6). The raw score (sum of question scores for the 4 subscales [ranging from 25 to 150]) is transformed to a unified score, ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores correspond to a higher quality of life, and lower scores represent a lower quality of life. CFB is calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures were study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), sex, region (U.S./non-U.S.), OAB type (wet/dry), BL score, and treatment by study visit interaction.</description>

    <measure>CFB at Week 12 in the Symptom Bother Score From the OAB-q LF (1-week Recall) in All OAB Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The OAB-q LF is a validated patient-reported outcome. The first 8 questions of the OAB-q LF ask participants how much they were bothered by their bladder symptoms during the previous week. Each question has a response ranging from &quot;Not at all&quot; (= 1) to &quot;A very great deal&quot; (= 6). These questions make up the symptom bother scale. The raw score (sum of question scores [ranging from 8 to 48]) is transformed to a unified score, ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores correspond to the symptoms having a larger bother, and lower scores represent a lower amount of bother due to symptoms. CFB is calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures were study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), sex, region (U.S./non-U.S.), OAB type (wet/dry), BL score, and treatment by study visit interaction.</description>

    <measure>CFB at Week 12 in Overall Bladder Symptoms Based on Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-Severity) in All OAB Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression (PGI) questions are designed to assess a participant's overall impression of OAB. For the PGI-Severity score, participants are asked to rate their OAB symptoms over the previous week with one of the following responses: 1 = none, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe. CFB is calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures were study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), OAB type (wet/dry), sex, region (U.S./non-U.S.), BL score, and treatment by study visit interaction.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression (PGI) questions are designed to assess a participant's overall impression of OAB. For the PGI-Control score, participants were asked to rate how much control they had over their OAB symptoms over the previous week with one of the following responses: 1 = complete control, 2 = a lot of control, 3 = some control, 4 = only a little control, 5 = no control. CFB is calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures were study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), OAB type (wet/dry), sex, region (U.S./non-U.S.), BL score, and treatment by study visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (CFB) at Week 12 in the Average Number of Micturitions Per 24 Hours in All Overactive Bladder (OAB) Participants</title>
        <description>A micturition/void is defined as &quot;Urinated in Toilet&quot; as indicated on the Patient Voiding Diary (PVD). The number of micturitions is defined as the number of times a participant voided in the toilet as indicated on the PVD. The average daily number of micturitions was calculated using the daily entries in the PVD (which was to be completed prior to each study visit) as the total number of micturitions that occurred on a Complete Diary Day (CDD) divided by the number of CDDs in the PVD. CFB was calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. &quot;Per 24 hours&quot; corresponds to one Diary Day (i.e., time between when the participant got up for the day each morning and time the participant got up for the day the next morning as recorded in the PVD). Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures are study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), OAB type (wet/dry), sex, region (U.S./non-U.S.), BL number of micturitions, and treatment by study visit interaction.

The average daily number of UUI episodes was calculated using the daily entries in the PVD (which was to be completed prior to each study visit) as the total number of UUI episodes that occurred on a CDD divided by the number of CCDs in the PVD. CFB was calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. &quot;Per 24 hours&quot; corresponds to one Diary Day (i.e., time between when participant got up for the day each morning and time participant got up for the day the next morning as recorded in the PVD). Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures were study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), sex, region (U.S./non-U.S.), BL number of UUI episodes and treatment by study visit interaction.

          <description>The number of UUI episodes is defined as the number of times a participant had checked &quot;urge&quot; as the main reason for the leakage in the PVD, regardless of whether more than one reason for leakage in addition to &quot;urge&quot; was checked. The average daily number of UUI episodes was calculated using the daily entries in the PVD (which was to be completed prior to each study visit) as the total number of UUI episodes that occurred on a CDD divided by the number of CCDs in the PVD. CFB was calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. &quot;Per 24 hours&quot; corresponds to one Diary Day (i.e., time between when participant got up for the day each morning and time participant got up for the day the next morning as recorded in the PVD).</description>

        <description>The OAB-q LF is a validated patient-reported outcome. 8 questions of the OAB-q LF ask participants how well they have coped with their bladder symptoms during the previous week, as a measure of quality of life. Each question has a response ranging from &quot;not coping&quot; (= 1) to &quot;coping well&quot; (= 6). These questions make up the coping scale. The raw score (sum of question scores [ranging from 8 to 48]) is transformed to a unified score, ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores correspond to a higher quality of life, and lower scores represent a lower quality of life. CFB is calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures were study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), sex, region (U.S./non-U.S.), OAB type (wet/dry), BL score, and treatment by study visit interaction.</description>

        <title>CFB at Week 12 in the Health-related Quality of Life (HRQL) Total Score From the OAB-q LF (1-week Recall) in All OAB Participants</title>
        <description>The OAB-q LF is a validated patient-reported outcome. The 25 questions comprising the Coping, Concern, Sleep and Social Interaction subscales of the OAB-q LF ask participants how much their symptoms have affected their life over the last week. Each question has a response ranging from &quot;None of the time&quot; (= 1) to &quot;All of the time&quot; (= 6). The raw score (sum of question scores for the 4 subscales [ranging from 25 to 150]) is transformed to a unified score, ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores correspond to a higher quality of life, and lower scores represent a lower quality of life. CFB is calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures were study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), sex, region (U.S./non-U.S.), OAB type (wet/dry), BL score, and treatment by study visit interaction.</description>

        <description>The OAB-q LF is a validated patient-reported outcome. The first 8 questions of the OAB-q LF ask participants how much they were bothered by their bladder symptoms during the previous week. Each question has a response ranging from &quot;Not at all&quot; (= 1) to &quot;A very great deal&quot; (= 6). These questions make up the symptom bother scale. The raw score (sum of question scores [ranging from 8 to 48]) is transformed to a unified score, ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores correspond to the symptoms having a larger bother, and lower scores represent a lower amount of bother due to symptoms. CFB is calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures were study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), sex, region (U.S./non-U.S.), OAB type (wet/dry), BL score, and treatment by study visit interaction.</description>

        <title>CFB at Week 12 in Overall Bladder Symptoms Based on Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-Severity) in All OAB Participants</title>
        <description>The Patient Global Impression (PGI) questions are designed to assess a participant's overall impression of OAB. For the PGI-Severity score, participants are asked to rate their OAB symptoms over the previous week with one of the following responses: 1 = none, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe. CFB is calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures were study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), OAB type (wet/dry), sex, region (U.S./non-U.S.), BL score, and treatment by study visit interaction.</description>

        <description>The Patient Global Impression (PGI) questions are designed to assess a participant's overall impression of OAB. For the PGI-Control score, participants were asked to rate how much control they had over their OAB symptoms over the previous week with one of the following responses: 1 = complete control, 2 = a lot of control, 3 = some control, 4 = only a little control, 5 = no control. CFB is calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures were study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12), OAB type (wet/dry), sex, region (U.S./non-U.S.), BL score, and treatment by study visit interaction.</description>
