      The objective of this program is to provide access to cemiplimab (REGN2810) to patients with&#xD;
      metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (mCSCC) or locally advanced cutaneous squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (laCSCC) who are not candidates for surgery prior to cemiplimab (REGN2810)&#xD;
      being commercially available.&#xD;

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma&#xD;
             (CSCC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hepatic function:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN; if liver metastases ≤3 x ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Transaminases ≤3 x ULN (or ≤5.0 x ULN, if liver metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 x ULN (or ≤5.0 x ULN, if liver or bone metastases)&#xD;
                  Patients with hepatic metastases: If transaminase levels (AST and/or ALT) are &gt;3&#xD;
                  x but ≤5 x ULN, total bilirubin must be ≤1.5 x ULN. If total bilirubin is &gt;1.5 x&#xD;
                  but ≤3 x ULN, both transaminases (AST and ALT) must be ≤3 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Renal function: serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl)&#xD;
             &gt;30 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Bone marrow function:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Platelet count ≥75 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients not candidates for surgery include the examples below, but are not limited&#xD;
             to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metastatic disease (distant or nodal)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recurrence in the same location and curative resection is unlikely&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Significant local invasion that precludes complete resection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Surgery may result in severe disfiguration or dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other conditions deemed to be contraindicating for surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that&#xD;
             required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk&#xD;
             for immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The following are not exclusionary:&#xD;
             vitiligo, childhood asthma that has resolved, type 1 diabetes, residual hypothyroidism&#xD;
             that required only hormone replacement, or psoriasis that does not require systemic&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior treatment with other immune modulating agents that was (a) within fewer than 4&#xD;
             weeks (28 days) prior to the first dose of cemiplimab (REGN2810), or (b) associated&#xD;
             with immune-mediated adverse events (AEs) that were ≥ Grade 1 within 90 days prior to&#xD;
             the first dose of cemiplimab (REGN2810), or (c) associated with toxicity that resulted&#xD;
             in discontinuation of the immune-modulating agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Continuous immunosuppressive corticosteroid treatment (doses &gt;10 mg prednisone daily&#xD;
             or equivalent) within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of cemiplimab (REGN2810)Note:&#xD;
             Patients who require brief course of steroids (eg, as prophylaxis for imaging studies)&#xD;
             are not excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active uncontrolled infection requiring therapy, including infection with human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus, or active infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis&#xD;
             C virus (HCV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of pneumonitis within the last 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply&#xD;
