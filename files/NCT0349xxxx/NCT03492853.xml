      Purpose: To examine the genotypes associated with the peripheral retinal phenotypic features&#xD;
      in patients with age-related macular degeneration documented with wide-field imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Clinic-based case series study in Croatia. Participants: 160 patients &gt;50 years of&#xD;
      age known to have early or advanced AMD and 150 subjects &gt;50 years of age without known AMD&#xD;
      (controls) Methods: Both groups of patients were examined with ophthalmoscopy and OCT to&#xD;
      confirm their classification. Posterior and peripheral fundus features were documented with&#xD;
      Optos wide-field imaging (Optos P200MA, Optos Plc, Dunfermline, Scotland) and graded. DNA was&#xD;
      extracted from blood samples and gene polymorphisms were evaluated for complement factor H&#xD;
      (CFH) rs1061170 and rs1410996, age-related maculopathy susceptibility (ARMS2) rs10490924,&#xD;
      high temperature requirement factor A1 (HtrA1) rs11200638, complement factor B (CFB)&#xD;
      rs4151667 and rs641153, complement factor 2 (C2) rs9332739 and rs547154 and complement factor&#xD;
      3 (C3) rs2230199.&#xD;

      Purpose: To examine the genotypes associated with the peripheral retinal phenotypic features&#xD;
      in patients with age-related macular degeneration documented with wide-field imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Clinic-based case series study in Croatia. Participants: Using standard protocols,&#xD;
      160 patients &gt;50 years of age known to have early or advanced AMD and 150 subjects &gt;50 years&#xD;
      of age without known AMD (controls) were studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: Both groups of patients were examined with ophthalmoscopy and OCT to&#xD;
      confirm their classification. Posterior and peripheral fundus features were documented with&#xD;
      Optos wide-field imaging (Optos P200MA, Optos Plc, Dunfermline, Scotland) and graded. DNA was&#xD;
      extracted from blood samples and gene polymorphisms were evaluated for complement factor H&#xD;

&#xD;
      The study cohort was identified among the clinical patients at the University Department of&#xD;
      Ophthalmology at University Hospital Centre &quot;Sestre milosrdnice&quot;, Zagreb, Croatia. The&#xD;
      protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee approval (EP-13030/11-13) of the University&#xD;
      Hospital Centre &quot;Sestre milosrdnice&quot; and complied with the tenets of the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki with the informed consent obtained from all the participants. We included 160&#xD;
      subjects in AMD group and 150 subjects in the control group who met the following criteria:&#xD;
      age exceeding 50 years, clinical signs of AMD in at least one eye in AMD group and without&#xD;
      signs of the disease in the control group. Exclusion criteria were as follows: confounding&#xD;
      maculopathy of any etiology, having a myopic refractive error more than -3.0 diopters in&#xD;
      either eye, failure to obtain readable color images documenting at least 270 degrees of the&#xD;
      retina (three quadrants), or failure to provide a peripheral blood sample for DNA extraction.&#xD;
      All the participants were examined according to standardized examination protocols where the&#xD;
      macular region and retinal periphery were photodocumented with Resmax and wide field imaging&#xD;
      respectively using the Optos P200MA camera (Optos plc, Dumfermline Scotland).23 Phenotypes&#xD;
      Eligibility for the AMD group was determined according to an international classification of&#xD;
      AMD.24,25 The retinal periphery was defined as an extramacular area 6000 Âµm diameter distant&#xD;
      from the foveolar centre and a grid template was used for measuring the distance. Following&#xD;
      peripheral retinal phenotypes were documented: peripheral drusen, reticular pigmentations&#xD;
      (RP), hyperpigmentations (pigment clumping (PC) or nevus (N)), hypopigmentations (peripheral&#xD;
      retinal pigment defects (RPD) or atrophic areas (AA)), other degenerations in aggregate (OD)&#xD;
      which include any of the following: microcystoid degenerations with degenerative&#xD;
      retinoschisis (RD), lattice degenerations (LD), snail-track degeneration (ST), white-without&#xD;
      pressure (WWP), paving stone degeneration(also known as cobblestone) (PS), retinal holes (R)&#xD;
      and vitreal opacities (VO). The inclusion criteria for the peripheral retinal change was its&#xD;
      size which had to exceed at least one hour of the retinal periphery Main outcome measures:&#xD;
      The type, localization and frequency of peripheral retinal changes and gene polymorphisms of&#xD;
      participants in both groups were examined.&#xD;
