  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the dosage for oral and IM Cabotegravir LA and IM&#xD;
      Rilpiverine LA and evaluate the safety, acceptability, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      oral and long-acting injectable cabotegravir and long-acting injectable rilpivirine in&#xD;
      virologically suppressed HIV-infected children and adolescents.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will confirm the dose and evaluate the safety, acceptability, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral cabotegravir (CAB), long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB&#xD;
      LA), and long-acting injectable rilpivirine (RPV LA) in virologically suppressed HIV-1&#xD;
      infected children and adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include two cohorts of participants and two steps of study participation in&#xD;
      each cohort. Cohort 1, Step 1 and Cohort 2, Step 3 are both a lead-in phase in which&#xD;
      participants will receive oral formulations of the study products for at least 4 weeks, and&#xD;
      up to 6 weeks (maximum). In Cohort 1, Step 2 and Cohort 2, Step 4, participants will receive&#xD;
      injectable formulations of the study products. In each cohort, participants will enter the&#xD;
      study in the oral lead-in phase (Step 1, or Step 3) and then transition to the injectable&#xD;
      phase (Step 2, or Step 4) if eligibility criteria for the injectable phase are met. Cohort 1,&#xD;
      Step 2, and Cohort 2, Step 4, participants, including those who prematurely permanently&#xD;
      discontinue injectable study product, will continue on-study for an additional 48 weeks after&#xD;
      their last study product injection, per the long-term safety and washout PK follow-up (LSFU)&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will open to accrual in Cohort 1, in which participants, in addition to continuing&#xD;
      their pre-study combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimen, will receive either oral&#xD;
      CAB or oral RPV (Step 1) followed by either CAB LA or RPV LA (Step 2). Cohort 1 participants&#xD;
      will be assigned either CAB (Cohort 1C) or RPV (Cohort 1R) based on their pre-study cART&#xD;
      regimen. Participants will not stop their cART. An interim analysis of safety and PK data&#xD;
      will be performed, and Cohort 2 will initially open to accrual based on these interim&#xD;
      analyses; however, accrual at this stage will be limited to Cohort 1 participants who meet&#xD;
      criteria to enter Cohort 2. After Cohort 1 is fully enrolled and a full cohort data analysis&#xD;
      is performed, accrual into Cohort 2 will be opened to additional participants who were not&#xD;
      previously enrolled in Cohort 1. Upon Cohort 2 Entry (i.e. Cohort 2, Step 3), all Cohort 2&#xD;
      participants will discontinue their pre-study cART regimen and receive both study products -&#xD;
      CAB and RPV - at the doses confirmed in Cohort 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Cohort 1 will be followed for up to 64 weeks, and participants in Cohort 2&#xD;
      will be followed for up to 144 weeks. Enrolled parents/caregivers will complete a single&#xD;
      qualitative phone interview (U.S. sites only).&#xD;

                  been initiated within the prescribed time, per the respective contraceptive&#xD;
                  method, to be considered effective at the time of Entry. The site IoR or designee&#xD;
                  is responsible for ensuring that the contraceptive is used in accordance with the&#xD;
                  approved product label, and counseling participants on proper use of chosen&#xD;

                  detection of the assay (transient detectable viremia, or &quot;blip&quot;) prior to&#xD;
                  screening is not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
