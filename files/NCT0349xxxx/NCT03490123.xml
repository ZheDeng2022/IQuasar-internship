  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current principle of yaws eradication (the Morges strategy) is based on single round mass&#xD;
      drug administration (MDA) of azithromycin (AZI) called total community treatment (TCT)&#xD;
      followed by targeted treatment of active cases every 6 months to detect and treat cases and&#xD;
      contacts called total targeted treatment (TTT). Studies done in Papua New Guinea (PNG) show&#xD;
      that 1 round of MDA will probably not suffice to stop transmission of infection. It may be&#xD;
      preferable to conduct 3 rounds of MDA prior to the switch to TTT because of high coverage&#xD;
      requirements to achieve elimination, particularly of latent cases. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      determine whether 3 rounds of MDA are more effective for reaching yaws elimination. This&#xD;
      research is needed to guide national programmatic implementation and needs to be done as soon&#xD;
      as possible to scale up the program in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this proposal is to ascertain the number of rounds of MDA with AZI to be included&#xD;
      in an improved strategy towards yaws eradication. The study will be implemented in 38 wards&#xD;
      of New Ireland Province (NIP). The investigators will compare two different distribution&#xD;
      strategies of MDA: (A) strategy with 3 biannual rounds of MDA and (B) a single mass treatment&#xD;
      round of MDA followed by targeted treatment of cases and contacts. The investigators will&#xD;
      also monitor the risk of appearance of antimicrobial resistance in Treponema pertenue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2013 WHO piloted the yaws eradication MDA strategy in several countries, including PNG. A&#xD;
      study carried out on Lihir Island has shown that 1-round MDA with single-dose oral AZI&#xD;
      reduced the prevalence of yaws by 90% at 12-months. However, this did not suffice to stop&#xD;
      transmission of infection. At baseline, the estimated prevalence of PCR-confirmed active&#xD;
      infection was 1.8% and greatly reduced to 0.4% at 6-months, and 0.1% at 24 months; but&#xD;
      prevalence increased again to 0.4% at 42 months after MDA. The relapse of untreated latent&#xD;
      infections appeared to hinder elimination efforts in this community. Almost half of subjects&#xD;
      with newly identified active yaws cases during follow up targeted treatment programs reported&#xD;
      having not been present for MDA. T. p. pertenue may become resistant to macrolide&#xD;
      antibiotics, as has occurred with T. p. pallidum (the causative agent of syphilis) in some&#xD;
      developed countries, which necessitates close monitoring for the emergence of resistance. The&#xD;
      investigators recently reported the first documented genotypic macrolide resistance in T. p.&#xD;
      pertenue infections in PNG. A total of five clinical specimens, out of 208 samples tested&#xD;
      during the post-MDA period of 3Â·5 years, demonstrated a T. p. pertenue strain carrying the&#xD;
      A2059G point mutation. There was only local spread of the resistant clone among relatives and&#xD;
      friends and further spread was immediately stopped through the use of alternative (benzathine&#xD;
      penicillin) antibiotic to treat the newly identified cases and contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible population will be people targeted for MDA treatment living in the three LLG&#xD;
      study areas at time of implementation. The 38 wards will be randomly assigned (1:1) to&#xD;
      receive 1 vs 3 rounds of MDA using AZI. All villages within a ward will receive the same&#xD;
      intervention in an effort to minimize contamination between villages. The intervention arm&#xD;
      will receive 3 rounds (0, 6, 12 months) of MDA with AZI, each round known as total community&#xD;
      treatment (TCT); control arm will receive 1 round (0 months) of MDA with AZI followed by&#xD;
      total targeted treatment (TTT) (6 and 12 months). During each MDA round all study&#xD;
      participants will receive 30 mg/Kg (maximum 2 g) of AZI orally under direct observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be prevalence of PCR-confirmed active yaws measured in the entire&#xD;
      population at 18 months. The investigators will estimate the evolution of latent yaws&#xD;
      prevalence measured as the proportion of children 1-15 years who are dually positive on the&#xD;
      DPP test at two time-points (0, 18 months).&#xD;
