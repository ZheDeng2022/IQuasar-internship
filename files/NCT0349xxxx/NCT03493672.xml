      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal selection of patients with cancer eligible for a clinical trial, is of utmost&#xD;
      importance, but can be very difficult. Patients must be sufficiently fit and have a&#xD;
      reasonable life expectancy, to be eligible for participation in clinical trials. In current&#xD;
      clinical practice, the ECOG/WHO performance status, is used to select patients for clinical&#xD;
      trials, and it has proven to be an independent predictor of survival in patients with cancer.&#xD;
      This score is based on a subjective assessment of the treating physician, which can, together&#xD;
      with the strong motivation of some patients to participate, lead to overestimation of a&#xD;
      patient's actual physical condition and may thereby contribute to early trial&#xD;
      discontinuation. Participation of these patients may not only harm them, but will also hamper&#xD;
      trial conduct and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both, physical activity and fitness are positively associated with survival in patients with&#xD;
      cancer. This gives rise to the investigators hypothesis that objective measurements can be of&#xD;
      added value in the selection process. Additionally, preliminary results in 50 patients with&#xD;
      cancer that participated in part 1 of the &quot;Counting Steps!&quot; project revealed that the&#xD;
      smartphone can produce valid and reliable assessments of physical activity and fitness, and&#xD;
      the user friendliness was rated &quot;good&quot; by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that measurements of physical activity and fitness with&#xD;
      smartphones will provide more objective and accurate information about the actual physical&#xD;
      condition of a patient with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a better prediction of trial feasibility (without early trial discontinuation) and&#xD;
      overall survival in patients participating in phase I-II clinical trials, the selection of&#xD;
      eligible trial participants could be improved. In this way, it is possible to more adequately&#xD;
      identify patients who are most likely to successfully participate in a clinical trial and&#xD;
      thereby have the highest chance to benefit from trial participation. Successful trial&#xD;
      participation will provide optimal palliative care to patients and improve their quality of&#xD;
      life. In addition, it may prohibit participation of patients who are currently incorrectly&#xD;
      included in clinical trials and suffer from toxic therapies without having a chance to&#xD;
      benefit from treatment. A better selection of patients will be beneficial for the trial&#xD;
      outcomes and subsequently for the development of new anticancer drugs or treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify whether objective smartphone measurements of physical activity and fitness is&#xD;
           predictive for trial feasibility (without early trial discontinuation) in patients with&#xD;
           cancer participating in phase I-II clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the use of the smartphone's objective&#xD;
           assessments of physical activity and fitness in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ 135 patients with hematologic or solid cancer referred to the VU medical center for&#xD;
      participation in phase I-II clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this observational study, patients will not receive an additional intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of medical treatment, physicians will rate the performance status, and&#xD;
      participants will wear a smartphone for one week to measure the daily number of steps, to&#xD;
      complete the 6 minute walk test using the smartphone application, and to fill out the 5-item&#xD;
      physical function subscale of the EORTC QLQ-C30. These assessments will be repeated after 4&#xD;
      and 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No extra visits to the hospital will be necessary. Participation in this study will not cause&#xD;
      any additional risks or expected benefits for participants. It will only deliver knowledge,&#xD;
      which may be used in the future to better select patients eligible for participation in phase&#xD;
      I-II clinical trials or even for regular treatment. Participation in the study will only cost&#xD;
      time for patients. The patients will be asked to wear a smartphone for a week, have to&#xD;
      perform a six-minute walk test (6MWT) once in this week and have to complete a questionnaire&#xD;
      about their own physical function once. Subsequently, patients will repeat those measurements&#xD;
      4 and 8 weeks after inclusion in the phase I-II clinical trial.&#xD;
