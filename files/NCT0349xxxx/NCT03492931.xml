    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I study is to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of&#xD;
      ticagrelor in pediatric patients from 0 to less than 24 months with sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ticagrelor dose level adjustment will require a Protocol amendment and regulatory approval.&#xD;

      Study design This Phase I paediatric study (in patients aged 0 to &lt;24 months) with ticagrelor&#xD;
      is planned to be a multi-centre, open-label, single dose study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the PK properties of ticagrelor after a single oral dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the PK properties of the active metabolite (AR-C124910XX) after a single oral&#xD;
      dose To assess the acceptability and the palatability of a single oral dose of ticagrelor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of ticagrelor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment At least 20 eligible patients will receive a single open label oral&#xD;
      dose of ticagrelor on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods A population PK analysis approach will be used to determine the PK&#xD;
      parameters of ticagrelor and its metabolite AR-C124910XX in paediatric patients aged 0 to &lt;24&#xD;
      months eg, CL/F (oral clearance) (only for ticagrelor) and AUC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PK will also be described by presenting the observed plasma concentrations of Ticagrelor&#xD;
      and its active metabolite for all individuals, as well as corresponding descriptive&#xD;
      statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No statistical comparisons are planned for the primary or secondary objectives, which will be&#xD;
      summarised descriptively&#xD;
