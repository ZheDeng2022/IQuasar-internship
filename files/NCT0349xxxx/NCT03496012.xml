    <measure>Percentage of Participants with a ≥15-Letter Improvement from Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at Month 12 as Measured by the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Chart</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA will be assessed for both eyes using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity (VA) chart. BCVA test should be performed prior to pupil dilation, and distance refraction should be carried out before BCVA is measured. Initially, letters are read at a distance of 4 meters from the chart. If &lt;20 letters are read at 4 meters, testing at 1 meter should be performed. BCVA is to be reported as number of letters read correctly by the participant using the ETDRS Scale (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in contrast sensitivity in the study eye is measured using a Pelli Robson contrast sensitivity chart at 1 meter. The contrast sensitivity chart contains letters that are darkest at the top and then get progressively lighter. Scores range from 0 to 48 and are based on the number of letters read correctly. A negative change from baseline indicates a worsening in contrast sensitivity and a positive change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>
