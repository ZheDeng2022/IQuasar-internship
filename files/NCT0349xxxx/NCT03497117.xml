  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use perfluorinated gas imaging to highlight regions of&#xD;
      functional variation within the lungs of participants with cystic fibrosis (CF), and to&#xD;
      correlate this with changes in spirometry, lung clearance index, and quality of life of CF&#xD;
      subjects undergoing treatment for a pulmonary exacerbation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that 19F-enhanced MRI will detect improvements in lung&#xD;
      ventilation following the treatment of a CF pulmonary exacerbation, and changes in&#xD;
      ventilation as well as global MRI scores will track with both spirometry and quality of life&#xD;
      assessments. Therefore, investigators propose this pilot and feasibility study to gain&#xD;
      preliminary data on a comparison of the changes in ventilation that occur with treatment of a&#xD;
      pulmonary exacerbation, as well as to begin to understand the repeatability of this novel&#xD;
      outcome measure. Through this study, the investigators aim to: 1) Compare quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative assessments of lung ventilation using 19F MRI imaging and traditional, global&#xD;
      physiologic assessments (spirometry, LCI) and compare these with images obtained in an&#xD;
      age-matched healthy control population; 2) Correlate changes in MRI scoring with subjective&#xD;
      changes in health related outcomes as measured by the CFQ-R (Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire -&#xD;
      Revised); 3) Determine the ability of 19F MRI to detect changes in ventilation that occur&#xD;
      with treatment of a CF pulmonary exacerbation; and 4) Determine the repeatability of 19F MRI&#xD;
      assessment of ventilation in a disease population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with CF with baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of at least&#xD;
      40%, no contraindications to MRI, and oxygen saturation &gt;90% on room air will be&#xD;
      prospectively enrolled. Investigators will recruit a pre-defined cross-section of CF patients&#xD;
      with mild, moderate, and severe lung disease, with approximately 4 subjects per group at the&#xD;
      onset of a disease exacerbation requiring antibiotic intervention. The research team will&#xD;
      obtain a pre-response MRI (within 3 days of initiating oral, inhaled, or IV antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy), and a post-treatment MRI (within 3 days of terminating antibiotic treatment) to&#xD;
      assess the responsiveness of 19F-MRI to a change in disease status. Each 19F-MRI study will&#xD;
      be combined with assessments of spirometry, LCI (multiple breath nitrogen washout), and&#xD;
      quality of life (CFQ-R quality of life tool).&#xD;
&#xD;
      19F-MRI will be performed by having each participant inhale a mixture of 79% perfluorinated&#xD;
      propane (PFP) and 21% oxygen (pre-mixed) while using MRI to obtain 3D images. Subsequently,&#xD;
      participants will be switched to room air, and cycled breathing will be continued while&#xD;
      additional MRI images are captured to characterize gas wash-out. Safety measures, including&#xD;
      pulse oximetry, will be monitored continuously, and spirometry will be performed before and&#xD;
      after each MRI. Participants will also perform multiple breath washout maneuvers to obtain a&#xD;
      lung clearance index, so this may be correlated to wash-out kinetics of the PFP.&#xD;
