  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA) on&#xD;
      outcomes for pain, sleep, and physical activity level in an active duty military sample with&#xD;
      subacute or chronic lower back pain (LBP). BFA is a form of auricular acupuncture (AA) that&#xD;
      has been implemented in many Department of Defense (DoD)/Veterans Affairs (VA) medical&#xD;
      settings to alleviate acute or chronic pain. BFA uses five predetermined locations in a&#xD;
      defined sequence to place semi-permanent needles in the ear. Subacute lower back pain is pain&#xD;
      that has persistently lasted from four to twelve weeks. Chronic lower back pain is pain that&#xD;
      lasts more than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Participants with subacute or chronic LBP will have reduced pain using BFA as&#xD;
      compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Participants with subacute or chronic LBP will have improved physical activity&#xD;
      using BFA as compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Participants with subacute or chronic LBP will have improved sleep quality as&#xD;
      compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary study aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore the effects of BFA two weeks following the treatment for LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Do positive outcomes appreciated with BFA persist over two weeks?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. What is the pain medication usage during and after intervention treatments?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the effectiveness of BFA on trunk flexion mobility and balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Does pain reduction improve trunk flexion and balance?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Does improved truck flexion mobility and balance contribute to increased physical&#xD;
                activity?&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain level change over time on the Defense/Veterans Pain Rating Scale(DVPRS).</measure>
    <time_frame>The DVPRS will be administered weekly for seven times. Followed by a one time washout 2 weeks later.</time_frame>
    <description>Participant reported pain level using the DVPRS. DVPRS pain level ranks from 0 (no pain) to 10 (As bad as it can be. Nothing else matters).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain medication need.</measure>
    <time_frame>A medication form will be administered weekly for seven times. Followed by a one time washout 2 weeks later.</time_frame>
    <description>A self reported increase, decrease, or no change in medication use.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in trunk flexion.</measure>
    <time_frame>Trunk flexion will be administered weekly for seven times. Followed by a one time washout 2 weeks later. If the participant has a DVPRS &gt;=2 and mODI &gt;=20%, trunk flexion will also be measured after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Trunk flexion will be assessed with Dual Digital Inclinometers. The Dual Digital Inclinometer is placed around the sacrum and measures the angle of flexion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in balance</measure>
    <time_frame>The FRT and TUG will be administered weekly for seven times. Followed by a one time washout 2 weeks later. If the participant has a DVPRS &gt;=2 and mODI &gt;=20%, the FRT and TUG will also be measured after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Balance is measured by Functional Reach Test(FRT) and Timed Up and Go Test(TUG). The FRT assesses a patient's stability by measuring the maximum distance an individual can reach forward while standing in a fixed position. The TUG is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. It measures the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>The mODI will be administered weekly for seven times. Followed by a one time washout 2 weeks later. The Actigraph watch is worn the entire 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Activity will be measured using an Actigraph watch and Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnairre(mODI)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>The ESS and ISI will be administered weekly for seven times. Followed by a one time washout 2 weeks later. The Actigraph watch is worn the entire 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep will be measured using an Actigraph watch, Epworth Sleepiness Scale(ESS), and Insomnia Severity Index(ISI)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Health and well being</measure>
    <time_frame>The SF-8 is administered the first, fourth, and eighth week.</time_frame>
    <description>Health and well being is measured using the SF-8 Health Survey (4 Week Recall).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Height, weight, and Body Mass Index(BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Height, weight, and BMI is measured the first and eighth week.</time_frame>
    <description>The participants height and weight is measured. A BMI is also calculated using the following formula: BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in meters squared.</description>
