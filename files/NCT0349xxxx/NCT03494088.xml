  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's primary aim is to explore the potential differences in the gut mycobiome of&#xD;
      children with autism spectrum disorder compared to otherwise healthy children. The secondary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate whether the presence of specific species of fungi&#xD;
      (e.g. Candida tropicalis, C. albicans, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae), in stool: 1) correlates&#xD;
      with increased gastrointestinal symptoms; 2) correlates with evidence of increased behavioral&#xD;
      problems (as assessed by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist or Social Responsiveness Scale-2);&#xD;
      or 3) plays the same role as a constituent of commensal gut microflora as in normal controls.&#xD;
      The scale indicates severity of social deficits in the autism spectrum as mild, moderate or&#xD;
      severe. Additionally, the study aims to compare the fecal and oral fungi in these children&#xD;
      because many fecal mycobiota are felt to originate in the oropharynx.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  for autistic children with GI symptoms: confirmed diagnosis of autism spectrum&#xD;
             disorder (ASD) and its severity (DSM-5: 299.00) by Autism Diagnostic Interview&#xD;
             (ADI-R), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), and Autism Diagnostic Observation&#xD;
             SChedule-2 (ADOS-2); substantial gastrointestinal symptoms (as indicated by score of&#xD;
             greater than 7 on the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Severity Index)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  for autistic children without GI symptoms: confirmed diagnosis of autism spectrum&#xD;
             disorder (ASD) and its severity (DSM-5: 299.00) by Autism Diagnostic Interview&#xD;
             (ADI-R), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), and Autism Diagnostic Observation&#xD;
             SChedule-2 (ADOS-2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  for controls: healthy children&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  major psychiatric illness (e.g., psychotic disorders that might interfere with&#xD;
             assessment). (however, children with common psychological problems such as depression&#xD;
             and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder will not be excluded, given that doing so&#xD;
             would result in a sample of children with ASD that would be unrepresentative of the&#xD;
             pediatric ASD population as a whole.)- children who appear genetically syndromic&#xD;
             (based on exam in the pediatric GI clinic)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  taking immunosuppressive medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  abnormal screening labs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  GI diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  allergy to antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  fever or a pre-existing adverse event monitored in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  known history of hepatitis B/C or HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  known pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  use of probiotics in the last 60 d&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  use of oral antibiotics/anti-fungal during the previous 2 weeks&#xD;
