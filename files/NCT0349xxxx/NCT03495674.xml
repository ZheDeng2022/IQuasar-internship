    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well cycling works in preventing colorectal cancer in participants&#xD;
      with Lynch syndrome. Exercise such as cycling may reduce colorectal cancer risk in&#xD;
      participants with Lynch syndrome.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility of a 12-month exercise cycling intervention among Lynch syndrome&#xD;
      (LS) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effect size of exercise on circulating biomarkers as well as regulation of&#xD;
      genomic, transcriptomic, and immunologic biomarkers in normal intestinal mucosa of LS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Starting on day 15, participants wear FITBIT and complete cycling classes over 45&#xD;
      minutes 3 times a week for a total of 12 classes a month for up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Starting on day 15, participants receive information about exercise guidelines and&#xD;
      wear FITBIT to track heart rate and activities for up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study interventions, participants are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have Lynch syndrome defined as meeting any of the following: (1)&#xD;
             Mutation-positive Lynch syndrome: carriers or obligate carriers (by pedigree) of a&#xD;
             pathogenic mutation in one of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mismatch repair (MMR)&#xD;
             genes (i.e. MLH1, MSH2/EPCAM, MSH6, or PMS2) or (2) Mutation-negative Lynch syndrome:&#xD;
             patients with a personal history of a non-sporadic MMR deficient premalignant lesion&#xD;
             (i.e. polyp) or a non sporadic MMR deficient malignant tumor (where non-sporadic MMR&#xD;
             deficient is defined by: microsatellite instability high by either&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry or microsatellite instability (MSI) testing or both, but no&#xD;
             evidence of MLH1 promoter methylation in cases with loss of both MLH1 and PMS2, and/or&#xD;
             no evidence of BRAF mutation in cases with loss of both MLH1 and PMS2) but germline&#xD;
             MMR genetic testing showed either a variant of unknown significance or mutation&#xD;
             negative result or had declined germline MMR genetic testing.&#xD;

             (i.e. participants must have at least part of the descending/sigmoid colon and/or&#xD;
             rectum intact).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must consent to two standard of care lower gastro-intestinal GI endoscopy&#xD;
             (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) with biopsies that will be 12 months (+/-21&#xD;
             days) apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are status post total proctocolectomy (i.e. removal of all colon and&#xD;
             rectum).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with history of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary-artery bypass&#xD;
             draft, invasive coronary revascularization, arrhythmia requiring treatment such as&#xD;
             atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary&#xD;
             embolism, or deep venous thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable&#xD;
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of diabetes, hypertension, or have smoked cigarettes in the&#xD;
             last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are unable to participate in cycling due to musculoskeletal&#xD;
             limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are unable to identify cycling classes in their community for&#xD;
             exercise.&#xD;
