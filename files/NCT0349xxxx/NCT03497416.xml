  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative anemia is a known risk factor for morbidity, mortality and increased healthcare&#xD;
      resource utilisation. The Investigator's previous study demonstrated the rate of preoperative&#xD;
      anemia in Singapore General Hospital (SGH) to be at 26.6%. The rate is highest in the elderly&#xD;
      group which stands at 49.9%. The main objective of this study is to investigate the&#xD;
      perioperative morbidity and mortality, blood transfusion rate, healthcare outcomes and&#xD;
      patient-centric outcomes among anemic elderly patients undergoing major surgery. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that elderly patients who undergoes major abdominal surgery with&#xD;
      preoperative anemia will have higher composite morbidity and mortality rates (primary&#xD;
      outcome), longer length of hospital stay, higher blood transfusion requirements and lower&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 1, 3 and 6 months (secondary outcomes) when&#xD;
      compared to elderly patients without preoperative anemia. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      prospective observational study of 450 consecutive patients above 65 years, who are&#xD;
      undergoing elective major open abdominal surgery in SGH over 12 months. Baseline clinical&#xD;
      assessment, including iron studies for anemic patients, will be done within 14 days prior to&#xD;
      surgery. To determine the primary outcome, patients will be followed up prospectively for 30&#xD;
      days from the day of surgery. This will be done via a mixture of medical records review and&#xD;
      phone interview. For secondary outcomes, the length of hospital stay and readmissions for any&#xD;
      reason within 3 and 6 months will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRQoL questionnaires will be done through phone calls by a study team member. Findings from&#xD;
      this study will hopefully fill the knowledge gaps such as how anemia impacts elderly people&#xD;
      in terms of perioperative morbidity, mortality, postsurgical quality of life and their&#xD;
      eventual return to the community as well as providing local data on the healthcare resource&#xD;
      utilisation in this group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative anemia is a common and important problem in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have established association between preoperative anemia and poor postoperative&#xD;
      outcomes. Some propose that preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor of adverse&#xD;
      outcomes. Preoperative anemia is also one of the strongest predictors of perioperative blood&#xD;
      transfusion which is independently associated with increased risk of perioperative morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Consequently, preoperative anemia increases healthcare utilization and costs&#xD;
      due to increased blood transfusion requirements, prolonged length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      hospital readmission rates. As more elderly patients undergo surgery yearly, there is a need&#xD;
      to improve perioperative outcome, contain healthcare costs and help rapid return to&#xD;
      community. Addressing preoperative anemia could be one such strategy as it may lead to&#xD;
      decreased need for blood transfusion, and reduction of morbidity and mortality, and improved&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. The relationship between anemia and quality of life is well&#xD;
      documented in patients with cancer and with end-stage renal failure, but not so well examined&#xD;
      in elderly postoperative patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the impact of preoperative anemia on&#xD;
      postoperative complications as defined by presence of Postoperative Morbidity Survey (POMS)&#xD;
      defined complications at day 5. The 9 domains within POMS allow classification of&#xD;
      complications into various organ categories, such as cardiac, respiratory, infectious etc.&#xD;
      The secondary aim of this study is to investigate the impact of preoperative anemia on the&#xD;
      severity of post operative complications as classified with the Clavien Dindo Classification&#xD;
      and Comprehensive Complication Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other secondary aims of this study include investigating the association between preoperative&#xD;
      anemia and length of hospital stay, readmission within 6 months, days alive and out of&#xD;
      hospital (DaOH) within 6 months, and 30-day mortality. Data generated on the potential&#xD;
      healthcare costs of this modifiable risk factor would help to provide the background for&#xD;
      future studies on intervention strategies and its cost effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another secondary aim of the study is to examine the relationship between preoperative anemia&#xD;
      and baseline and postoperative health-related quality of life indices up to 6 months&#xD;
      postoperative using the EQ-5D questionnaire. The results of this study will encourage&#xD;
      policies that risk profile patients who may require extra support on returning to the&#xD;
      community. In the longer term, the investigators hope to spur studies which look at the&#xD;
      optimal hemoglobin level prior to hospital discharge after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this study will have a significant impact on the way clinicians and&#xD;
      researchers approach preoperative anemia in the elderly. The full clinical, patient-centred,&#xD;
      and economic impact of operating on an anemic elderly patient has not been clearly&#xD;
      elucidated, especially in the local context. In the longer term, this study may set the&#xD;
      foundation for nationwide policies to address anemia in the surgical population with the aim&#xD;
      of improving patient outcomes in the most cost effective manner.&#xD;
