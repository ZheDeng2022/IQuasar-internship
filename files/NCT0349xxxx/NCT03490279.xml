  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diverticular disease is a chronic pathology, characterized by recurrent abdominal symptoms&#xD;
      and a high social impact, with a high prevalence in developed countries, especially among the&#xD;
      elderly. Diverticula are thought to develop from age-related degeneration of the mucosal wall&#xD;
      and segmental increases in colon pressure resulting in bulging at points of weakness,&#xD;
      typically at the insertion of the vasa recta. Classification of diverticular disease is&#xD;
      largely based on symptoms: it begins with the development of diverticulosis, to asymptomatic&#xD;
      disease, to symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) and finally to complicated&#xD;
      disease when patients develop abscesses, phlegmon, bleeding, fistula and sepsis.&#xD;
      Approximately the 20% of the patients with diverticular disease has symptoms, such as&#xD;
      abdominal pain, fever and altered bowel movement and, in the last decades, a significant&#xD;
      increase of the incidence of complications related to the disease has been recorded, in&#xD;
      particular of intestinal perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactoferrin (Lf) is a glycoprotein present in several secretory liquids - i.e. milk, saliva&#xD;
      and tears - with antimicrobial properties that it exert to seizing iron, thus preventing the&#xD;
      use by the pathogens, or altering their plasma membrane through its highly cationic charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the antimicrobial and immunoregulatory characteristics of&#xD;
      the Lf can be used to maintain an adequate homeostasis of the intestinal mucosa in patients&#xD;
      with SUDD resulting in an improvement of both symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;

      The investigators will verify whether a 4-week treatment with lactoferrin CRX is able to&#xD;
      reduce SUDD-related symptoms, thus improving patient's quality of life. Symptoms will be&#xD;
      assessed with the questionnaire by Tursi et al.&#xD;
