    <textblock>
      To demonstrate the comparative effectiveness of Lucentis (ranibizumab) in patients with well&#xD;
      controlled compared to those with poorly controlled diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for the study will be the mean change in best-corrected visual acuity&#xD;
      (BCVA) from baseline to Month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of patients, based on HbA1c levels will be entered into the trial -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patients with a recent HbA1c level &lt; 7.5 % (the 'well controlled' subgroup) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patients with a recent HbA1c level ≥ 10.0% (the 'poorly controlled' subgroup).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ranibizumab treatment will be administered over the 12-month period, initial 3 monthly&#xD;
      injections, followed by 'as needed' protocol using the following principles:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly ranibizumab injections would be suspended when:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No further BCVA improvement from treatment at the last 2 consecutive follow up visits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BCVA letter score &gt;84 (6/6) at the last 2 consecutive follow up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly ranibizumab injections would be reinitiated when:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Decrease in BCVA due to DME progression in the opinion of the investigator Laser treatment&#xD;
      could also be administered from 3 months after study initiation, according to the&#xD;
      investigators decision, in accordance with ETDRS guidelines, and at intervals of at least 3&#xD;
      months from the last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit schedule: Screening visit then monthly visits for 12 visits (total of 13 visits)&#xD;

             measured within the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with visual impairment due to either focal or diffuse DME in at least one eye&#xD;
             who are eligible for laser treatment in the opinion of the investigator. The study eye&#xD;

             eye will be selected by the investigator, based on potential for improvement): i) BCVA&#xD;
             score between 73 and 39 letters, inclusively, using LogMAR visual acuity testing&#xD;
             charts at 4 metres (or at the equivalent appropriate testing distance for the chart&#xD;
             size) (approximate Snellen equivalent between 6/12 (20/40) and 6/48 (20/160); ii) the&#xD;
