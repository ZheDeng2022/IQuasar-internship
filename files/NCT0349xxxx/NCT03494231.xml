      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of fully human anti-VEGFR2 monoclonal antibody, HLX06, in patients with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic tumors refractory to standard therapy. This study will also evaluate&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and anti-tumor effect of HLX06 and&#xD;
      explore the potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Angiogenesis plays an important role in cancer development. The VEGF family and their&#xD;
      receptors (VEGFR) are well characterized for their role in neoplastic angiogenesis. VEGFR2&#xD;
      belongs to type V receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by KDR gene, and is expressed in vascular&#xD;
      endothelial cells. It is a primary responder to vascular endothelial growth factor signal&#xD;
      that regulates endothelial migration and proliferation. The expression of VEGFR2 can be found&#xD;
      in multiple tumor types, including angiosarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma. In epithelial carcinoma,&#xD;
      VEGFR2 expression can be found in mesothelioma, non-small cell lung cancer, and embryonal&#xD;
      carcinoma. Targeting angiogenesis using either small molecule inhibitors or biological agents&#xD;
      have been widely used in current cancer management. Current approved anti-angiogenesis&#xD;
      biological agents include bevacizumab, ramucirumab, aflibercept. Among them, ramucirumab&#xD;
      (IMC-1121B) targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Ramucirumab has&#xD;
      been approved for use in combination with paclitaxel for second-line treatment of patients&#xD;
      with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although ramucirumab has been approved for gastric cancer, its improvement in overall&#xD;
      survival is still not satisfactory. It prolongs the overall survival by 6 weeks when combined&#xD;
      with paclitaxel. So far, there is not biomarker available to predict the efficacy of&#xD;
      ramucirumab. Therefore, a new monoclonal antibody also targeting VEGFR2 might provide better&#xD;
      efficacy for cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HLX06 is a new, fully human monoclonal antibody targeting VEGFR2. It has better binding&#xD;
      affinity to VEGFR2, and also binds to different region in VEGFR2. In vitro studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the growth inhibition of human endothelial cells, and HLX06 has shown growth&#xD;
      inhibition of tumors in xenogeneic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonclinical studies up to weekly 150 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys for 13 weeks have shown good&#xD;
      tolerability without evident toxicities (please refer to Investigator's brochure). HLX06&#xD;
      shows cross-reactivity to both monkey and human VEGFR2, but does not bind rodent VEGFR2. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that HLX06 will provide a better alternative than ramucirumab for&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, HLX06 has not yet been tested in humans. Therefore, the investigators propose this&#xD;
      first-in-human phase 1 study. In this study, the investigators intend to monitor the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of HLX06 in humans, and hope to identify the maximum tolerated dose, and&#xD;
      determine the recommended phase 2 dose for future study. At the same time, the investigators&#xD;
      would like to collect information of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug&#xD;
      and its potential immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize the risk of patients who volunteer to receive this experimental drug, the&#xD;
      investigators have selected 250 mg flat dose as the starting dose. The reason for using flat&#xD;
      dosing instead of body weight-adjusted dosing is based on previous population pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      studies for multiple monoclonal antibody drugs. The 500 mg flat dose was conservatively&#xD;
      selected to provide sufficient safety factor in the FIH study, based on 1/6 of the human&#xD;
      equivalent dose (1/3) of the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) in 3 month repeat-dose&#xD;
      studies in cynomolgus monkeys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the dose required to reach maximal effect, the investigators propose a dose&#xD;
      escalation sequence. The purpose of the dose escalation is to obtain the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of HLX06 at different dose levels, and investigate its relationship with&#xD;
      adverse reactions. Also, the investigators intend to identify the MTD. The information from&#xD;
      the dose escalation is crucial to determine the optimal dose in future studies and potential&#xD;
      indications for HLX06.&#xD;
