    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety of changing pain medications (opioids) adult sickle cell&#xD;
      patients take to another type of medication therapy (buprenorphine). Patients will be asked&#xD;
      questions about their quality of life. Other tools for assessment will also be administered.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a descriptive, pilot study to assess the safety of converting a subset of adult&#xD;
      sickle cell patients who are on effective disease modifying therapy (on high dose oral&#xD;
      opioids who are unable to wean off opioids) and who continue to have frequent acute visits&#xD;
      where parenteral opioids are administered to convert all opioid treatments to buprenorphine.&#xD;
      Quality of life will be assessed using the Adult Sickle Cell Quality of life Measurement tool&#xD;
      (ASCQ-Me), the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), two Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement&#xD;
      Information System (PROMIS) surveys (short-form Pain Interference and Physical Function), and&#xD;
      frequency of acute pain visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Buprenorphine is a partial mu-agonist and kappa antagonist and has a high affinity for the mu&#xD;
      receptors with an elimination half-life of 28-37 hours for the sublingual administration. The&#xD;
      lower risk for misuse, diminished withdrawal symptoms and cravings for opioids as well as the&#xD;
      reduced risk of overdose make it an appealing alternative. Recent data on successful&#xD;
      conversion for patients with chronic pain show a decrease in pain scores and increase in&#xD;
      quality of life measurements after the beginning buprenorphine therapy for more than two&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose will be determined for each patient by a physician to ensure that the dosage&#xD;
      of buprenorphine will be appropriate given the patient's current opioid dosage. There is the&#xD;
      risk of withdrawal induced vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days prior to conversion to buprenorphine, a patient will take the ASCQ-Me, BPI,&#xD;
      and two PROMIS surveys. Twenty-four hours prior to conversion, the patient will stop all&#xD;
      opioid intake. The day of conversion, the patient will take a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal&#xD;
      Scale (COWS) survey to determine whether they are in withdrawal. If so, the patient will&#xD;
      begin buprenorphine conversion. They will also retake the aforementioned quality of life&#xD;
      surveys. The patient will return on days 1, 14, 30, 90, and 180 to be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>Data will be collected on need for hospitalization within 72 hours of conversion due to withdrawal induced vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). If 2 out of the first 5 patients require hospitalization within 72 hours of conversion the study will be stopped and we will assess what changes need to be made in the protocol to decrease the risk of hospitalization triggered by the conversion.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months (final patient completes October 30 2020)</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of quality of life measured by Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System (ASCQ-Me). There are a fixed set of 5 items or questions for one domain. A unique aspect of ASCQ-Me measures is their use of standardized scores that are centered on a clinical population of people with sickle cell disease. Such scores are called &quot;normative&quot; because their value represents how close or far away they are from a normative population. The meaning of the score is defined by how it compares to the scores of others in a referent population. A score of 40 is one Standard Deviation lower than the mean of the reference population. A score of 60 is one Standard Deviation higher than the mean of the reference population</description>

    <description>All patients will be in opiate withdrawal at the time of buprenorphine initiation. The level of withdrawal will be measured by the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), an 11-item scale designed to be administered by a clinician. The score ranges from 0-4 (no withdrawal), 5-12 (mild withdrawal), 13-24 (moderate withdrawal), 25-36 (severe withdrawal), and 36-48 (most severe withdrawal). Each patient's COWS score at time of initiation and at 24 hours post initiation will be measured and reported.</description>

        <description>Measurement of quality of life measured by Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System (ASCQ-Me). There are a fixed set of 5 items or questions for one domain. A unique aspect of ASCQ-Me measures is their use of standardized scores that are centered on a clinical population of people with sickle cell disease. Such scores are called &quot;normative&quot; because their value represents how close or far away they are from a normative population. The meaning of the score is defined by how it compares to the scores of others in a referent population. A score of 40 is one Standard Deviation lower than the mean of the reference population. A score of 60 is one Standard Deviation higher than the mean of the reference population</description>

        <description>All patients will be in opiate withdrawal at the time of buprenorphine initiation. The level of withdrawal will be measured by the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), an 11-item scale designed to be administered by a clinician. The score ranges from 0-4 (no withdrawal), 5-12 (mild withdrawal), 13-24 (moderate withdrawal), 25-36 (severe withdrawal), and 36-48 (most severe withdrawal). Each patient's COWS score at time of initiation and at 24 hours post initiation will be measured and reported.</description>
