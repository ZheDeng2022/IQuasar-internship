      Participants will be given the opportunity to purchase ventilated, unventilated, and&#xD;
      alternative nicotine products at different prices using an account balance based on their&#xD;
      typical, daily nicotine product purchasing. Additionally, account balances will differ across&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The 2014 Surgeon General's Report on the Health Consequences of Smoking concludes that&#xD;
      changes in the physical design of cigarettes have caused an increased risk of developing lung&#xD;
      cancer. One prominent cigarette design feature is filter ventilation, which has become&#xD;
      increasingly common since the 1960s. Now, ventilated cigarettes now dominate the tobacco&#xD;
      market. Filter ventilation alters cigarette burn rate and smoking topography. Ventilated&#xD;
      cigarettes increase how much smoke is inhaled and therefore exposure to carcinogens.&#xD;
      Moreover, because ventilated cigarettes most frequently feature low nicotine yield, smokers&#xD;
      of highly ventilated cigarettes also smoke more cigarettes per day to compensate for reduced&#xD;
      nicotine; this, in turn, further increases exposure to mutagens and carcinogens in tobacco&#xD;
      smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Food and Drug Administration has the authority to ban filter ventilation. However, we&#xD;
      currently don't know what such a ban would do to consumption of unventilated cigarettes--that&#xD;
      is, whether smokers would switch to unventilated cigarettes and demonstrate similar levels of&#xD;
      consumption, or whether smokers would reduce cigarette consumption or quit entirely. We also&#xD;
      do not know if such a ban would result in the substitution of other nicotine products (e.g.,&#xD;
      electronic cigarettes, cigarillos, etc.). One way of understanding the effects of ventilation&#xD;
      bans on tobacco consumption is to investigate unventilated cigarettes as an inferior good. An&#xD;
      inferior good is an inferior substitute for a preferred product. This can be established by&#xD;
      manipulating the account balance of a cigarette smoker. A good is determined inferior if its&#xD;
      consumption decreases as the account balance for tobacco products increases. Thus, in the&#xD;
      present studies, we will examine the behavioral economic demand for unventilated cigarettes&#xD;
      in participants who normally smoke highly ventilated cigarette varieties (i.e., &quot;ultra light&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;light&quot; cigarettes). Using an account balance we provide, participants will purchase&#xD;
      ventilated and/or unventilated cigarettes in three separate sessions across a range of prices&#xD;
      (e.g., $0.12, $0.25, $0.50. $1.00, $2.00 per cigarette). For some participants, some&#xD;
      participants may also have access to alternative nicotine products such as cigarillos, gum,&#xD;
      or lozenges. Participants will be asked to make these purchases under six different account&#xD;
      balance conditions. From each session, purchases from one price will be randomly selected and&#xD;
      participants will take home all cigarettes purchased at that price. Participants will later&#xD;
      return to the lab to return any unused cigarettes and receive reimbursement for these unused&#xD;
      products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place over approximately four experimental sessions (one consent session,&#xD;
      two purchase sessions, and one follow-up session) at the VTCRI's Addiction Recovery Research&#xD;
      Center or the Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center. The initial consent session will last&#xD;
      approximately two hours; the two purchase sessions and the final follow-up session in which&#xD;
      subjects report consumption of, and/or return for reimbursement, their purchased cigarettes&#xD;
      will last approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour each. Participants may also complete a brief&#xD;
      (5-10 minutes) phone interview daily throughout participation, during which they will be&#xD;
      asked to provide the number of study and non-study products they have used the previous&#xD;
      day(s). They will be asked about their tobacco consumption at the laboratory sessions for&#xD;
      days in which the data from the phone screen was not collected. Participants will also be&#xD;
      asked to provide a breath sample for recent alcohol use at each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the consent session, participants will provide informed consent (see section 4, above,&#xD;
      for details), provide a baseline CO breath sample, and may also be asked to leave a urine&#xD;
      sample. This sample may be tested for recent drug use and pregnancy, when applicable. During&#xD;
      the consent sessions, and throughout the study, participants will also be asked to complete&#xD;
      one or more of the following: the AUDIT questionnaire, questionnaires about cigarette use,&#xD;
      craving withdrawal, delay-discounting tasks, cigarette demand, and ETM tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be given samples of the ETM cigarettes and/or alternative nicotine&#xD;
      products (if that participant is assigned to ETM conditions that have more than cigarettes).&#xD;
      Commercially available cigarettes will be used. Specifically, Marlboro Black 100's (~1.5%&#xD;
      ventilation) and Marlboro Gold 100's (~28% ventilation). For participants that typically&#xD;
      smoke menthol cigarettes, they will be given menthol versions of the Marlboro cigarettes.&#xD;
      Importantly, the cigarettes will be labeled as &quot;Cigarette A&quot; or &quot;Cigarette B.&quot; While both&#xD;
      cigarettes are labeled with the Marlboro logo, they are not explicitly labeled as ventilated&#xD;
      or unventilated. If participants are assigned to conditions where they will also purchase&#xD;
      alternative nicotine products, they may be given samples of those products as well. Popular&#xD;
      flavors of the alternative nicotine products will be made available. Participants will then&#xD;
      take these samples home to use over approximately the next three days. The end of this&#xD;
      sampling period will coincide with the first purchase session, at which time participants&#xD;
      will return any unused samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then begin reporting to the laboratory approximately once every 2 days at a&#xD;
      consistent time of day. Breath samples will be collected at each visit to measure CO.&#xD;
      Participants will be informed that during the study they will be expected to only use&#xD;
      products that we provide to them, but that the use of other products will not disqualify them&#xD;
      from the study if they are accurately reported to us. This approach is intended to discourage&#xD;
      the use of products that are not provided within the study while encouraging accurate&#xD;
      self-reporting of such use. We will use a timeline follow-back procedure, or structured&#xD;
      interview of recent product use to assess the use of other products outside of the&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each of two purchase sessions, participants will &quot;purchase&quot; two days' worth of either the&#xD;
      Marlboro Blacks or Golds in one session. Here, they will report the number of cigarettes they&#xD;
      would like to purchase across increasing prices (e.g., $0.12, $0.25, $0.50, $1.00, $2.00 per&#xD;
      cigarette). In one session, the price of both ventilated and unventilated cigarettes will&#xD;
      increase in tandem across trials. In the other session, only the price of ventilated&#xD;
      cigarettes will increase across trials. They will complete this task 6 times at each session.&#xD;
      Once with the account balance that reflects what they typically spend on tobacco products&#xD;
      (100%). The full range of account balances will be 140%, 120%, 100%, 80%, 60%, and 40%. At&#xD;
      the end of each session, one price from one of the six times they complete the task will be&#xD;
      drawn randomly and the participant will take home all cigarettes purchased at this price.&#xD;
      Participants may also complete hypothetical purchase tasks. For some participants,&#xD;
      alternative nicotine products such as cigarillos, gum, or lozenges may be available as well&#xD;
      in both the real and hypothetical purchase tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each of the purchase sessions, participants will be able to purchase as many cigarettes&#xD;
      (or alternative nicotine products) as their account balance allows, with the total price of&#xD;
      the products purchased deducted from their account balance. Participants will be informed&#xD;
      that the price of any unused products that are returned to the laboratory at their next visit&#xD;
      will be refunded to their account. Thus, the number of cigarettes used outside of the&#xD;
      laboratory will be calculated from the amount that is provided minus the amount that is&#xD;
      returned. Before and after each session, participants may be asked to complete product&#xD;
      evaluation surveys to measure changes over the course of the study. Participants will also be&#xD;
      asked to return used cigarette filters (and cigarillo butts, depending on their availability)&#xD;
      following each purchase session and the sampling period in order to qualify for the next&#xD;
      session so that we may detect tampering or alteration of our method of ventilation blocking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also complete a series of computerized and/or paper assessments (see&#xD;
      attached task files for examples) during the consent session, purchase, and/or follow-up&#xD;
      sessions. Likewise, in all sessions, participants may also be asked to leave a urine sample.&#xD;
      This sample may be tested for recent drug use and pregnancy, when applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To allow for payments that are both convenient and rapidly available, we may pay participants&#xD;
      with reloadable prepaid cards through Greenphire ClinCard (www.greenphire.com), an&#xD;
      FDIC-insured payment provider that specializes in clinical trial stipend payments that comply&#xD;
      with IRB privacy regulations and considerations. At the beginning of the study, the&#xD;
      participant will receive a prepaid MasterCard debit card that can be used anywhere that&#xD;
      accepts MasterCard. As payments are earned in the course of the study, additional funds will&#xD;
      be added to the account for that participant. Funds are immediately available when added and&#xD;
      participants can check their balance as desired. This system will allow frequent, immediately&#xD;
      available payments. Payments may also be made via check, however remote debit card payments&#xD;
      and checks will be used most often.&#xD;
