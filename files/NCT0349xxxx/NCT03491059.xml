      The investigators aim to (1) establish a methodology for the evaluation of the&#xD;
      biodistribution of radio-labeled nicotine following e-cigarette use, (2) determine the&#xD;
      oral/pulmonary distribution of nicotine following e-cigarette use, and (3) determine the&#xD;
      lowest required dose using the new digital PET/CT technology to provide detailed or accurate&#xD;
      oral/pulmonary distribution data following e-cigarette use. Potential participants will be&#xD;
      identified using advertisements such as brochures and online social media postings. After&#xD;
      participants are identified, their eligibility will be determined using survey tools. All&#xD;
      eligible participants will first have a screening visit at the WCIBMI for study&#xD;
      participation. During this initial visit, subjects will be informed about the study in&#xD;
      detail, and the relevant consent form will be reviewed and signed. If the participant agrees&#xD;
      to participate, they will go through a full dress rehearsal. Up to 10 volunteers will only&#xD;
      participate in the dress rehearsal. All other volunteers (30) will have a dress rehearsal&#xD;
      without radiation exposure on day 1, and then on a second day, they will participate in the&#xD;
      full imaging study using 11C-nicotine. During the imaging study, S-nicotine will be labeled&#xD;
      with 11C and placed in the cartridge of an e-cigarette. There will be two dose groups: (A) 3&#xD;
      mCi dosage or (B) 9 mCi doses. The investigators intend to use dose level A; however, if it&#xD;
      does not lead to the expected results, an alternate dose level as an option is needed, which&#xD;
      is the 9 mCi (B) dose level. Subjects will take a maximum of 10 puffs (1 puff per 30 seconds)&#xD;
      from the e-cigarette while positioned in the PET/CT system. Dynamic PET/CT imaging will be&#xD;
      performed for a maximum of 60 minutes following inhalation. The subject will be placed in the&#xD;
      PET camera in order to generate axial images of the following regions: head/neck (e.g.,&#xD;
      brain, oral cavity, and throat) and thorax (e.g., trachea, lungs). From the PET/CT images,&#xD;
      quantitative radioactivity deposition will be determined, and the biodistribution and&#xD;
      uptake/clearance will be evaluated. PET data will be acquired in listmode and subsequently&#xD;
      used for simulation to determine the potentially lowest dose feasible using the next&#xD;
      generation digital PET/CT technology.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      E-cigarette manufactures claim that e-cigarettes are safer than conventional cigarettes and&#xD;
      that they may aid in smoking cessation. As a result, e-cigarettes are gaining popularity and&#xD;
      use in the general public as a replacement for traditional cigarettes. However, little is&#xD;
      known about the benefits and health risks of e-cigarette use. Although e-cigarettes have been&#xD;
      shown to have negligible effect on carbon monoxide exposure and heart rate, they contain a&#xD;
      variety of glycerols mixed with variable concentrations of nicotine. In addition, other&#xD;
      substances are present in the refill solutions and/or resulting vapor, such as tobacco&#xD;
      specific nitrosoamines, cotinine, aldehydes, metals, volatile organic compounds, tobacco&#xD;
      alkaloids, and other pharmacologically active ingredients (although in concentrations much&#xD;
      lower than in combustible traditional cigarettes). In addition, studies have shown that&#xD;
      during the atomization process, there is a large range in the size of the particulate matter&#xD;
      formed that is dependent upon both the device and refill solution used. It is well know that&#xD;
      inhaled particulate matter may induce inflammation and may eventually lead to an increase in&#xD;
      a variety of health risks including cardiovascular disease and emphysema. Although&#xD;
      e-cigarettes are not currently regulated, studies have indicated that the e-liquid products&#xD;
      should be regulated to ensure consistent nicotine delivery and to prohibit the use of&#xD;
      ethylene glycol and other excipients that currently may be present at potentially harmful&#xD;
      levels (high risk category). Additionally, only minimal valid data is available related to&#xD;
      the biodistribution (deposition of nicotine and/or aerosol excipients) following inhalation.&#xD;
      The evaluation of nicotine and aerosol deposition in the body will help to determine if the&#xD;
      particulates formed during the atomization process may induce any serious health risks.&#xD;
      Additionally, this data may be compared to traditional cigarette smoking to determine if&#xD;
      e-cigarettes are truly a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes. In order to provide&#xD;
      this data, quantitative methods need to be developed that allow for accurate in vivo&#xD;
      biodistribution determination following inhalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine eligibility, participants will sequentially complete two eligibility surveys&#xD;
      that include questions related to their use of e-cigarettes, tobacco cigarettes, other&#xD;
      tobacco products, and pharmaceuticals. The brochures and social media postings will include a&#xD;
      link to Eligibility Survey 1. Survey 1 will collect sensitive, medical information, but will&#xD;
      be completely anonymous. Medical information will be collected solely for the purposes of&#xD;
      determining participant eligibility and will be unlinked from any identifying participant&#xD;
      information as well as future collected study data. Once participants are determined eligible&#xD;
      by Survey 1, they will be directed to complete Survey 2 to confirm their eligibility. Survey&#xD;
      2 will ask participants questions about their vaping habits. If they are confirmed eligible&#xD;
      from the survey, they will also be asked to provide their name and contact information&#xD;
      (e-mail). Study personnel will then contact eligible participants to schedule a time for them&#xD;
      to come to the WCIBMI for their initial visit. Responses from Survey 1 and Survey 2 will be&#xD;
      completely unlinked to maintain anonymity about participants' medical information. Once the&#xD;
      participant has been deemed eligible and indicated interest in participation, they will be&#xD;
      invited to the WCIBMI to see the facilities, and the relevant consent form will be reviewed&#xD;
      and signed. Participants will either participate solely in a dress rehearsal of the study, or&#xD;
      they will participate in both a dress rehearsal and the full imaging study. During the dress&#xD;
      rehearsal, participants will walk through the study process without the use of the&#xD;
      11C-nicotine e-cigarette and without performing any imaging. The participant will first&#xD;
      disrobe and change to hospital scrubs. The subject will also wear full-body disposable&#xD;
      personal protective equipment (PPE) including a gown, hairnet, double latex gloves, and foot&#xD;
      coverings. Then, the subject will lay on the bed of the PET/CT imaging system and practice&#xD;
      puffing in the supine position, the proper posture for PET scanning, and exhaling into the&#xD;
      gas traps. Participants who are only participating in the dress rehearsal will use their own,&#xD;
      personal e-cigarette to vape in the system. For participants who are participating in the&#xD;
      full study, the investigators will provide them with the e-cigarette that they will use in&#xD;
      the full study. Urine will be collected from female participants of the full study to confirm&#xD;
      that they are not pregnant. During the study, first, S-nicotine will be labeled with C11 and&#xD;
      placed in the cartridge of an e-cigarette. The S-nicotine may be given in two different&#xD;
      doses. The investigators will focus on the 3 mCi C11 (Dose Level A) in the e-cigarette at the&#xD;
      time of initial inhalation previously purified by HPLC. If 3 mCi does not yield adequate&#xD;
      image quality, the dosage will be increased to 9 mCi (Dose Level B) for subsequent&#xD;
      participants. To determine the appropriate dose level, the imaging scans will be reviewed&#xD;
      independently at a minimum by three experienced investigators (Michael V. Knopp, Chadwick&#xD;
      Wright, and Jun Zhang). Once the C11 labeled e-cigarette enters the facility, it may be&#xD;
      placed in the dose calibrator for secondary dose confirmation and then transported directly&#xD;
      to the imaging room. The subject will then be instructed to start inhalation (maximum 10&#xD;
      puffs at 30 second intervals) while positioned in the PET/CT system. Afterwards, the&#xD;
      e-cigarette will be removed from the imaging system by a staff member, and the remaining&#xD;
      activity of the E-liquid will be determined using a dose calibrator. PET/CT imaging will then&#xD;
      be performed for a maximum of 60 minutes following inhalation. The subject will be placed in&#xD;
      the PET camera as to generate axial slices in the following sectors: the brain, oral cavity,&#xD;
      throat, and lungs. From the PET/CT images, quantitative radioactivity deposition will be&#xD;
      determined, and the biodistribution and uptake/clearance will be evaluated. Acquired data&#xD;
      will be used for listmode based simulation to determine the potentially lowest dose feasible&#xD;
      using new digital PET/CT technology. After scanning, the subject will be removed from the&#xD;
      imaging suite and will be asked to stay in the patient waiting/recovery area for up to 120&#xD;
      minutes (2 hours). Prior to release, the subject will be surveyed to ensure that any&#xD;
      exhaled/emitted air is at background levels with respect to radiation. Additionally, all&#xD;
      subjects will be contacted within 12 to 48 hours after release from the study to ensure that&#xD;
      they are feeling well and have not experienced any adverse reaction to the study. Any adverse&#xD;
      reactions will be recorded and reported immediately to the PI.&#xD;
