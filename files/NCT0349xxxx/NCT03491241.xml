  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In obese patients the superficial adipose tissue works as an endocrine active tissue to&#xD;
      express different cytokines, and multiple molecular pathways implied in the cross talking&#xD;
      with different part of the human body, such as the cardiovascular system. To date, adipocytes&#xD;
      and adipose tissue-derived macrophages and adipose tissue synthesize, and secrete several&#xD;
      cytokines, and sirtuins. In this setting, the excess of body fat is linked to heart&#xD;
      contractile dysfunction. All these pathways are differently expressed in obese diabetic&#xD;
      patients as compared to obese non diabetic patients. Intriguingly, in diabetic obese patients&#xD;
      the hyper-expression of inflammatory cytokines is associated to a hypo-expression of&#xD;
      sirtuins. Furthermore, microRNAs (miRs) as miR 195 and miR 27 could be implied in the&#xD;
      regulation of this complex cellular and molecular axis.Therefore, this molecular pattern in&#xD;
      diabetic obese patients may correlate to altered myocardial performance, and to the&#xD;
      development of heart failure disease. In this study authors will evaluate at baseline by&#xD;
      peripheral blood samples and by the abdominal fat tissue, and than at 12 months of follow-up&#xD;
      by perupheral blood analysis, the expression of cytokines sirtuins and miR 195/27 comparing&#xD;
      pre-diabetics obese patients vs. non pre-diabetics obese patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In obese patients the visceral fat, and the superficial adipose tissue work as an endocrine&#xD;
      active tissue to express different cytokines, and multiple molecular pathways implied in the&#xD;
      cross talking with different part of the human body, such as the cardiovascular system. To&#xD;
      date, adipocytes, and adipose tissue-derived macrophages and adipose tissue, synthesize and&#xD;
      secrete several cytokines, like tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-5 and interleukin (IL)-6, and&#xD;
      anti-apoptotic proteins, such as sirtuins. Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent deacetylase involved&#xD;
      in the control of energy metabolism, adipocyte hypertrophy, and of different cardiac&#xD;
      reparative, and rimodellative functions. Furthermore Sirtuins could cross talk with&#xD;
      inflammatory/oxidative stress axis, and could be modulated by miR 195/27 expression. In this&#xD;
      setting, the excess of body fat is linked to heart contractile dysfunction. It is intuitive&#xD;
      to speculate that, all these pathways are differently expressed in obese diabetic patients as&#xD;
      compared to obese non diabetic patients. Intriguingly, in diabetic obese patients the&#xD;
      hyper-expression of inflammatory cytokines is associated to a hypo-expression of sirtuins,&#xD;
      and over expression of miR 195 and miR 27. Therefore, this molecular pattern in diabetic&#xD;
      obese patients may correlate to altered myocardial performance, and to the development of&#xD;
      heart failure disease. Authors' study hypothesis is that, this complex altered bidirectional&#xD;
      pattern between the inflammatory and apoptotic pathways axis may be due to a progressive&#xD;
      increase in adipose tissue, produced by long-term alterations in energy balance. However, all&#xD;
      these alterations may be measured in adipocytes as well as in adipose tissue derived&#xD;
      macrophages, and by peripheral blood assay. Intriguingly, no data evaluated these pathways in&#xD;
      pre-diabetics obese patients, and their possible correlation to cardiac function worsening,&#xD;
      and to the development of heart failure disease. Actually, the pre-diabetic obese subjects&#xD;
      represent a population of patients associated to higher risk to develop cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, myocardial dysfunction, and heart failure. In these patients a not clear indication&#xD;
      exists about the right dietetic and/or drug treatment to control the hyperglycemia. However,&#xD;
      there is discussion about the necessity or not to introduce hypoglycemic drug therapy added&#xD;
      to a hypocaloric diet therapy to control the hyperglycemic overload. Therefore, the aim of&#xD;
      the present study will be to evaluate at baseline the abdominal fat tissue expression of&#xD;
      cytokines, sirtuins, miR 195 and miR 27 (by direct tissue biopsy) and by peripheral blood&#xD;
      samples in pre-diabetics obese patients vs. non pre-diabetics obese patients. As second,&#xD;
      during six and twelve months of follow up by peripheral blood samples analysis authors will&#xD;
      evaluate the abdominal fat tissue expression of cytokines, miR 195 and miR 27 in&#xD;
      pre-diabetics obese patients treated by hypocaloric diet-therapy as compared to pre-diabetics&#xD;
      obese patients treated by hypocaloric diet-therapy plus metformine. At the end, authors will&#xD;
      report their correlation to myocardial performance index (MPI) as an index of myocardial&#xD;
      performance in pre-diabetics obese patients treated by hypocaloric diet-therapy as compared&#xD;
      to pre-diabetics obese patients treated by hypocaloric diet-therapy plus metformine. Authors&#xD;
      may speculate to observe a different cytokines, sirtuins, miR 195 and miR 27 expression at&#xD;
      visceral fat and peripheral blood in pre-diabetics obese patients vs. non pre-diabetics obese&#xD;
      patients. As second, authors may find that, hypoglycemic drug therapy may induce a down&#xD;
      regulation of peripheral blood cytokines, a hyper expression of sirtuins, and a down&#xD;
      regulation of miR 195 and miR 27 involved in the control of energy metabolism, and of&#xD;
      adipocyte hypertrophy, and secondary implied in a better cardiac function at follow up.&#xD;
