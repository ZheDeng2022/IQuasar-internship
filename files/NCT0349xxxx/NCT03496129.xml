  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substance-Impaired Driving among college students remains a significant public health concern&#xD;
      and may be the single riskiest substance-related outcome among young adults. Brief&#xD;
      Interventions (BIs) have been shown to reduce alcohol-impaired driving among college&#xD;
      students, but are not often implemented - despite their demonstrated efficacy - because it is&#xD;
      not economically feasible for universities to hire and train staff to deliver in-person BIs&#xD;
      to all college substance users. Very few college students seek out substance prevention or&#xD;
      treatment services available on campus or in the surrounding community. Innovative ways of&#xD;
      delivering BIs to this at-risk population in a manner that is both effective and economically&#xD;
      feasible have to be developed. The present study will be the first to examine whether a&#xD;
      text-messaging-based substance-impaired driving BI significantly decreases substance-impaired&#xD;
      driving among colleges substance users compared to an informational control. Participants&#xD;
      will be 150 college students who endorse driving after substance use (alcohol, drugs, and/or&#xD;
      combined alcohol/drugs) at least twice in the past 3 months. After completing baseline&#xD;
      measures, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either: a) substance use&#xD;
      information, b) a substance-impaired driving personalized feedback intervention, or c) a&#xD;
      substance-impaired driving personalized feedback intervention plus interactive text messages.&#xD;
      Participants will complete outcome measures 3, 6, and 12 months post-intervention. Repeated&#xD;
      measures mixed modeling analyses will be used to determine whether the intervention&#xD;
      significantly reduces substance-impaired driving over time. The project has two specific&#xD;
      aims: 1) to evaluate a text based substance-impaired driving intervention in a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial, and 2) to determine whether the use of interactive text-messages sustains&#xD;
      intervention effects over time. This study is innovative because it utilizes cutting-edge&#xD;
      technology to deliver the entire intervention, enabling the study to reach a large number of&#xD;
      students in a short time period at a low cost. The study is significant because it will&#xD;
      contribute substantially to the substance-impaired driving literature by identifying an&#xD;
      intervention that can decrease substance-impaired driving among this high-risk population.&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will add to the newly emerging technology-based intervention&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rates of substance-impaired driving remain especially high among college students, and&#xD;
      substance-related traffic accidents remain the leading cause of substance-related death among&#xD;
      young adults. Prevention and intervention efforts, such as brief Interventions (BIs) have&#xD;
      been shown to decrease substance use and related problems. BIs attempt to identify and&#xD;
      correct faulty normative beliefs and highlight consequences of substance use (such as driving&#xD;
      after substance use) and BIs typically consist of one or two individual therapeutic meetings&#xD;
      delivered in motivational interviewing style and include personalized feedback (based on a&#xD;
      series of questionnaires completed by the student prior to their BI session). The reason why&#xD;
      BIs have not been deployed - despite their demonstrated efficacy - is that it is not&#xD;
      economically feasible for universities to hire and train staff to deliver in-person BIs to&#xD;
      all college substance users, and very few college students seek out substance prevention or&#xD;
      treatment services available on campus or in the surrounding communities. Innovative ways of&#xD;
      delivering BIs to this at-risk population in a manner that is both effective and economically&#xD;
      feasible have to be developed. Text messaging represents a particularly advantageous way to&#xD;
      provide BIs as they can be highly personalized to the individual, accessed at any time that&#xD;
      suits the individual's needs, and allow for engagement and interaction between the&#xD;
      interventionist and participant. Given the high prevalence and fatal consequences of&#xD;
      substance-impaired driving, intervention approaches with the ability to reach a large number&#xD;
      of students at a low cost are imperative for reducing this extremely risky behavior.&#xD;
      Personalized feedback delivered without a one-on-one intervention may effectively reduce&#xD;
      substance use and problems, despite the fact that web-based and feedback-only interventions&#xD;
      consistently demonstrate smaller effect sizes than in-person interventions at long-term&#xD;
      follow-ups, with effects often dissipating after the first follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will enhance and extend intervention effects by including MI consistent&#xD;
      interactive text messages to provide an interpersonal and interactive element. Research&#xD;
      indicates that college students prefer text messages to telephone calls and emails and rate&#xD;
      this medium positively. However, few published studies in alcohol literature have implemented&#xD;
      text-messaging interventions and no published studies have examined the effects of a&#xD;
      text-based substance impaired driving BI among students who report recent substance-impaired&#xD;
      driving. A text-based BI focused specifically on decreasing alcohol-impaired driving&#xD;
      (AI-driving) among college students has been developed and evaluated in a pilot trial. This&#xD;
      study indicated that a brief, text-based AI-driving intervention resulted in significantly&#xD;
      greater reductions in AI-driving at the 3-month follow-up, compared to an intervention&#xD;
      providing alcohol information alone. This was the first controlled study to demonstrate that&#xD;
      a text-based AI-driving intervention could decrease AI-driving outcomes over time. However,&#xD;
      it is not clear from this study whether interactive text messages are a crucial part of the&#xD;
      intervention because this study did not compare an AI-driving feedback only condition to the&#xD;
      AI-driving feedback + interactive texts condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will extend these promising pilot results by (a) expanding inclusion&#xD;
      criteria to include drug-impaired and combination drug and alcohol-impaired drivers, (b)&#xD;
      increasing power and generalizability by recruiting 150 college students indicating recent&#xD;
      substance-impaired driving, (c) dismantling the pilot trial design by including a&#xD;
      personalized feedback only condition, and (d) including a 6-month and 1-year follow-up to&#xD;
      determine whether intervention effects persist over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal is to reduce driving after drinking, drug use, and combined drug/alcohol&#xD;
      use among college students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a 3-group trial with 150 college students (project 50% female and 20%&#xD;
      minority) recruited from a large public university.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: substance information only Group 2: substance-impaired driving personalized feedback&#xD;
      only Group 3: substance impaired driving personalized feedback and MI interactive text&#xD;
      messages&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate a text based substance-impaired driving intervention in a Randomized Clinical&#xD;
      Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Groups 2 and 3 will report greater reductions in driving after substance use at&#xD;
      3-month follow-up compared to Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine whether interactive text-messages sustain intervention effects over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Group 3 will report greater reductions in driving after substance use at&#xD;
      6-month and 12-month follow-up compared to Group 2.&#xD;
