  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pubalgia is a pain syndrome located in the groin area. This syndrome is mainly described in&#xD;
      young male athletes and typically affect the superficial muscles defining the boundaries of&#xD;
      the femoral triangle, i.e. gracilis, pectineus, adductor brevis and especially adductor&#xD;
      longus, and less commonly the deep muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, the pain is located in the inner aspect of the thigh, where the tendons attach&#xD;
      onto the pubic symphysis. It is usually unilateral, and sometimes associated with neuropathic&#xD;
      pain suggestive of obturator nerve irritation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no official recommendation or expert consensus on the management of pubalgia.&#xD;
      However, a few protocols recommend a period of rest with Non-Inflammatory Anti-Steroidien&#xD;
      Drugs (NSAIDs), icing and massages, as well as rehabilitation with passive stretching and&#xD;
      muscle reinforcement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of botulinum toxin type A could be an option in cases of treatment failure. However,&#xD;
      a feasibility study must be performed beforehand, and if results are positive, a controlled&#xD;
      study on a larger cohort could be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major potential impact is a great effective pain relief for patients with neurological&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of pubalgia in the literature varies, with large series reporting an incidence&#xD;
      close to 5-10%, representing 15 to 18% of all injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrences are also common, affecting 30 to 35% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once other differential diagnoses (such as spondylarthropathy, colorectal cancer, kidney&#xD;
      disease…) have been ruled out, athletic pubalgia is typically divided into three main&#xD;
      categories based on the site of the injury:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal wall, the most common form, representing 38 to 50% of all cases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pubic symphysis due to osteoarthropathy of the pubic bone caused by repetitive stress&#xD;
           injury, accounting for 10 to 15% of all cases of pubalgia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adductor tendons, on which this study focuses, representing 22 to 38% of all cases of&#xD;
           pubalgia, caused by repetitive tractions on the tendon insertions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no official recommendation or expert consensus on the management of pubalgia.&#xD;
      However, a few protocols recommend a period of rest with Non-Inflammatory Anti-Steroidien&#xD;
      Drugs (NSAIDs), icing and massages, as well as rehabilitation with passive stretching and&#xD;
      muscle reinforcement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromuscular reprogramming is then performed to stabilise the pelvis, followed by a&#xD;
      progressive resumption of sporting activities, guided by the pain level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, 70 to 85% of patients are able to resume their sporting activities with this&#xD;
      management protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 15 to 20% of cases of essential adductor tendinopathy, symptoms do not improve and the&#xD;
      only currently validated solution is then a tenotomy, sometimes combined with partial tendon&#xD;
      release in recurring cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies showed that the use of botulinum toxin type A (BTA) produces fairly positive&#xD;
      results in chronic tendinopathies, such as epicondylitis. However, the efficacy of BTA&#xD;
      injections in adductor tendinopathies has not been demonstrated consistently and a&#xD;
      feasibility study must be conducted to address this question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothetical benefit of BTA in adductor tendinopathies is based on the toxin's known&#xD;
      effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a purely analgesic effect, which reduces pain in the injected area within a few days.&#xD;
           This type of chronic tendinopathy does not involve inflammation. The pain in such cases&#xD;
           is most likely due to the action of neurotransmitters such as substance P and calcitonin&#xD;
           gene-related peptide (CGRP). As BTA is known to inhibit the secretion of these&#xD;
           neurotransmitters, this mechanism could explain the toxin's specific analgesic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a muscle relaxant effect due to its action on the motor endplate, which reaches its&#xD;
           maximum 6 weeks after the injection, and lasts 3 to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting muscle relaxation helps improve healing of the damaged tendon, and provides&#xD;
      sustained analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series including 39 cases showed that botulinum toxin is effective on hip adductor muscles&#xD;
      following total hip arthroplasty, providing reduced muscle contracture and improved hip&#xD;
      mobility without side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of botulinum toxin type A could be an option in cases of treatment failure. However,&#xD;
      a feasibility study must be performed beforehand, and if results are positive, a study on a&#xD;
      larger cohort could be conducted.&#xD;
