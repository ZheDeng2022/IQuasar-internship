  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive airways disease is the most common group of acute illnesses leading to hospital&#xD;
      treatment in children. This group consists of different age-related diagnoses, such as&#xD;
      bronchiolitis in infants or wheezing and asthma in older children. Though these entities&#xD;
      overlap with each other, they have common characteristics and the same leading symptom&#xD;
      breathing distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim conduct an observational cohort study to examine if the clinical course&#xD;
      of respiratory distress be quantified and the treatment improved in children with acute&#xD;
      breathing difficulty using a new non-touch non-invasive SLP measurement device?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thora3Di is a new CE- and FDA-approved medical device able to measure chest and abdominal&#xD;
      wall movements during tidal breathing with a method called structured light plethysmography&#xD;
      (SLP). The method is non-touch and non- invasive, it does not need any connection with the&#xD;
      child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-month- to 12-years-old infants and children are recruited from the paediatric wards at&#xD;
      Evelina London Children's hospital. The child lies or sits within the field of vision of the&#xD;
      SLP device with their chest and abdomen exposed. A grid pattern of normal light will be&#xD;
      projected onto the chest and changes in the format of the grid as the infant or child&#xD;
      breathes will be recorded by the SLP device. Data will be collected for each child for 3-5&#xD;
      minutes once in 24 hour periods for 2-10 times during hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to reduce duration of hospital stay by finding predicting parameters for&#xD;
      obstructive airways diseases with the new SLP method, and further aim to standardization of&#xD;
      treatment strategies, to reduce expenditure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cohort pilot study to characterise the chest wall movement during tidal breathing in children&#xD;
      admitted due to acute obstructive airways disease, using non-invasive SLP methodology&#xD;
      (Thora3DiTM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to utilise the SLP in children admitted for obstructive airways&#xD;
      disease and track progression of their condition during the hospital stay. Focus will be in&#xD;
      the SLP output, and investigators aim to 1) quantify the breathing distress and whether this&#xD;
      number has an effect on the patient outcome and 2) further aim to see if regional changes in&#xD;
      the thoracic-abdominal movement can be recognized by the measurement method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected from this study will allow investigators to characterise chest wall&#xD;
      movements in children with obstructive airways disease and to examine the effect of the&#xD;
      treatment on this movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will aim to recruit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  35-60 children between the ages of 1 month and 12 years with acute obstructive airways&#xD;
           disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admitted to hospital within 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Locations: Participants are children, in Evelina Children's hospital as a patient due to&#xD;
      obstructive airways disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible children admitted to hospital will be identified at the clinical handovers and&#xD;
      after obtaining the parental consent to participate in the study, the first measurements are&#xD;
      performed as soon as possible, however within the first 24 hours of admission. The SLP&#xD;
      measurements are repeated in 24 hour intervals 2-10 times depending on the duration of&#xD;
      hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical patient data of age, sex, ethnicity, weight and length will be collected. A member&#xD;
      of the clinical / research team (respiratory clinical fellow) collects structured data on the&#xD;
      breathing distress using a modified pulmonary index scale for children (mPIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of standard clinical variables, such as respiratory rate, heart rate and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation will be made each time the SLP readings are recorded. The measurement will be&#xD;
      taken on a bare skin with a white medical adhesive tape to cover any existing medical&#xD;
      attachments on thoracic-abdominal region (such as ECG electrodes). Alternatively,&#xD;
      measurements can be made if the child is wearing a close fitting white garment without any&#xD;
      creases (such as a babygrow).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A structured light pattern will be projected onto the chest and abdominal wall and the&#xD;
      movement of this pattern as the patient breathes will be recorded for 3-5 min. The total&#xD;
      period of testing per session should take approximately 15 minutes per person, including the&#xD;
      movement of the device and the positioning of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological and clinical data collection at each study point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dates of onset of breathing difficulty, admission and discharge Oxygen treatment and&#xD;
      breathing support (Flow in L/min for HFNC, Fi02 %O2, CPAP settings) Current medication Need&#xD;
      for NG-tube Need for IV-fluids Heart Rate SaO2 Respiratory Rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will include the traditional time indices from tidal breathing, and the&#xD;
      variability of these time indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate statistical analyses will be identified depending on the study and distribution&#xD;
      of the samples (parametric vs. non-parametric). It is suspected that t-tests (one-sample to&#xD;
      two sample), analysis of variance (ANOVA), or Mann-Whitney-U tests will be used where&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also explore novel higher levels of data interpretation including&#xD;
      Bayesian interpretation of respiratory function, and machine learning to predict disease&#xD;
      diagnosis, severity and discharge.&#xD;

    <description>To examine whether SLP can predict clinical severity, the relationship between SLP tidal breathing parameters and clinical score (mPIS is a composite score from RR, HR, Sat02, Wheezing, Accessory muscle use, Inhalation-Exhalation-ratio) will be assessed. For each of these 6 measurements or observations, a score of 0 to 3 is assigned, resulting in a possible minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 18. A cut-off score of 12 has been studied to distinguish more severe asthmatic exacerbation in children. (Carrol et al 2005) Primary outcome measure: mPIS</description>
