      To demonstrate that the early addition of Pentaglobin to the best available antimicrobial&#xD;
      therapy is able to reduce mortality and improve survival in neutropenic febrile acute&#xD;

      The study will enroll adult patients suffering from acute leukemia candidate to intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy or patients with hematological cancers candidate to allogeneic transplant with a&#xD;
      documented colonization or previous bloodstream infection sustained by Carbapenem-resistant&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: to demonstrate that the early addition of Pentaglobin to the best&#xD;
      available antimicrobial therapy is able to reduce mortality and improve survival in&#xD;
      neutropenic febrile acute leukemia or allo- Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)&#xD;
      patients colonized by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or by any Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: to evaluate the overall impact of Pentaglobin administration in the&#xD;
      study population concerning infectious complications and treatment-related mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have two co-primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate a 50% reduction in 30-day mortality for carriers developing a pre-engraftment&#xD;
      bloodstream infection sustained by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa (earlier primary endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase the Overall Survival (OS) at 4 months from the start of intensive treatment in&#xD;
      all carriers of CRE or PA compared to historical controls (later primary endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      OS in carriers not developing a bloodstream infection sustained by carbapenem-resistant&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) at 4 months from the start of&#xD;
      intensive chemotherapy or transplant Days of fever &gt; 38.3°C within 4 months from the start of&#xD;
      start of intensive chemotherapy or transplant Days of hospitalization within 4 months from&#xD;
      the start of intensive chemotherapy or transplant Days of i.v. antimicrobials within 4 months&#xD;
      from the start of intensive chemotherapy or transplant Non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 4&#xD;
      months from the start of intensive chemotherapy or transplant Patients will be treated&#xD;
      according to the standard procedures, which will be decided by each Center according to local&#xD;
      policies (e.g. chemotherapy cycles for acute leukemia, choice of conditioning regimen for&#xD;
      allo- Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and graft-versus-host- disease prophylaxis,&#xD;
      anti-microbial prophylaxis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment microbiological screening Before the initiation of intensive chemotherapy&#xD;
      (within 2 weeks) patients will be screened by rectal and pharyngeal swabbing for&#xD;
      multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, as part of routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the rectal and/or pharyngeal swabs reveal the presence of Carbapenem-resistant&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the patient will be considered eligible for the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a previous documented infection (within 3 months) caused by&#xD;
      Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa are also considered&#xD;
      eligible for the study regardless of the result of the rectal/pharyngeal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and management of febrile neutropenia in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or&#xD;
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa carriers Antimicrobial treatment active against the&#xD;
      multidrug-resistant strain should be started in case of neutropenic fever, defined as a&#xD;
      single oral temperature of ≥38.3°C or a temperature of ≥38.0°C sustained over a one-hour&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the onset of neutropenic fever and before the initiation of antimicrobial therapy at least&#xD;
      2 sets of blood cultures (2 bottles from a peripheral vein and 2 bottles from central venous&#xD;
      catheter) should be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should receive the best available first-line therapy, usually a combination therapy,&#xD;
      based on the in vitro susceptibility results of the pre-treatment screening swab in&#xD;
      combination to Pentaglobin 5ml/kg over a 12h i.v. infusion for 3 consecutive days. Empirical&#xD;
      treatment should be subsequently streamlined according to microbiological results (both&#xD;
      positive and negative) Pentaglobin should be started within 12h from the onset of fever,&#xD;
      regardless of the presence of hemodynamic stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Septic shock should be diagnosed and managed according to standard procedure The duration of&#xD;
      the antimicrobial therapy or subsequent lines of therapy will be decided by local&#xD;
      investigators according to clinical judgment. Cycles of Pentaglobin can be repeated according&#xD;
      to clinician judgment (usually at least 1 week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study two co-primary endpoints will be evaluated: the 30-day mortality rate for&#xD;
      carriers developing a pre-engraftment bloodstream infection sustained by Carbapenem-resistant&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Overall Survival at 4 months from the&#xD;
      start of intensive treatment in pre-treatment carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to address the multiplicity issue, the Bonferroni method to adjust the significance&#xD;
      level will be applied as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the early endpoint (i.e. the &quot;30-day mortality for carriers developing a pre-engraftment&#xD;
           bloodstream infection sustained by CRE or PA&quot;) will be tested at the 3.0% significance&#xD;
           level using the Simon (minimax) phase II study design;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the late endpoint (i.e. the &quot;OS at 4 months from the start of intensive treatment in&#xD;
           pre-treatment carriers&quot;) will be tested at the 2.0% significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30-day mortality rate for carriers developing a pre-engraftment bloodstream infection&#xD;
      sustained by Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test was planned to determine whether it will be possible to obtain a consistent rate of&#xD;
      reduction in 30-day mortality for carriers developing a pre-engraftment bloodstream infection&#xD;
      sustained by CRE or PA. In the proposal, to reject the null hypothesis that p&lt;=0.60&#xD;
      (mortality rate: 0.40) vs. the alternative hypothesis that p&gt;=0.80 (mortality rate: 0.20)&#xD;
      with Type I error probability (α) equal to 0.03 and 80% power (1-β), a maximum of 40&#xD;
      evaluable patients has to be accrued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage of the study, 31 evaluable patients will be enrolled and the trial will be&#xD;
      terminated if 9 or more patients died by day +30; otherwise, 9 further evaluable patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the total number of patients died will be less than or equal to 11, the combination&#xD;
      therapy will not be recommended for further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the total number of patients alive at day +30 is at least 30, the treatment will be deemed&#xD;
      worthy of further investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that approximately 33% of enrolled patients will be &quot;carriers developing a&#xD;
      pre-engraftment bloodstream infection sustained by CRE or PA&quot;, a total of 120 patients will&#xD;
      be needed to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, considering the study design, an interim analysis is planned after 31 carriers developing&#xD;
      a pre-engraftment bloodstream infection sustained by CRE or PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Survival at 4 months from the start of intensive treatment in pre-treatment&#xD;
      Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The later endpoint is the Overall Survival at 4 months. This sample size was calculated using&#xD;
      the &quot;Sample size tables for exact single-stage phase II design&quot; (A'Hern RP, Statistics in&#xD;
      Medicine 2001). Considering an expected Overall Survival at 4 months of 70% from the start of&#xD;
      intensive treatment in pre-treatment carriers, the number of patients required to evaluate an&#xD;
      increase on the Overall Survival from 50% (P0) to 70% (P1) with 90% power at the 2.0%&#xD;
      significance level (one side) is 68.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the total number of patients to be enrolled in this study is 120, including the 68&#xD;
      patients needed for the later endpoint. Calculations were made using PASS software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Data Safety Monitoring Board will make one monitoring at 31 evaluable patients (in&#xD;
      concomitant with the interim analysis) to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in to the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of enrollment will end based on the ad interim analysis results according to the&#xD;
      adaptive model of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment may then terminate after the interim analysis provided after recording 31&#xD;
      bacteremia in 31 patients with CRE or PA or when the 120th patient will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient enrolled will have a minimum follow-up period of 4 months from transplant or&#xD;
      start chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient enrolled developing bacteremia sustained by Carbapenem-resistant&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa will have a 30-day follow-up from initiation of&#xD;
      treatment with Pentaglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to complete the total enrollment (120 patients) in 2 years starting from the&#xD;
      first patient enrolled.&#xD;
