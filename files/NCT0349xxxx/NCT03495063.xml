  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study determine the difference in hemodynamic effects of synthetic and&#xD;
      natural caffeine consumption in healthy individuals through blood pressure (central and&#xD;
      peripheral) assessment. Participants will randomly be assigned to consume either one 8oz cup&#xD;
      of coffee containing 400mg of caffeine (increased caffeine using concentrated coffee) or one&#xD;
      8oz cup of coffee-flavored drink with approximately 400mg synthetic caffeine from capsules&#xD;
      dissolved in it.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to assess the difference in effects of consuming synthetic&#xD;
      versus natural caffeine on hemodynamic parameters in healthy subjects. This study will&#xD;
      determine the difference in hemodynamic effects of synthetic and natural caffeine consumption&#xD;
      in healthy individuals through blood pressure (central and peripheral) assessment. The&#xD;
      participants in this study are healthy adults who will be introduced to a risk that may be&#xD;
      more than they would encounter through their normal daily activities. This study seeks to add&#xD;
      to the literature by evaluating the difference in impact of synthetic compared to natural&#xD;
      caffeine on central blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol has the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigators hypothesize there will be a (baseline adjusted [ΔBP]) difference in BP&#xD;
           (peripheral and central) between the natural and synthetic caffeine arms in healthy&#xD;
           volunteers post consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigators hypothesize there will be (baseline adjusted [ΔCO]) no difference in CO&#xD;
           between the natural and synthetic caffeine arms in healthy volunteers post consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigators hypothesize there will be (baseline adjusted [ΔSVR]) no difference in SVR&#xD;
           between the natural and synthetic caffeine arms in healthy volunteers hours post&#xD;
           consumption.&#xD;
