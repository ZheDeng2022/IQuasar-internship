  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a frequent and serious disease, with many complications. Diabetic foot ulcers are&#xD;
      a frequent complication. Infection of diabetic foot ulcers is common, and requires heavy&#xD;
      medical and/or surgical treatments. Antibiotherapy is one of the main options for the&#xD;
      treatment of the diabetic foot ulcers, but it has many side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness and safety of medical treatments, in this&#xD;
      population of patients.&#xD;

    <description>Effectiveness :&#xD;
For soft tissue infections, remission is defined by the disappearance of any functional or physical sign of infection,&#xD;
For osteomyelitis, remission is defined as the absence of clinical and /or radiological recurrence at the initial site one year after antibiotic therapy cessation.</description>

    <description>Occurrence of side effects:&#xD;
All clinical and/or biological adverse events will be reported. The severity of any adverse events will be graded according to the criteria of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) from grade 1 (mild) to 5 (death).&#xD;
Clinical adverse events included gastrointestinal disorders, skin eruption, pain, weight gain or loss Biological adverse events included impair kidney function, increase liver serum markers, anemia, low neutrophils count, thrombopenia.</description>
