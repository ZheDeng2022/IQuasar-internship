  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Headstart (HS) is an early childhood education program for low-income children. Preliminary&#xD;
      analyses of Hamilton County HS preschoolers with developmental concerns identified 26% with&#xD;
      &quot;severe concern&quot; necessitating developmental testing, and only 47% followed-through when some&#xD;
      developmental concern was identified. Those less likely to follow-through were African&#xD;
      American or Hispanic, lived in larger families, or had asthma. Cultural and economic factors&#xD;
      are known barriers to earlier diagnosis of children with developmental disabilities (DD)&#xD;
      among African American, Hispanic and low-income children. Given that HS children are&#xD;
      low-income and culturally diverse, preschoolers are likely to face barriers to early&#xD;
      identification of DD and subsequently kindergarten readiness. Patient navigator programs are&#xD;
      effective interventions for vulnerable populations to improve health care access, increase&#xD;
      treatment adherence, enhance trust in health care systems, and reduce health care costs. A&#xD;
      family (FN) intervention that is culturally-adapted to promote caregiver follow-through, and&#xD;
      undergirded by HS's mission of kindergarten success may effectively increase caregiver&#xD;
      adherence to developmental testing. The goal of this study is to develop and pilot test a FN&#xD;
      intervention in HS that is executed by peer-to-peer navigators to improve adherence with&#xD;
      developmental testing in high-risk preschoolers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Headstart (HS) is a pipeline for early school success for low-income children aged 3-5 years,&#xD;
      and provides health promotion services such as developmental monitoring to promote school&#xD;
      readiness. In 2014-2015 Hamilton County Headstart (HCHS) identified 968 of 2987 preschoolers&#xD;
      (32%) with developmental concern, with 251 (26%) identified as &quot;severe concern&quot; necessitating&#xD;
      developmental testing. Yet, follow-through with testing did not occur for 53 high-risk&#xD;
      preschoolers (21%), and only 451 (47%) followed-through when some developmental concern was&#xD;
      identified. Those less likely to follow-through were African American or Hispanic, lived in&#xD;
      families of 3 or more, or had asthma. That race and ethnicity predict insufficient&#xD;
      follow-through is not surprising; cultural and economic factors are known barriers to earlier&#xD;
      diagnosis of children with developmental disabilities (DD), resulting in 2 year lags in&#xD;
      obtaining DD diagnoses among African American, Hispanic and low-income children and placing&#xD;
      them at risk for worse long-term prognosis. Diagnostic disparities are also grounded in the&#xD;
      social factors of poorer health care access, caregiver distrust of health systems, knowledge&#xD;
      deficits, and stigma about disability. One mechanism thought to contribute to the diagnostic&#xD;
      delays is caregiver postponement in obtaining developmental assessments due to these&#xD;
      collective factors. Given that all HS children are low-income and a majority are African&#xD;
      American or Hispanic, HS preschoolers are likely to face barriers to early identification of&#xD;
      DD and subsequently kindergarten readiness. An intervention that addresses the salient&#xD;
      barriers to developmental assessment for HS preschoolers could advance pre-academic abilities&#xD;
      and promote access to earlier recognition and treatment of DD, leading to improved health&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient navigator programs have been effective interventions for vulnerable populations to&#xD;
      improve health care access, increase treatment adherence, enhance trust in health care&#xD;
      systems, and reduce health care costs. Despite these findings, investigations into peer-based&#xD;
      navigation interventions for families of children with inferior health outcomes have mostly&#xD;
      been program evaluations or unpublished clinical trials. A promising study in Developmental&#xD;
      and Behavioral Pediatrics (DBP) on family navigators (FN) for children referred from primary&#xD;
      care for evaluation of DD is examining family quality of life outcomes prior to and after DD&#xD;
      diagnoses, and has shown preliminary success in developing and training FNs. A FN&#xD;
      intervention that is culturally-adapted to promote caregiver follow-through, and undergirded&#xD;
      by HS's mission of kindergarten readiness may effectively increase caregiver adherence to&#xD;
      developmental testing in HS. The goal of this study is to refine and pilot test a FN&#xD;
      intervention that is informed by HS caregivers, staff and primary care providers (PCP),&#xD;
      grounded in the HS community, and executed by peer-to-peer navigators to improve adherence&#xD;
      with developmental testing in high-risk preschoolers. This study is the final year of a&#xD;
      research program that will focus on tailoring the elements of a community-based (Head Start&#xD;
      (HS) Family Navigator (FN) intervention for high risk children with developmental concerns in&#xD;
      order to improve access to developmental testing. This study will be conducted over a 1 year&#xD;
      period with the specific aim outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study titled: Prototype of a Head Start Navigator Intervention for Child Developmental&#xD;
      Testing (IRB#2016-4253) was conducted to develop a community-based family navigator&#xD;
      intervention for preschoolers identified in HS as high-risk for developmental delay. Focus&#xD;
      groups were conducted with caregivers, teachers and primary care providers (PCPs) to&#xD;
      understand the barriers and facilitators to follow-through with developmental testing. The&#xD;
      prototype was tailored to the thematic focus group findings, cultural and risk factors&#xD;
      previously identified, and results of an updated analysis of predictors of poor&#xD;
      follow-through of developmental assessments from HCHS academic year 2015-2016 (IRB#&#xD;
      2016-4253). Findings confirmed that primary care and Head Start operate in silos regarding&#xD;
      developmental screening and follow-through for at-risk children. Facilitating factors to&#xD;
      caregiver follow-through were identified as: building relationships, increasing resource&#xD;
      knowledge, and addressing denial/stigma of disability. Findings substantiated that caregivers&#xD;
      needed assistance with navigating developmental testing, and valued its delivery using a&#xD;
      peer-to-peer approach that was culturally-matched. The intervention was adapted from the&#xD;
      crucial components necessary for a successful Family Navigator training program and delivery&#xD;
      of the intervention including elements of frequency, duration and intensity that were also&#xD;
      confirmed by the findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study purpose is to test a community-based family navigator intervention for preschoolers&#xD;
      identified in HS as high-risk for developmental delay. The community-based intervention will&#xD;
      train racially/ethnically matched peer caregivers in HS as FNs. FNs from HS will guide and&#xD;
      support caregivers to follow-through with child developmental testing. The investigators will&#xD;
      test if a Head Start FN program is feasible, acceptable and health-promoting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Pilot test a community-based FN intervention in HS that trains peer caregivers as FNs&#xD;
      to guide and support caregivers to follow-through with child developmental testing. The&#xD;
      investigators will test if an adapted model of a FN program that includes racially/ethnically&#xD;
      matched peers, trained to support and guide caregivers through child developmental testing,&#xD;
      is feasible, acceptable and health-promoting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key outcomes are: 1) proportion of children who complete developmental testing guided by FNs&#xD;
      (feasibility), 2) caregiver, FN, teacher and PCP satisfaction with the intervention and its&#xD;
      implementation (acceptability), and 3) caregivers' and FNs' knowledge of development and&#xD;
      disparities in early DD recognition (health promotion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The study settings will be multiple with the primary setting being Hamilton County Head&#xD;
           Start centers from CAA (Community Action Agency) and ESC (Educational Services Center).&#xD;
           HS is a federally-funded program providing preschool education and kindergarten&#xD;
           preparation. HS establishes partnerships with caregivers and communities by identifying&#xD;
           and building on family and community strengths. Both informally and formally through&#xD;
           parent groups and committees, caregivers are empowered to participate in HS curriculum&#xD;
           planning and make decisions regarding their children's education. HS encompasses urban&#xD;
           and suburban center-based programs serving income-eligible families of children 3-5&#xD;
           years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Additional study settings will be the caregiver's home, developmental testing sites such&#xD;
           as primary care provider office, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Division&#xD;
           of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics (DDBP) outpatient clinic, therapy evaluation&#xD;
           and treatment centers (i.e. speech, occupational, physical therapies), local school, and&#xD;
           community locations that are mutually determined between caregiver and FN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. FN participants will be current, former, or pending HS parents, or a parent of a child&#xD;
           with a developmental disability who has experience with HS, and sampled from urban and&#xD;
           suburban HS. Eight FNs will be trained to support and guide caregivers through&#xD;
           developmental testing, including 4 African American, 1 Caucasian and 3 bi-lingual&#xD;
           Hispanic parents. Each FN will be assigned 1 to 5 caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study sample of caregiver participants will include 32 eligible HS caregivers of&#xD;
           preschoolers between 3 and 5 years old identified with moderate or severe developmental&#xD;
           concerns on HS developmental screening, in order to include those at-risk before&#xD;
           kindergarten age. Those with moderate developmental concern will have failed 2 domains&#xD;
           on developmental screening, whereas those with severe concern have failed 3 or more&#xD;
           domains. Those who fail 1 domain (mild concern) will be excluded since often single&#xD;
           domain failures are due to limited early learning exposures and/or language barriers,&#xD;
           which can be adequately addressed in HS. Half of those selected will be sampled from the&#xD;
           moderate and half from the severe group, with 50% from urban and 50% from suburban HS&#xD;
           centers included. Given that the demographics differ slightly in racial and ethnic&#xD;
           make-up among the urban and suburban Head Starts, 12 African American, 2 Caucasian and 2&#xD;
           Hispanic caregivers will be sampled from urban HS; in suburban HS, 8 African American, 6&#xD;
           Caucasian and 2 Hispanic caregivers will be sampled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family Navigator recruitment: Eligible FN participants will be current, former, or pending HS&#xD;
      parents, or a parent of a child with a developmental disability who has experience with HS,&#xD;
      and sampled from urban and suburban HS. Recruitment will occur via purposeful sampling from&#xD;
      HS staff, parent advisory groups, and previously completed focus group participants (IRB#&#xD;
      2016-4253).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregiver recruitment: Eligible caregiver participants will be selected for the intervention&#xD;
      and control (usual care) groups using stratified block random sampling by race, level of&#xD;
      developmental concern and within each urban and suburban HS center. HS database will be&#xD;
      accessed retrospectively for the intervention and control groups. Since HS developmental&#xD;
      screening is completed within 45 days of enrollment, selection will begin once all HS&#xD;
      screening has been completed. The investigators will abstract data on severity of concern and&#xD;
      whether developmental referrals were completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention includes a training and navigation component. The training and navigation&#xD;
      components will be adapted from an existing DDBP FN program and integrated with the&#xD;
      intervention development features from the previous prototype study. The FN training&#xD;
      component will be built from the DDBP FN curriculum and include training in: 1)&#xD;
      confidentiality and HIPAA, 2) safety issues and reporting concerns, 3) disparities in&#xD;
      identification of developmental delay and importance of early developmental testing, 4) HS&#xD;
      and primary care and other developmental services, and 5) peer mentoring skills. The training&#xD;
      will be provided by the research team, including consultation with HS staff and the DDBP FN.&#xD;
      Training will include 6 hours of didactic and interactive sessions in a workshop format. The&#xD;
      navigation component will also be developed from the DDBP FN program and generally comprise&#xD;
      the FN role of guiding and supporting caregivers in navigating the educational and health&#xD;
      care interfaces. The primary interfaces between FN and caregiver participants can include,&#xD;
      but are not limited to: 1) HS identification of child at-risk for developmental concern, 2)&#xD;
      HS and PCP communication about the child's ongoing developmental concerns and the plan for&#xD;
      further testing/treatments, and 3) results sharing. Non-English speaking caregivers will be&#xD;
      provided a translator for on-site HS or developmental meetings as a standard of care. The FN&#xD;
      will build a supportive relationship with the caregiver by facilitating and guiding at each&#xD;
      of the above interfaces through in-person meetings, attending testing and results, and&#xD;
      facilitating communication at every interface. Intermittent FN contact with caregivers&#xD;
      between meetings may also take the form of phone calls, texts or emails, as determined by the&#xD;
      FN/caregiver dyad. The research team will assess the FN fidelity to the intervention with&#xD;
      focus on the FN/caregiver dyad relationship at the mid-intervention caregiver/FN encounter.&#xD;
      Family navigation will cease at the end of the academic year, with transitions facilitated to&#xD;
      social service or health care agencies for severe needs not fully addressed. The navigation&#xD;
      component will comprise about 5 two-hour meetings among the FN/caregiver dyad during the&#xD;
      academic year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The caregiver intervention group will include those caregivers' whose children fail 2 or more&#xD;
      developmental domains on HS screening and will be referred for usual care in Head Start, such&#xD;
      as follow up with primary care or school district testing . The investigators will request&#xD;
      the caregivers share the results of any follow up visits for development (ie. with primary&#xD;
      care or school district) with the Family Navigator, and subsequently the research team.&#xD;
      Results will be tracked until the end of the study. The control group will be assessed from&#xD;
      the HS database retrospectively, including access to usual care (e.g. outside referral for&#xD;
      developmental testing in school district or primary care) when identified by HS with&#xD;
      developmental concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator-developed questionnaires in English or Spanish on knowledge of health&#xD;
      disparities in DD and the importance of developmental testing will be administered to FNs and&#xD;
      caregivers pre-and-post navigator intervention. Investigator-developed questionnaires on&#xD;
      satisfaction and implementation of the intervention will be administered to FNs, caregivers,&#xD;
      teachers and PCP post-intervention. Teacher and PCP questionnaires will ascertain additional&#xD;
      factors of communication of developmental concerns between Head Start and Primary Care, and&#xD;
      the navigator interfaces with each site. Demographic information on caregiver age,&#xD;
      race/ethnicity, language, family size, employment, income, education, and marital status will&#xD;
      be collected from HS records. Demographics on child age, health screenings and conditions,&#xD;
      and HS attendance will be obtained from HS records. Completion of developmental referrals&#xD;
      will be obtained from HS database for the intervention and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key outcomes for this study are: 1) proportion of children who complete developmental testing&#xD;
      guided by FNs (feasibility), 2) caregiver, FN, teacher and PCP satisfaction with the&#xD;
      intervention and its implementation (acceptability), and 3) caregivers' and FNs' knowledge of&#xD;
      development and disparities in early DD recognition (health promotion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the proportion of children who complete referrals for developmental&#xD;
      testing in the intervention group relative to the control group, with the hypothesis that the&#xD;
      FN intervention will increase caregiver completion of referrals and time to completion is&#xD;
      less than those in the control group (feasibility). Secondary outcomes are: 1) caregiver, FN,&#xD;
      teacher and PCP satisfaction with the intervention and implementation (acceptability) and 2)&#xD;
      caregiver and FN knowledge of child developmental disparities (health promotion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of 32 caregiver participants was selected because the capacity for FNs to be&#xD;
      trained and intervene is limited to 5 families for each of the 8 navigators, as this is a new&#xD;
      intervention within the HS setting and feasible for newly-trained FNs in a pilot study. To&#xD;
      assess the primary outcome, the proportion of children who complete referrals for testing&#xD;
      will be compared between caregivers who receive the intervention and those in the control&#xD;
      group. Participants (caregivers) will be randomized to receive either the family navigator&#xD;
      intervention or control (usual care process) groups using stratified block random sampling by&#xD;
      race and within each center (CAA, ESC). To compare the difference in the time from referral&#xD;
      to testing between groups, survival analyses (e.g. Cox proportional hazards modeling) will be&#xD;
      used. Preliminary analysis of HS caregiver completion of referral (the primary outcome of our&#xD;
      proposed study) indicated that approximately 50% of caregivers across all groups completed a&#xD;
      referral. With 32 moderate and severe risk preschoolers per group (32 in intervention and 32&#xD;
      in non-intervention), using a chi-square test with 2-sided significance level set at α=0.05&#xD;
      the investigators will have &gt;90% power to detect an increase of 50% to 90% of caregivers&#xD;
      completing the referral. Secondary outcomes include the time to completion of referrals, and&#xD;
      acceptability and knowledge of the intervention as measured by investigator-developed&#xD;
      instruments. These analyses will provide effect sizes for investigator-development&#xD;
      instruments, and will enable power calculations for a subsequent R21 proposal testing random&#xD;
      allocation of a FN intervention. Costs and labor of the intervention vs. the control group&#xD;
      will be analyzed using means and ratios of labor costs, materials, transportation,&#xD;
      caregiver's time off work, retention and health services use to facilitate development of&#xD;
      procedures for wider dissemination and sustainability. The aggregate of these measures will&#xD;
      assist our evaluation of the components needed to provide a timely, coordinated approach to&#xD;
      follow-through with developmental testing for moderate and severe at-risk preschoolers in HS.&#xD;
      Generalizability will be constrained by the sample size and the local sample represented,&#xD;
      with the objective at present being to conduct a pilot intervention study. Caregiver&#xD;
      demographic characteristics will be assessed for distribution of the data using means and&#xD;
      standard deviations or medians and ranges as appropriate to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage All electronic data and data analysis results will be stored on a&#xD;
      password-protected limited-access network drive. Names will not be associated with the&#xD;
      participants or risk analyses data. Only the personnel directly involved in the study will&#xD;
      have access to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk and Benefit to Participants The study poses minimal risk and may have no direct benefit&#xD;
      to individuals participating in the study. However this study has the potential to add to our&#xD;
      understanding regarding the feasibility of peer-matched navigators guiding caregiver&#xD;
      follow-through to developmental recommendations for high-risk preschoolers. Despite having no&#xD;
      immediate and direct benefit for the study participants, participation may benefit caregivers&#xD;
      in obtaining developmental resources for their at-risk preschooler, and may benefit FN&#xD;
      participants by participation in resource training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks, Discomforts, Inconveniences, and Precautions There is minimal risk for this&#xD;
      study. Participants include caregivers of preschoolers enrolled in HS, current or former or&#xD;
      pending HS parents (the family navigator participants), HS teachers and primary care&#xD;
      providers (PCPs). Caregiver participants will be sampled to represent the cultural diversity&#xD;
      of HS parents because the investigators are seeking to understand the feasibility of a&#xD;
      culturally-matched peer navigator intervention to increase follow-through with developmental&#xD;
      testing. Caregivers whose primary language is Spanish will be included and interpreter&#xD;
      services available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For caregiver participants it is unlikely, but possible, that after consenting they may feel&#xD;
      uncomfortable with the emotional content around their child at-risk for developmental&#xD;
      concerns, and if this is the case, have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. It&#xD;
      will be reinforced in the consent that participation is voluntary, and if the process is&#xD;
      uncomfortable for the participants they may withdraw at any time. Community resources will be&#xD;
      offered if needed. Members of the research team will comply with requests to withdraw or no&#xD;
      longer participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Private space in HS will be provided for meetings between FN and caregiver participants as&#xD;
      needed. Caregiver participant demographics will be obtained from HS database and shared only&#xD;
      with the research team. Caregiver, FN, teacher and PCP data from questionnaires will be&#xD;
      shared only with the research team. Control group demographics will be obtained from HS&#xD;
      database, and shared only in aggregate form. All sources will be de-identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality Loss of confidentiality or privacy is another possible risk for the&#xD;
      participants. To reduce these risks, the FN training will include the need to protect&#xD;
      caregiver participant confidentiality (e.g HIPPA and FERPA) and caregivers will be informed&#xD;
      that the FN and Caregiver meetings constitute questions and answers in a dyad. Participant&#xD;
      names will be known only to the research team, HS site coordinators and the assigned Family&#xD;
      Navigator. Only personnel directly associated with the study will have access to the data.&#xD;
      Participant information and study results will be reported in aggregate. Risk analyses are&#xD;
      conducted from de-identified data in aggregate. No identifying information will be included&#xD;
      in scientific reports, presentations, or publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method to be used in Procuring Consent of Participants The research involves no more than&#xD;
      minimal risk to the participants and will not adversely affect the rights or welfare of the&#xD;
      participants. All Family Navigator and Caregiver participants will be fully informed and&#xD;
      consented for their participation. The caregiver consent form will also give parental&#xD;
      permission for their child (age 3-5) to participate in developmental testing at CCHMC. A&#xD;
      member of the research team will review the study information and consent with the&#xD;
      participants using lay language. The participants will be given an opportunity to ask&#xD;
      questions about the study. Participants will be informed that they have the right to stop&#xD;
      participating at any time. Participation is always voluntary. The participants will be given&#xD;
      the consent to take home to make an informed and independent decision regarding whether to&#xD;
      participate in the research. For Spanish-speaking participants, the consent will be conducted&#xD;
      with a Spanish-speaking translator available during consent. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      will translate the consent form to Spanish using the CCHMC interpreter services after IRB&#xD;
      approval. This will be certified, and submitted to the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, approximately 25% of the Family Navigator and Caregiver participants may be&#xD;
      Latino immigrants, a vulnerable population, who may be undocumented and/or illiterate. Having&#xD;
      the Latino participants sign their name to a consent form would have the potential for&#xD;
      putting the immigrant participants at risk for harm about their legal status, harm from a&#xD;
      breach of confidentiality, and they may not be able to write their name if illiterate. For&#xD;
      these participants, only first names will be recorded and/or linked to any information that&#xD;
      is discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and Safety Monitoring Plan This proposal is a pilot test of a clinical trial, and as&#xD;
      such it will be registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Although given the nature of the study&#xD;
      the investigators do not expect to have serious adverse events, the investigators are&#xD;
      prepared to address these appropriately should they occur. The PI will be available on cell&#xD;
      phone at all times. All numbers will be provided to all participants. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      brought to the immediate attention of the PI through the investigative team, Head Start staff&#xD;
      or any study participants. For recruitment of participants the PI will be available on cell&#xD;
      phone at all times. The PI will be available at all times for any questions from the family&#xD;
      navigators or caregiver participants about any aspects of the study. Satisfaction with the&#xD;
      intervention will be assessed at specified intervals with questionnaires given to&#xD;
      participants and an open-ended comment section included in the questionnaire. The PI or CRC&#xD;
      will review all data as it is collected to monitor for safety issues. The PI will be notified&#xD;
      immediately of any safety issues. Adverse events will require a timely response to ensure the&#xD;
      health and well-being of participants, and procedures will be reviewed to determine their&#xD;
      potential contribution to the adverse event. Procedural changes will ensue if they are deemed&#xD;
      to be necessary. These will be done in conjunction with the IRB and guidance from the PI's&#xD;
      research mentors of Dr. Tanya Froehlich (DDBP) or Dr. Rita Pickler (OSU). Both are&#xD;
      experienced as intervention researchers in adverse event monitoring and reporting. At&#xD;
      quarterly meetings with the research mentors, and monthly meetings with the research team,&#xD;
      the PI will review recruitment and data collection to track the meeting of study objectives.&#xD;
      Summary reports of data will be prepared by the PI for review by the research team prior to&#xD;
      each meeting. The mentorship team can request additional information to assist in safety&#xD;
      monitoring. Written minutes of these meetings with summaries of adverse events will be&#xD;
      forwarded to the IRB and NIH as part of the annual reporting process, following institutional&#xD;
      and NIH guidelines. Determinations or recommendations for early stopping of the pilot trial&#xD;
      by the research team (including the research mentors) will be for reasons of safety only.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. FN participants will be current or former HS parents and sampled from urban and&#xD;
             suburban HS.Eight FNs will be trained to support and guide caregivers through&#xD;
             developmental testing, including 4 African American, 2 Caucasian and 2 bi-lingual&#xD;
             Hispanic parents. Each FN will be assigned 1 to 4 caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The study sample of caregiver participants will include 32 eligible HS caregivers of&#xD;
             preschoolers between 3 and 4 years old identified with moderate or severe&#xD;
             developmental concerns on HS developmental screening, in order to include those&#xD;
             at-risk before kindergarten age. Those with moderate developmental concern will have&#xD;
             failed 2 domains on developmental screening, whereas those with severe concern have&#xD;
             failed 3 or more domains. Those who fail 1 domain (mild concern) will be excluded&#xD;
             since often single domain failures are due to limited early learning exposures and/or&#xD;
             language barriers, which can be adequately addressed in HS.24,25 Half of those&#xD;
             selected will be sampled from the moderate and half from the severe group, with 50%&#xD;
             from urban and 50% from suburban HS centers included. Given that the demographics&#xD;
             differ slightly in racial and ethnic make-up among the urban and suburban Head Starts,&#xD;
             12 African American, 2 Caucasian and 2 Hispanic caregivers will be sampled from urban&#xD;
             HS; in suburban HS, 8 African American, 6 Caucasian and 2 Hispanic caregivers will be&#xD;
             sampled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For FN, not being a former head start parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For caregiver, child not failing more than 2 or more domains on developmental testing.&#xD;
