  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Airborne transmission represents one of the most rapidly spreading and dangerous&#xD;
      dissemination mechanisms for pathogens. Public health strategies to prevent and control the&#xD;
      often explosive outbreaks associated with such pathogens are: 1) vaccination and treatment,&#xD;
      if available, 2) isolation and barrier precautions such as face masks, and 3) decontamination&#xD;
      of the exposed areas and surfaces. A lack of understanding how these pathogens are&#xD;
      transmitted hampers the ability to develop effective prevention measures. This study will be&#xD;
      used to collect preliminary data of the emission patterns of respiratory pathogens.&#xD;

      Airborne transmission represents one of the most rapidly spreading and dangerous&#xD;
      dissemination mechanisms for pathogens. The study team have been investigating bacterial and&#xD;
      viral transmission routes and barrier precautions. In a recent clinical study, it was&#xD;
      observed that Measles virus RNA was detected from a patient for at least up to 10 feet. In&#xD;
      addition, the group has been studying barrier precautions (facemasks) for their ability to&#xD;
      prevent the spread of aerosolized viruses. Finally, in a controlled lab setting the&#xD;
      investigators have assessed the impact of environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) on&#xD;
      pathogen transmission and the effect of UV-C light to prevent the spread of influenza. The&#xD;
      purpose of this observational study is to describe the human aerosolization patterns of&#xD;
      respiratory pathogens. The study team hypothesizes that the emission patterns of specific&#xD;
      airborne pathogens varies between individual patients.&#xD;
