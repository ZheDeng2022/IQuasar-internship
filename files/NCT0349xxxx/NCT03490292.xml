      This is a 2 part Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy&#xD;
      of avelumab in combination with chemoradiation in patients with resectable esophageal and&#xD;
      gastroesophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: This is the run-in phase of the trial. This portion will determine the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of avelumab in combination with chemoradiotherapy in 6 patients. The proposed&#xD;
      combination will be considered as safe if dose limiting toxicities are observed in at most 1&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: This is a Phase 2 portion of the trial, which will evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      proposed treatment regimen in patients with stage II/III resectable esophageal and&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiation is part of the standard of care for patients with stage II and III&#xD;
      resectable esophageal and gastroesophageal cancer. This approach is based on the results of a&#xD;
      large randomized clinical trial (CROSS) that demonstrated superior survival in patients&#xD;
      receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection compared to patients&#xD;
      treated with surgery alone. Pathological complete response at the time of resection is&#xD;
      strongly linked to better survival. However, with current strategies pathological complete&#xD;
      response is achieved only in a minority (29%) of patients. Remaining patients, especially&#xD;
      those with positive lymph nodes at the time of the resection, are at significant risk for&#xD;
      recurrences. Five-year survival rate for these patients is only 37%, and overall survival is&#xD;
      as low as 9 months for those with persistent lymph node disease. Among patients who develop&#xD;
      recurrent disease, most present with distant metastases outside of the radiation field. This&#xD;
      is not surprising since the accepted treatment paradigm for this disease does not target&#xD;
      possible disseminated microscopic systemic disease. Hence, novel strategies are needed to&#xD;
      improve outcomes of these patients. We propose conducting a phase I/II clinical trial&#xD;
      evaluating a role of immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination with chemoradiotherapy and&#xD;
      post-operatively in the management of resectable esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A number of preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated synergism between radiation&#xD;
           and immunotherapy, suggesting that combining these approaches can enhance anti-tumor&#xD;
           activity and increase treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated promising activity in a subset of&#xD;
           patients with metastatic esophageal and gastric cancers. Moving these agents into&#xD;
           neoadjuvant setting may increase the cure rate of this disease compared to the standard&#xD;
           approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Current neoadjuvant therapy does not target any potential microscopic disease outside of&#xD;
           the radiation field since chemotherapy serves primarily as a radiation sensitizer.&#xD;
           Immunotherapy treatment will target both local and systemic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that co-administration of avelumab with chemoradiation will be well tolerated&#xD;
      and will increase pathological complete response rate in resected tumor specimens. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that avelumab treatment will also decrease the rates of disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 2 part Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy&#xD;
      of avelumab in combination with chemoradiation in patients with resectable esophageal and&#xD;
      gastroesophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: This is the run-in phase of the trial. This portion will determine the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of avelumab in combination with chemoradiotherapy in 6 patients. The proposed&#xD;
      combination will be considered as safe if dose limiting toxicities are observed in at most 1&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: This is a Phase 2 portion of the trial, which will evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      proposed treatment regimen in patients with stage II/III resectable esophageal and&#xD;
      gastroesophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Evaluate the safety of avelumab in combination with chemoradiation in patients with&#xD;
      resectable esophageal cancer and gastroesophageal receiving perioperative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Obtain efficacy data and further safety data of the proposed drug combination in&#xD;
      this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives: The translational focus of the study will evaluate changes in tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment that occur in response to radiation and immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 - Primary endpoint: Establish safety and tolerability of the proposed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 - Primary Endpoint: Pathological complete response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 - Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Disease free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Incidence of surgical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rate of R0 resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centers &amp; patients: One center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: total of 6 eligible patients will be accrued to evaluate the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of the proposed combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: 18 patients will be enrolled in the phase 2 portion of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with histologically confirmed, potentially curable squamous-cell carcinoma,&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma, or large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophagus&#xD;
      who are candidates for neoadjuvant therapy and surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avelumab (Provided by EMD Serono). IND information to be added as needed.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a two-part phase 1/2 clinical trial conducted in one center.&#xD;
Part 1. Run-in phase to assess the safety and tolerability of avelumab in combination with chemoradiation. Will enroll 6 patients, after which accrual will be stopped temporarily while safety data is being obtained.&#xD;
Part 2. An open-label phase 2 study. Part 2 will obtain further safety data of the proposed drug combination and will evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of perioperative avelumab and chemoradiation in this patient population. Will enroll 18 additional patients.&#xD;
Each phase of the study will have a 21-day screening period, treatment procedures (neoadjuvant therapy, resection and adjuvant therapy), and active surveillance for a year after the completion of adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
After active surveillance visit at 12 months post treatment completion, survival data and disease status will be collected via phone calls or medical record review every 6 months during the following 3 years.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A total number of 6 subjects will be enrolled during the run-in phase of the trial. A sample size of 6 is sufficient to estimate the true dose limiting toxicity rate of the proposed avelumab/chemoradiation therapy with adequate accuracy. Specifically, the true dose limiting toxicity rate will be estimated with a standard error of 20%. The proposed treatment combination will be considered as safe if dose limiting toxicities are observed in at most 1 patient.</description>

    <description>Pathologic compete response (pCR) is defined as an absence of any viable tumor at microscopic examination of the primary tumor and any lymph nodes sampled after surgery following neoadjuvant therapy. Participants with invalid/missing pCR assessments will be defined as non-responders. The number and frequency of patients with a pCR will be summarized in tabular format. The pCR rate will be reported along with the corresponding 90% confidence interval which will be constructed using the Wilson score method.</description>

All patients who receive at least one dose of avelumab will be evaluated for toxicity. Toxicities observed will be summarized in terms of types and severities by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.0. The number and severity of toxicity incidents will be analyzed descriptively in tabular format. The 90% confidence interval for the dose limiting toxicity rate (DLT) will be constructed using the Wilson score method.</description>
