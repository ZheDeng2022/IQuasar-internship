      Our research hypothesis is that the practice of walking on a secure treadmill is possible at&#xD;
      home and allows the patient to increase the work of training of walking in everyday life&#xD;
      compared to a conventional care. In addition, we believe that this practice should be&#xD;
      supervised by a caregiver trained by the physiotherapist / APA investigator, in order to&#xD;
      increase the use of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The people concerned by this protocol are those who have a partial disability of walking&#xD;
      whatever the pathology and the underlying deficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: To evaluate the feasibility of using EzyGain at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Evaluation Criteria: Number of sessions performed on the device during the duration of&#xD;
      the study, compared to the number of scheduled sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective 1: make a partial transfer of the supervision of the physiotherapist /&#xD;
      APA investigator's sessions to the caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 2: To evaluate whether the exercise period on the device increases the&#xD;
      amount of spontaneous physical activity of the patient after the end of the period compared&#xD;
      to the average spontaneous physical activity prior to the exercise period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population concerned:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population over 60 years of age with partial walking disability regardless of etiology and&#xD;
      pathology leading to walking disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population coming into consultation in the services of Dr. Teixeira and Pr. Yelnik of GH&#xD;
      Saint Louis Lariboisière Fernand Widal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial incapacity of walking. Availability at home during their participation period (weeks&#xD;
      of walking exercise + weeks of evaluation of physical activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethnicity indifferent Indifferent sex Patient with a close volunteer caregiver to participate&#xD;
      in the study and receive training from the investigator / APA investigator and then manage&#xD;
      sessions autonomously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anyone who would like to train more regularly on the walk and at home because unable to go&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who uses or does not use technical assistance to walk or move Patient who falls or is at risk&#xD;
      of falling and, as a result, limits his progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possibility of installation of the device in the patient's home. Patient affiliated to a&#xD;
      social security scheme&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical sequence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection and medical inclusion of the patient by one of the investigating physicians and&#xD;
      delivery of consent. During this visit, the doctor judges the eligibility criteria, explains&#xD;
      the research to the patient, gives him the informed consent that is signed on the spot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the eligibility criteria, there must be a caregiver close to the patient, who is&#xD;
      willing to participate in the research. If he is present during this visit, he signs his&#xD;
      consent to participate in the research. If he is absent during this visit, the patient gives&#xD;
      his coordinates, the doctor calls him to explain the research, and sends his consent by mail,&#xD;
      which the caregiver returns signed by mail to the doctor. It only remains to verify that the&#xD;
      apartment can accommodate the device EzyGain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the accessibility of the home by the EzyGain team. If the apartment can&#xD;
      accommodate the device, then the patient is included in the search. If the apartment can not&#xD;
      accommodate the device, then the patient is not included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit takes place on site with the investigator / APA investigator and an&#xD;
      investigator. Laying the Actigraph ©.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the spontaneous physical activity of the patient by actimetry for seven days +&#xD;
      QAPPA (questionnaire of physical activity for old person).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning of the training phase on the device. The dosage of the activity (frequency of&#xD;
      sessions and practical content) and the possibility of supervising additional sessions by a&#xD;
      family caregiver is determined by the investigating physiotherapist / APA investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient performs a minimum of 3 sessions per week with the investigator / APA&#xD;
      investigator, for 4 weeks, each walk for a few minutes (&lt;60 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the spontaneous physical activity of the patient by actimetry for seven days&#xD;
      QAPPA (questionnaire of physical activity for elderly person) a week and a month after the&#xD;
      training phase of four weeks&#xD;
