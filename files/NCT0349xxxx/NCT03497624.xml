    <textblock>
      Patient Derived Xenografts (PDXs) are models to study tumor growth, response to anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapies, and resistance to anti-cancer therapies. The purpose of this study is to develop&#xD;
      up to 24 PDX models for ROS1-fusion driven cancers to be used for research purposes only.&#xD;
      That is, these patient derived PDX models will have no immediate benefit to the patient from&#xD;
      whom the tumor specimen was obtained. Rather, these PDX models will be used to inform the&#xD;
      study of ROS1-fusion driven cancers at large.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ROS1-fusions occur in several cancer types such as non-small cell lung cancer, gastric&#xD;
      cancer, ovarian cancer, glioblastoma, cholangiocarcinoma and melanoma. In each of these&#xD;
      cancers, ROS1-fusions account for a small sliver of the pie, accounting for 1-2% of all&#xD;
      diagnoses, forming a relatively rare molecular subset of cancer. The Addario Lung Cancer&#xD;
      Medical Institute (ALCMI) would like to focus on this under-studied rare molecular subset of&#xD;
      cancer to understand how cancer begins and spreads in these tumors, how these tumors respond&#xD;
      to treatment and what happens when tumors stop responding to treatment. Therefore, in&#xD;
      collaboration with cancer patients whose tumors have ROS1-fusions (known as the &quot;ROS1ders&quot;),&#xD;
      we are studying ROS1-fusions across all cancer types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Derived Xenografts (PDXs) are models to study cancer. These models are developed by&#xD;
      injecting a fresh piece of tumor specimen from a patient into a special type of mouse, which&#xD;
      then acts as 'host' to allow the tumor to grow. Peer-reviewed and published experimental&#xD;
      studies have shown that PDX models can maintain features similar to the original tumor from&#xD;
      the patient. PDX models can be used to study tumor growth, response to anti-cancer therapies,&#xD;
      and resistance to anti-cancer therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to develop up to 24 PDX models for ROS1-fusion driven cancers to&#xD;
      be used for research purposes only. That is, these patient derived PDX models will have no&#xD;
      immediate benefit to the patient from whom the tumor specimen was obtained. Rather, these PDX&#xD;
      models will be used to inform the study of ROS1-fusion driven cancers at large.&#xD;
