    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder is the number one cause of disability worldwide. Evidence regarding&#xD;
      the effectiveness of various treatments for patients with severe depression is still lacking.&#xD;
      Although many patients achieve treatment response, only a minority of patients achieve full&#xD;
      remission and even fewer sustain it. In fact, within one month 10% will be re-hospitalized&#xD;
      and the rate climbs to 30% within a year. Further, remission from depressive symptoms is a&#xD;
      surprisingly poor predictor of recovery of community functioning following discharge. It is&#xD;
      clear that the traditional focus on diagnostic symptoms is insufficient for promoting a full&#xD;
      return to everyday functioning. The present aim is to examine the efficacy and effectiveness&#xD;
      of treating neurocognition, a symptom that explains persistent deficits in community&#xD;
      functioning for those with depression. The study design that maps on to the contemporary&#xD;
      clinical setting, in order to reflect the changing landscape of inpatient and community&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment in depression has emerged as one of the most robust predictors of&#xD;
      sustained impairment in everyday functioning. Significant deficits in attention, memory and&#xD;
      executive function are widespread and remain even after effective treatment of primary mood&#xD;
      symptoms. Relevant to the investigators aims, severity of cognitive impairments has been&#xD;
      linked to more severe episodes and higher rates of relapse. Cognitive Remediation (CR) is a&#xD;
      psychological treatment developed and tested in research settings, where techniques that&#xD;
      train the brain to process information more efficiently result in improvements in cognition&#xD;
      and in community functioning. Contemporary CR relies on three pillars of treatment: Drill and&#xD;
      Practice, Strategic Monitoring, and Bridging of Cognitive Skills to Everyday Life. CR&#xD;
      treatment produces robust effects in depression, with some evidence for transfer to reduced&#xD;
      depressive symptoms. However, each of the three pillars is typically done within a group&#xD;
      therapy context, with two or more meetings per week, presenting a challenge to both modern&#xD;
      health care models and the symptoms of depression that would be barriers to attendance (low&#xD;
      motivation, social anxiety, lack of energy). The investigators have recently developed a&#xD;
      Remote Cognitive Remediation program that overcomes these obstacles with novel components of&#xD;
      CR to allow for delivery of treatment remotely. These techniques include the use of online&#xD;
      exercises for an increased dose, and the delivery of recorded visual examples of bridging&#xD;
      strategies. Efficacy (cognitive improvement) and effectiveness (improved community&#xD;
      functioning, reduced time to relapse) will be compared to a placebo control group in this&#xD;
      12-week randomized controlled trial with 6-month follow-up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has the potential to address a significant gap in the treatment of depression&#xD;
      and to modify an established treatment to fit into the changing demands of the health care&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine whether cognitive remediation, delivered at home over the Internet, is&#xD;
      efficacious in improving cognition in symptomatic individuals with recurrent MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine the effectiveness of remote cognitive remediation for improving community&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To examine the baseline and dynamic predictors and mediators of change in functioning&#xD;
      for patients with MDD who receive cognitive remediation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: To examine whether cognitive remediation affects rates of response,&#xD;
      remission, and relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Remote cognitive remediation will improve neurocognitive functioning at&#xD;
      post-treatment and these improvements will persist for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a: Remote cognitive remediation will improve functional capacity at&#xD;
      post-treatment and these improvements will persist for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2b: Remote cognitive remediation will improve functioning in the community 24&#xD;
      weeks post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Improvements in cognitive functioning will predict improvements in functional&#xD;
      capacity and functional behaviours post-treatment and 24 weeks later, controlling for&#xD;
      depressive symptoms at baseline and change in depressive symptoms. Social cognitive&#xD;
      functioning and social anxiety will mediate the degree to which cognitive and functional&#xD;
      capacity relate to real world behavior change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.Remote cognitive remediation will increase response and remission rates, and reduce rates&#xD;
      of relapse over a 24 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.12 weeks of CR will demonstrate equivalency in treatment effects to 24 weeks of CR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of three groups. Two groups will receive active&#xD;
      cognitive remediation, with one terminating sessions after 12 weeks (the standard length of&#xD;
      time in the literature) and one continuing for a total of 24 weeks of treatment. The third&#xD;
      group will receive a comparison training group where they will login to the same training&#xD;
      environment but the difficulty level of the working memory load will not progress over time&#xD;
      but the tasks will be longer (referred to in the consent as 'focusing your attention for&#xD;
      longer periods of time). In previous work, the investigators have found participants to be&#xD;
      equally compliant with these groups and for specific changes in memory or attention depending&#xD;
      on the group to which they are assigned. Participants will be tested at baseline, 12 weeks&#xD;
      (post-intervention, intermediate intervention, or sham, respectively), and at 6 months&#xD;
      post-intervention. This design will allow the investigators to test a 2:1 ratio of&#xD;
      participants in active memory training versus comparison on the baseline to 12 week&#xD;
      assessments and a 1:1:1 comparison for the short-term treatment, long-term treatment, and&#xD;
      comparison condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized testing will be performed at baseline and/or screening, during clinic visits,&#xD;
      and immediately following 12 weeks of intervention. The investigators will also perform a&#xD;
      durability assessment at endpoint (end of study participation or at time of dropout) and at 6&#xD;
      months post-treatment to examine the persistence and transfer of effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurocognition will be assessed with the CNS Vitals system (CNSVS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Cognition will be examined as a potential mediator of changes in cognition and&#xD;
      functional capacity to functional behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the Bell-Lysaker Emotion Recognition Test, which they have&#xD;
      previously found to be sensitive to impairment and cognitive treatment in depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional capacity will be assessed with the Virtual Reality Functional Capacity Assessment,&#xD;
      which is a computerized performance based assessment of independent living skills such as&#xD;
      planning and shopping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4-item Perceived Competence Scale will assess self-ratings of ability on the measures&#xD;
      prior to and after testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Behaviour will be assessed with the the World Health Organization Quality of Life&#xD;
      Assessment (WHOQoL-BREF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) will be used to assess subjective quality of life. The Lam&#xD;
      Employment Absence and Productivity Scale (LEAPS) will be used to measure occupational&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of depression will be assessed with Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale MADRS,&#xD;
      a gold standard interview-based assessment of 10 items common to MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other measures that are used include: The Self-Report of Cognitive Lifestyle, The Need for&#xD;
      Cognition Scale, The Cognitive Approach Scale, and The Cognitive Failures Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include the foundational Pillars of CR, but modified for this study in a&#xD;
      structure that fits contemporary health care systems and with the intention of extending&#xD;
      cognitive effects to improved community functioning. The novel components of CR in this study&#xD;
      will be the delivery of treatment remotely, the use of online exercises for an increased&#xD;
      dose, and the delivery of recorded visual examples of strategic monitoring and bridging&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pillar I: Cognitive Activation. In the treatment, the use of online exercises allow for a&#xD;
      steadier dose of treatment compared to week to week in-person meetings, essential for&#xD;
      motivation and learning. There are 30 unique cognitive exercises in the program (sbtpro.com).&#xD;
      The investigators will prescribe 24 exercises in the domains most commonly impaired in MDD:&#xD;
      six targeting executive functions, ten targeting memory, and eight targeting attention and&#xD;
      working memory. The specific activities are prescribed in a fixed, systematic order, such&#xD;
      that the participants have a schedule of exercises that address several different cognitive&#xD;
      domains each week and return to exercises in subsequent weeks. Parameters are automatically&#xD;
      adjusted based on participant performance across 30 difficulty levels. Participants are&#xD;
      prescribed two 20-minute sessions per day, five days per week, for the duration of the study.&#xD;
      Participants who do not complete tasks for three consecutive days will receive reminder calls&#xD;
      from a therapist to address technical or motivational issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pillar II: Strategy Monitoring, Development, and Pruning. Therapists communicate with&#xD;
      participants in asynchronous private and group forums, where specific responses to questions&#xD;
      prime flexible strategy formation, monitoring of strategies, and bridging to real world&#xD;
      functioning. Participants use logs to track their own strategies and upload this information&#xD;
      to the forum for therapist feedback. The purpose of the therapist responses is to reinforce&#xD;
      the development of multiple strategies and help supplement or reshape those that are&#xD;
      concrete, based on a predetermined list of strategies developed for each of the computer&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pillar III: Bridging. The online forum will have illustrations for bridging cognitive&#xD;
      abilities and problem solving strategies related to each game to experiences in the real&#xD;
      world. An at home workbook will also be used to facilitate active application of skills in&#xD;
      various domains (e.g., work, socialization, recreation, household maintenance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison Control Group: Comparison cognitive remediation treatment procedures include the&#xD;
      same stimuli that are presented in the active treatment condition, but the parameter&#xD;
      adjustments change without increasing cognitive demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who consent will be assigned to the CR or Comparison treatment conditions on a 2:1&#xD;
      basis, based on a computerized random number generator. Allocation to active treatment at 2:1&#xD;
      has advantages related to within group analysis to predict outcomes, trial costs, expected&#xD;
      dropouts, and patient acceptability, and does not reduce power. Participants will meet with a&#xD;
      study therapist for an orientation to the computer tasks and goal setting in a one-hour&#xD;
      training session. Those who experience difficulty understanding or utilizing the program will&#xD;
      receive additional training, though this contact will continue to be only computer skill&#xD;
      training rather than therapeutic. The study coordinator and assistant will remain available&#xD;
      throughout the study for asynchronous responses to email and live telephone support related&#xD;
      to usage issues. The goal setting session follows the investigator's standard protocol, which&#xD;
      is a collaborative discussion to identify real world functional goals, discuss how the&#xD;
      patient's individual cognitive profile links with those goals, and demonstrate how the&#xD;
      treatment techniques are related to their profile and everyday functional goals. Ph.D.-level&#xD;
      psychology students or psychologists from the PI's laboratory will be available on an&#xD;
      asynchronous nature to respond to online Strategic Monitoring and Bridging forum questions&#xD;
      and to moderate comments.&#xD;
