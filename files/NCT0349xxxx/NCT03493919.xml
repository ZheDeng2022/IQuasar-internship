  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect large volumes of matched pairs of pre- and&#xD;
      post-vaccination sera from healthy subjects who will be administered GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)&#xD;
      Biologicals' vaccine against meningitis- MenACWY vaccine (Menveo) or rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine&#xD;
      (Bexsero), which will serve for the development, qualification, validation and maintenance of&#xD;
      immunological assays and will support the preclinical research activities and clinical&#xD;
      development of GSK Biologicals' vaccines. The safety of the subjects given one of the 2&#xD;
      vaccines (Bexsero or Menveo), as per the recommended dosage and schedule will be assessed&#xD;
      during their participation in the study.&#xD;
