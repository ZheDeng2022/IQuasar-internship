    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label study of AGEN1884 in combination with AGEN2034 in subjects&#xD;
      with locally advanced, recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumors including cervical cancer.&#xD;
      AGEN2034 is a novel, fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody, designed to&#xD;
      block program cell death-1 (PD-1). AGEN1884 is a novel, fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin&#xD;
      G1 (IgG1) antibody, designed to block cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial consists of 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1: Dose escalation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2: Expansion in advanced cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Dose Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment to the Phase 1 portion of the study is completed. The trial will consist of a&#xD;
      3+3 dose escalation that will evaluate different combination dose levels (CDL) of AGEN1884&#xD;
      and AGEN2034 in subjects with locally advanced, recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be enrolled to the following CDL cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CDL1 - AGEN1884 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks + AGEN2034 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (starting CDL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CDL2 - AGEN1884 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks + AGEN2034 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (maximum planned&#xD;
           CDL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CDL-1 - AGEN1884 0.3 mg/kg every 6 weeks + AGEN2034 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (potential&#xD;
           de-escalation CDL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination Dose Level 1 (CDL1) will be the first to be tested. Dose escalation will continue&#xD;
      until the maximum planned CDL (CDL2) is shown to be safe or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      is reached. The MTD is defined as the CDL below which ≥ 33% of subjects develop dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLT). The decision to escalate to the next cohort will be made by a Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee (SMC), based on safety assessments after all subjects of a cohort&#xD;
      reached the end of the DLT observation period of 21 days. Should ≥2 DLTs be observed in CDL1,&#xD;
      the SMC may open enrollment to CDL-1. The SMC will also select the CDL for Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive the combination treatment for a maximum of 24 months or until&#xD;
      confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for withdrawal from&#xD;
      the trial or the investigational medicinal products (IMPs) occur. Subjects who do not&#xD;
      complete the DLT observation period of 21 days after the first dose, for reasons other than a&#xD;
      DLT will be replaced. Additional subjects will be backfilled, concurrently with the 3+3 dose&#xD;
      escalation schema at the lower cleared CDL, to ensure that each cohort enrolls at least 10&#xD;
      subjects. These additional subjects at each dose level will have the purpose of generating&#xD;
      additional safety, PK, and receptor occupancy (RO) data, and will not undergo formal DLT&#xD;
      observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SMC selected CDL2 (AGEN1884 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks + AGEN2034 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) as&#xD;
      the Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Expansion in Select Tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further characterize safety and efficacy, the following expansion cohort will be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced cervical cancer In Phase 2, the RP2D of AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 will be administered&#xD;
      for a maximum of 2 years or until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any&#xD;
      criterion for stopping the study drugs or withdrawal from the trial occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Phase 2 portion of the trial, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be&#xD;
      established to evaluate safety and efficacy and an IERC will be established to adjudicate&#xD;
      tumor response.&#xD;

&#xD;
        To be eligible for participation in this trial the subject must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Voluntarily agree to participate by giving written informed consent. (Participation in&#xD;
             pharmacogenomics testing is optional.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be ≥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Phase 1: Male or female having a histologically or cytologically confirmed&#xD;
                  diagnosis of a locally advanced, recurrent, and/or metastatic solid tumor for&#xD;
                  which no standard therapy is available or standard therapy has failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
             I. Female having (1) a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous&#xD;
             cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the cervix, and (2)&#xD;
             locally advanced, recurrent, and/or metastatic disease at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
             Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required via pathology&#xD;
             report.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: The following cervical tumors are not eligible: minimal deviation/adenoma&#xD;
             malignum, gastric type adenocarcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and mesonephric&#xD;
             carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             II. Has cervical cancer and has relapsed after a platinum-based treatment (first line)&#xD;
             regimen for locally advanced, recurrent, and/or metastatic disease; Note: Subjects who&#xD;
             only received platinum-based chemotherapy concurrently with primary radiation (e.g.,&#xD;
             weekly cisplatin) or adjuvant chemotherapy following completion of radiation therapy&#xD;
             (e.g., paclitaxel and carboplatin for ≤ 4 cycles) and progressed within 6 months after&#xD;
             treatment completion will be eligible as this systemic therapy will be considered&#xD;
             first line.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Measurable Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Phase 1: Have objective evidence of disease; the presence of measurable disease&#xD;
                  is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Phase 2: Have measurable disease on imaging based on RECIST version 1.1. Note:&#xD;
                  Subjects must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response, as&#xD;
                  defined by RECIST version 1.1. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will&#xD;
                  be designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented, or a&#xD;
                  biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion&#xD;
                  of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 must be confirmed by independent central&#xD;
             radiologic review prior to first dose. Subjects without centrally confirmed measurable&#xD;
             disease at baseline will not be eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have a life expectancy of at least 3 months and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
             (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory values:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Adequate hematological function defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5&#xD;
                  x 109/L, platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L, and hemoglobin&#xD;
&#xD;
                  ≥ 8 g/dL (without transfusions within 1 week of first dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Adequate hepatic function based on a total bilirubin level &lt; 1.5 x the&#xD;
                  institutional upper limit of normal (IULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)&#xD;
                  level ≤ 2.5 x IULN, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level ≤ 2.5 x IULN, and&#xD;
                  alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 IULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Adequate renal function defined as creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN OR calculated&#xD;
                  creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min for subjects with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 x IULN&#xD;
                  (if no local guideline is available, creatinine clearance should be calculated&#xD;
                  using the Cockcroft-Gault Method).&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Adequate coagulation defined by international normalized ratio (INR) or&#xD;
                  prothrombin time ≤ 1.5 x IULN (unless the subject is receiving anticoagulant&#xD;
                  therapy); and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x IULN (unless&#xD;
                  the subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Other than the cancer for which the subject is enrolled, have no history of prior&#xD;
             malignancy, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial&#xD;
             bladder cancer, squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin, or has undergone potentially&#xD;
             curative therapy with no evidence of that disease recurrence for 5 years since&#xD;
             initiation of that therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: In Phase 2, the history and time requirement for no evidence of disease for 5&#xD;
             years does not apply to the cancer for which the subject is enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. In Phase 2, subjects must provide a sufficient and adequate formalin fixed paraffin&#xD;
             embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue sample preferably from the most recent biopsy of a tumor&#xD;
             lesion, collected either at the time of or after the diagnosis of locally advanced,&#xD;
             recurrent, and/or metastatic disease has been made AND from a site not previously&#xD;
             irradiated. If no tumor tissue is available, a fresh biopsy will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Tissue from needle or excisional biopsy or from resection is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening (within 72&#xD;
             hours of first dose of study drug) if of childbearing potential or be of non-&#xD;
             childbearing potential. Non-childbearing potential is defined as (by other than&#xD;
             medical reasons):&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Amenorrheic for ≥ 2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and a&#xD;
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) value in the postmenopausal range upon&#xD;
                  pretrial (screening) evaluation,&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Whose status is post hysterectomy, oophorectomy, or tubal ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. If of childbearing potential, female subjects must be willing to use 2 highly&#xD;
             effective contraceptive measures (defined in the informed consent form [ICF])&#xD;
             throughout the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception&#xD;
             for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Male subjects with a female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to use 2&#xD;
             highly effective contraceptive measures (defined in the ICF) throughout the trial&#xD;
             starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of study drug&#xD;
             is received. Males with pregnant partners must agree to use a condom; no additional&#xD;
             method of contraception is required for the pregnant partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception&#xD;
             for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  within 6 months of completing chemotherapy concurrent with primary radiation or&#xD;
                  adjuvant chemotherapy after radiation will only be considered as having 1 prior&#xD;
                  systemic regimen for the purpose of this criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: In Phase 1, prior treatment with a CTLA-4 antibody is permissible for subjects&#xD;
             with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has persisting toxicity related to prior therapy of National Cancer Institute Common&#xD;
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (NCI-CTCAE) Grade &gt;1 severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Sensory neuropathy or alopecia of Grade ≤2 is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is expected to require any other form of systemic or localized antineoplastic therapy&#xD;
             while on trial (including maintenance therapy with another agent, radiation therapy,&#xD;
             and/or surgical resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has known severe hypersensitivity reactions to fully human monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
             (NCI-CTCAE Version 4.03 Grade ≥3), any history of anaphylaxis, or uncontrolled asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Is receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy ≤ 7 days prior to first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment or receiving any other form of systemic immunosuppressive medication&#xD;
             (corticosteroid use on study for management of immune-related adverse events (AE),&#xD;
             and/or a premedication for intravenous (IV) contrast allergies/reactions is allowed).&#xD;
             Subjects who are receiving daily corticosteroid replacement therapy are an exception&#xD;
             to this rule. Examples of permitted therapy are daily prednisone at doses of 5 to 7.5&#xD;
             mg or equivalent hydrocortisone dose, and steroid therapy administered by topical,&#xD;
             intraocular, intranasal, and/or inhalation routes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has a central nervous system (CNS) tumor, metastasis(es), and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis identified either on the baseline brain imaging obtained during the&#xD;
             screening period OR identified prior to consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Subjects with history of brain metastases that have been treated may participate&#xD;
             provided they show evidence of stable supra-tentorial lesions at screening (based on 2&#xD;
             sets of brain images performed ≥ 4 weeks apart, and obtained after the brain&#xD;
             metastases treatment). In addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either as a&#xD;
             result of the brain metastases or their treatment must have resolved or be minimal and&#xD;
             be expected as sequelae from treated lesions. For individuals who received steroids as&#xD;
             part of brain metastases treatment, steroids must be discontinued ≥ 7 days prior to&#xD;
             first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has active or history of autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment&#xD;
             within 2 years of the start of study treatment (i.e. with use of disease modifying&#xD;
             agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (i.e.,&#xD;
             thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or&#xD;
             pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of immunosuppressive systemic&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Subjects with diabetes type 1, vitiligo, psoriasis, hypo-, or hyperthyroid&#xD;
             disease not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has had an allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has or had interstitial lung disease (ILD) OR has had a history of pneumonitis that&#xD;
             has required oral or IV corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has an active infection requiring IV systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has known active Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or tuberculosis. Active Hepatitis B is&#xD;
             defined as a known positive HBsAg result. Active Hepatitis C is defined by a known&#xD;
             positive Hep C Ab result and known quantitative HCV RNA results greater than the lower&#xD;
             limits of detection of the assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular&#xD;
             accident/stroke or myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment, unstable&#xD;
             angina, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class ≥II), or serious&#xD;
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Is, at the time of signing informed consent, a regular user (including &quot;recreational&#xD;
             use&quot;) of any illicit drugs or had a recent history (within the last year) of substance&#xD;
             abuse (including alcohol).&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Is legally incapacitated or has limited legal capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of AGEN2034 and/or AGEN1884.&#xD;
