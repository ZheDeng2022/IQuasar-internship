    <textblock>
      This study plans to investigate whether using electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or skin&#xD;
      patches containing nicotine affects switching from smoking conventional combustible (burning)&#xD;
      cigarettes.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to assess the relative role of nicotine dose and route of delivery in&#xD;
      affecting successful switching from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes, as well as&#xD;
      concomitant reductions in ad libitum cigarette smoking and exposure to harmful and&#xD;
      potentially harmful constituents of combustion. The strategy will be to assess adoption of&#xD;
      e-cigarette use and concomitant reduction in ad libitum smoking of subjects' usual brands of&#xD;
      cigarettes over an 8-week period, during which they will receive nicotine or non-nicotine&#xD;
      e-cigarettes, and nicotine skin patches. The nicotine patches will not be used as a&#xD;
      therapeutic treatment in this study, but rather as a way to manipulate the nicotine dose,&#xD;
      while varying the rate and route of nicotine delivery. Behavioral or &quot;habit&quot; aspects of&#xD;
      e-cigarette use will be controlled for by the groups receiving non-nicotine e-cigarettes.&#xD;
      Initially the study design included placebo patch control conditions, but due to limitations&#xD;
      in budget and period of support, enrollment in these these arms was discontinued. All&#xD;
      participants currently receive active nicotine patches.&#xD;
