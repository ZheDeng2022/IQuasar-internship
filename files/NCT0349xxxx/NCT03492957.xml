      The aim of this study is to design a physical activity programme for non-ambulatory stroke&#xD;
      survivors (delivered via either community-based groups or a home-based individual programme)&#xD;
      and evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, preliminary and adverse effects. The study will&#xD;
      also explore the views of non-ambulatory stroke survivors and their carers on: needs,&#xD;
      personal goals, barriers, and motivators, experiences of programme participated in and&#xD;
      preferred format (i.e. home-based individual/ community-based groups).&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity interventions after stroke are needed because stroke survivors are&#xD;
      under-active; their average physical fitness level is about 50% of sedentary healthy&#xD;
      controls. This adversely affects vascular risk factor profiles, disability and participation,&#xD;
      problems that are all likely to be exacerbated in stroke survivors who are unable to walk.&#xD;
      Fitness can be improved after stroke through cardiorespiratory training. This also improves&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning and adaptation to life after stroke. Community-based services for&#xD;
      exercise after stroke are developing throughout the UK. However, current evidence, associated&#xD;
      guidelines and exercise professional training mainly pertain to ambulatory stroke survivors;&#xD;
      non-ambulatory stroke survivors have hardly been involved in this area of research. In this&#xD;
      study, we define &quot;non-ambulatory&quot; as requiring at least &quot;continuous or intermittent support&#xD;
      of one person to help with balance or coordination&quot; (i.e. Functional Ambulatory Category â‰¤&#xD;
      2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to design a physical activity programme for non-ambulatory stroke&#xD;
      survivors (delivered via either community-based groups or a home-based individual programme)&#xD;
      and evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, preliminary and adverse effects. The study will&#xD;
      also explore the views of non-ambulatory stroke survivors and their carers on: needs,&#xD;
      personal goals, barriers, and motivators, experiences of programme participated in and&#xD;
      preferred format (i.e. home-based individual/ community-based groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed-methods, observational feasibility study. This study will incorporate qualitative&#xD;
      interviews/focus groups to explore the experiences of the programme participants are taking&#xD;
      part in and their thoughts and views of PA after stroke. Interviews and focus groups will be&#xD;
      conducted throughout the physical activity programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited by the Scottish Stroke Research Network (SRN) via: databases&#xD;
      and electronic patient medical/nursing/AHP notes, records of discharges from acute stroke&#xD;
      wards to off-site rehabilitation units and word of mouth among AHPs., within NHS Lanarkshire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be recruited via non-NHS sites: local community stroke groups, social&#xD;
      media, stroke charities, press releases and related media and care homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glasgow Caledonian University will be used for the community-based group programme and focus&#xD;
      groups/interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' own home setting will be used for the home-based, individual programme and&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-ambulatory stroke survivors and their carers (where applicable) living at home or in care&#xD;
      homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will include measures of disability, ADL, strength, anxiety and depression,&#xD;
      sedentary behaviour, self-efficacy, health status, attainment of individual goals, as well as&#xD;
      carer burden (where appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility will be assessed by numbers of participants invited to participate, accepting and&#xD;
      being recruited into the study, completing the intervention, programme adherence and drop&#xD;
      outs. Safety data will be examined using data on adverse effects reported by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 12 months.&#xD;
