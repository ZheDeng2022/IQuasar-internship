      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many people with alcohol use disorders have a sleep problem called insomnia. One treatment is&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). Researchers want to study people s&#xD;
      experiences with a web-based CBT-I program called SHUTi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if a web-based insomnia therapy program works well and helps people with alcohol use&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-65 who joined another protocol and have been an inpatient on that protocol at&#xD;
      least 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with questions about insomnia. They will wear a device on their&#xD;
      wrist and finger for one night while sleeping. This checks for sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete 1 of 2 programs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SHUTi: Participants will start using the program in the hospital and finish it about 6&#xD;
           weeks later. They will get a computer tablet to access SHUTi at least 3 times a week.&#xD;
           They will get surveys, stories, videos, and interactive data about sleep. They will&#xD;
           complete at least 5 daily sleep diaries every week. SHUTi will be customized based on&#xD;
           the diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Education-only program: This is like SHUTi but it is not interactive and is not&#xD;
           customized. Participants will access it at least once a week. They will finish at their&#xD;
           own pace within 6 weeks. These participants may access SHUTi later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will wear a device on their wrist for 4 straight days at several different&#xD;
      time points. It records activity and sleep data. They will do this 3 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions about the program before starting it and after finishing.&#xD;
      Interviews will be audio recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will do follow-up surveys 6-7 months after they are discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by problematic drinking that becomes severe. The&#xD;
      prevalence of insomnia in individuals with alcohol dependence is estimated to be between&#xD;
      36-91% and after two weeks of alcohol detoxification, as many as 65% of these individuals&#xD;
      still experience &quot;sleep problems.&quot; Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is an&#xD;
      efficacious non-pharmacological treatment for insomnia and is recommended as a first-line&#xD;
      treatment for adults with chronic insomnia disorder. CBT-I has been associated with more&#xD;
      rapid and &quot;durable&quot; improvement in sleep outcomes, even when compared with other&#xD;
      nonpharmacological treatments. Internet-based CBT-I (ICBT-I or eCBT-I for &quot;electronic&quot;) could&#xD;
      play a key role in the dissemination of this behavioral sleep intervention, given the paucity&#xD;
      of trained clinicians able to provide CBT-I in person and other logistical/cost concerns.&#xD;
      SHUTi (Sleep Healthy Using The Internet) is the most tested and empirically-sound internet&#xD;
      intervention for insomnia. The SHUTi program tailors specific recommendations based on&#xD;
      participant responses to sleep diaries and other input within the program. Despite the&#xD;
      promise of internet-based CBT-I interventions, very little is known about their effectiveness&#xD;
      among individuals with AUD: to date, no RCTs exist examining the feasibility/effectiveness of&#xD;
      an internet-based CBT-I program among individuals recovering from AUD. This is a two-phase&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial assessing feasibility/acceptability and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      SHUTi program for research participants at the NIH Clinical Center. Phase I will be focused&#xD;
      on assessing feasibility and effectiveness of program delivery and data collection (n=10).&#xD;
      Phase II will be a pilot RCT powered to examine intervention effectiveness (n=20 per group).&#xD;
      All participants enrolled in this study will first be admitted under the screening and&#xD;
      assessment protocol on the 1SE clinic (14-AA-0181), which includes adults over 18 years of&#xD;
      age seeking treatment for alcohol rehabilitation. Participants for this study must also meet&#xD;
      criteria for &quot;mild to severe&quot; insomnia. Individuals randomized to the intervention group will&#xD;
      receive six sessions of the SHUTi intervention (one completed while inpatient, the rest while&#xD;
      outpatient) and individuals randomized to the control group will receive an educational&#xD;
      web-based program. The goals of the study are as follows: 1) assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of Internet-based CBT-I among individuals with AUD in recovery with insomnia&#xD;
      (Phase I ), 2) compare the efficacy of CBT-I versus control group with respect to primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcome variables (Phase II), and 3) explore specific domains associated with&#xD;
      improved outcomes: e.g. demographic, psychiatric, and/or drinking-related factors (Phase II).&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures include changes in insomnia severity over time and changes in&#xD;
      actigraphy-recorded sleep efficiency over time.&#xD;

    <description>The PACS is a clinical tool for practitioners to measure alcohol craving. It is a five- item self-administered instrument that measures frequency, intensity, and duration of thoughts about drinking along with ability to resist drinking. The Alcohol TLFB is a drinking assessment method that obtains estimates of daily drinking and has been evaluated with clinical and nonclinical populations. Using a calendar, people provide retrospective estimates of their daily drinking over a specified time period that can vary up to 12 months from the interview date.</description>
