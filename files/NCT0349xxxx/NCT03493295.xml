  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this non-interventional study (NIS) is to assess, under real-life conditions,&#xD;
      woman's satisfaction with Levonogestrel IntraUterine System (LNG-IUS) in a young (18-30 years&#xD;
      old (y.o.)) Spanish population taking into account their parity status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the study is aimed to evaluate the impact of: menstrual bleeding pattern and&#xD;
      satisfaction with it at baseline, LNG-IUS chosen, previously used contraceptive method and&#xD;
      reasons for change to/ choice of a LNG-IUS on overall satisfaction with LNG-IUS use.&#xD;
