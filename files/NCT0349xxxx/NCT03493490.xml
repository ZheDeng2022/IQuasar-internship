      The clinical study is planned as a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group, single-centre exploratory clinical study with the aim to investigate the&#xD;
      analgesic efficacy of the Neodolpasse® Infusion Solution in comparison to a 75 mg diclofenac&#xD;
      only infusion. Included will be Patients receiving elective cruciate ligament surgery. The&#xD;
      effectiveness will be measured by the use of additional analgesic medication via PCA during&#xD;
      the first 24 hours postoperatively as well as by using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;
      Furthermore the local and systemic tolerability and safety of the clinical study medications&#xD;
      (i.e. Neodolpasse® Infusion Solution and 75 mg diclofenac only infusion) will be assessed.&#xD;

      The clinical study is planned as a double-blind, randomised, treatment-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group, single-centre exploratory clinical study with the aim to investigate the&#xD;
      analgesic efficacy of the Neodolpasse® Infusion Solution in comparison to a 75 mg diclofenac&#xD;
      only infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled to the clinical study&#xD;
      and receive an enrolment number. The enrolment number will be a 4-digit number where the&#xD;
      leftmost position will be zero (&quot;0&quot;). Enrolled patients will receive enrolment numbers&#xD;
      starting at 0001, 0002, and so forth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients who were successfully randomized after surgery will continue the study&#xD;
      protocol. All other patients will be regarded as screening failures. Successfully randomized&#xD;
      patients will receive two infusions over 60 - 90 minutes with a time interval of 8 hours each&#xD;
      during the first 24 hours postoperatively. All patients will be provided with a PCA device&#xD;
      and will be allowed on demand analgetics as postoperative rescue medication. Consequently the&#xD;
      possibility of an inadequate postoperative pain treatment in the study patients is very low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia will be induced with propofol (1.0-2.5 mg/kg), remifentanil (1 mcg/kg over&#xD;
      minimum of 30s) and rocuronium (0.6mg/kg) and subsequently maintained with remifentail (0.25&#xD;
      - 1 mcg/kg/min), and sevoflurane. During skin suture, 7.5 mg piritramid will be administered.&#xD;
      No nitrous oxide will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No other narcotics, analgesics, or sedatives than those described herein will be allowed. In&#xD;
      case the surgical procedure mandates the use of additional and/or other narcotics,&#xD;
      analgesics, or sedatives it shall be up to the investigator to decide on further treatment.&#xD;
      However, in such case the patient will not be randomized and will be regarded as screening&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of the study patient takes place post-surgery as soon as the patient is able to&#xD;
      cooperate adequatey. Ability to cooperate is defined as successful VAS assessment. At this&#xD;
      time point the patient will be randomized and assigned her/his final randomisation number.&#xD;
      The final randomisation number will be a 4-digit number where the leftmost position&#xD;
      indicating the type of knee surgery performed. Patient undergoing surgery for cruciate&#xD;
      ligament repair will receive randomisation numbers starting at 1001, 1002, and so forth.&#xD;
      Patients undergoing knee replacement surgery will receive randomisation numbers starting at&#xD;
      2001, 2002, and so forth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first infusion of the investigational medicinal product will be started immediately after&#xD;
      randomization. PCA will be established as soon as possible after the start of the first&#xD;
      infusion of the investigational medicinal product but not later than 30 min after the start&#xD;
      of the first infusion of the investigational medicinal product. A one-way PCA device (Vygon&#xD;
      PCA-System) will be used. The PCA system is independent from any power supply and therefore&#xD;
      both safe and reliable. The PCA system contains 20 mg Hydal® (hydromorphone) in 50 mL&#xD;
      solvent. The PCA system parameters are fixed to a single bolus volume of 0.5 mL thus&#xD;
      delivering 0.2 mg hydromorphone per bolus which equates to 2.0 mg piritramide or 1.5 mg&#xD;
      morphine. Lock-out period of the PCA system used is fixed to 5 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All bolus injections will be recorded and added to the cumulative analgesic doses delivered&#xD;
      by PCA.&#xD;
