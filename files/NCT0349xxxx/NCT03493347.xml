  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often participate in equine-assisted&#xD;
      interventions, where practitioners partner with horses to improve the health and well-being&#xD;
      of the clients they serve. One of these interventions is equine-assisted occupational therapy&#xD;
      (EAOT). The first aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of EAOT at improving the&#xD;
      social, behavioral, and occupational functioning of children with ASD. Second, this study&#xD;
      aims to conceptually develop the theory of change that guides how horses are integrated into&#xD;
      occupational therapy for children with ASD. Eight children with ASD will participate in 10&#xD;
      weeks of EAOT. The quantitative strand will involve caregivers filling out measures of social&#xD;
      functioning, self-regulation, and occupational performance on a weekly basis. Investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize children will demonstrate improved performance on these measures during the&#xD;
      intervention in comparison to baseline. The qualitative strand will consist of interviews&#xD;
      with the providing occupational therapists aimed at understanding the theory behind why the&#xD;
      intervention is effective. The results of this study will have implications for children with&#xD;
      ASD, their families, and occupational therapists providing services to individuals with ASD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The proposed study will implement a mixed-methods investigation of equine-assisted&#xD;
      occupational therapy (EAOT) for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUANTIATIVE STRAND&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS Investigators will distribute fliers to local schools and ASD organizations to&#xD;
      recruit eight participants for the study. Investigators will screen children for inclusion&#xD;
      through a four-step process. They will call interested participants to ensure eligibility for&#xD;
      the study, provide basic information, and answer any questions. Next, investigators will mail&#xD;
      interested participants a packet that includes the SCQ, the ABC-C, and Hearts and Horses&#xD;
      Enrollment Packet, along with a cover letter and instructions to mail back the completed&#xD;
      forms, which will include a physician's signature stating the child is medically cleared to&#xD;
      ride horses. Next, eligible participants will attend a screening at Hearts and Horses&#xD;
      Therapeutic Riding Center to ensure they meet all PATH, Intl standards, and can ride a horse&#xD;
      for 10 minutes while following safety rules. Finally, eligible participants will attend a&#xD;
      final screening visit that will include administration of the ADOS-2, Leiter-3, and Adaptive&#xD;
      Behavior Assessment System, Third Edition (ABAS-3). Eight participants who meet criteria will&#xD;
      be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING MEASURES. Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). This parent-report measure is a&#xD;
      quick, 10-minute screen for ASD. A score of 15 or above indicates the individual likely has&#xD;
      ASD. The SCQ has strong discrimination between children with and without ASD and is widely&#xD;
      used for entry into ASD research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2). The ADOS- 2 is a play-based&#xD;
      assessment of communication, social interaction and behaviors, and is often used to confirm a&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of ASD. The ADOS has strong predictive validity for diagnosis of ASD.&#xD;
      Participants who meet clinical-cutoffs for ASD will be included in the study. The ADOS-2&#xD;
      requires extensive training to administer reliably; an investigator who has obtained&#xD;
      research-level reliability will administer the ADOS-2 to potential participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leiter International Performance Scales, Third Edition (Leiter-3). The Leiter-3 is a&#xD;
      completely nonverbal measure of intelligence and cognitive abilities that is widely used with&#xD;
      the ASD population. The Brief IQ score can be used reliably in place of the Full IQ score&#xD;
      when a minimal IQ estimate is needed; therefore, this study will use the Brief IQ version of&#xD;
      the Leiter-3. Participants who have an IQ below 55 will be excluded from the study. A&#xD;
      registered and licensed occupational therapist will administer the Leiter-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aberrant Behavior Checklist- Community (ABC-C). The ABC-C is a valid and reliable behavior&#xD;
      rating scale that measures the extent of problem behaviors in children and adults with&#xD;
      development disabilities. Any adult who knows the child well, in this case the caregiver, can&#xD;
      complete the 58-item checklist. The irritability and hyperactivity subscales will be used as&#xD;
      outcome measures in the study. Therefore, to avoid a ceiling effect as described above,&#xD;
      children included in this study must have a combined score â‰¥ 11 on the irritability and&#xD;
      hyperactivity subscales of the ABC-C, as established by Gabriels et al. (2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATH, Intl. Standards. PATH, Intl provides a list of contraindications for participants who&#xD;
      should not participate in equine-assisted interventions. In order to ensure participants meet&#xD;
      all PATH, Intl standards, they will complete Hearts and Horses enrollment packet and process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS-3). The ABAS-3 is a norm-referenced rating scale&#xD;
      that measures ten domains of adaptive behaviors and can be completed by a caregiver. The&#xD;
      ABAS-3 was chosen because it measures adaptive behavior in a variety of domains, therefore&#xD;
      providing a well-rounded picture of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE INTERVENTION The intervention will occur at Hearts and Horses Therapeutic Riding Center,&#xD;
      which follows guidelines set forth by PATH, Intl to ensure safety of participants; for&#xD;
      example, instructors are PATH-certified, trained side-walkers will be present during the&#xD;
      intervention, and participants will wear helmets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the intervention, each participant and caregiver will participate in an evaluation&#xD;
      with an occupational therapist to determine current level of functioning and family&#xD;
      priorities. Before the evaluation, caregivers will be asked to fill out two forms and bring&#xD;
      them to the evaluation: a questionnaire about their child's adaptive functioning and the&#xD;
      sensory profile. During the evaluation, occupational therapists will conduct a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview with the parent and child. Next, the occupational therapist will&#xD;
      collaborate with the child and family to create occupation-focused goals, a process that will&#xD;
      be facilitated by the administration of the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM).&#xD;
      Occupational therapists will help to guide the family in setting occupation-focused goals&#xD;
      that are realistically attainable with this 10-week intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guided by the evaluation, the occupational therapist will individualize the intervention to&#xD;
      address each participant's unique goals, accommodate for individual learning styles (e.g.&#xD;
      minimize use of verbal cues), and incorporate each child's special interests or powerful&#xD;
      motivators. Despite this individualization, common components will be present across all&#xD;
      intervention sessions. Each session will be 45-60 minutes long, and the child will be mounted&#xD;
      on the horse for at least 25 minutes. The session will begin with a visual schedule of the&#xD;
      day's activities, which can then be referred to throughout the session to facilitate&#xD;
      transitions from one activity to another. There will be a one-to-one ratio between the child&#xD;
      and occupational therapist to ensure the intervention is individualized to each child's&#xD;
      needs. Two EAOT sessions will occur simultaneously in the same arena, and the occupational&#xD;
      therapists will facilitate social interaction between participants. Participants will be&#xD;
      paired into groups of two so that the session that is occurring simultaneously is with a&#xD;
      child with autism with a similar level of adaptive functioning. Activities will be structured&#xD;
      to provide positive reinforcement for communication, and the occupational therapist will&#xD;
      manipulate equine movement to provide graded sensory stimulation and optimal arousal.&#xD;
      Unmounted, or &quot;ground activities&quot; will be customized to address each child's goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION: It is likely that improvements made during EAOT will be maintained after the&#xD;
      intervention is withdrawn, therefore a multiple-baseline design is the optimal single-case&#xD;
      experimental design. After the occupational therapy evaluation, participants will be paired&#xD;
      into groups of two based on similar levels of adaptive functioning and/or similar or&#xD;
      complementary treatment goals. Pairs of participants will then be randomized to a 5-week, or&#xD;
      7-week baseline phase. The baseline condition will be a no-treatment waiting list, during&#xD;
      which caregivers will fill out the ABC-C on a weekly basis, retrospectively reporting on&#xD;
      their child's behavior for the previous week. Caregivers will also complete a brief&#xD;
      questionnaire that asks about any changes in medication, therapy, or routines that week. In&#xD;
      addition, caregivers will rate their child's target behaviors on a VAS everyday. All of these&#xD;
      measures (ABC-C, parent questionnaire, and VAS) will be administered online using a Qualtrics&#xD;
      survey that is emailed or texted to them, depending on parent preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 10-week intervention phase will consist of weekly, 45-minute EAOT intervention sessions.&#xD;
      Throughout the intervention phase, caregivers will continue completing the ABC-C and brief&#xD;
      questionnaire weekly; caregivers will also continue providing VAS ratings daily. In addition,&#xD;
      caregivers will complete the intervention credibility scale, the SRS-2, and the COPM on the&#xD;
      first week and the 10th week of the intervention phase, in order to provide a pre and post&#xD;
      assessment of caregivers' attitude toward treatment, and child social functioning and&#xD;
      occupational performance. Three months after the intervention, caregivers will complete the&#xD;
      SRS-2, COPM, and the ABC-C a final time to determine maintenance of effects DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
      Visual inspection will be the primary method of data analysis. The Co-PI will plot the&#xD;
      dependent variables (y-axis) against time (x-axis) for each participant. Next, she will&#xD;
      inspect the data for changes in mean (average rate of performance), and trend (direction of&#xD;
      change over time), of the dependent variables between baseline and intervention conditions.&#xD;
      If the data demonstrate positive findings, the plotted graphs will be further inspected for&#xD;
      evidence of non-effect, such as delayed latency to change, positive trends during the&#xD;
      baseline phase, or variable data with overlap between phases. As a secondary method of&#xD;
      analysis, investigators will calculate the non-overlap of all pairs (NAP) of the ABC-C, and&#xD;
      VAS scores between baseline and intervention phases, which will yield an effect size and a&#xD;
      measure of statistical significance .&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITATIVE STRAND&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS: Two occupational therapists have been recruited to participate in this study.&#xD;
      Both occupational therapists helped to screen the children with autism to determine if they&#xD;
      met all PATH, Intl standards for participation in equine-assisted therapy. Second, they have&#xD;
      both helped to conduct occupational therapy evaluations to determine the current level of&#xD;
      functioning and therapy goals for the children with autism. Third, they will provide the&#xD;
      equine-assisted occupational therapy to children with autism. Finally, they will participate&#xD;
      in interviews about the theory guiding the intervention they are delivering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION &amp; ANALYSIS: Qualitative data will consist of interviews with the occupational&#xD;
      therapists during and after the 10-week intervention. During the course of the 10-week&#xD;
      intervention, the Co-PI will interview both occupational therapists using a semi-structured&#xD;
      interview guide. Overall during the intervention phase, investigators will conduct 5 hours of&#xD;
      interviews with each occupational therapist. After the 10-week intervention has concluded and&#xD;
      quantitative data have been analyzed, the Co-PI will conduct one final hour-long interview&#xD;
      with both occupational therapists aimed at explaining the quantitative results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will transcribe audio-recorded interviews and perform theoretical thematic&#xD;
      analysis with constant comparison using the qualitative data analysis software program,&#xD;
      NVivo. First, interviews will be coded according to these start codes, derived from work on&#xD;
      theory-guided interventions: 1- &quot;problems&quot; experienced by participants 2- intervention&#xD;
      components designed to address problems, 3- theories of change and mediational processes, and&#xD;
      4- intended outcomes. Next, investigators will conduct open coding, whereby the text will be&#xD;
      broken down, examined, conceptualized, and categorized. Data will be sub-categorized within&#xD;
      existing start-codes as appropriate, and new categories may emerge from the data. After open&#xD;
      coding, investigators will engage in axial coding, seeking to find links and relationships&#xD;
      between and within categories and sub-categories. Investigators will bring emerging analyses&#xD;
      to the practitioners for occasional member checks, in order to ensure that ongoing analyses&#xD;
      are consistent with their intended meanings. Finally, selective coding will allow final&#xD;
      themes to emerge, and will elucidate relationships between themes.&#xD;
