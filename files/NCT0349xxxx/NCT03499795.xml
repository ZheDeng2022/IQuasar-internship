      This is a phase 2, open-label efficacy study of VGX-3100 administered by intramuscular (IM)&#xD;
      injection followed by electroporation (EP) in adult men and women who are human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative with histologically confirmed anal or anal/peri-anal&#xD;
      high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) associated with human papilloma virus&#xD;
      (HPV)-16 and/or HPV-18. Approximately 24 participants will receive at least 3 doses of&#xD;
