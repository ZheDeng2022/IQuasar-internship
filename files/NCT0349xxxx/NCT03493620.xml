  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a chronic disease that has grown to epidemic proportions in Brazil and throughout&#xD;
      the world in recent years. Bariatric surgery has been the most effective method for the&#xD;
      treatment and prophylaxis of complications caused by morbid obesity, thereby increasing the&#xD;
      longevity and quality of life of patients. The treatment of patients with Class III obesity&#xD;
      or higher or Class II with comorbidities is already well established with bariatric surgery&#xD;
      being the best option. However, there is no consensus as to the best treatment in cases of&#xD;
      Class I or II obesity without comorbidities. The objective of this research will be to make a&#xD;
      gastric tube similar to that obtained by surgical gastroplication but using endoscopic&#xD;
      intragastric sutures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this research will be to make a gastric tube similar to that&#xD;
      obtained by surgical gastroplication but using endoscopic intragastric sutures. The secondary&#xD;
      objective will be to correlate demographic, endoscopic and laboratory data with the outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out in two institutions. The Kaiser Clinic and Day Hospital and&#xD;
      the Faculty of Medicine of ABC. Sixty patients will be randomly selected for treatment by&#xD;
      Endospore Endoscopy (ESG) or as controls (only the endoscopist will know which group each&#xD;
      patient belongs to). The draw will take place only after upper endoscopy has been carried out&#xD;
      to avoid possible contraindications for the procedure due to injuries. Once the criteria for&#xD;
      endoscopic evaluation have been met, randomization will be carried out in loco with the&#xD;
      patient still sedated. Gastric Endo Sutures will be performed when the patient is randomized&#xD;
      for Group I; Group II will be the control group. All patients will be followed up for two&#xD;
      years by a multidisciplinary team (endoscopist, surgeon, nutritionist and psychologist). The&#xD;
      data will be obtained during the outpatient follow-up at the Hospital Mario Covas and will&#xD;
      include demographic (gender, age), clinical (height, weight, BMI, time after procedure,&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, alcoholism) and operative data&#xD;
      (complications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation to perform the examination/procedure: All exams will be performed with the&#xD;
      patients within eight hours. The procedure will begin with the patient in left lateral&#xD;
      decubitus position and under general anesthesia performed by an anesthesiologist. Endoscopic&#xD;
      suturing will be performed with 2-0 prolene stitches until a tubular-shaped stomach is formed&#xD;
      similar to vertical gastrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery after the procedure: After this procedure and recovery from the anesthesia, all&#xD;
      patients will only be discharged in the company of a companion. All patients will be&#xD;
      counseled to enter in touch with the physician to report any signs or symptoms.&#xD;
