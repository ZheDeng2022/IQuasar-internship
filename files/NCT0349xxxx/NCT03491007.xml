      The purpose of this research is to determine if a study medication called&#xD;
      Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) helps to reduce PTSD symptoms in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans. In&#xD;
      addition to finding out if DHEA is effective for treating PTSD symptoms, this research seeks&#xD;
      to determine if DHEA is effective in treating other symptoms, such as depression and anxiety.&#xD;
      Depression and anxiety are symptoms that are frequently present in Veterans who are&#xD;
      experiencing PTSD. Another purpose of this research is to takes pictures of the brain using&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blood levels of various small molecules including&#xD;
      neurosteroids and also proteins, which may be affected by the study drug and/or related to&#xD;
      symptoms in Veterans with PTSD. This study seeks to determine if DHEA is changed to other&#xD;
      compounds after it is taken by mouth and the safety and effectiveness of DHEA in Veterans&#xD;
      with PTSD. This is an &quot;add-on&quot; study and Veterans enrolled in the study will continue to take&#xD;
      all of their current medications without any changes (also called &quot;usual care&quot;), and DHEA or&#xD;
      a sugar pill (also called a &quot;placebo&quot;) will then be added to their current medication&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a parallel-group, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled, randomized Phase 2 pilot&#xD;
      study using adjunctive dehydroxyepiandrosterone [DHEA (400 mg)] to establish Proof of Concept&#xD;
      (POC) for use of this agent in Veterans with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' first objective is POC target engagement to evaluate a one-time adjunctive&#xD;
      oral dose of DHEA (400 mg) relative to PBO on the neuronal circuity of fear-anxiety-emotion&#xD;
      connectivity. This will be achieved by comparing pre- to post-treatment changes in&#xD;
      amygdala-hippocampal functional connectivity to DHEA and PBO during fMRI activation. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that compared with PBO, DHEA will increase task-associated fMRI&#xD;
      functional connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus (primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective is to determine if an 8-week treatment with adjunctive DHEA is superior&#xD;
      to PBO in reducing symptoms of PTSD (CAPS-5) and depression (BDI) in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans,&#xD;
      and enhancing resilience (CD-RISC). The investigators hypothesize that 400mg DHEA will result&#xD;
      in reduced PTSD and depression symptom severity relative to PBO, as determined by a pre- to&#xD;
      post-treatment decrease in CAPS-5 and BDI scores, respectively, with enhancement in&#xD;
      resilience scores using the CD-RISC at 6-weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third objective is to evaluate the impact of DHEA relative to PBO on serum neurosteroid&#xD;
      levels in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with PTSD. The investigators hypothesize that DHEA will result&#xD;
      in a statistically-significant increase in serum neurosteroid levels (DHEA, DHEAS,&#xD;
      androsterone) relative to PBO, as determined by pre- to post-treatment reductions in PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms severity. This association will be evaluated by correlating neurosteroid levels with&#xD;
      PTSD, depression, and resilience scores over 6 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objective is to determine preliminary evidence for an association of fMRI and&#xD;
      myelin integrity measures of fear-anxiety-emotion circuits with serum neurosteroid levels and&#xD;
      treatment response to DHEA. Changes in myelin integrity following DHEA treatment will be&#xD;
      evaluated using novel susceptibility diffusion imaging [STI]), as DHEA impacts myelination in&#xD;
      preclinical rodent models. The investigators will also determine if serum neurosteroid levels&#xD;
      are correlated with myelin integrity on STI. The investigators hypothesize that fMRI and&#xD;
      myelin integrity of fear-anxiety circuits will correlate with serum neurosteroids and&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;

             hematologic illness, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, or other medical&#xD;

             and/or likely to lead to worsening of symptoms during the course of the study in the&#xD;
             opinion of study physician and research team.&#xD;
