  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this longitudinal cohort study including young to middle aged people with longstanding hip&#xD;
      and groin pain (LHGP) referred to tertiary care, we will collect data of patient reported&#xD;
      symptoms, function and quality of life three and seven years after the initial contact with&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeon.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      81 physically active patients (18-55 years) with (LHGP) who were enrolled in a&#xD;
      cross-sectional study (Diagnosis and functional limitations in the young to middle-aged&#xD;
      physically active population with long-standing hip/groin pain: A cross-sectional study)&#xD;
      during the period October 2014 to January 2017 will be recruited to this longitudinal cohort&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research coordinator will contact the patients and provide them with written and oral&#xD;
      information about the study. Patients who accept to participate will electronically complete&#xD;
      the following questionnaires. The same questionnaires were included at baseline, i.e., in the&#xD;
      cross-sectional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HSAS - Hip Sports Activity Scale (HSAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Specific Functional Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical Outcomes Study short form 36 (SF-36)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  K-10 questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-Presentation in Exercise Questionnaire (SPEQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional questions about treatment, medication, patient satisfaction and perceived change&#xD;
      in hip function will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For descriptive purposes, the mean difference (95% CI), or median (quartiles), between&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up assessments will be used as appropriate. Separate linear regression&#xD;
      models will be used to evaluate the change in each variable compared to baseline values.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 7 years after baseline (cross-sectional study)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported outcome regarding hip dysfunction, which includes six subscales; pain, symptoms, physical function in daily living, physical function in sport and recreation, participation in physical activity, and quality of life. The score for each subscale ranges from 0-100, where 0 indicates extreme problems and 100 no problems. Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) will be derived from HAGOS score using previously described cut-off values for the different subscales</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HSAS - Hip Sports Activity Scale (HSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 7 years after baseline (cross-sectional study)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported outcome regarding activity level. The scale ranges från 0-8 where 0 indicates the lowest activity and 8 the highest.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>K-10 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years after baseline (cross-sectional study)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported outcome regarding mental health. This instrument consists of 10 questions, where each question is scored from 1 to 5. The total score is summerized and ranges from 10 to 50, where 10 indicates no problem and 50 severe problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Presentation in Exercise Questionnaire (SPEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years after baseline (cross-sectional study)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported outcome regarding self image during exercise and consists of 14 questions. Each question is assessed on a 6-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Higher scores represent a greater desire to present oneself as an exerciser and a greater use of strategies to portray oneself as an exerciser.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years after baseline (cross-sectional study)</time_frame>
    <description>The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) is designed to measure perceptions of support from 3 sources: Family, Friends, and a Significant Other. The scale is comprised of a total of 12 items, with 4 items for each subscale. The items are scored on 7 point likert scale anging from 1 (very strongly disagree) to 7 (very strongly agree). The mean value tor each subscale are calculated. High score indicates a percetion of good social support.</description>
