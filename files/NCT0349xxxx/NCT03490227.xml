    <description>Magnetic resonance imaging were traced for lipid: water ratio in the supraclavicular region. Brown adipose tissue volume was calculated by summing all brown adipose tissue volume in the supraclavicular region with a lipid: water ration (or fat signal fraction) between 10-50%.</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Magnetic resonance imaging scans were traced for lipid: water ratio in the supraclavicular region. Fat signal fraction is defined as the lipid: water ratio found in the lipid tissues in the supraclavicular region. Only traced lipid tissues (between 10-50%) were included in the average fat signal fraction because only traced lipid tissues were classified as brown adipose tissue.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>During one MRI scan occurring at the respective participant's first visit, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine malfunction led to acquisition of images that were unanalyzable and therefore unusable.&#xD;
The study is limited by a small and relatively homogenous sample of ten infants. Given the nature of the method development study, we did not enroll equal numbers of males and females.</limitations_and_caveats>
