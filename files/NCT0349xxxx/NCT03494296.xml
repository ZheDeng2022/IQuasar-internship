  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decitabine is a cytosine analogue and is a specific DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor.&#xD;
      It directly inhibits DNMT by phosphorylating DNA and inhibits DNMT, thereby reversing DNA&#xD;
      methylation and inducing tumor cells to Normal cell differentiation or induction of tumor&#xD;
      cell apoptosis.Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common pathological type in&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The first-line chemotherapy regimen using&#xD;
      Rituximab+Cyclophosphamide+Doxorubicin +Vincristine+Bonisone（R-CHOP）significantly increases&#xD;
      the remission rate and disease-free survival of patients with DLBCL, but it is difficult to&#xD;
      partially relapse. Long-term remission and survival rates in treating patients are not&#xD;
      satisfactory.Due to the greater cardiac toxicity of adriamycin, more patients can not be&#xD;
      uncomfortable, so the COP program is also widely used in patients with DLBCL, and achieved a&#xD;
      good response rate.In 2008, the FDA had approved decitabine for the demethylation treatment&#xD;
      of Myelodysplastic syndrome（MDS）. Over the years, good initial remission rates and better&#xD;
      long-term survival rates have been achieved in patients with MDS.There are also a variety of&#xD;
      clinical trials of decitabine for patients with solid tumors that have achieved significant&#xD;
      clinical efficacy.Due to the high side effects of high-dose decitabine, patient tolerance is&#xD;
      poor. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      low-dose decitabine combined with Cyclophosphamide+Vindesine+Bonisone(COP) regimen (D-COP)&#xD;
      4-6 course of treatment for relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      Decitabine is a cytosine analogue and is a specific DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor.&#xD;
      It directly inhibits DNMT by phosphorylating DNA and inhibits DNMT, thereby reversing DNA&#xD;
      methylation and inducing tumor cells to Normal cell differentiation or induction of tumor&#xD;
      cell apoptosis. High concentrations of decitabine inhibit DNA synthesis, exert its cytotoxic&#xD;
      effects, and induce cell death; low concentrations of decitabine inactivate DNMT and&#xD;
      demethylate some hypermethylated CpG islands in tumor suppressor genes. To activate the&#xD;
      silencing tumor suppressor gene and exert its effect of inhibiting tumor growth to achieve&#xD;
      anti-tumor effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetics plays an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors and is a hot&#xD;
      topic in recent years. Methylation of DNA is the main form of epigenetic information. Normal&#xD;
      methylation plays an important role in maintaining the normal functions of cells and organs&#xD;
      and in the development, differentiation, growth, and aging of the body. However, the abnormal&#xD;
      participation of cell epigenetics can directly affect the overexpression of tumor cells,&#xD;
      which leads to the occurrence and development of tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common pathological type in non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma. The first-line chemotherapy regimen using R-CHOP significantly increases the&#xD;
      remission rate and disease-free survival of patients with DLBCL, but it is difficult to&#xD;
      partially relapse. Long-term remission and survival rates in treating patients are not&#xD;
      satisfactory.Due to the greater cardiac toxicity of adriamycin, more patients can not be&#xD;
      uncomfortable, so the COP program is also widely used in patients with DLBCL, and achieved a&#xD;
      good response rate.In 2008, the FDA had approved decitabine for the demethylation treatment&#xD;
      of MDS. Over the years, good initial remission rates and better long-term survival rates have&#xD;
      been achieved in patients with MDS.There are also a variety of clinical trials of decitabine&#xD;
      for patients with solid tumors that have achieved significant clinical efficacy.Due to the&#xD;
      high side effects of high-dose decitabine, patient tolerance is poor. Therefore, the purpose&#xD;
      of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose decitabine combined with&#xD;
      COP regimen (D-COP) 4-6 course of treatment for relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this study will select relapsed refractory high-risk patients, previous studies&#xD;
      have confirmed that the COP program can make a good effect in most patients, also confirmed&#xD;
      the demethylation of decitabine in other tumors Therefore, whether the treatment of low-dose&#xD;
      decitabine combined with COP regimen for DLBCL can improve the prognosis is worth looking&#xD;
      forward to. At present, there are few researches on the treatment of DLBCL with low-dose&#xD;
      decitabine at home and abroad. The purpose of this study is to explore whether low-dose&#xD;
      decitabine combined with COP regimen as a treatment for patients with relapsed and refractory&#xD;
      DLBCL can improve the relapse-refractory DLBCL. The patient's prognosis, and hope to explore&#xD;
      through a stratified analysis which group of patients benefit more from it.&#xD;
