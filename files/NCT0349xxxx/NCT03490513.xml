  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have preliminary data suggesting that obese patients with hypogonadotropic&#xD;
      hypogonadism (HHG) have minimal benefit from testosterone therapy likely because of its&#xD;
      conversion to estradiol by the abundant aromatase enzyme in the adipocytes. The increased&#xD;
      conversion of androgens into estrogens in obese men results in a negative feedback of high&#xD;
      estradiol levels on hypothalamus and pituitary, inhibiting the production of&#xD;
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating&#xD;
      hormone (FSH) and, as a consequence, of testosterone by the testis. Testosterone&#xD;
      administration could increase estradiol production, further promoting the inhibitory feedback&#xD;
      to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Although weight loss from lifestyle modification&#xD;
      has been shown to reduce estradiol and increase testosterone levels, the effect is at best&#xD;
      modest and weight regain results in recurrence of hypogonadism. The use of aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors, in combination with weight loss, could be an effective alternative strategy due&#xD;
      to its action at the pathophysiology of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Subjects (body mass index of ≥35, testosterone &lt;300 ng/dl) will be randomized to&#xD;
      the active (anastrozole) or control (placebo) group. Anastrozole 1 mg tablet / day will be&#xD;
      self-administered with or without food, at around the same time every day (active group);&#xD;
      placebo 1 tablet/day with or without food to take at around the same time every day (control&#xD;
      group). The study duration will be 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will undergo lifestyle intervention consisting of diet and supervised exercise&#xD;
      program. Target weight loss will be at least 10% of baseline body weight during the&#xD;
      intervention. Subjects will attend weekly group behavior modification sessions which will&#xD;
      last ~75-90 min for the first 3 months and decreased to every two weeks from 3 to 12 months.&#xD;
      Subjects will attend supervised research center-based exercise sessions during the first 6&#xD;
      months followed by community fitness center-based sessions during the next 6 months for at&#xD;
      least 2 d/wk, with recording of home-based exercises for the other 2-4 days/week.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After age of 40, testosterone (T) production in men gradually decreases at a rate of 1.6% per&#xD;
      year for total and to 2-3% per year for bioavailable T. This reduction in T production in men&#xD;
      parallels the age-associated loss of muscle mass that leads to sarcopenia and impairment of&#xD;
      function and the age-associated loss of bone mass that leads to osteopenia and fracture risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypogonadism is a condition associated with multiple symptom complex including fatigue,&#xD;
      depressed mood, osteoporosis, gain of fat mass, loss of libido and reduced muscle strength,&#xD;
      all of which deeply affect patient quality of life. The prevalence of hypogonadism among&#xD;
      obese men was estimated to be as much as 40% and could as much as 50% if they are also&#xD;
      diabetic, with levels of androgens decreasing proportionately to the degree of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In obese men, the age-related decline in T is exacerbated by the suppression of the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by hyperestrogenemia. The high expression of aromatase&#xD;
      enzyme in the adipose tissue enhances the conversion of androgens into estrogens which in&#xD;
      turn exerts a negative feedback on hypothalamus and pituitary, inhibiting the production of&#xD;
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating&#xD;
      hormone (FSH) and, as a consequence, of T by the testis resulting in hypogonadotropic&#xD;
      hypogonadism (HH). Considering the high aromatase expression in the adipose tissue, the&#xD;
      administration of T among obese men with HHG could increase the conversion of the substrate T&#xD;
      to estradiol (E2) and fuels the negative feedback on hypothalamus and pituitary, producing a&#xD;
      greater suppression of GnRH and gonadotropins. Thus, men with obesity induced HHG may benefit&#xD;
      from other treatment strategies that target the pathophysiology of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although weight loss intervention improves hormonal and metabolic abnormalities related to&#xD;
      obesity, the increase in T levels induced by weight loss are often lost due to weight regain,&#xD;
      which is very frequent among patients undergoing massive weight loss. One possible approach&#xD;
      is the use of aromatase inhibitors (AI) to stop the conversion of T to E2 thereby&#xD;
      interrupting the vicious cycle of E2 inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis&#xD;
      and restoring T production to normal levels. Since weight loss remains the standard of care&#xD;
      for obese patients, the investigators propose the following OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effect of an AI plus WL (AI+WL) compared to WL alone on the changes in&#xD;
           hormonal profile in severely obese men with HHG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effect of an AI+WL compared to WL alone on the changes in muscle&#xD;
           strength and muscle mass, and symptoms of hypogonadism in severely obese men with HHG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effect of an AI+WL compared to WL alone on the changes in body&#xD;
           composition and metabolic risk factors in severely obese men with HHG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the effect of an AI+WL compared to WL alone on the changes in bone mineral&#xD;
           density (BMD), bone markers, and bone quality in severely obese men with HHG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary aim, the investigators will elucidate the mechanism for the anticipated positive&#xD;
      effects of AI+WL on obesity-associated HHG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study comparing the effect of weight&#xD;
      loss + anastrozole to weight loss + placebo for 12 months on the hormonal profile and&#xD;
      symptoms associated with hypogonadism in severely obese men with a body mass index (BMI) of&#xD;
      more or equal to 35 kg/m2.&#xD;
