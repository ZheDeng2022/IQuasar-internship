  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2 research study is to determine whether a combination of&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs plus radiation therapy, given before surgery in resectable pancreactic&#xD;
      cancer, can help to increase the chances of surgeons achieving and R0 resection. The&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs used are gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. These drugs are both approved by&#xD;
      the FDA for use in treating adults with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The investigational&#xD;
      portion of this study is providing the chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy before&#xD;
      surgery. Primary Endpoint, R) resection rate ≥70%. Secondary Endpoints, Disease free&#xD;
      survival, Overall survival , Perioperative mortality and morbidity.&#xD;

      Primary Endpoint: R0 resection rate ≥ 70%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: Disease free survival, Overall survival, Perioperative mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment should start within 28 days of registration. Pre-operative Chemotherapy Patients&#xD;
      will receive a combination of the agents (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) prior to surgery&#xD;
      for a maximum of four cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine 1000 mg-m2 IV on days 1, 8, 15 Nab-paclitaxel 125 mg-m2 IV on days 1, 8, 15 28&#xD;
      day cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative Chemotherapy Treatment should start within 5-10 weeks of surgery. Patients&#xD;
      will receive a combination of the agents (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) after surgery for&#xD;
      maximum of two cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine 1000 mg-m2 IV on days 1, 8, 15 Nab-paclitaxel 125 mg-m2 IV on days 1, 8, 15 28&#xD;
      day cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy Immobilization and Treatment Planning CT Scan All patients will be&#xD;
      immobilized in a full body immobilization device in the supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 4D-CT scan from T5 to L5-S1 with intravenous and oral contrast will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Toxicity All acute toxicities will be scored according to the NCI Common Toxicity&#xD;
      Criteria v4.0. Late toxicity will be scored per RTOG guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery, Pre-operative Re-staging Pre-operative evaluation should occur within 2-4 weeks&#xD;
      prior to the planned surgery date. Based on the results of the pre-operative evaluation, the&#xD;
      corresponding action below should be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological responding or stable disease: Patients should proceed to surgery per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery Pancreatic resection should occur within 4-10 weeks after the last dose of&#xD;
      preoperative chemotherapy or SBRT. Staging laparoscopy may be performed at the time of&#xD;
      planned laparotomy but is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative Restaging Evaluation should occur within 2 weeks prior to initiation of&#xD;
      postoperative chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor Response Evaluation (Adapted From RECIST 1.1) Assessment of overall tumor burden and&#xD;
      measurable disease To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to&#xD;
      estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent&#xD;
      measurements. Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in&#xD;
      protocols where objective tumor response is the primary endpoint. Measurable disease is&#xD;
      defined by the presence of at least one measurable. In studies where the primary endpoint is&#xD;
      tumor progression (either time to progression or proportion with progression at a fixed&#xD;
      date), the protocol must specify if entry is restricted to those with measurable disease or&#xD;
      whether patients having non-measurable disease only are also eligible.&#xD;
