    <textblock>
      Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is characterized by low back and leg pain, walking disturbances&#xD;
      and sometimes instability, impaired balance and numbness of the lower limbs. This condition&#xD;
      is caused by degenerative changes in the lumbar spine including bulging discs, osteophytes&#xD;
      from the arthritic facet joints and thickened ligamentum flavum which together cause&#xD;
      narrowing of the spinal canal and thus affect the lumbar nerve roots. This diagnosis is&#xD;
      attracting more and more interest due to the aging population with increasing demands for&#xD;
      physical activity. LSS is the most common indication for spinal surgery. The surgical&#xD;
      treatment involves relieving the pressure from the nerve structures in the stenotic segments&#xD;
      through a posterior approach. In several studies, surgery has been shown to have better&#xD;
      results than the conservative treatment. However, methodological difficulties and a large&#xD;
      proportion of cross-over in these studies indicate that there is still uncertainty about&#xD;
      whether surgery is generally a better option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been speculated whether the compression of the nerve roots causes in some patients&#xD;
      permanent nerve damage with muscle denervation, while in other cases a reinnervation and&#xD;
      recovery of the function may occur. Results from neurography and EMG studies have been shown&#xD;
      these modalities to have a possible predictive value for the natural process of LSS. If a&#xD;
      neurophysiological examination could be able to predict which patients are able to benefit&#xD;
      from surgery, many patients could avoid surgery and the risks involved in it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is primarily to evaluate whether surgery with decompression leads to&#xD;
      superior results than the non-surgical treatment with structured physical therapy.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is characterized by low back and leg pain, walking disturbances&#xD;
      and sometimes instability, impaired balance and numbness of the lower limbs. This condition&#xD;
      is caused by degenerative changes in the lumbar spine including bulging discs, osteophytes&#xD;
      from the arthritic facet joints and thickened ligamentum flavum which together cause&#xD;
      narrowing of the spinal canal and thus affect the lumbar nerve roots. LSS affects mainly&#xD;
      older populations and is unusual under 50 years old. This diagnosis is attracting more and&#xD;
      more interest due to the aging population with increasing demands for physical activity. LSS&#xD;
      is the most common indication for spinal surgery. The surgical treatment involves relieving&#xD;
      the pressure from the nerve structures in the stenotic segments through a posterior approach.&#xD;
      The hypertrophic ligaments and parts of the facet joints are removed (i.e., decompression).&#xD;
      Adding fusion to the decompression for stabilization of the decompressed segment has not been&#xD;
      shown to provide superior results than decompression alone. In several studies, surgery has&#xD;
      been shown to have better results than the conservative treatment. However, methodological&#xD;
      difficulties and a large proportion of cross-over in these studies indicate that there is&#xD;
      still uncertainty about whether surgery is generally a better option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After decompression, only 60-70% of patients reported to be satisfied with the result and a&#xD;
      minor proportion of them experienced even no improvement at all [Str√∂mqvist]. Conservative&#xD;
      treatment has shown in some studies to have good results for some patient groups and other&#xD;
      studies have shown that the benefit of the surgical treatment decreases over time and that&#xD;
      physical exercise may reduce the need for surgery. Moreover, surgery itself has a positive&#xD;
      placebo effect that can improve symptoms in some diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been speculated whether the compression of the nerve roots causes in some patients&#xD;
      permanent nerve damage with muscle denervation, while in other cases a reinnervation and&#xD;
      recovery of the function may occur. Results from neurography and EMG studies have been shown&#xD;
      these modalities to have a possible predictive value for the natural process of LSS. If a&#xD;
      neurophysiological examination could be able to predict which patients are able to benefit&#xD;
      from surgery, many patients could avoid surgery and the risks involved in it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degeneration of the lumbar spine is progressively impairing the spinal sagittal balance.&#xD;
      The need to make extensive correction and fusion in addition to the decompression in order to&#xD;
      restore the sagittal balance is debated among spinal surgeons. The experience gained from&#xD;
      previous RCTs is that the patients' back pain is reduced by decompression only. Many patients&#xD;
      also report that their posture improved after decompression alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous trials in the connective tissue and blood samples have shown that proinflammatory&#xD;
      factors and nociceptors (molecules that induce pain) are upregulated in patients with&#xD;
      patellar tendinosis which is an inflammatory condition. Changes in the connective tissue that&#xD;
      cause LSS are mainly inflammatory (arthritic facet joints and ligamentum flavum) and a&#xD;
      possible theory around LSS pathophysiology may be that the nerves are biologically affected&#xD;
      by proinflammatory factors and nociceptors. Identification of some of these factors could&#xD;
      lead to better explanation of the pathomechanism behind the nerve compression in LSS and to&#xD;
      the development of future pharmacological treatments to be used in conjunction with surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is primarily to evaluate whether surgery with decompression leads to&#xD;
      superior results than the non-surgical treatment with structured physical therapy. For this&#xD;
      evaluation, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main secondary aim is to investigate by means of Neurography and EMG, whether the degree&#xD;
      of neurological affection caused by nerve compression affects the outcome of surgery for LSS.&#xD;

      Aims The aim of this study is primarily to evaluate whether surgery with decompression leads&#xD;
      to superior results than the non-surgical treatment with structured physical therapy. For his&#xD;
      evaluation, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main secondary aim is to investigate by means of Neurography and EMG, whether the degree&#xD;
      of neurological affection caused by nerve compression affects the outcome of surgery for LSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questions at issue are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does decompression provide a better clinical outcome than the non-surgical treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is there any correlation between the clinical grade of symptoms and the degree of&#xD;
           neurological affection measured by ENG/EMG?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is there any connection between the neurological affection and the proinflammatory&#xD;
           markers/nociceptors in the blood as well as in histological findings from ligamentum&#xD;
           flavum? Are these correlated with the clinical grade of symptoms?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does decompression provide superior neurological recovery, measured by ENG/EMG, in&#xD;
           comparison to the non-surgical treatment ?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Can decompression improve the spinal sagittal balance?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up 6 months, 1, 2 and 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results at 2 years will be the most important goal of the study, on which the main&#xD;
      clinical results will be built. The neurophysiological results can be analyzed and presented&#xD;
      after the 6-month follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow-chart&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment The patient is recruited during an outpatient visit to a surgeon. Oral and&#xD;
      written information about the study is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICF The patient gives oral and written consent. The consent is documented in the patient&#xD;
      journal and the written consent is filed in the study document binder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data - PROMs via Swespine Study&#xD;

        -  ENG/EMG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples for analysis of inflammatory markers (OLINK)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-over Feasibility for cross-over from group B till A after 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up 1,2 years - PROMs via Swespine Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      - 6MWT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow -up 5 years - PROMs via Swespine Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment group A, in conjunction with the surgical procedure, ligamentum flavum will&#xD;
      be collected (which is usually removed during the decompression surgery) and will be examined&#xD;
      with histological methods regarding proinflammatory markers and nociceptors . An 1x1 cm&#xD;
      tissue piece will be dissected and saved. The ligament samples will be examined by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry and with proteomics analysis. Proteomics analysis will be performed in&#xD;
      collaboration with Olink Uppsala (www.olink.com) where 92 inflammation-related factors will&#xD;
      be investigated. Sample management will be in accordance with the Ethics Examination Act of&#xD;
      Human Research (2003: 460) and according to the rules of Uppsala Biobank.&#xD;
