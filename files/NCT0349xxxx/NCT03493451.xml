  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, open-label, Phase 2 clinical study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of BGB-A317 in participants with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      mature T- and natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasms. There will be two cohorts of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Participants with relapsed or refractory extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (nasal&#xD;
           or non-nasal type)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: other mature T-cell neoplasms (limited to the following histologies:&#xD;
           peripheral T-cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma,&#xD;
           or anaplastic large-cell lymphoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (limited to mycosis fungoides and Sèzary syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 70 participants will be enrolled into cohort 1, up to 50 participants into cohort 2,&#xD;
      and up to 10 participants into cohort 3 for a total sample size of up to 130 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is overall response rate (ORR) determined by investigator&#xD;
      assessment. Disease response for the primary endpoint for cohorts 1 and 2 will be assessed&#xD;
      per the Lugano criteria with LYRIC modification for immunomodulatory therapy Disease response&#xD;
      for the primary endpoint for cohort 3 will be assessed per the International Society for&#xD;
      Cutaneous Lymphoma (ISCL)/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)&#xD;
      guidelines for immunomodulatory therapy BGB-A317 will be administered intravenously as a 200&#xD;
      mg infusion every 3 weeks (Each cycle consists of 21 days). Study procedures will occur over&#xD;
      a Screening phase (up to 35 days); Treatment phase (until disease progression, intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever occurs first); Safety Follow-up phase&#xD;
      (up to 90 days following last study treatment for all adverse events (AEs) and serious&#xD;
      adverse events (SAEs)); Survival follow-up phase (duration varying by participant).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is completed by the participant. The EORTC QLQ-30 contains 30 questions that incorporate 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning), 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). The participant answers questions about their health during the past week. There are 28 questions answered on a 4-point scale where 1 =Not at all (best) to 4 =Very Much (worst) and 2 questions answered on a 7-point scale where 1 =Very poor (worst) to 7 =Excellent (best).</description>

    <measure>Patient-reported outcomes based on EuroQoL-Five Dimensions, Five Levels (EQ-5D-5L) for all cohorts</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D- is a generic, self-reported measure of utility that consists of a five-item descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system has two versions, namely the 3L and 5L, both involving five health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). In the EQ-5D-5L that will be used, participants may choose from the following five response levels: no problems=1; slight problems=2; moderate problems=3; severe problems=4; and unable to/extreme problems=5. Higher values indicate worst health.</description>
