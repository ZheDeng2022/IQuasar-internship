      Abstract Background: Ketamine has been introduced as one of the most common drugs,&#xD;
      administered to sedate children for different painful procedures in the emergency department&#xD;
      (ED) but administration in higher dosage causes some severe complications. Thus, the aim of&#xD;
      this study was to evaluate the effect of low-dose intravenous ketamine bolus versus&#xD;
      conventional injection for reduction of upper and lower extremity fractures in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 198 participants with upper and&#xD;
      lower extremity fractures were enrolled. The participants were divided randomly into two&#xD;
      groups. In the intervention group, ketamine 1% was administered rapidly at a dose of 0.5 mg /&#xD;
      kg (within 5 seconds), and in the control group, ketamine 1.5 mg / kg was slowly injected for&#xD;
      30 to 60 seconds. Then outcomes such as sedation depth and complications were measured for&#xD;
      every two minutes and satisfaction of participants and physicians were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Results showed that the successful sedation rate in the low dose ketamine group was&#xD;
      significantly lower, as compared to the control group (7% vs 100%) (p&lt;0.001). Moreover, In&#xD;
      terms of duration of drug effect and of recovery, the low dose ketamine group were&#xD;
      significantly lower compared with the group receiving higher dosage of ketamine (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
      Furthermore, the sedation depth based on Wisconsin Sedation Scale was significantly higher,&#xD;
      in the low dose ketamine group compared to the other group. By evaluating different&#xD;
      complications, we found that the rate of neurological (20.4 % vs 5%) and physiological (10.2%&#xD;
      vs 2%) complications in the control group was significantly higher compared to the group&#xD;
      receiving low-dose ketamine (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective double-blind clinical trial was conducted in the ED of Isfahan Al-Zahra&#xD;
      Hospital, from May 2016 to June 2017. The sedation levels and different outcomes of patients&#xD;
      receiving low-dose intravenous ketamine bolus (intervention group) were compared to patients&#xD;
      receiving higher doses of intravenous ketamine (control group), for reduction of upper and&#xD;
      lower extremity fractures. Inclusion criteria consisted of parents' desire and consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study, body mass index (BMI) within the normal range, having age of 6&#xD;
      months to 17 years, requiring a reduction of upper and lower limb fractures, not receiving&#xD;
      benzodiazepines and other sedative drugs before intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria consisted of patients' age &lt;3 months with the body temperature of &gt; 38 ̊C,&#xD;
      due to upper respiratory tract infection. Patients having any other complications such as&#xD;
      cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, psychological and neurological were excluded from the&#xD;
      study. We also excluded the patients who have withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and Intervention The study flowchart is shown in figure 1. Two hundreds ten&#xD;
      patients with a diagnosis of upper and lower extremity fractures, diagnosed by Emergency&#xD;
      Medicine Specialist, were enrolled based on clinical and para-clinical images and inclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were randomly allocated into two groups, using a block randomization&#xD;
      procedure with matching subjects in each block based on sex and age. One hundred ninety eight&#xD;
      patients completed the study; including one hundred from the intervention group and 98 from&#xD;
      the control group. The study received ethics approval from the Ethics Committee of Isfahan&#xD;
      University of Medical Sciences (--------------), and all participants and their parents&#xD;
      signed the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, eligible patients were enrolled. All patients were&#xD;
      monitored by direct observation and continuous cardiovascular monitoring, in order to check&#xD;
      the vital signs and also by pulse Oximeters to examine the blood oxygen saturation level.&#xD;
