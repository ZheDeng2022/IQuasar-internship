    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, examiner-blind, 2-treatment parallel group study. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted at the Hebrew University, Hadassah, Israel. A sufficient number of subjects&#xD;
      will be screened to obtain approximately 200 generally healthy adult volunteers with mild to&#xD;
      moderate periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be stratified and randomly assigned equally to either the regimen group (AGE)&#xD;
      or a control group (Placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be requested to use the products at home for the duration of the study&#xD;
      according to the written and verbal usage instructions given to them during product&#xD;
      distribution. At Baseline, Month 6, 12, and 18 subjects will receive oral soft tissue exams,&#xD;
      and will have gingival inflammation, bleeding, and periodontal measurements made as described&#xD;
      in below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will receive supragingival dental prophylaxes every 6 month consistent with local&#xD;
      norms and standards. Products will be re-supplied approximately every six months following&#xD;
      Baseline. During study conduct, subjects with evidence of progressive periodontal disease (â‰¥3&#xD;
      mm increases in pocket depth, attachment loss or recession) will be exited from the study and&#xD;
      treated following local norms.&#xD;

      Study Objective The objective of this study is to assess the long-term efficacy of &quot;AGE among&#xD;
      on periodontitis for a period of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Study Design and Plan This is a randomized, controlled, examiner-blind, 2-treatment&#xD;
      parallel group study. The study will be conducted at the Hebrew University, Hadassah, Israel.&#xD;
      A sufficient number of subjects will be screened to obtain approximately 200 generally&#xD;
      healthy adult volunteers with mild to moderate periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be stratified and randomly assigned equally to either the regimen group (AGE)&#xD;
      or a control group (Placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be requested to use the products at home for the duration of the study&#xD;
      according to the written and verbal usage instructions given to them during product&#xD;
      distribution. At Baseline, Month 6, 12, and 18 subjects will receive oral soft tissue exams,&#xD;
      and will have gingival inflammation, bleeding, and periodontal measurements made as described&#xD;
      in below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will receive supragingival dental prophylaxes every 6 month consistent with local&#xD;
      norms and standards. Products will be re-supplied approximately every six months following&#xD;
      Baseline. During study conduct, subjects with evidence of progressive periodontal disease&#xD;
      will be exited from the study and treated following local norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/Baseline, Visit 1 Subjects will be asked to read and sign an informed consent and&#xD;
      receive a signed copy. Personal medical history information will be reviewed and retained as&#xD;
      site source documentation. A comprehensive oral examination (OST) will then be conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the oral and perioral region, including hard and soft tissues. Demographic&#xD;
      information and study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be obtained and documented on the&#xD;
      appropriate electronic case report form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, subjects will receive MGI, GBI, CAL, and PPD assessments in that order by the&#xD;
      experienced examiner. Subjects will be eligible to enroll in the study after meeting study&#xD;
      entrance criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to continue using their regular home oral hygiene products until&#xD;
      the Baseline visit. They will also be instructed not to add or change any of their regular&#xD;
      home oral hygiene products during that time. Data will be reviewed and qualified subjects&#xD;
      will be contacted and scheduled for their Baseline appointment. Those subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to refrain from performing any oral hygiene procedures the morning prior to their scheduled&#xD;
      Baseline visit and to refrain from using medicated lozenges, breath mints, eating, drinking&#xD;
      (except for water), smoking and chewing gum for four (4) hours prior to their visit. The rest&#xD;
      of the subjects will be released from the study, and a subject accountability form will be&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Comments, if applicable, will be documented on the appropriate CRF. Product&#xD;
      Distribution, Visit 2 Approximately maximum 1-2 weeks after the Screening/Baseline visit,&#xD;
      subjects will return to the site and continuance criteria will be verified. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to a treatment group based on their Screening mean PPD, GBI, age, gender and&#xD;
      tobacco use. Subjects will receive their assigned treatment products to use until their next&#xD;
      appointment in the clinic (approximately 6 month later). AEs and General Comments, if&#xD;
      applicable, will be documented. All data will be recorded electronically on the appropriate&#xD;
      CRFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately one week later, site staff not blinded to the products will re-connect to&#xD;
      subjects via phone to ensure proper product usage and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within one month from Baseline, subjects will receive a dental prophylaxis. Month-6, 12 Visit&#xD;
      3-4 Approximately 2 weeks before their scheduled visit, subjects will be contacted and&#xD;
      reminded about their appointment. Subjects will also be reminded to bring their study&#xD;
      products and to refrain from performing any oral hygiene procedures the morning prior to&#xD;
      their next scheduled visit. In addition, they will be reminded to refrain from using&#xD;
      medicated lozenges, breath mints, eating, drinking (except for water), smoking and chewing&#xD;
      gum for four (4) hours prior to their next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the site (6 month from Baseline) and continuance criteria will be&#xD;
      verified. Personal medical history information will be updated and retained as site source&#xD;
      documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive oral examination will then be conducted to evaluate the oral and perioral&#xD;
      region, including hard and soft tissues. Subjects will receive a MGI, GBI, CAL, and PPD&#xD;
      assessment by the experienced examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following that, subjects will proceed to an area separated from the examination area to&#xD;
      ensure blinding of the examiner to the identity of the test products and receive their&#xD;
      supplemental kit box containing re-supply of their assigned treatment products. They will be&#xD;
      asked to continue to use them for their daily oral hygiene twice per day until their next&#xD;
      appointment in the clinic (approximately 6 month later). Instructions for home use and a&#xD;
      reminder to comply with the study protocol will be given verbally by the site staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEs and General Comments, if applicable, will be documented. All data will be recorded&#xD;
      electronically on the appropriate CRFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within one month from Month-6 visit, subjects will receive a dental prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month-18, Visit 5 Approximately 2 weeks before their scheduled visit, subjects will be&#xD;
      contacted and reminded about their appointment. Subjects will also be reminded to bring their&#xD;
      study products and to refrain from performing any oral hygiene procedures the morning prior&#xD;
      to their next scheduled visit. In addition, they will be reminded to refrain from using&#xD;
      medicated lozenges, breath mints, eating, drinking (except for water), smoking and chewing&#xD;
      gum for four (4) hours prior to their next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the site (18 month from Baseline) and continuance criteria will be&#xD;
      verified. Personal medical history information will be updated and retained as site source&#xD;
      documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive oral examination will then be conducted to evaluate the oral and perioral&#xD;
      region, including hard and soft tissues. Subjects will receive a MGI, GBI, CAL, and PPD&#xD;
      assessment by the experienced examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEs and General Comments, if applicable, will be documented. Subject accountability will be&#xD;
      completed and subjects will be dismissed from the study. Subject accountability will also be&#xD;
      completed for subjects who drop out of the study prior to its completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be recorded electronically on the appropriate CRFs.&#xD;
