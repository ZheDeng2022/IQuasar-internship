    <textblock>
      Backgrounds： With the continuous improvement of sterilization and endoscopic structure, the&#xD;
      infection caused by endoscopy has gradually declined.With the rapid development of digestive&#xD;
      endoscopic therapy in the past decade, therapeutic endoscopy has been widely carried out&#xD;
      worldwide. These techniques have caused the mucous membrane or deeper damage to achieve the&#xD;
      goal of curing the disease. During therapeutic endoscopic procedures, endogenous bacteria may&#xD;
      be ectopic to the blood circulation due to mucosal or deeper damage. The endoscope is used to&#xD;
      in and out lumens multiple times, and the injections are injected into the tissues through&#xD;
      the accessories. These processes may bring the pathogenic bacteria from the patient's mouth&#xD;
      into the digestive tract through the endoscope and enter the blood through the damaged&#xD;
      mucosa. In addition, bacteremia associated with endoscopic procedures may cause bacterial&#xD;
      infections in distant organs (eg infective endocarditis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative infection rates can reach 12-22% . The results of the etiological culture show&#xD;
      that it is consistent with the bacteria of oral bacteria. It is possibly related to multiple&#xD;
      passage into the digestive tract of endoscopic and accessory . However, the endoscopic&#xD;
      operation process will inevitably lead to subsequent infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESD treatment involves endoscopic multiple access to the upper digestive tract through the&#xD;
      mouth, attachments and injection needles and other multiple exposure to the wound, so the&#xD;
      probability of postoperative infection is significantly higher than the average endoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators proposed to gargle patients with chlorhexidine acetate before ESD to improve&#xD;
      the oral microenvironment and reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the oral cavity, so as to&#xD;
      observe whether it can achieve the effect of preventing postoperative infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objectives: This study is a prospective randomized controlled study in single center of&#xD;
           Peking University Third Hospital. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the preventive&#xD;
           effect of chlorhexidine acetate gargle on the infection of early upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
           cancer after endoscopic ESD therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Calculation of sample size: According to the postoperative infection rate of 10%, 25%&#xD;
           improvement is given after the gargle is administered, and the error range is calculated&#xD;
           at 2%. The sample size needs 306 cases.&#xD;

      The investigator proposed to gargle patients with chlorhexidine acetate before ESD to improve&#xD;
      the oral microenvironment and reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the oral cavity. The main&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to evaluate the preventive effect of chlorhexidine acetate gargle on&#xD;
      the infection of early upper gastrointestinal cancer after endoscopic ESD therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diagnosis of early gastrointestinal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. in line with endoscopic ESD treatment indications&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. no limitation of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patients do not agree with the mouthwash&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient requested surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with early-stage upper gastrointestinal cancer diagnosed endoscopically in the&#xD;
           ivestigator's hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ESD indications evaluation: endoscopic ultrasonography was used to assess the depth of&#xD;
           lesion infiltration and surrounding lymph nodes. Abdominal or chest CT was used to&#xD;
           further evaluate local lymph nodes and distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with indications for treatment sign informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment programs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After the patient signed the informed consent, they will be divided into the&#xD;
           experimental group and control group according to random envelopes in accordance with&#xD;
           the sequence of patients were admitted. Patients in the treatment group are given twice&#xD;
           daily three days before endoscopic treatment.Patients in the controlled group will not&#xD;
           receive gargle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment of second-generation cephalosporins or levofloxacin (allergic cephalosporins)&#xD;
           intravenously half an hour before ESD procedure to prevent infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The main steps of ESD include: marking around the lesion, submucosal injection to fully&#xD;
           lift of the lesion, cutting the mucosa around the circumference, submucosal peeling to&#xD;
           completely separate the submucosa and the muscularis propria to achieve a complete&#xD;
           resection of the lesion, and checking the wound surface vessels and lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Monitor blood routine and body temperature changes on the first and third days after&#xD;
           treatment. If there are signs of infection in the clinic, monitor PCT and add&#xD;
           appropriate antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of sample size: According to the postoperative infection rate of 10%, 25%&#xD;
      improvement is given after the gargle is administered, and the error range is calculated at&#xD;
      2%. The sample size needs 306 cases.&#xD;
