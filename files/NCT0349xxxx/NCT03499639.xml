      Management of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) related liver disease with concomitant&#xD;
      co-morbidity was challenging, especially in the period before the era of new direct-acting&#xD;
      antiviral (DAA) agents. With the introduction of DAAs protocols, the therapeutic options were&#xD;
      expanded to endorse many patients that were previously assigned as difficult-to-treat&#xD;
      population. Different situations were encountered with co-infection with HCV such as chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD) with its spectrum from mild forms to the end-stage kidney disease&#xD;
      (ESKD), patients on hemodialysis (HD), and in post-renal transplant settings. Till now,&#xD;
      pooled data about the safety and efficacy of different DAAs regimens in different renal&#xD;
      situations are still under evaluation, especially in Egypt, where HCV genotype 4 the most&#xD;
      dominating genotype. In Egypt, there were two adopted protocols for patients with HCV and&#xD;
      CKD; the sofosbuvir-based combinations and the ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus&#xD;
      ribavirin-based combination. Sofosbuvir was proved to be contraindicated in patients with&#xD;
      end-stage renal diseases as its elimination based mainly on renal route that may affect its&#xD;
      bioavailability. On the other hand, ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus ribavirin&#xD;
      regimen was proved to be a well-tolerated protocol in non-cirrhotic patients with CKD.&#xD;

      Introduction Management of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) related liver disease with&#xD;
      concomitant co-morbidity was challenging, especially in the period before the era of new&#xD;
      direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents. With the introduction of DAAs protocols, the&#xD;
      therapeutic options were expanded to endorse many patients that were previously assigned as&#xD;
      difficult-to-treat population [ ]. Different situations were encountered with co-infection&#xD;
      with HCV such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) with its spectrum from mild forms to the&#xD;
      end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), patients on hemodialysis (HD), and in post-renal transplant&#xD;
      settings [ , ]. Till now, pooled data about the safety and efficacy of different DAAs&#xD;
      regimens in different renal situations are still under evaluation [ ], especially in Egypt,&#xD;
      where HCV genotype 4 the most dominating genotype [ ]. In Egypt, there were two adopted&#xD;
      protocols for patients with HCV and CKD; the sofosbuvir-based combinations and the&#xD;
      ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus ribavirin-based combination [5, ]. Sofosbuvir&#xD;
      was proved to be contraindicated in patients with end-stage renal diseases as its elimination&#xD;
      based mainly on renal route that may affect its bioavailability [ ]. On the other hand,&#xD;
      ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus ribavirin regimen was proved to be a&#xD;
      well-tolerated protocol in non-cirrhotic patients with CKD [6, ].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim Therefore, we herein, tried to evaluate a real-life practice to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus ribavirin regimen in patients with&#xD;
      ESKD, with or without hemodialysis in Egyptian based multicenter cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting from July 2017, a prospective multicenter cohort study was designed to enroll all&#xD;
      consecutive patients presented at the Viral Hepatitis Management Outpatient Clinic at Assiut&#xD;
      University Hospital, South Valley University Hospital, Sohag University Hospital, Egypt, with&#xD;
      proven CHC genotype 4 and concomitant ESKD with or without hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients were 18 years old or more, naive to HCV treatment, HCV genotype 4, and&#xD;
      compensated liver disease. Patients with combined HCV/HBV co-infection, hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC), decompensated liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score above 6), and non-genotype 4&#xD;
      were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ESKD was based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) that calculated by the&#xD;
           Cockroft-Gault equation [ , ].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two sets of patients: ESKD-group; eGFR less than between 59-30 ml/min without&#xD;
           hemodialysis and HD-group; eGFR less than 30 ml/min with or without hemodialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCV Treatment Response: sustained virologic response was defined as HCV RNA under the&#xD;
           detection limit at week 12 after the end of treatment (SVR12), non-responder was defined&#xD;
           as a detectable viremia at week 12, and relapse was defined as re-appearance of HCV&#xD;
           viremia during follow up after being undetectable at week 12 [ ].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methods and follow up protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver disease-status was assessed before therapy by Child-Turcotte Pugh (CTP) score [ ]&#xD;
           and liver stiffness score measurements by FibroscanÂ® (EchoSens, Paris, France) in&#xD;
           kilopascals (kPa) according to the manufacturer's instructions (score less than 7.4 kPa&#xD;
           equal to F0-F2, 9.5-12.4 kPa equal to F3, and 14.5 kPa or greater equal to F4 on METAVIR&#xD;
           pathologic scoring system) [ , ].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCV genotype assessment by direct sequencing of the 50 untranslated region (50UTR),&#xD;
           using RT-PCR-based assay (AmpliSens HCV-genotype-FRT PCR kit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCV RNA was measured using the Roche COBAS Taq Man HCV assay version 2.0 (lower limit of&#xD;
           detection 15 IU/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In all patients, hematologic (hemoglobin level) liver (CTP score parameters), renal&#xD;
           (eGFR), and virologic (HCV-RNA viremia), and the co-medications such as&#xD;
           immunosuppressive drugs (doses and levels), were evaluated at base-line (week0), at&#xD;
           weeks 4, 12 during therapy, and week 24 after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCV Medications &amp; protocols (Figure 1)[according to the National Committee for Control of&#xD;
      Viral Hepatitis (NCCVH)]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with eGFR between 59-30ml/min: a co-formula of ombitasvir (OBV; 25mg)/&#xD;
           paritaprevir (PTV; 150mg)/ ritonavir (r; 100mg) (OBV/PTV/r) once-daily plus ribavirin&#xD;
           (RIB) was given for 12 weeks. Dose adjustment of RIB was made as follow: If eGFR was&#xD;
           30-59 ml/min, an alternating dosing of 200 mg and 400 mg daily; if eGFR 15-30 ml/min,&#xD;
           dosing was 200 mg once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on hemodialysis: a co-formula of OBV/PTV/r (25/150/100mg) once-daily plus RIB&#xD;
           200 mg 3 times/week, only in the days that they have their hemodialysis settings, 4&#xD;
           hours before the hemodialysis setting for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcome measures &amp; endpoints The primary endpoint was the achievement of SVR at week 12&#xD;
      (SVR12) post-treatment. The potential adverse events were evaluated in each visit for the&#xD;
      development of adverse events or any significant interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and ethical considerations Frequencies, percentages, and means were&#xD;
      used, as appropriate, for descriptive analysis. Chi Square test was used to compare&#xD;
      parametric qualitative data, while Mann-Whitney test was used to compare non-parametric&#xD;
      qualitative data and fisher exact test used to compare non-parametric qualitative data.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was conducted by SPSS (V.19, SPSS Inc.; Chicago, IL, USA). A p-value &lt;&#xD;
      0.05 was considered significant. The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee.&#xD;
