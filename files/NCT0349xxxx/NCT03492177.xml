  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to confirm the selexipag starting dose(s), selected based on&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) extrapolation from adults, that leads to similar exposure as adults&#xD;
      doses in children from greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 2 to less than (˂) 18 years of age with&#xD;
      Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH), by investigating the PK of selexipag and its active&#xD;
      metabolite ACT-333679 in this population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The selection of the starting dose for pediatric participants is based on the PK&#xD;
      extrapolation from adults, taking into account the children body weight category, in order to&#xD;
      lead to an exposure similar to that in adult PAH participants at a starting dose of 200&#xD;
      micrograms (mcg). As in adults, selexipag will be up-titrated to the individual maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (iMTD) during the first 12 weeks. Approximately 60 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in 3 different age cohorts to obtain at least 45 participants with evaluable PK&#xD;
      profiles: Cohort 1: &gt;= 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, Cohort 2: &gt;= 6 to &lt; 12 years of age, Cohort&#xD;
      3: &gt;= 2 to &lt; 6 years of age. In each age cohort the starting dose will depend on the body&#xD;
      weight. Enrollment will start with both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. After completion of PK&#xD;
      assessments in at least 15 participants from Cohort 1 at Week 12, a first interim analysis&#xD;
      will be conducted to establish the dose-exposure relationship using a population PK model.&#xD;
      The PK data from any participants in Cohort 2 who have completed their PK assessments at this&#xD;
      time will be included in this first interim analysis. Results of this model-based analysis&#xD;
      will be used to confirm or adjust the selexipag doses initially selected. Enrollment of&#xD;
      Cohort 3 (children &gt;= 2 to &lt; 6 years of age) will start once the appropriate doses have been&#xD;
      confirmed in a second interim analysis of PK data from Cohorts 1 and 2, and if there is no&#xD;
      safety concern based on review by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC).&#xD;

    <description>The first dose of selexipag (Uptravi) will be administered in the evening of Day 1 and will be based on the body weight. Thereafter selexipag will be administered twice daily (morning and evening). Selexipag will be up-titrated during the first 12 weeks, with weekly increments equal to the starting dose until the participants reach their individual maximum tolerated dose (iMTD) or until a maximum dose corresponding to their baseline weight category is achieved (which will be 8-fold of the corresponding starting dose). Up-titration is followed by a stable maintenance treatment period from Week 12 to Week 16, at the maximum tolerated dose. Thereafter, participants will be treated with selexipag as long as the treatment is beneficial to the participants, as per investigator's decision.</description>
