  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about whether or not little cigars and cigarillos cause or maintain addiction,&#xD;
      and if flavors, such as fruit, make them more addictive. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      understand the addiction potential of little cigars and cigarillos compared to cigarettes in&#xD;
      young adults who smoke both products. This study will also look at the differences between&#xD;
      men and women. In the rest of this form, little cigars or cigarillos will be referred to as&#xD;
      LCCs.&#xD;
