  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to generate data for the investigation of absorption,&#xD;
      distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME) processes of pracinostat in humans, as well&#xD;
      as generating samples for metabolite profiling and structural identification. The mass&#xD;
      balance recovery of pracinostat following administration of [14C]-pracinostat will be&#xD;
      assessed, as well as metabolite profiling and identification of pracinostat in healthy male&#xD;
      subjects. In addition, this study will provide further PK and safety data in healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
