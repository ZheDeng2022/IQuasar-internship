  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2 study is intended to investigate the safety, tolerability, and radiation&#xD;
      dosimetry of 177Lu-PSMA-R2 and further assess preliminary efficacy data in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The Phase 1 portion of the study&#xD;
      will determine the recommended dose of 177Lu-PSMA-R2 for radio-ligand therapy (RLT) of mCRPC,&#xD;
      and the Phase 2 portion will expand into approximately 60 patients documenting the&#xD;
      preliminary activity (anti-tumor response) of repeated treatments administered, continuing&#xD;
      safety assessments and collecting QoL data.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Based on the totality of the available data, the Safety Review Board (SRB) recommendation&#xD;
      Novartis has decided to halt recruitment for PROter A206T-G01-001 (NCT03490838) and not&#xD;
      initiate the phase II expansion portion of the study. Importantly, this recruitment halt is&#xD;
      not a consequence of any safety concern. The treatment of the patients currently enrolled&#xD;
      will continue according to protocol with the 1 year safety follow-up and subsequent 4 years&#xD;
      of survival follow-up.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Prior to dosing on Day 1 and every 12 weeks until 1 year after disease progression or early study termination whichever comes first</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 contains 30 questions assessed by the participant. There are 9 multiple-item scales: 5 scales that assess aspects of functioning (physical, role functioning, cognitive, emotional, and social); 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea and Vomiting); and a global health status/Quality of Life (QOL) scale. There are 5 single-item measures assessing additional symptoms (i.e., dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea) and a single item concerning perceived financial impact of the disease. All but two questions have 4 point scales ranging from &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot;Very much.&quot; The two questions concerning global health status/ QOL have 7 point scales with ratings ranging from &quot;Very poor&quot; to &quot;Excellent.&quot; For each of the 14 domains, final scores are transformed such that they range from 0-100, where higher scores indicate improvement.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-PR25 is a prostate cancer module for the assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). It consists of 25 questions distributed on 6 domains: urinary symptoms (8 items), incontinence aid (1 item), bowel symptoms (4 items), hormonal treatment-related symptoms (HTRS) (6 items), sexual activity (2 items), and sexual functioning (4 items). Questions use a 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'). All raw domain scores are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores reflecting either more symptoms (urinary, bowel, hormonal treatment-related symptoms) or higher levels of activity or functioning (sexual).</description>
