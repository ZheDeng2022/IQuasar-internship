    <textblock>
      This is a single-institution phase II trial of Durvalumab combined with Radiation Therapy&#xD;
      (RT) for metastatic pancreatic cancer patients who have progressed through first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Pancreatic cancer patients who have received second-line or greater&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the metastatic setting are not eligible. Target accrual is 39 patients.&#xD;
      Durvalumab 1500 mg (or 20 mg/m2 if &lt;30 kg) IV every 4 weeks will be started and continued&#xD;
      during RT and afterwards until the patient experiences either unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      disease progression, whichever comes first. Patients must have at least three&#xD;
      radiographically measurable pancreatic cancer lesions in different organs that have not&#xD;
      previously received RT, two of which will receive RT. Eligible lesions include either the&#xD;
      primary pancreatic tumor in unresected patients or distant metastatic lesions. Three&#xD;
      fractions of 8 Gy each will be prescribed to one lesion during Week 3. Three fractions of 8&#xD;
      Gy each will be prescribed to the second lesion during Week 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-arm trial with continuous monitoring of acute non-hematologic toxicity with&#xD;
      the primary endpoint of progression free survival. Efficacy will be evaluated by time to&#xD;
      progression or death, whichever comes first, and compared to historical control of&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone as reported in the literature.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biopsy-proven metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with progression through standard&#xD;
             first-line chemotherapy. Chemotherapy given as part of prior chemoradiation does not&#xD;
             count as a line of therapy. Chemotherapy given as part of prior chemoradiation in the&#xD;
             setting of non-metastatic pancreatic cancer does not count as a line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 3 radiographically distinct pancreatic cancer lesions that are measurable by&#xD;
             RECIST 1.1 criteria, including 2 that are eligible for RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lesions that will receive RT are separated by ≥3 cm and none &gt;7 cm in greatest&#xD;
             dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of ≥12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver and kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate blood cell count.&#xD;
