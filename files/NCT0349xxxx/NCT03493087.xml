  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that patients with chronic kidney disease in hemodialysis have a low&#xD;
      vitamin K status which is believed to be related to an increased risk of atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      increased bleeding tendency. The underlying causes of low vitamin K status in hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients is unknown. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate why hemodialysis patients&#xD;
      have a low vitamin K status and how to improve it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is composed of five trials. Four of them are based on possible hypotheses to the&#xD;
      low vitamin K status. The hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The daily intake of vitamin K is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vitamin K is removed from the blood during dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Absorption in the intestines is impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The analysis method (dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP) is influenced by the patients'&#xD;
           protein intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the fifth trial is to investigate solutions to improve the vitamin K status of&#xD;
      hemodialysis. One is to improve vitamin K status through diet with an increased focus on&#xD;
      foods with high concentrations of vitamin K while considering phosphate, potassium and fluid&#xD;
      restrictions. The second is to increase vitamin K status through a daily supplement of 360µg&#xD;
      Menakinon-7.&#xD;

      Studies have reported a low vitamin K status in chronic kidney disease patients in&#xD;
      hemodialysis linked to an increased risk of atherosclerosis and increased bleeding tendency.&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate the underlying causes of the reported low&#xD;
      vitamin K status and to improve the patients' vitamin K status through diet and supplement.&#xD;
      The study is divided in 5 sub-trials listed below. Sub-trial 1-4 focuses on determining the&#xD;
      underlying course of low vitamin K status while sub-trial 5 deals with possible solutions to&#xD;
      the reported low vitamin K status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis method used to determine vitamin K status is dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated&#xD;
      Matrix-Gla-Protein (dp-ucMGP). Dp-ucMGP is the inactive form of the protein MGP whose&#xD;
      activation is vitamin K dependent. The dp-ucMGP analysis method is not a direct measure of&#xD;
      vitamin K status. However, an increased concentration of dp-ucMGP is a manifestation of a low&#xD;
      vitamin K status and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-trial 1: Intake of vitamin K Aim: To assess the patients' intake of vitamin K.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The daily intake of vitamin K is insufficient. Method: Patients are asked to fill&#xD;
      out a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The FFQ is based on their intake of different foods&#xD;
      rich in vitamin K during the last month. To compare the results from the FFQ with their&#xD;
      actual vitamin K status a blood sample is collected and analyzed to determine dp-ucMGP.&#xD;
      Participants: 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-trial 2: The influence of dialysis Aim: To examine whether vitamin K status is&#xD;
      compromised during dialysis. Hypothesis: Vitamin K is removed from the blood during dialysis.&#xD;
      Method: A blood test is collected before and after dialysis and analyzed to determine&#xD;
      dp-ucMGP. At the end of the dialysis a sample of the remaining dialysis-water is collected&#xD;
      and analyzed to determine dp-ucMGP. Furthermore, the patients will be weighed before and&#xD;
      after dialysis with the purpose of calculating concentrations. Participants: 16 (the analysis&#xD;
      of the dialysis water is done for five patients at first, if the results are useful the&#xD;
      analysis is done for every participant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-trial 3: Absorption Aim: To investigate whether a decreased absorption can be the cause&#xD;
      of the low vitamin K status. Hypothesis: Absorption in the intestines is impaired. Method: A&#xD;
      D-xylose test is performed. The participants are given a dose of 15g D-xylose dissolved in&#xD;
      water and after one hour a sample of blood is collected to determine D-xylose in serum. Prior&#xD;
      to this trial the patients need to be fasting.The patients are asked to fill out a FFQ&#xD;
      concerning their intake of fat during the last month. Participants: 16&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-trial 4: Concentrations of dp-ucMGP is influenced by a low protein intake. Aim: To&#xD;
      determine if a low protein intake influence the dp-ucMGP analysis method. Hypothesis: The&#xD;
      analysis method (dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP) is influenced by the patients' protein&#xD;
      intake. Method: Patients are given a daily protein supplement for 14 days. Before and after&#xD;
      the intervention a blood test is collected and the concentration of dp-ucMGP is determined&#xD;
      and compared. Moreover, the patients are asked to fill out a FFQ concerning their intake of&#xD;
      protein during the last month. Participants: 16&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-trial 5: Intervention with vitamin K Aim: To investigate whether a diet or supplement&#xD;
      with tablets is best for improve vitamin K status. Hypothesis: If the intake of vitamin K is&#xD;
      insufficient the diet rich in vitamin K should be sufficient. However, if absorption is&#xD;
      compromised or vitamin K is influenced by dialysis a larger dose of vitamin K might be&#xD;
      necessary. Method: This trial lasts for 15 weeks divided in two periods of six weeks and a&#xD;
      three week wash out period in-between. One period focuses on a diet rich in vitamin K while&#xD;
      dealing with the possible restrictions on phosphate, potassium and fluid for hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients. The intervention in the other period consists of a supplement of 360μg&#xD;
      Menakinon-7/day. Blood samples are collected at the beginning, middle and end of both&#xD;
      periods. These blood samples are analyzed to determine dp-uc-MGP during the intervention&#xD;
      period. Moreover, coagulations factor 2, 7, 10, vitamin A and D status and calcification&#xD;
      propency score analysis will be done as well if the funds allow it. Patients are asked to&#xD;
      fill out a questionnaire concerning physical and mental wellbeing and the presence of&#xD;
      bruising at the beginning and end of both periods to determine whether vitamin K has an&#xD;
      effect. Participants: 24&#xD;
