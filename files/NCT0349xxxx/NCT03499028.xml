  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      JointCOACH is a web-based communication platform that enables joint replacement patients to&#xD;
      communicate with their care team via computer or smartphone throughout their episode of care,&#xD;
      from the time that surgery is scheduled until at least 90 days postoperatively.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive the following information at key intervals: 1) instructions about how&#xD;
      to prepare for surgery, 2) information about the procedure, 3) information about medications&#xD;
      and pain control, 4) information about postoperative recovery and rehabilitation. In&#xD;
      addition, several surveys will be distributed using JointCOACH to keep patients involved in&#xD;
      their own recovery and to keep the surgical team informed of their progress. The proposed&#xD;
      research will help determine if JointCOACH can improve patient satisfaction and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
