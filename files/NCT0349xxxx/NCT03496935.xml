      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to examine whether tunneled dialysis&#xD;
      catheters should be first-line for acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy&#xD;
      (AKI-RRT) in the critical care setting, barring any clinical contraindications, compared to&#xD;
      non-tunneled access. This randomized controlled trial will include patients admitted to an&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). The investigators will&#xD;
      randomize all eligible consented incident patients with AKI requiring renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy either to tunneled dialysis catheter or non-tunneled dialysis catheter placement. The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria encompasses all adult patients in the BWH ICUs with an incident AKI&#xD;
      requiring renal replacement therapy. The investigators' hypothesis is that the rate of&#xD;
      overall complications is lower with tunneled dialysis catheters compared to non-tunneled&#xD;
      catheters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by an abrupt decrease in kidney function resulting in&#xD;
      the retention of urea and other nitrogenous waste products and in the dysregulation of&#xD;
      extracellular volume and electrolytes. AKI is common, harmful and potentially treatable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite decades of research, renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the form of dialysis remains&#xD;
      the primary therapy to treat AKI and its complications. Due to convenience of scheduling and&#xD;
      distribution of expertise, non-tunneled dialysis catheters have generally been the first-line&#xD;
      source of vascular access for patients requiring acute dialysis for AKI in the ICU setting.&#xD;
      However, there is evidence that tunneled dialysis catheters are associated with improved&#xD;
      outcomes compared to non-tunneled dialysis catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators for this proposed trial performed an observational study at Brigham and&#xD;
      Women's Hospital in 2016 comparing outcomes from temporary dialysis catheter versus tunneled&#xD;
      dialysis catheter use for renal replacement therapy in the ICU.12 They found that there was a&#xD;
      significant increase in median venous and arterial access pressure between temporary dialysis&#xD;
      catheters and tunneled dialysis catheters for patients on CVVH with an increased rate ratio&#xD;
      of interruptions and decreased blood flow rates for temporary dialysis catheters compared to&#xD;
      tunneled dialysis catheters&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now propose a prospective randomized controlled trial to examine whether&#xD;
      tunneled dialysis catheters should be first-line for AKI-RRT in the critical care setting,&#xD;
      barring any clinical contraindications, compared to non-tunneled access. This RCT will&#xD;
      include patients admitted to an ICU at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The investigators will&#xD;
      randomize all eligible consented incident patients with AKI requiring renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy either to tunneled dialysis catheter or non-tunneled dialysis catheter placement. The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria encompasses all adult patients in the BWH ICUs with an incident AKI&#xD;
      requiring renal replacement therapy. Exclusion criteria will include 1) clinical instability&#xD;
      requiring bedside catheter placement; 2) international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;2.0 or other&#xD;
      significant coagulopathy; 3) pending blood cultures within 48 hours or active bacteremia; or&#xD;
      4) urgency of line placement warranting placement within 6 hours. To avoid bias introduced by&#xD;
      operator performance, the same group of interventional nephrologists will be utilized to&#xD;
      place the catheters in both arms of the trial. The investigators' hypothesis is that the rate&#xD;
      of overall complications is lower with tunneled dialysis catheters compared to non-tunneled&#xD;
      catheters. Other secondary outcomes of interest include dialysis delivery parameters&#xD;
      including access pressures and blood flow rates. The investigators also plan to assessing the&#xD;
      feasibility of tunneled dialysis catheter placement for AKI, by capturing data on time to&#xD;
      placement, resource utilization and cost. The proposal challenges a common clinical practice;&#xD;
      placement of non-tunneled catheters for RRT initiation, which is not evidence-based, to&#xD;
      determine if tunneled catheters can improve outcomes for patients compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will identify all patients with AKI requiring vascular access by reviewing&#xD;
      inpatient renal consult patient lists and electronic orders for intermittent hemodialysis&#xD;
      (IHD) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) initiation. Data will be prospectively&#xD;
      collected on demographics, comorbidities, laboratory data, and microbiology results on a&#xD;
      daily basis. Data will also be abstracted from procedure notes to identify procedural&#xD;
      complications. Similarly, CVVH and IHD data (blood flow rates, venous and arterial pressures,&#xD;
      total time of RRT per session, and number of interruptions during RRT) will be gathered&#xD;
      prospectively on a daily basis from RRT flowsheets and RRT nursing notes. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed throughout the entirety of the hospitalization until hospital discharge or death.&#xD;
