      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumors almost always return after treatment. When that happens the&#xD;
      tumor can never completely be removed by surgery, so most people also receive drugs.&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if combining the drugs nivolumab and BMS-986016 may help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how nivolumab affects the brain s immune system in people who have had glioblastoma&#xD;
      brain tumors return. To study how nivolumab and BMS-986016 affect brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 and older who have had a return of GBM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cheek swab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart, blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest x-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Participants will lie on a table that slides in&#xD;
      and out of a cylinder in a strong magnetic field. A contrast agent will be injected in an arm&#xD;
      vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the hospital. They will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have surgery. A tube will be inserted into the back. Brain tumor and bone marrow samples will&#xD;
      be taken. Tubes will be inserted into the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have a computed tomography brain scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stay in Intensive Care (ICU) 7 days. Fluid from the brain and back will be collected every&#xD;
      few hours. In the ICU, participants will get nivolumab by IV for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have surgery to remove the tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have standard surgery to remove as much of the GBM as possible. Bone marrow will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After leaving the hospital, participants will have visits every 2 weeks to get the study&#xD;
      drugs by IV and have physical exams and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a brain MRI once a month.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is being performed to 1) characterize the clinical and 2) immunological&#xD;
      response of patients with recurrent glioblastoma to treatment with Nivolumab, together with&#xD;
      an anti-Lag-3 antibody, BMS-986016, and to evaluate the safety of brain tumor microdialysis&#xD;
      in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 patients (total, after replacement for any dropout), 18 years old and older with&#xD;
      recurrence of glioblastoma after standard treatment of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened by study neurosurgeons or neuro-oncologists to verify their&#xD;
      confirmed or likely diagnosis of a recurrent glioblastoma. Patients will be offered standard&#xD;
      of care therapy, including repeat surgery and/or recommendations for chemotherapeutic agents&#xD;
      and other trials. If the patients are deemed to be surgical candidates for their potential&#xD;
      recurrence, they will be enrolled in the trial. Enrolled patients will then undergo a&#xD;
      stereotactic brain biopsy. If a frozen section confirms a diagnosis of recurrent&#xD;
      glioblastoma, two microdialysis catheters will be placed in the brain after the biopsy, and a&#xD;
      lumbar drain will also be placed. These microdialysis catheters will sample interstitial&#xD;
      fluid in and around the brain tumor every 6 hours. We will collect blood and cerebral spinal&#xD;
      fluid samples daily for comparison. After two days (Day 3), the patients will be given one&#xD;
      dose of Nivolumab, 240mg IV. We will continue to collect samples every six hours from the&#xD;
      microdialysis catheters and daily from blood and cerebral spinal fluid for 5 additional days,&#xD;
      after which patients will undergo surgical resection of their tumors and removal of the&#xD;
      microdialysis catheters and lumbar drain. Nivolumab, at a dose of 240mg IV over 30 minutes&#xD;
      every 2 weeks, will be administered after surgery (starting on Day 17(+/- 2 days), two weeks&#xD;
      after the first dose on Day 3) followed by BMS 986016, an anti-Lag-3 antibody at a dose of&#xD;
      80mg IV over 60 minutes, until the study neuroradiologist notes tumor progression on MRI or&#xD;
      the patient experiences treatment toxicity. While on therapy with Nivolumab and BMS-986016,&#xD;
      patients will be seen and examined every 2 weeks +/- two days for signs of toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed for at least three months after the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures are the proportion of patients who have a measurable increase of&#xD;
      interferon gamma levels in the brain tumor tissue after their first dose of Nivolumab as&#xD;
      compared to the pre-treatment baseline, the safety of using brain tumor microdialysis to&#xD;
      monitor response to immune modulators in patients with recurrent glioblastoma and the safety&#xD;
      of the combination of Nivolumab and BMS-986016. Exploratory outcome measures include: 1) To&#xD;
      determine the change in interferon gamma production within the tumor microenvironment and in&#xD;
      the rest of the body from before and after therapy with the immune checkpoint inhibitor,&#xD;
      nivolumab; 2) To evaluate the pathological response of the immune microenvironment of brain&#xD;
      tumor tissue to the first dose of Nivolumab; 3) To evaluate the clinical response&#xD;
      (progression free survival, overall survival) of recurrent glioblastoma patients to this&#xD;
      treatment combination; 4) To describe the difference in survival between responders and&#xD;
      non-responders on this treatment combination; 5) To examine the differences in the immune&#xD;
      cells and secreted factors of the tumor environment as compared to the immune cells and&#xD;
      secreted factors of the cerebral spinal fluid, blood and, potentially, bone marrow in&#xD;
      response to this treatment.&#xD;
