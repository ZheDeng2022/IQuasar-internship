    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple&#xD;
      ascending doses and effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of a novel antimalarial drug in&#xD;
      healthy adults. The study will enroll 104 healthy volunteers, males and females, aged 18 to&#xD;
      45 years and will consists of 3 parts: Part 1, Single Ascending Dose (SAD); Part 2, Multiple&#xD;
      Ascending Dose (MAD); and Part 3, Food Effect. Part 2 and Part 3 may be initiated after a&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) review and approval of the of Part 1 safety data. Study&#xD;
      duration will be 16 months with patient participation duration 14 days for SAD and Food&#xD;
      Effect, and 18 days for MAD. The primary objectives of this study are to: 1) assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of single doses of DM1157 at levels ranging from 9 mg to 900 mg; 2)&#xD;
      assess the safety and tolerability of DM1157 administered as single daily doses for 3 days at&#xD;
      levels ranging from 150 mg to 900 mg; 3) assess the safety and tolerability of DM1157&#xD;
      administered with or without food.&#xD;

      This is a first-in-humans, phase 1, randomized, double-blind, single-site, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study in 104 healthy volunteers, males and females, aged 18 to 45 years inclusive. The study&#xD;
      will consists of 3 parts: Part 1, Single Ascending Dose (SAD) - participants will be&#xD;
      administered a single dose (ranges from 9 mg to 900 mg) of DM1157 orally after fasting or a&#xD;
      matching placebo; Part 2, Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) - participants will be administered&#xD;
      three doses (ranges from 150 mg to 900 mg) of DM1157 orally once daily for three days after&#xD;
      fasting or a matching placebo; and Part 3, Food Effect - participants will be administered&#xD;
      300 mg of DM1157 orally with high fat meal or a matching placebo. Part 2 and Part 3 may be&#xD;
      initiated after a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) review and approval of the of Part 1&#xD;
      safety data. Study duration will be 16 months with patient participation duration 14 days for&#xD;
      SAD and Food Effect, and 18 days for MAD. The primary objectives of this study are to: 1)&#xD;
      assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of DM1157 at levels ranging from 9 mg to&#xD;
      900 mg; 2) assess the safety and tolerability of DM1157 administered as single daily doses&#xD;
      for 3 days at levels ranging from 150 mg to 900 mg; 3) assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      DM1157 administered with or without food. The secondary objectives are to: 1) assess the PK&#xD;
      of single doses of DM1157 at levels ranging from 9 mg to 900 mg, including dose&#xD;
      proportionality; 2) assess the PK of DM1157 administered as single daily doses for 3 days at&#xD;
      levels ranging from 150 mg to 900 mg; 3) assess the PK of 300 mg DM1157 administered with or&#xD;
      without food, including determination of the presence or absence of a food effect on&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
