  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of MSC-1. MSC-1 is a&#xD;
      first-in-class, humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1) which binds to the immunosuppressive&#xD;
      human cytokine Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), and is intended to treat adult patients with&#xD;
      Advanced Solid Tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part 1, multiple dose levels of MSC-1 in patients with Advanced Solid Tumors will be&#xD;
      studied to determine the recommended dose for further evaluation of safety and efficacy in&#xD;
      Part 2.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      MSC-1 is a first-in-class, humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1) which binds to the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive human cytokine Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), and is intended to treat&#xD;
      adult patients with advanced solid tumors. LIF is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in many&#xD;
      physiological and pathological processes including the promotion of an immunosuppressive&#xD;
      environment. In cancer, it is hypothesized that LIF expressing malignancies co-opt this&#xD;
      activity, creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment as well as promoting the&#xD;
      activity of cancer-initiating cell(s) (CICs). LIF is highly expressed in a subset of tumors&#xD;
      across multiple solid tumor types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During dose escalation, patients with Advanced Solid Tumors will be treated with MSC-1 with&#xD;
      the primary objective of determining the safety and tolerability of MSC-1 and defining an&#xD;
      appropriate dose for further evaluation in dose expansion. MSC-1 will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or&#xD;
      study termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In dose expansion, up to 4 parallel cohorts of patients with LIF-High tumors (NSCLC, Ovarian&#xD;
      Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer), and a cohort of mixed Solid Tumors (referred to as the &quot;basket&#xD;
      cohort&quot;), may be treated at the recommended expansion dose to further characterize the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, PK, PD and anti-tumor activity of MSC-1.&#xD;
