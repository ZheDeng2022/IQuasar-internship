  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there are no published data on the role of melatonin supplementation or the&#xD;
      appropriate dose for patients with multiple sclerosis. Because of the potential benefits of&#xD;
      melatonin, this pilot study will be an exploratory investigation to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      supplementing melatonin in subjects with multiple sclerosis who are taking an oral disease&#xD;
      modifying therapy (DMT) for 6 months or longer. It is our intent that the results of this&#xD;
      study will support the rationale and be a prelude to a larger trial which can focus on&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of melatonin therapy outcomes.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the change in 24 hour urinary&#xD;
      6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6SMT) collected for 24 hours in two twelve hour sessions. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to evaluate the change in serum morning melatonin level. In addition, quality&#xD;
      of life (QOL) measures will be assessed including the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS),&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).&#xD;
      Clinical objectives include the number of relapses during the trial and a change in the&#xD;
      Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) &amp; Performance Scales (PS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study is a one-year randomized, rater- and dose-blinded trial evaluating the&#xD;
      potential role of melatonin in subjects with relapsing multiple sclerosis who have been&#xD;
      taking a stable dose of an oral disease modifying therapy (DMT) for at least 6 months. The&#xD;
      oral DMTs include dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, teriflunomide, diroximel fumarate,&#xD;
      siponimod, and ozanimod. Thirty subjects with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis who meet&#xD;
      all of the eligibility criteria will be enrolled at Providence Neurological Specialties in&#xD;
      Portland, Oregon.&#xD;

    <description>Changes in the MFIS: Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) is a PRO, consisting of 21 statements that describe the effect of fatigue. Subject will choose an answer (0= never to 4=always) that best describes how fatigue has affected them in the past 4 weeks. Item scores are summed to a total score. The total MFIS score ranges from 0 to 84. Higher scores indicate higher level of fatigue.</description>

    <description>Changes in the MSIS-29: Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS) is a patient reported outcome (PRO) measure, consisting of two subscales- physical impact of MS (20 items) and psychological impact (9 items). It asks subject to rate the impact MS has their daily life in the past 2 weeks (1=low impact to 4=large impact). Scores from individual items are summed to a total score. Physical impact score ranges from 20-80 and psychological impact scores ranges from 9-36. Higher scores indicate greater impact of MS on QoL.</description>

    <description>Changes in PSQI: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) asks 10 sets of questions about sleep quality and pattern in the past month. The scale derive 7 component scores based on a 0 to 3 scale (0= no difficulty, 3=severe difficulty) which are summed to a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicates worse sleep quality.</description>
