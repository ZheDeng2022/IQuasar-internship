    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether there is a performance enhancing effect associated with&#xD;
      hydrating with coconut water. There have been only two studies in the past that have examined&#xD;
      this phenomenon, however these studies have limitations due to their design parameters.&#xD;
      Kalman et al. (2012) &quot;.... while treadmill time to exhaustion is routinely used in laboratory&#xD;
      studies, the use of a time trial test as the measure of exercise performance may be more&#xD;
      appropriate.&quot; While Peart et al. (2016) stated: &quot;limitations to the exercise protocol&#xD;
      employed here may have contributed to the absence of a performance improvement with coconut&#xD;
      water.&quot;&#xD;

      Purpose The purpose of the study is to determine whether hydrating with coconut water during&#xD;
      a game-simulated, basketball-specific training session can enhance performance. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that coconut water will provide an ergogenic effect for basketball players.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample The sample will include 20 varsity basketball players, male and female, ranging in age&#xD;
      from 18-35 who volunteer to participate in the study. This sample size is justified assuming&#xD;
      a standard deviation of 1.5 based on previous studies and using a power of 80% with the&#xD;
      statistical significance of 0.05 the resulting n would be 2(1.5)^2*(0.84+1.96)^2/5=7 (Kadam,&#xD;
      P., &amp; Bhalerao, S. (2010). Sample size calculation. International journal of Ayurveda&#xD;
      research, 1(1), 55). To account for dropouts, 10 participants will be recruited for each&#xD;
      group. Participants will be required to have no history of kidney problems. All individuals&#xD;
      must give written informed consent in order to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      include not being a varsity basketball player, being younger than 18 or older than 35, or&#xD;
      having a history of kidney problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be explicitly stated throughout the recruitment&#xD;
      process. Potential participants will be recruited through first contacting the Men's and&#xD;
      Women's Head Basketball Coaches of Western University and obtaining approval of collaboration&#xD;
      from the team. Players will then be in direct contact with Reed Zehr to gain information of&#xD;
      study. After given the study details, individuals will be given up to 3 days to determine if&#xD;
      they want to participate and give their informed consent. See attached form in the consent&#xD;
      section of the ethics application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement: All players will perform two sessions of a 10 minute BSST (Basketball Specific&#xD;
      Skills Test) which will represent the 1st and 2nd quarter respectively. Field Goal Attempts&#xD;
      (FGA) (#), Field Goals Made (FGM) (#), Field Goal Percentage (FGP) (%) will be measured from&#xD;
      the free-throw line, mid-range and three point distances during the BSST. A dribbling drill&#xD;
      will be used as well and number of dribbles (#) will be measured. All players will then&#xD;
      perform two sessions of a 10 minute BEST (Basketball Exercise Simulation Test) test which&#xD;
      will represent the 3rd and 4th quarter of a basketball game. Total distance covered (m), Mean&#xD;
      circuit completion time (s), mean sprint time (s), and total sprint decrement (%) will be&#xD;
      measured during the BEST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol: On test days, participants will report to he Gym at 0600 h after a 12 h overnight&#xD;
      fast and having abstained from any strenuous exercise following the evening meal. At 0615 h,&#xD;
      participants will consume a standardized breakfast (toast and jam) and the first beverage of&#xD;
      750mL. At 0730 h, participants will be told to consume the second beverage of 250mL. At 0745&#xD;
      h, the participants will undergo the first 10 min quarter of the BSST. At 0755 h, the&#xD;
      participants rest during a 2 min break (1st intermission) and consume the third beverage of&#xD;
      250mL. At 0757 h, the participants will undergo the second session of the BSST. At 0807 h,&#xD;
      the participants receive a 15 min break (half-time) and consume the fourth beverage of 500mL.&#xD;
      At 0822 h, the participants will undergo the first BEST. At 0832 h, the participants receive&#xD;
      a 2 min break (2nd intermission) and consume the final beverage of 250mL. At 0834 h, the&#xD;
      participants undergo the second BEST. At 0844, the exercise bout will be completed.&#xD;
      Participants will complete this protocol for each of the three experimental conditions.&#xD;
