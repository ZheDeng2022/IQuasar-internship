  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide has been shown to be an important regulator within the cardiovascular system,&#xD;
      responsible for regulation of blood flow, blood pressure and vascular growth. Cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases show a reduced ability of the peripheral blood vessels to dilate due to decreased&#xD;
      levels of NO with concomitant increased levels of oxidative stress, which is extremely&#xD;
      detrimental to patients with PAD, as the limited oxygen delivery to skeletal muscles&#xD;
      ultimately results in claudication and reduced physical ability. However, this reduced oxygen&#xD;
      delivery and utilization may be able to be improved as previous studies have revealed that&#xD;
      tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), is an important cofactor responsible for NO production.&#xD;
      Furthermore, recent studies have shown that endothelial BH4 levels are associated with the&#xD;
      vascular pathophysiological response to hypoxia, as it directly mediates endothelial nitric&#xD;
      oxide synthase regulation and reduces superoxide production. Additionally, acute&#xD;
      administration of BH4 was shown to improve vascular function, specifically, endothelial&#xD;
      mediated vasodilatory function, in patients with systemic vascular and coronary disease, as&#xD;
      well as six minute walking distances in patients with hypertension. Therefore, the purpose of&#xD;
      this proposed study will be to examine the effects of BH4 on vascular function, oxidative&#xD;
      stress and leg performance in patients with PAD. This study will examine patients with a&#xD;
      classification of stage 1 or stage 2 peripheral artery disease who demonstrate a history of&#xD;
      exercise-limiting claudication. Blood vessel oxygen transfer capacity in the leg will be&#xD;
      assessed in the femoral and popliteal arteries with ultrasound, and blood vessel dilatory&#xD;
      ability will be assessed in the brachial artery with flow-mediated dilation. Skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mitochondrial function will be measured with near infrared spectroscopy, and ROS levels will&#xD;
      be analyzed through blood samples. Leg function will be measured with an isokinetic&#xD;
      dynamometer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the National Institute of Health, one in every twenty Americans over the age of&#xD;
      50 years old suffers from peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD is a manifestation of systemic&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and is specifically characterized by atherosclerotic blockages of the&#xD;
      arteries in the legs. This results in claudication, a commonly experienced leg pain and&#xD;
      immobility due to occlusion of the blood vessels. This pain reduces the amount of physical&#xD;
      activity PAD patients can participate in, which can be detrimental to the patient, as it can&#xD;
      lead to more systemic issues such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and metabolic&#xD;
      disorders, as well as amputation and death. These periods of occlusion are thought to be&#xD;
      caused by endothelial dysfunction in the peripheral arteries leading to the legs, which&#xD;
      results in an inability to produce nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator which has been&#xD;
      shown to be decreased in patients with PAD. Patients with PAD have also shown higher levels&#xD;
      of systemic and skeletal muscle inflammation due to the impaired oxygen transfer capacity of&#xD;
      these blood vessels. This inflammation leads to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS),&#xD;
      which reduce the bioavailability of NO and are closely linked to the vascular dysfunction in&#xD;
      PAD. Furthermore, mitochondria, a major cellular component that is responsible for the&#xD;
      regulation between levels of production of ROS and antioxidants have shown to be altered in&#xD;
      patients with PAD, which may lead to impaired oxygen transfer and utilization capacity,&#xD;
      ultimately resulting in claudication, impaired functional capacity and reduced physical&#xD;
      activity. Nitric oxide has been shown to be an important regulator within the cardiovascular&#xD;
      system, responsible for regulation of blood flow, blood pressure and vascular growth.&#xD;
      Additionally, many cardiovascular diseases have been shown to be highly associated with a&#xD;
      reduced bioavailability of NO and a positively associated increase in ROS. These heightened&#xD;
      levels of ROS not only reduce the availability of NO, but they may also cause cellular damage&#xD;
      within the muscle and cardiovascular system. This combination of a reduced ability of the&#xD;
      peripheral blood vessels to dilate due to decreased levels of NO, with a concomitant&#xD;
      increased level of inflammation due to higher ROS levels could be extremely detrimental to&#xD;
      patients with PAD, as the limited oxygen delivery to skeletal muscles could ultimately result&#xD;
      in claudication and reduced physical ability. However, this reduced oxygen delivery and&#xD;
      utilization may be able to be improved as previous studies have suggested that&#xD;
      tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), is an important cofactor responsible for NO production.&#xD;
      Furthermore, recent studies have shown that endothelial BH4 levels are associated with the&#xD;
      vascular pathophysiological response to hypoxia, as it directly mediates endothelial nitric&#xD;
      oxide synthase regulation and reduces superoxide production. Additionally, acute&#xD;
      administration of BH4 was shown to improve vascular function, specifically, endothelial&#xD;
      mediated vasodilatory function, in patients with systemic vascular and coronary disease, as&#xD;
      well as six minute walking distances in patients with hypertension. Therefore, the purpose of&#xD;
      this proposed study will be to examine the effects of BH4 on vascular function, oxidative&#xD;
      stress and leg performance in patients with PAD. The findings of this study may help to&#xD;
      develop a new clinical therapy for patients with PAD. In this study we will examine&#xD;
      endothelial function via flow-mediated dilation, blood flow in the femoral and popliteal&#xD;
      arteries with a doppler ultrasound, leg skeletal muscle oxygenation with near-infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy, oxidative stress via blood samples and leg function by conducting a endurance&#xD;
      test on an isokinetic dynamometer in 10 class-1 or class-2 PAD patients. We will use 5 mg/kg&#xD;
      of BH4 obtained from Biomarin Pharmaceutical Industries in a 1:1 randomized, double-blinded,&#xD;
      cross-over design with a 2-week washout period between testing days.&#xD;
