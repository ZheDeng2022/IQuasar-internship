  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH) affects up to 3% of the population and leads to liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and death. The only known treatment is weight loss&#xD;
      and exercise. Many patients cannot or will not achieve this with conventional means. The&#xD;
      pathogenic process of the disease is insulin resistance which can be reversed relatively&#xD;
      quickly with intense exercise or electrical stimulation of muscle. Most patients cannot&#xD;
      achieve or sustain the level of aerobic exercise required; resistance exercise is more&#xD;
      sustainable and similarly effective. The aim of this pilot study is to investigate whether&#xD;
      electro-muscle stimulation, designed to emulate resistance exercise, resolves NASH in&#xD;
      patients and moves them to a less dangerous metabolic steady state which should be easier to&#xD;
      maintain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study which will determine if muscle stimulation by using electro-stimulation&#xD;
      can mimic resistance exercise and improve insulin resistance and hepatitis steatosis. We aim&#xD;
      to recruit up to 20 patients into the study, needing a minimum of 12 subjects suitable for&#xD;
      per protocol analysis. The participants will self-administer EMS for 8 -12 weeks. An interim&#xD;
      analysis of change in insulin resistance at 8 weeks of study will be undertaken in the first&#xD;
      4 patients, if this shows a clear effect the study period will be shortened to 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with biopsy proven NASH will be approached by their clinician at their routine liver&#xD;
      outpatient clinic and provided with study information alongside the contact details of study&#xD;
      staff. Patients will be given adequate time (over 24 hours) to consider the study and will be&#xD;
      asked to contact research staff by email or telephone supplied on the PIS if they then wish&#xD;
      to participate in the study or require further information. An appointment will be arranged&#xD;
      to attend for study screening convenient to the patient where a full in-depth discussion will&#xD;
      take place prior to consent or any study procedures undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will then follow the study pathway as shown in the flow chart, (section&#xD;
      3.2) Study Matrix (3.3) and as described in the study assessments schedule (section 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electro Muscle Stimulation (EMS) will commence at baseline visit, which will take place in&#xD;
      the Institute of Motion Analysis &amp; Research centre, Ninewells hospital, 6 sessions per week&#xD;
      self-administered at home, of up to 35 minutes duration for up to a total of 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will self-administer muscle stimulation via the Neurotrac Myoplus 2/4 device.&#xD;
      Manufactured by: Verity Medical Ltd, in compliance with the European Union Medical Device&#xD;
      Directive MDD93/42/EEC under the supervision of SGS, Notified Body number 0120. CE 0120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Custom STIM (stimulation) mode settings will be utilised and locked for safety. Each&#xD;
      participant's own tolerance for the settings within regulated parameters will be used to&#xD;
      ensure patient comfort but also allow for optimum muscle activity. 4 channels on the device&#xD;
      will be used with 2 sets of skin electrodes attached to the medial and lateral aspects of the&#xD;
      quadriceps muscles of each leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of Insulin Sensitivity. This will be based around frequently sampled oral Glucose&#xD;
      Tolerance test (fsOGTT) which will be performed in the Clinical Research Centre at baseline,&#xD;
      week 4, 8 and 12. The fsOGTT will use the 2 hour, seven sample method following glucose&#xD;
      administration (22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be analysed for glucose, insulin, c-peptide and non-esterified fatty acids&#xD;
      (NEFA), using the model described in Man et al (22). For the days leading up to the test&#xD;
      patients should eat a normal diet without restriction, fast overnight from 10pm (at least 8&#xD;
      hours), water is allowed. Regular medication may be taken, If any need to be taken with food&#xD;
      it may be best to take them after the test. Patients are asked to refrain from smoking,&#xD;
      chewing gum or wearing nicotine patches, during the fasting period until after the test is&#xD;
      completed. The procedure will last for 2-2Â½ hours. On the morning of the test patients will&#xD;
      be asked to sit comfortably. A peripheral venous cannula will be inserted into a vein in the&#xD;
      hand or arm to allow blood samples to be taken before the glucose drink and at 10, 20, 30,&#xD;
      60, 90, 120 minutes afterwards. The glucose drink should be drunk over a maximum of 5&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Water is allowed after the glucose drink if the patient is thirsty. After the blood tests are&#xD;
      complete the cannula will be removed. They will be offered a drink and something to eat at&#xD;
      the end of the test and the patient is free to leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of liver steatosis by MRI liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI scanning will take place at the Radiology department, Ninewells hospital. The&#xD;
      protocol will consist of three sub-sections, namely (i) cardiac MR for studying heart&#xD;
      structure and function (30 minutes scanning); (ii) abdominal MR for measuring liver lipid and&#xD;
      iron concentrations, and visceral/sub-cutaneous adipose tissue volumes (20 minutes scanning);&#xD;
      and (iii) MR elastography for measuring liver fibrosis (30 minutes scanning). For the&#xD;
      baseline visit, patient volunteers will undergo (i) and (ii), and for the follow-up visit&#xD;
      patient volunteers will undergo (ii) and (iii). This will ensure that the abdominal MR&#xD;
      sub-section of the protocol is acquired at both time-points, with a total scan time that will&#xD;
      not exceed 50 minutes for any given session.&#xD;

    <description>In this pilot study we aim to determine if change in the muscle metabolism can resolve insulin resistance in NAFLD through muscle stimulation by using electro-stimulation. We hypothesise that 6x35 minute sessions per week over a 12 week time scale would mimic effects of resistance exercise on metabolic parameters associated with NAFLD and hepatic steatosis. All 20 participants will have the electro-stimulation intervention.</description>
