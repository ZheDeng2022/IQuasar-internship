    <textblock>
      A phase 1 study examining the combination of Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and Trabectedin in various&#xD;
      solid tumor types. The study seeks to determine a safe dose of the combination of study drugs&#xD;
      and then examine this dose in larger groups of patients of specific tumor types to evaluate&#xD;
      its anti-tumor efficacy. Treatment will continue in patients who respond for up to 1 year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include dose escalation and dose expansion phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose escalation portion, patients with advanced cancer will be enrolled and treated&#xD;
      with Durvalumab and Trabectedin. Durvalumab will be administered at the same dose in each&#xD;
      dose escalation cohort, while the dose of Trabectedin will be progressively increased in&#xD;
      different cohorts until the safest dose of the combination is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose expansion portion patients will be treated with the safest dose of the study&#xD;
      drugs determined during the dose escalation phase. There will be two separate groups of&#xD;
      patients treated at this dose to evaluate anti-tumor efficacy of the combination. One group&#xD;
      will consist of non-small-cell lung cancer patients previously treated with PD-1 or PD-L1&#xD;
      inhibitors and another group will consist of an immunotherapy naive group of patients. This&#xD;
      immunotherapy naive group of patients will include sarcoma and another tumor type, this other&#xD;
      tumor type will be determined based on anti-tumor efficacy seen during the dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drugs will be given intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment will continue for up to&#xD;
      one year or until disease progression.&#xD;

             or other investigational product) ≤ 28 days. However, if a therapy has a short&#xD;
             half-life, then patients may participate if they received prior treatment ≤ 28 days&#xD;
             before starting study treatment with approval from the PI and AstraZeneca/Janssen.&#xD;

             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, substantially increase&#xD;

             at least four weeks apart and show no evidence of intracranial progression). In&#xD;
             addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either as a result of the brain&#xD;
             metastases or their treatment must have resolved or be stable either, without the use&#xD;
             of steroids, or are stable on a steroid dose of ≤10mg/day of prednisone or its&#xD;
             equivalent and not requiring anticonvulsants for at least 14 days prior to the start&#xD;
             of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. History of active primary immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical&#xD;
             history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with&#xD;
             local practice), hepatitis B (HBsAg positive), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency&#xD;
             virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies). Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection&#xD;
             (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HbsAg)&#xD;
             are eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             drugs. Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving&#xD;
             treatment with study drugs and up to 90 days after the last dose of study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of&#xD;
             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control (as&#xD;
             defined in section 7.1 of protocol) from screening to 180 days after receipt of the&#xD;
             last dose of study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug&#xD;
             excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Prior randomisation or treatment in a previous durvalumab and/or tremelimumab clinical&#xD;
             study regardless of treatment arm assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Judgment by the investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the&#xD;
             study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
