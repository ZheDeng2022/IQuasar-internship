  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the effects of beneficial compounds of plant foods, such as&#xD;
      pomegranate on cardiovascular health, skin inflammation and aging. This will be tested by&#xD;
      asking healthy males to eat a high fat ground beef patty with 8oz. pomegranate juice or 8oz&#xD;
      placebo (a study product that looks like pomegranate juice, but contains no active&#xD;
      ingredients) and then measuring blood vessel dilation (endothelial function) by blood flow.&#xD;
      The investigators also will measure the amount of Nitric Oxide (NO) in blood and urine&#xD;
      samples and sugar and insulin in blood. In addition, a Cutometer, a device that measures the&#xD;
      elasticity of the skin, will be used to obtain measurements of skin inflammation and aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy men have been chosen for this study because eating high fat hamburger patties can&#xD;
      easily mimic in them the condition that causes atherosclerosis. The results from this study&#xD;
      may help to explain how high fat foods can be harmful to the body and how beneficial plant&#xD;
      foods can have on cardiovascular function and the skin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed investigation has two major objectives: 1. to determine the clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      pomegranate juice to reduce skin aging by assessing UV-induced change and skin biological&#xD;
      characteristics of elasticity, sebum, hydration/moisture and systemic inflammation and 2. To&#xD;
      determine the impact of pomegranate polyphenols on the metabolic response to a high fat meal&#xD;
      by postprandial flow-mediated dilation and plasma nitric oxide. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      achieve the following specific aims in a randomized, two arm, parallel intervention of&#xD;
      pomegranate juice or placebo for 12 weeks in obese men.&#xD;
