    <textblock>
      Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain (Brief CBT-CP) is designed specifically&#xD;
      for use in integrated care settings. The first objective of the proposed study is to conduct&#xD;
      a pilot randomized controlled trial of Brief CBT-CP compared to primary care treatment as&#xD;
      usual to assess feasibility (i.e., recruitment and retention of participants, appropriateness&#xD;
      of measures, and assessment of fidelity of service delivery). This trial will also&#xD;
      preliminarily assess treatment effectiveness by examining changes in pain-related physical&#xD;
      interference, psychological distress, pain intensity, and other related outcomes. Thirty&#xD;
      eligible participants will be randomized into either Brief CBT-CP and primary care treatment&#xD;
      as usual or primary care treatment as usual only. Eligible Veterans will include those with&#xD;
      chronic musculoskeletal pain and pain-related functional impairment identified from primary&#xD;
      care. Participants assigned to Brief CBT-CP will receive six sessions of treatment in&#xD;
      30-minute appointments. This intervention will include education and goal setting, activities&#xD;
      and pacing, relaxation skills, cognitive coping, and relapse prevention. Assessments will&#xD;
      include validated self-report measures that will take place at pre-treatment (baseline),&#xD;
      post-treatment, and at 12-week follow-up. The second objective of this study will be to&#xD;
      explore patient and provider perceptions of Brief CBT-CP to identify potential modifications&#xD;
      that will improve its quality and overall feasibility of delivery in future work.&#xD;
      Participants will include up to 12 staff members as well as up to 12 patients who were&#xD;
      randomized to Brief CBT-CP. Participants will be interviewed by telephone about key&#xD;
      components of the treatment. Participants will comment on protocol and procedures in terms of&#xD;
      acceptability (the perception that a treatment is agreeable or that its specific components&#xD;
      are satisfactory), appropriateness (the perceived fit or compatibility of the intervention&#xD;
      for a given provider or consumer), and feasibility (the extent to which a new treatment can&#xD;
      be successfully carried out or is suitable for everyday use). This intervention has clear&#xD;
      implications for translation to clinical practice and for improving pain care quality by&#xD;
      providing an evidence-based protocol. The potential direct benefit to Veterans includes&#xD;
      offering a safe, accessible, non-pharmacological treatment for chronic pain early in the&#xD;
      trajectory of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit 30 Veterans from the primary care clinics located at the Buffalo Veterans&#xD;
      Affairs medical center in Buffalo, New York. Thirty eligible participants will be randomized&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio into either (1) Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain (Brief&#xD;
      CBT-CP) plus treatment as usual (TAU) or (2) TAU only. We will engage in recruitment during&#xD;
      the second quarter of Year 1 through the end of the first quarter of Year 2. We aim to&#xD;
      recruit and enroll 7-8 participants per quarter during that time frame. Post-treatment&#xD;
      follow-up will be conducted at eight weeks and at 12 weeks. Two recruitment methods will be&#xD;
      used. Veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain who self-report functional impairment will&#xD;
      be referred by their primary care team, in response to a recruitment flyer posted in primary&#xD;
      care, or by contacting the principal investigator or study staff directly after hearing of&#xD;
      the study by word of mouth or other sources. This approach will be supplemented by a&#xD;
      case-finding procedure in which study staff review electronic medical record data to identify&#xD;
      potential patients, who will be subsequently contacted by letter and screened by telephone.&#xD;
      Following telephone screening, potentially eligible participants will complete a baseline&#xD;
      assessment to assess pain and related characteristics as well as remaining exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Those passing baseline measures will be randomized to (1) Brief CBT-CP plus TAU or&#xD;
      (2) TAU only. Assignment to Brief CBT-CP will be stratified based on degree of pain&#xD;
      interference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief CBT-CP is a manualized protocol that includes six, 30-minute sessions over the course&#xD;
      of 6 weeks. Brief CBT-CP session outlines and patient handouts are included in the appendix.&#xD;
      Session one focuses on foundational pain education and the development of treatment goals.&#xD;
      Session two emphasizes balanced engagement in physical activity and pleasurable events.&#xD;
      Session three emphasizes skills training for easily implemented relaxation techniques.&#xD;
      Sessions four and five focus on recognizing and modifying unhelpful thoughts that negatively&#xD;
      impact pain. Session six focuses on relapse prevention and independent implementation of&#xD;
      CBT-CP skills following treatment. Brief CBT-CP will be delivered by a masters-level&#xD;
      interventionist either at the medical center or by telephone depending on the preference of&#xD;
      the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to TAU only will receive standard medical care from their primary care&#xD;
      provider including pain medications, brief advice (e.g., use of relative rest, application of&#xD;
      heat or ice, other self-care strategies), or referral to pain-related adjunctive&#xD;
      interventions (e.g., physical therapy), as indicated. Participants in TAU only will not&#xD;
      receive behavioral intervention from the primary care clinic behavioral health provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct brief interviews with up to 24 purposefully selected participants (i.e., 12&#xD;
      providers and 12 patients). The provider group will include 6 primary care providers and 6&#xD;
      behavioral health providers I providers who staff Veterans Affairs primary care clinics.&#xD;
      Interview items are based on implementation constructs relevant for early stage intervention&#xD;
      development: acceptability (or agreeableness and satisfaction with treatment components),&#xD;
      appropriateness (or perceived fit/compatibility of the intervention), and feasibility (or&#xD;
      whether the intervention is suitable for use.) Up to 12 patients who were randomized to Brief&#xD;
      CBT-CP will be asked to complete a 30-minute interviews (i.e., telephone or face-to-face,&#xD;
      depending on participant preference) following their 12-week assessment (as described in the&#xD;
      consent procedures prior to the trial). We will include participants who completed all study&#xD;
      procedures but will also attempt to include those who discontinued Brief CBT-CP.&#xD;

Brief CBT-CP: Brief CBT-CP is a manualized protocol that includes six, 30-minute sessions over the course of 6 weeks. Brief CBT-CP session outlines and patient handouts are included in the appendix. Session one focuses on foundational pain education and the development of treatment goals. Session two emphasizes balanced engagement in physical activity and pleasurable events. Session three emphasizes skills training for easily implemented relaxation techniques. Sessions four and five focus on recognizing and modifying unhelpful thoughts that negatively impact pain. Session six focuses on relapse prevention and independent implementation of CBT-CP skills following treatment.</description>

TAU: Participants assigned to TAU will receive standard medical care from their primary care provider including pain medications, brief advice (e.g., use of relative rest, application of heat or ice, other self-care strategies), or referral to pain-related adjunctive interventions (e.g., physical therapy), as indicated.</description>

          <description>Primary care treatment as usual and Brief CBT-CP&#xD;
Brief CBT-CP: Brief CBT-CP is a manualized protocol that includes six, 30-minute sessions over the course of 6 weeks. Brief CBT-CP session outlines and patient handouts are included in the appendix. Session one focuses on foundational pain education and the development of treatment goals. Session two emphasizes balanced engagement in physical activity and pleasurable events. Session three emphasizes skills training for easily implemented relaxation techniques. Sessions four and five focus on recognizing and modifying unhelpful thoughts that negatively impact pain. Session six focuses on relapse prevention and independent implementation of CBT-CP skills following treatment.</description>
