  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke survivors commonly have respiratory muscle weakness, swallowing disturbance, general&#xD;
      weakness, reduced the daily living activities and short of motivation for rehabilitation.&#xD;
      Respiratory muscle training (RMT) has been reported to improve the pulmonary function,&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, sensation of dyspnea and quality of life in&#xD;
      several diseases, but rare in stroke patients. Reviewing previous reports, the protocol,&#xD;
      intensity and duration of respiratory muscle training is still variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To investigate the feasibility and efficacy of respiratory muscle training on&#xD;
      cardio-pulmonary function, swallowing function, cough function and reduction of incidence of&#xD;
      pneumonia in post-stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A prospective, single blinded, randomized study. Consecutive patients with diagnosis&#xD;
      of stroke will be proved by magnetic resonance image or computerized tomography. Stroke&#xD;
      patients, aged 35-80 years old, with inspiratory muscle weakness or swallowing disturbance&#xD;
      will be enrolled and randomly divided into control group (usual rehabilitation alone) and&#xD;
      experimental group [inspiratory muscle training (IMT) group for patients with inspiratory&#xD;
      muscle weakness and expiratory muscle strengthening training (EMT) for patients with&#xD;
      swallowing disturbance]. Each patients will receive usual rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator expect that RMT will be practical for the restoration of respiratory muscle,&#xD;
      swallowing function, cough function and voice quality, thereby reduction of the incidence of&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stroke patients has been observed to have a higher position of diaphragm in thoracic&#xD;
      radiographs on the affected side after 1 day to 2 years of acute event, reduced movement of&#xD;
      whole hemi-thorax and excursion of diaphragm on the affected side during deep voluntary&#xD;
      breathing, and a tendency for predominance of rib cage contributions during tidal breathing,&#xD;
      reduced maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP). Their&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness could be markedly impaired within 7 weeks after a stroke. Neves, et&#xD;
      al. reported that the recent infarction group had a positive correlation between peak oxygen&#xD;
      uptake and both MIP and maximal incremental pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inspiratory muscle training (IMT). Inspiratory loading can improve limb blood flow, and&#xD;
      oxygen uptake efficiency. Threshold inspiratory loading has been recommended to improve&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle strength in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis,&#xD;
      congestive heart failure (CHF), heart failure, CABG and neuromuscular disease et al. Sutbeyaz&#xD;
      et al. ever reported that a statistically significant increase in MIP and MEP of the&#xD;
      breathing retraining group in subacute stroke patients. The training intensity of IMT varied&#xD;
      from 30% to 60% of MIP, duration of 3 to 7 times per week, the duration of each session from&#xD;
      10-30 minutes for a period of training from 6 to12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expiratory muscle training (EMT): EMT has been shown to improve the dyspnea perception and&#xD;
      walking distance within a time unit in COPD persons, aerodynamic changes in cough flow in&#xD;
      patients with multiple sclerosis and Parkinson disease, and swallowing safety in PD, and&#xD;
      voice aerodynamic. But till now, the protocol, intensity and duration of EMT is still&#xD;
      variable, from twice daily at the user's own frequency and tidal volume for 15 min for 4&#xD;
      week, or a week for 1/2 hour, start 15% MEP max, increased by 5-10% each session to 60% of&#xD;
      MEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Forty-six stroke patients with swallowing disturbance or respiratory muscle weakness,&#xD;
      age between 35 to 80 years, will be enrolled. The participants will be randomly assigned by a&#xD;
      computer random number generator into two groups, including the experimental group (RMT group&#xD;
      plus regular rehabilitation) and the control group (regular rehabilitation alone). All&#xD;
      allocations will be concealed in the opaque envelopes. The research assistant will enroll the&#xD;
      participants, generate the allocation sequence, and assign participants to their groups after&#xD;
      obtaining the informed consent. The research assistant who are responsible for measuring&#xD;
      outcomes will be blind to the allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group will be randomized into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: EMT+IMT for patients with inspiratory muscle weakness and swallowing disturbance&#xD;
      (MIP less than 70% of normal range).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II: EMT for patients with swallowing disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group will receive regular rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject with respiratory muscle weakness or swallowing disturbance, baseline&#xD;
      characteristics, including height, weight, body mass index, duration of the disease,&#xD;
      neurological level (Brunnstrom's stage), spirometry, peak cough flow, resting heart rate,&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resting oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), MIP, MEP ,&#xD;
      Borg's scale (0.5 to 10), 6-minute walking test, cough function, fatigue assessment scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training protocol Group I: IMT+EMT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMT will commence from 30% to 60 % of MIP and then adjust one level of training loading&#xD;
      according to the tolerance of continuously breathing through a respiratory trainer for one&#xD;
      set of 30 breaths or 6 sets of 5 repetitions with one or two minute of rest between sets,&#xD;
      twice per day, 5 days per week. Training resistance will be adjusted as tolerated. The&#xD;
      loading will be performed with the previous resistance setting or even lower if training load&#xD;
      is not tolerated or not completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During IMT, patients will be instructed to place their lips around breathing trainer in a&#xD;
      sitting position with a nose-clip, inhale with enough force to open the valve (inhale deeply&#xD;
      and forcefully), exhale through the mouthpiece (exhale slowly and gently), and then continue&#xD;
      inhaling and exhaling without removing the device from their mouths. The training load and&#xD;
      training program will be instructed by an experienced respiratory technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training protocol Group II: EMT for patients with swallowing disturbance EMT will commence&#xD;
      from 15% to 75% of threshold load of an individual's MEP, 5 sets, 5 repetition with one or&#xD;
      two minute of rest between sets, twice per day, 5 days per week. And training resistance will&#xD;
      be adjusted accordingly. The loading will be performed with the previous resistance setting&#xD;
      or even lower if training load is not tolerated or not completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patients with swallowing disturbance will receive swallowing screen test, Functional&#xD;
      Oral Intake Scale, voice quality analysis and surface electromyography by an experience&#xD;
      physician and experienced speech therapist to evaluate the functional level of oral intake of&#xD;
      food and liquid, voice quality and measurement of submental muscle strength respectively. And&#xD;
      swallowing training program will be conducted by an experienced speech therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for surface EMG (sEMG): The sEMG activities of swallowing-related muscles while&#xD;
      swallowing and doing expiratory breathing through a breathing trainer will be measured with&#xD;
      the Nicolet Viking Four Electrodiagnostic system, Multiple Modality Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for voice analysis: Voice quality will be assessed with Computerized Speech Lab&#xD;
      (CSL™)，Model 4500 (Mutlti-Dimensional Voice). Patients will sustain &quot;ah&quot; for at least 3&#xD;
      seconds at the most comfortable speaking pitch and loudness, as well as at the lowest pitch&#xD;
      and highest pitch increasing and decreasing loudness with audio recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be assessed again at 6 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervision: During the first session, the investigator will decrease one level of threshold&#xD;
      load imposed if a modest decrease in SpO2, which implies that it most likely reflects the&#xD;
      onset of hypoventilation, particularly when the load approaches the maximum; otherwise the&#xD;
      investigators will use continuous use EKG to monitor cardiac activity throughout the RMT&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular rehabilitation program All participants will receive usual rehabilitation care&#xD;
      including body positioning instruction, postural correction, breathing control, cough&#xD;
      maneuver, respiratory muscle stretch, chest wall mobility exercise, fatigue management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For checking the compliance of RMT at home, patients will be monitored by making a phone call&#xD;
      to them once a week.&#xD;
