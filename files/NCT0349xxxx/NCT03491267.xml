  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have extensive evidence in mouse that wounding leads to the generation of&#xD;
      new hair follicles in the skin. This can be an important new therapy for patients with&#xD;
      scarring, but especially those with alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question is whether gentle wounding in human subjects can cause the generation of a new&#xD;
      hair follicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan is to first carefully map a small area of the scalp without hair follicles.&#xD;
      Investigators will then try various modalities of gentle wounding (including fractionated&#xD;
      Carbon Dioxide (CO2) laser, mild curetting) of the surface epithelium in the presence and&#xD;
      absence of FDA approved topical medications (including retinoids). Investigators will then&#xD;
      prospectively monitor the area for hair growth both by noninvasive visual monitoring&#xD;
      (including photographs and dermoscopy) and biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of this study hopefully will allow new therapies for especially scarring&#xD;
      alopecia conditions where hair follicles are completely lost and there are no current&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) is a scarring, inflammatory alopecia seen&#xD;
      more commonly in women of African descent. The distinct pathophysiology of CCCA is poorly&#xD;
      understood, but it is known to involve inflammation directed at the upper part of the hair&#xD;
      follicle where the stem cells and sebaceous gland are located. If the stem cells and&#xD;
      sebaceous gland are destroyed, there is no possibility for regeneration of the hair follicle,&#xD;
      and permanent hair loss results. This form of scarring alopecia occurs mainly on the vertex&#xD;
      of the scalp, and spreads peripherally, and can lead to baldness. In our dermatology clinics,&#xD;
      our investigators see 5-10 patients per week for evaluation and treatment of CCCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, treatment is focused on decreasing inflammation and halting the progression of&#xD;
      disease. This typically consists of topical and intralesional corticosteroid therapy and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory antibiotics. Hair transplantation is the only treatment option for patients&#xD;
      with end-stage CCCA, and has been performed in a small number of patients but the results&#xD;
      have been disappointing with low graft survival rates and slow regrowth of the transplanted&#xD;
      hair. In addition, hair transplantation of the curved hair follicles found in patients of&#xD;
      African descent is difficult and requires specific expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study by Ito et al showed de novo hair follicle formation after wounding in genetically&#xD;
      normal adult mice. The regenerated hair follicles were fully functional, in that they&#xD;
      established a stem cell population, expressed known molecular markers of follicle&#xD;
      differentiation, and produced a hair shaft that progressed normally through all stages of the&#xD;
      hair follicle cycle. It is hypothesized that the regenerated hair follicles likely arise when&#xD;
      epithelial cells in the wound assume a hair follicle stem cell phenotype, possibly under the&#xD;
      influence of Wnt signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CO2 laser has been used extensively in dermatological surgery over the past 30 years and&#xD;
      is now recognized as the gold standard for soft tissue vaporization. CO2 laser beam heats and&#xD;
      vaporizes the skin tissue, instantly removing the superficial layers of the skin. Each&#xD;
      fractional micro-spot creates a thermal zone. Intact cells around the treated area help&#xD;
      during the healing process which in turn, induces cell regeneration. This likely occurs&#xD;
      through dsRNA released during wounding. The investigators have recently found that retinoids,&#xD;
      such as the tretinoin (retin-A) used in acne, can synergize with dsRNA and promote extra Wnt&#xD;
      signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore hypothesize that wounding of the area of scarring alopecia in&#xD;
      CCCA, using a fractionated CO2 laser in combination with retinoid acid, will induce hair&#xD;
      follicle regeneration.&#xD;
