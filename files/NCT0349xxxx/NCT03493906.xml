  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Acute leukemia is a life threatening hematological malignancy which can result in&#xD;
      substantial symptom burden including impaired psychological wellbeing. Peer-to-peer support&#xD;
      has positive and beneficial effects on patients with cancer. Yet there is lack of knowledge&#xD;
      and evidence of the feasibility and the effect of peer-to-peer support on patient with acute&#xD;
      leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The study aim to examine the feasibility and safety of Patient Ambassador Support in&#xD;
      newly diagnosed patients with acute leukemia during treatment, and to examine the benefit on&#xD;
      symptoms and psychological wellbeing in both patients and ambassadors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methods: This study is a one arm feasibility intervention trial with patients&#xD;
      n=40; patient ambassadors (PA) n=30. Patients will be consecutively recruited at the&#xD;
      Departments of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital and Sjællands&#xD;
      Universitetshospital, Roskilde, and paired with a PA who will follow and assist the patient&#xD;
      over the course of two series of chemotherapy for a 12 week period, with one follow-up&#xD;
      contact at 3 month. Data is collected at baseline (within 2 weeks of diagnosis), post&#xD;
      intervention (12 weeks) and follow-up 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implication: This study has the potential to be a new model for care incorporated in the&#xD;
      oncology/hematology clinical care setting, creating an active partnership between patients&#xD;
      and former patients; and in collaboration with the health care professionals which may&#xD;
      strengthen the existing care and support system.&#xD;

      Study Part 2 Aim To investigate the feasibility and safety of Patient Ambassador Support&#xD;
      (PAS) and whether there is benefit on psychological wellbeing and symptoms among newly&#xD;
      diagnosed patients with acute leukemia and among former patients with acute leukemia (patient&#xD;
      ambassadors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods A one arm feasibility intervention trial with patients (n=40) and patient&#xD;
      ambassadors (PA) (n=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Patients will be recruited at three Danish hematology departments: Rigshospitalet&#xD;
      (RH), Herlev og Gentofte Hospital (HGH and Sjællands Universitetshospital, Roskilde (SUR),&#xD;
      from January 2018 to June 2019. Eligible patients receive oral and written project&#xD;
      information from KHN within two weeks from diagnosis. KHN provides a summary of the study and&#xD;
      gives the opportunity to raise questions or concerns related to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PA´s will be recruited voluntarily from the patient association LyLe and from the outpatient&#xD;
      hematology departments of RH, HGH and SUR by KHN, and screened by interview to assess their&#xD;
      appropriateness for the intervention. Screening interviews include questions about a&#xD;
      survivor´s motivation for volunteering, availability, ability to respect confidentiality, and&#xD;
      ability to acknowledge the vulnerability that may occur when they revisiting experience of&#xD;
      others with acute leukemia. The PA is obligated to sign a confidentiality commitment, and&#xD;
      knows and accepts the terms and requirements included in the intervention. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      PA provides information regarding age, gender, diagnose, treatment, interests, work,&#xD;
      education, social conditions in order to match with patients. The PA must provide&#xD;
      transportation themselves but will receive a monetary incentive for their participation.&#xD;
      During the intervention we will adjust the PA recruitment process in order to fill specific&#xD;
      needs in the program such as age groups or diagnosis. This will ensure that we do not have a&#xD;
      larger ambassador pool than we effectively utilize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and ambassadors who have consented and agreed to participate in the study will&#xD;
      complete the baseline testing (patient reported outcome questionnaires) before the beginning&#xD;
      of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient ambassador training program Recruited PAs will receive a group training program,&#xD;
      curriculum and an ambassador 'checklist´. Before interacting with patients, the PA will&#xD;
      receive 6 hours of training. The training will be organized by KHN and a project nurse from&#xD;
      each intervention site. The training will be carried out by KHN, the project nurse, a&#xD;
      represent from the PAB and a psychologist. Training modules include information on medical&#xD;
      facts related to acute leukemia, information on psychosocial issues, training in&#xD;
      communication skills with emphasis on active listening, and learning how to help other&#xD;
      patients problem- solve and advocate for themselves within the health care system. Training&#xD;
      also includes discussion of the PA ´s personal goals and concerns about volunteering in the&#xD;
      study and their individual attitudes toward survivorship and illness. The importance of&#xD;
      maintaining appropriate boundaries are discussed, to ensure PA do not overly identify with&#xD;
      patients and remain aware of their role as listening mentors who use their experience only&#xD;
      when solicited by the patient. Further, possible changes in medical conditions in both&#xD;
      themselves and the patients will be discussed. The PA is offered supervision during the&#xD;
      intervention and the opportunity to attend ambassador support meetings every second month for&#xD;
      ongoing education and to process their experiences with patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Match between patients and ambassadors Patients and ambassadors express prior to intervention&#xD;
      which preferences they have for their match. They will be matched according to diagnosis,&#xD;
      age, gender and other factors that might create a mutual understanding and ease of&#xD;
      communication. KHN will pair patients with a PA. If it is not possible to match on the given&#xD;
      preferences, the patient and ambassador will be involved in the decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAS intervention The intervention consists of support provided by the PA, who will follow and&#xD;
      assist the patient over the course of 12 weeks, through two series of chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      intervention consists of minimum four face-to-face meetings between patient and PA and&#xD;
      additionally open telephone and/or email contact based on the patients 'individual needs,&#xD;
      including one follow-up contact at 3 months by telephone. The duration of the contact is&#xD;
      individual. The context of the face-to-face meetings are chosen between patients and&#xD;
      ambassadors e.g. café on the local hospital, a café near both patient and ambassador or&#xD;
      private based on the contact developed between patient and ambassador. The PA will follow one&#xD;
      patient at a time, however at the end of the 12 week period; the PA can choose to follow a&#xD;
      new patient. During the first meeting, an expectation agreement between the patient and PA&#xD;
      will be discussed and signed. The PA will use an ambassador checklist to document the&#xD;
      frequency, content and quality of the connections between patient and PA, as well as&#xD;
      documenting themes, goals, progress and outcomes of their conversations. The checklist will&#xD;
      be developed in conjunction with representatives from the PAB and prior to the recruitment of&#xD;
      the IG. The checklist will provide a comprehensive guidance and list of important and&#xD;
      relevant actions, or steps to be taken in the role as PA, as well as serve as a work and&#xD;
      documentation tool during the intervention and follow-period. Upon completion of the training&#xD;
      program each PA will receive a training certificate and a personal PA name badge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in medical conditions in both patients and ambassadors which will affect their&#xD;
      ability to participate in the study will result in exclusion. The project nurse at the&#xD;
      specific hematologic department reports to the primary investigator (KHN) within 48 hours.&#xD;
      Changes in medical conditions comprise the following conditions: relapse (ambassadors),&#xD;
      critical psychological conditions including delirium or severe depression, hospitalization in&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) longer than two weeks or transition to palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety net - ambassadors' support There will be held an ambassador support meeting which is&#xD;
      important to allow the ambassadors to share experiences, solve problems, and provide mutual&#xD;
      support. The ambassadors have the possibility to request supervision from a psychologist&#xD;
      during the intervention. The psychological health of the ambassadors is of great interest and&#xD;
      it is important that they do not suffer unnecessary distress following the intervention. Any&#xD;
      adverse events will be documented and acted on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes measurements and data collection Data are collected by patient reported outcome&#xD;
      measures (PROM) completed by patients electronically prior to intervention, post intervention&#xD;
      (12 weeks) and at 3-month follow-up. PROM is completed by PA, after they have completed the&#xD;
      patient ambassador training program, but prior to their first PAS intervention and at post&#xD;
      intervention (12 weeks). Socio-demographic characteristics are collected through by patient's&#xD;
      medical charts and questionnaire.&#xD;
