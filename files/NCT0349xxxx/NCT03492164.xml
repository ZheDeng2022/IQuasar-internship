  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to enroll 30 evaluable patients with (1) a histological diagnosis of&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who have demonstrated at least stable disease&#xD;
      following ≥16 weeks of treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and (2) who have signed&#xD;
      consent to participate in a clinical trial that contains PARP inhibitor therapy and are&#xD;
      anticipated to receive this treatment or (3) will receive PARP inhibitor therapy as part of&#xD;
      their clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre-treatment 18F-FluorThanatrace ([18F]FTT) positron emission tomography/computed&#xD;
      tomography (PET/CT) scan will be done prior to the start of treatment with a PARP inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/CT imaging will be used to evaluate PARP-1 expression in sites of pancreatic cancer using&#xD;
      the investigational radiotracer [18F]FTT. This is an observational study in that [18F]FTT&#xD;
      PET/CT will not be used to direct treatment decisions. While patients and referring&#xD;
      physicians will not be blinded to the [18F]FTT PET/CT results, treatment decisions will be&#xD;
      made by the treating physicians based upon clinical criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo approximately 60 minutes of dynamic scanning starting at the time of&#xD;
      injection of [18F]FTT. This procedure will be followed by a skull base to mid-thigh scan,&#xD;
      starting at approximately 60 minutes post injection. PET/CT imaging sessions will include an&#xD;
      injection of approximately 10 mCi (approximate range for most studies is anticipated to be&#xD;
      8-12 mCi) of [18F]FTT. Data will be collected to evaluate uptake of [18F]FTT in sites of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer, which will be compared with PARP-1 expression in tissue, when available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 30 evaluable patients are expected to start PARP inhibitor therapy following the [18F]FTT&#xD;
      PET/CT scan. It is expected that due to patient preference and time considerations,&#xD;
      approximately 24 patients (80%) will also undergo a second (optional) scan that will be&#xD;
      performed approximately 3 weeks (± 1 week) after therapy has started. The second scan is&#xD;
      obtained to evaluate whether the PARP inhibitor therapy decreases [18F]FTT uptake, which&#xD;
      would suggest PARP blocking by the therapy.&#xD;
