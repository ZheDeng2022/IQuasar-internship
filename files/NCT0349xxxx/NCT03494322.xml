  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head &amp; neck (H&amp;N) cancer is the eighth most common cancer in the UK. Advanced H&amp;N cancer&#xD;
      which has come back after treatment or has spread to other parts of the body is incurable and&#xD;
      the average life expectancy of these patients is less than a year. New drugs called immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors work with the patient's own immune system to fight cancer. They are&#xD;
      used in the clinic to treat a number of cancers, including H&amp;N cancer. It may be possible to&#xD;
      make immune checkpoint inhibitors more effective by combining drugs that work in different&#xD;
      ways. In effect, attacking the cancer from different angles. Cetuximab is a well-established&#xD;
      drug that works by blocking signals that tell cancer cells to grow and divide into more&#xD;
      cells. It also engages with the immune system within the tumour. The trial aims to see if&#xD;
      giving cetuximab along with an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug called avelumab is better at&#xD;
      treating advanced H&amp;N cancer than giving avelumab on its own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These two drugs have not been given together before, so to start with, the investigator plans&#xD;
      to enrol a small number of patients and give the patients avelumab + cetuximab to make sure&#xD;
      the combination is safe at the doses chosen. After this, the investigator plans to enrol 114&#xD;
      patients with advanced H&amp;N cancer. Half the patients will be treated with avelumab alone and&#xD;
      the other half with avelumab + cetuximab. Both drugs are given intravenously in the hospital&#xD;
      once every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment lasts for up to a year and patients will be followed up for up to 2 years from the&#xD;
      time they enter the study. Patients will be recruited from around 15 hospitals in the UK.&#xD;
      Recruitment would be expected to start in the second quarter of 2018 and it will take about&#xD;
      29 months (Safety run-in: 5 months; Phase II: 24 months) to recruit all the patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised phase II study comparing the efficacy of avelumab alone with avelumab +&#xD;
      cetuximab combination in patients with platinum-resistant advanced or metastatic head &amp; neck&#xD;
      cancer. The randomised phase II part of the trial will be preceded by a safety run-in.The&#xD;
      objective of the safety run in is to make sure the combination of cetuximab and avelumab at&#xD;
      the doses selected for the study are safe and tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase II, the main question the investigator wants to answer is whether or not giving&#xD;
      avelumab and cetuximab together is better than giving avelumab alone to treat patients with&#xD;
      head and neck cancer that have had previous treatment with cisplatin and whose cancer has&#xD;
      come back or spread to other parts of the body. The investigator will compare the number of&#xD;
      patients in each group whose cancer has not gotten any worse 6 months after joining the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase II part of the trial will recruit patients with head &amp; neck squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      only. However, during the safety run-in, patients with other types of squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinomas will also be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target accrual:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety run-in: up to 16 patients with squamous cell carcinomas; Phase II: 114 patients with&#xD;
      head &amp; neck squamous cell cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety run-in will recruit patients in cohorts of 3 at a time and all patients will be&#xD;
      treated with the combination. The safety run in is a dose de-escalation design. That is,&#xD;
      patients will be given the dose that is planed for use in phase II and if this proves not&#xD;
      tolerable, the dose of cetuximab will be de-escalated and another cohort of patients will be&#xD;
      recruited. The investigator will conclude the combination is safe and tolerable if less than&#xD;
      33% of patients who are treated experience side effects that lead to a dose reduction. The&#xD;
      purpose is to ensure the safety of the combination prior to starting phase II, as these drugs&#xD;
      have not been given together before. However, there is evidence from previous studies that&#xD;
      these types of drugs can be combined safely. The trial aims to complete the safety run-in&#xD;
      within 5 months and the phase II study within 24 months. The entire duration of recruitment&#xD;
      is expected to be 29 months.&#xD;
