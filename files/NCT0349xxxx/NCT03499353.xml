    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 15, Day 1 of Cycles 3-6, End of Treatment visit (maximum of 33 weeks) and Post-surgical follow-up visit (maximum of 41 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer module developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of participants with breast cancer, consisting of 2 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, and 3 single-item scales. Each scale has 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the arm symptoms scale, participants self-rated how much they had pain in the arm or shoulder, how much the arm or hand was swollen, and difficulty in raising the arm or moving it sideways. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement of arm symptoms and positive change indicates deterioration.</description>

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales. For the nausea and vomiting symptoms scale, participants self-rated how much they had felt nauseated and/or vomited during the past week. A 10 point change from baseline was used to indicate clinically meaningful change. Deterioration in nausea and vomiting symptoms was defined as a 10 point or more increase from baseline for that specific time point.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Missed Expected Menstrual Periods Per Patient Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 15, Day 1 of Cycles 3-6, End of Treatment visit (maximum of 33 weeks) and Post-surgical follow-up visit (maximum of 41 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Missed expected menstrual period was assessed electronically using the PRO CTCAE questionnaire, a PRO measure developed to evaluate symptomatic toxicity in patients on cancer clinical trials. This objective captures the concept of fertility preservation through PRO, since there is a possible fertility sparing effect of talazoparib versus chemotherapy.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 61 participants were enrolled and treated with talazoparib.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Talazoparib 1 mg QD</title>
          <description>During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.&#xD;
Safety follow-up (end of treatment visit) occurred approximately 28 calendar days after the last dose of talazoparib or after permanent treatment discontinuation or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurred first).&#xD;
Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>

        <description>The RCB is a continuous index derived from the following: primary tumor dimensions; cellularity of the tumor bed; axillary nodal burden. Residual cancer burden by ICR is reported as a categorical variable with four classes (categories): RCB 0 (pCR), I (minimal RCB), II (moderate RCB), III (extensive RCB). Participants who had progressive disease or was unable to be assessed for RCB due to missing required axillary specimen were counted in the &quot;Missing&quot; category. The simultaneous exact CI was calculated using Goodman's method.</description>

Grades of AEs were defined by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. Grade 1=asymptomatic/mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only, intervention not indicated; Grade 2=minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated, limiting age-appropriate instrumental activity of daily living (ADL); Grade 3=severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization of prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4=events with life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5= death related to AE.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Achieved Definitive Deterioration in Global Health Status (GHS)/Quality of Life (QoL) Per European Organization For Research And Treatment Of Cancer Quality Of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-30)</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes (PROs), consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the GHS/QoL scale, participants rated their overall health and quality of life within the past week. A 10 point change from baseline was used to indicate clinically meaningful change. Definitive deterioration was defined as ≥10 point decrease from baseline without any subsequent &lt;10 point decrease.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Achieved Definitive Deterioration in Nausea and Vomiting Symptoms Per EORTC QLQ-C30</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the nausea and vomiting symptoms scale, participants self-rated how much they had felt nauseated and/or vomited during the past week. A 10 point change from baseline was used to indicate clinically meaningful change. Definitive deterioration was defined as ≥10 point increase from baseline without any subsequent &lt;10 point increase.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Physical Functioning Per EORTC QLQ-C30</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the physical functioning scale, participants self-rated levels of difficulty in doing strenuous activities, taking a walk, how much they needed to stay in bed or a chair, or needed help with eating, dressing, bathing, using the toilet. Negative change from baseline indicates deterioration in physical functioning and positive change indicates improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 15, Day 1 of Cycles 3-6, End of Treatment visit (maximum of 33 weeks) and Post-surgical follow-up visit (maximum of 41 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Number of Participants Analyzed refers to participants who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of this outcome measure prior to end of study treatment. Number Analyzed refers to those who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at both baseline and each specific visit. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; may or may not be smaller than &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; due to individual missing values.</population>

            <title>Talazoparib 1 mg QD</title>
            <description>During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.&#xD;
Safety follow-up (end of treatment visit) occurred approximately 28 calendar days after the last dose of talazoparib or after permanent treatment discontinuation or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurred first).&#xD;
Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Role Functioning Per EORTC QLQ-C30</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the role functioning scale, participants self-rated how much they were limited in doing work or daily activities, or in pursuing hobbies or other leisure time activities during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates deterioration in role functioning and positive change indicates improvement.</description>

        <population>Number of Participants Analyzed refers to participants who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of this outcome measure prior to end of study treatment. Number Analyzed refers to those who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at both baseline and each specific visit. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; may or may not be smaller than &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; due to individual missing values.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Functioning Per EORTC QLQ-C30</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the cognitive functioning scale, participants self-rated the extent of difficulty in concentrating on things or remembering things during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates deterioration in cognitive functioning and positive change indicates improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 15, Day 1 of Cycles 3-6, End of Treatment visit (maximum of 33 weeks) and Post-surgical follow-up visit (maximum of 41 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Number of Participants Analyzed refers to participants who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of this outcome measure prior to end of study treatment. Number Analyzed refers to those who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at both baseline and each specific visit. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; may or may not be smaller than &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; due to individual missing values.</population>

            <title>Talazoparib 1 mg QD</title>
            <description>During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.&#xD;
Safety follow-up (end of treatment visit) occurred approximately 28 calendar days after the last dose of talazoparib or after permanent treatment discontinuation or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurred first).&#xD;
Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Social Functioning Per EORTC QLQ-C30</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the social functioning scale, participants self-rated how much their physical condition or medical treatment interfered with their family life and social activities during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates deterioration in social functioning and positive change indicates improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 15, Day 1 of Cycles 3-6, End of Treatment visit (maximum of 33 weeks) and Post-surgical follow-up visit (maximum of 41 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Number of Participants Analyzed refers to participants who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of this outcome measure prior to end of study treatment. Number Analyzed refers to those who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at both baseline and each specific visit. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; may or may not be smaller than &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; due to individual missing values.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Nausea and Vomiting Symptoms Per EORTC QLQ-C30</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the nausea and vomiting symptoms scale, participants self-rated how much they had felt nauseated and/or vomited during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates improvement of nausea and vomiting symptoms and positive change indicates deterioration.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 15, Day 1 of Cycles 3-6, End of Treatment visit (maximum of 33 weeks) and Post-surgical follow-up visit (maximum of 41 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Number of Participants Analyzed refers to participants who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of this outcome measure prior to end of study treatment. Number Analyzed refers to those who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at both baseline and each specific visit. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; may or may not be smaller than &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; due to individual missing values.</population>

            <title>Talazoparib 1 mg QD</title>
            <description>During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.&#xD;
Safety follow-up (end of treatment visit) occurred approximately 28 calendar days after the last dose of talazoparib or after permanent treatment discontinuation or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurred first).&#xD;
Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pain Symptoms Per EORTC QLQ-C30</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the pain symptoms scale, participants self-rated the extent of pain and how much the pain interfered with daily activities during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates improvement of pain symptoms and positive change indicates deterioration.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 15, Day 1 of Cycles 3-6, End of Treatment visit (maximum of 33 weeks) and Post-surgical follow-up visit (maximum of 41 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Number of Participants Analyzed refers to participants who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of this outcome measure prior to end of study treatment. Number Analyzed refers to those who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at both baseline and each specific visit. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; may or may not be smaller than &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; due to individual missing values.</population>

            <description>During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.&#xD;
Safety follow-up (end of treatment visit) occurred approximately 28 calendar days after the last dose of talazoparib or after permanent treatment discontinuation or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurred first).&#xD;
Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>

            <title>Talazoparib 1 mg QD</title>
            <description>During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.&#xD;
Safety follow-up (end of treatment visit) occurred approximately 28 calendar days after the last dose of talazoparib or after permanent treatment discontinuation or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurred first).&#xD;
Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Dyspnoea Symptoms Per EORTC QLQ-C30</title>
          <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the dyspnoea symptoms scale, participants self-rated the intensity of shortness of breath during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates improvement of dyspnoea symptoms and positive change indicates deterioration.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Appetite Loss Symptoms Per EORTC QLQ-C30</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the appetite loss symptoms scale, participants self-rated the extent of lack of appetite during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates improvement of appetite loss symptoms and positive change indicates deterioration.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 15, Day 1 of Cycles 3-6, End of Treatment visit (maximum of 33 weeks) and Post-surgical follow-up visit (maximum of 41 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Number of Participants Analyzed refers to participants who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of this outcome measure prior to end of study treatment. Number Analyzed refers to those who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at both baseline and each specific visit. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; may or may not be smaller than &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; due to individual missing values.</population>

            <title>Talazoparib 1 mg QD</title>
            <description>During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.&#xD;
Safety follow-up (end of treatment visit) occurred approximately 28 calendar days after the last dose of talazoparib or after permanent treatment discontinuation or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurred first).&#xD;
Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Constipation Symptoms Per EORTC QLQ-C30</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the constipation symptoms scale, participants self-rated the intensity of constipation during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates improvement of constipation symptoms and positive change indicates deterioration.</description>

        <population>Number of Participants Analyzed refers to participants who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of this outcome measure prior to end of study treatment. Number Analyzed refers to those who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at both baseline and each specific visit. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; may or may not be smaller than &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; due to individual missing values.</population>

            <description>During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.&#xD;
Safety follow-up (end of treatment visit) occurred approximately 28 calendar days after the last dose of talazoparib or after permanent treatment discontinuation or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurred first).&#xD;
Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Financial Difficulties Per EORTC QLQ-C30</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the symptom scale of financial difficulties, participants self-rated how much their physical condition or medical treatment caused financial difficulties. Negative change from baseline values indicates improvement of financial difficulties and positive change indicates deterioration.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 15, Day 1 of Cycles 3-6, End of Treatment visit (maximum of 33 weeks) and Post-surgical follow-up visit (maximum of 41 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Number of Participants Analyzed refers to participants who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of this outcome measure prior to end of study treatment. Number Analyzed refers to those who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at both baseline and each specific visit. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; may or may not be smaller than &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; due to individual missing values.</population>

            <title>Talazoparib 1 mg QD</title>
            <description>During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.&#xD;
Safety follow-up (end of treatment visit) occurred approximately 28 calendar days after the last dose of talazoparib or after permanent treatment discontinuation or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurred first).&#xD;
Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Body Image Per EORTC QLQ Breast Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BR23)</title>
        <description>EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer module developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of participants with breast cancer, consisting of 2 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, and 3 single-item scales. Each scale has 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the functional scale of body image, participants self-rated how much they felt physically less attractive or less feminine, difficult to look at themselves naked, or dissatisfied with their body during the past week. Negative change from baseline indicates worsening of self-rated body image and positive change indicates improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 15, Day 1 of Cycles 3-6, End of Treatment visit (maximum of 33 weeks) and Post-surgical follow-up visit (maximum of 41 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Number of Participants Analyzed refers to participants who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of this outcome measure prior to end of study treatment. Number Analyzed refers to those who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at both baseline and each specific visit. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; may or may not be smaller than &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; due to individual missing values.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sexual Enjoyment Per EORTC QLQ-BR23</title>
        <description>EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer module developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of participants with breast cancer, consisting of 2 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, and 3 single-item scales. Each scale has 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the functional scale of sexual enjoyment, participants self-rated to what extent sex was enjoyable for them during the past 4 weeks. Negative change from baseline values indicates worsening of sexual enjoyment and positive change indicates improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 15, Day 1 of Cycles 3-6, End of Treatment visit (maximum of 33 weeks) and Post-surgical follow-up visit (maximum of 41 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Number of Participants Analyzed refers to participants who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of this outcome measure prior to end of study treatment. Number Analyzed refers to those who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at both baseline and each specific visit. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; may or may not be smaller than &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; due to individual missing values.</population>

            <title>Talazoparib 1 mg QD</title>
            <description>During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.&#xD;
Safety follow-up (end of treatment visit) occurred approximately 28 calendar days after the last dose of talazoparib or after permanent treatment discontinuation or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurred first).&#xD;
Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>

        <description>EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer module developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of participants with breast cancer, consisting of 2 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, and 3 single-item scales. Each scale has 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the functional scale of future perspective, participants self-rated how much they were worried about their health in the future. Negative change from baseline values indicates worsening of future perspective and positive change indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Breast Symptoms Per EORTC QLQ-BR23</title>
        <description>EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer module developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of participants with breast cancer, consisting of 2 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, and 3 single-item scales. Each scale has 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the breast symptoms scale, participants self-rated how much they had pain or skin problems (e.g. itchy, dry, flaky) on or in the area of affected breast, and how much this area was swollen or oversensitive during the past week. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement of breast symptoms and positive change indicates deterioration.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 15, Day 1 of Cycles 3-6, End of Treatment visit (maximum of 33 weeks) and Post-surgical follow-up visit (maximum of 41 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Number of Participants Analyzed refers to participants who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of this outcome measure prior to end of study treatment. Number Analyzed refers to those who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at both baseline and each specific visit. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; may or may not be smaller than &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; due to individual missing values.</population>

            <title>Talazoparib 1 mg QD</title>
            <description>During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.&#xD;
Safety follow-up (end of treatment visit) occurred approximately 28 calendar days after the last dose of talazoparib or after permanent treatment discontinuation or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurred first).&#xD;
Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Arm Symptoms Per EORTC QLQ-BR23</title>
        <description>EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer module developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of participants with breast cancer, consisting of 2 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, and 3 single-item scales. Each scale has 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the arm symptoms scale, participants self-rated how much they had pain in the arm or shoulder, how much the arm or hand was swollen, and difficulty in raising the arm or moving it sideways. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement of arm symptoms and positive change indicates deterioration.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 15, Day 1 of Cycles 3-6, End of Treatment visit (maximum of 33 weeks) and Post-surgical follow-up visit (maximum of 41 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Number of Participants Analyzed refers to participants who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of this outcome measure prior to end of study treatment. Number Analyzed refers to those who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at both baseline and each specific visit. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; may or may not be smaller than &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; due to individual missing values.</population>

            <description>During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.&#xD;
Safety follow-up (end of treatment visit) occurred approximately 28 calendar days after the last dose of talazoparib or after permanent treatment discontinuation or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurred first).&#xD;
Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>

            <description>During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.&#xD;
Safety follow-up (end of treatment visit) occurred approximately 28 calendar days after the last dose of talazoparib or after permanent treatment discontinuation or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurred first).&#xD;
Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Upset by Hair Loss Per EORTC QLQ-BR23</title>
          <description>EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer module developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess the quality of life of participants with breast cancer, consisting of 2 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, and 3 single-item scales. Each scale has 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales.&#xD;
For the upset by hair loss scale, participants self-rated how upset they were due to loss of hair during the past week. Negative change from baseline values indicates improvement of upset by hair loss and positive change indicates deterioration.</description>
          <population>Number of Participants Analyzed refers to participants who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of this outcome measure prior to end of study treatment. Number Analyzed refers to those who completed the PRO assessment of this outcome measure at both baseline and each specific visit. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; may or may not be smaller than &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; due to individual missing values.</population>

        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales. For the nausea and vomiting symptoms scale, participants self-rated how much they had felt nauseated and/or vomited during the past week. A 10 point change from baseline was used to indicate clinically meaningful change. Deterioration in nausea and vomiting symptoms was defined as a 10 point or more increase from baseline for that specific time point.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Improvement in Nausea/Vomiting Symptoms</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales. For the nausea and vomiting symptoms scale, participants self-rated how much they had felt nauseated and/or vomited during the past week. A 10 point change from baseline was used to indicate clinically meaningful change. Improvement in nausea and vomiting symptoms was defined as a 10 point or more decrease from baseline for that specific time point.</description>

        <population>The analysis population included all participants who completed a baseline and at least one post-baseline QoL assessment prior to end of study treatment.

Safety follow-up (end of treatment visit) occurred approximately 28 calendar days after the last dose of talazoparib or after permanent treatment discontinuation or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurred first).&#xD;
Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>

Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>

          <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific instrument that assesses participant reported outcomes, consisting of 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales, a GHS/QoL scale, and 6 single-item scales. The GHS/QoL scale has 7 possible scores of responses (1=very poor to 7=excellent). All other items have 4 possible scores (1=not at all to 4=very much). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best for GHS/QoL and functional scales, and 0 being the best and 100 being the worst for symptoms scales. For the nausea and vomiting symptoms scale, participants self-rated how much they had felt nauseated and/or vomited during the past week. A 10 point change from baseline was used to indicate clinically meaningful change. No change in nausea/vomiting symptoms=having neither deterioration (≥10 point increase from baseline) nor improvement (≥10 point decrease from baseline) for the time point.</description>
          <population>The analysis population included all participants who completed a baseline and at least one post-baseline QoL assessment prior to end of study treatment. Number of Participants Analyzed refers to participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure. Number analyzed refers to participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure at the specific visit.</population>

      <time_frame>Adverse events were assessed from Baseline to 28 days after the last dose of talazoparib (maximum of approximately 8 months). All-cause mortality was assessed from Baseline until participant died or withdrew consent for follow-up, or study termination (maximum of approximately 16 months).</time_frame>
      <desc>The same event may appear as both an AE and an SAE. An event may be categorized as serious in one participant and as non-serious in another participant, or one participant may have experienced both a serious and non-serious event during the study.

          <title>Talazoparib 1 mg QD</title>
          <description>During talazoparib treatment period, participants received oral administration of talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks (6 cycles, 4 weeks per cycle), or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline, followed by definitive breast surgery within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose.&#xD;
Safety follow-up (end of treatment visit) occurred approximately 28 calendar days after the last dose of talazoparib or after permanent treatment discontinuation or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurred first).&#xD;
Long-term follow-up was planned to be at least 3 years, which started from the date of surgery for event-free survival (EFS) and after first dose of talazoparib for overall survival (OS).</description>
