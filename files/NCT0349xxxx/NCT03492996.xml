      The primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the absorption, metabolism, excretion of LCB01-0371 after a single oral&#xD;
      LCB01-0371 dose with a [14C]-LCB01-0371-tracer dose to healthy subjects&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, one-sequence, one-period, single arm&#xD;
      study in healthy male subjects. A total of 6 subjects will be enrolled in the study, and a&#xD;
      minimum of 4 evaluable subjects are considered sufficient. An evaluable subject is defined as&#xD;
      a subject who has provided whole blood, plasma, exhalation and excreta samples sufficient for&#xD;
      evaluation of the primary objectives. Study subjects will be screened for eligibility to&#xD;
      participate in the study within 28 days before dosing.&#xD;
