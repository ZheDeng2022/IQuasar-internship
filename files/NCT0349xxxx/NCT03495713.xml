  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II single-arm, single-site, open label clinical trial with r/r HL patients,&#xD;
      aimed to determine whether a RadVax approach using low-dose RT added to nivolumab can improve&#xD;
      response among patients who do not achieve a CR to nivolumab alone. The long-term goal is to&#xD;
      develop an effective regimen for r/r HL patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nivolumab 3 mg/kg will be administered on day 1 (pre-response assessment week 0) and on day 1&#xD;
      and continued per standard of care and institutional practices. At the week 1 biomarker&#xD;
      collection, research FDG PET/CT will be performed to assess for FDG &quot;flare.&quot; At week 8-12,&#xD;
      PET/CT will be performed for the first response assessment. If a complete anatomic response&#xD;
      is seen, nivolumab monotherapy will be continued on day 1 and continued per standard of care&#xD;
      and institutional practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By contrast, if at week 8 less than a complete anatomic response is seen, radiotherapy to 4&#xD;
      Gy x 2 fractions will be administered (post-response assessment week 0). The patient will be&#xD;
      evaluated by a radiation oncologist while on treatment, and toxicities will be recorded.&#xD;
      Nivolumab will be continued on day 1 and continued per standard of care and institutional&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In either scenario, a second response assessment will be conducted ~8-12 weeks after the&#xD;
      first response assessment. In either scenario, nivolumab monotherapy will be continued at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating medical oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is less than CR post-RT and there is an additional untreated non-target lesion that&#xD;
      can be followed, radiotherapy can again be administered when disease progresses to a&#xD;
      previously untreated lesion, after which the patient will continue on the post-RT follow-up&#xD;
      algorithm.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will receive initial treatment with the immunomodulatory agent, nivolumab, followed by low-dose (4 Gy x 2) involved-site radiotherapy in subjects with less than an anatomic CR after the first restaging scan. Patients with anatomic CR will continue nivolumab alone without radiotherapy. Eligible patients will have r/r disease with at least 2 sites of measurable disease, and must be eligible for treatment with nivolumab.</description>
