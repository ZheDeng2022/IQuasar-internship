  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective early life programs that reduce the long-term non-communicable diseases (NCDs) risk&#xD;
      could bring great economic benefits to the society. However, there is a lack of local data on&#xD;
      the effect of nutrition on child growth and most research on early life intervention focus on&#xD;
      disease models such as obese women to improve offspring health outcomes. There is limited&#xD;
      research on postpartum interventions in the community that optimize maternal and infant&#xD;
      nutrition through improving success of breastfeeding, infant growth diet quality and&#xD;
      microbiota to enhance health in the adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it is hypothesized that our early nutrition program could promote&#xD;
      breastfeeding successful rate (increase the number of months the mothers breastfed their&#xD;
      infants) and improve growth status, diet quality and microbiota of the infants which may&#xD;
      reduce the risk of NCDs in the adulthood. The planned project proposal would like to include&#xD;
      240 pairs of mothers and infants. In order to test the protocol in the planned proposal, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to run a pilot study to set up this community based early nutrition&#xD;
      program including breastfeeding workshops and supports, healthy lifestyle courses, parenting&#xD;
      education, introduction of solid foods for infants, child development and cooking classes of&#xD;
      infant foods. the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of this early nutrition&#xD;
      program and determine its impacts on breastfeeding, infant growth (by comparing infants'&#xD;
      biomarkers and microbiota in different stages) , diet quality and microbiota, as well as the&#xD;
      benefits to the postpartum mothers such as reducing the postpartum weight retention so that&#xD;
      to generate pilot result and facilitate the up scale study that the investigators proposed in&#xD;
      the planned proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal is that a long term follow up with the children in this project could also&#xD;
      be arranged to determine the long term health effects of this early nutrition program.&#xD;

      Study background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective early life programs that reduce the long-term non-communicable diseases (NCDs) risk&#xD;
      could bring great economic benefits to the society. NCDs are responsible for roughly&#xD;
      two-thirds of worldwide death and cause large burden of health care cost. Most policies&#xD;
      nowadays that combat disease focus on treatment after disease occurs and on reducing risk&#xD;
      factors in adult life. Early life interventions are an unexplored and promising new avenue of&#xD;
      health policy . One of the oldest US early life intervention programs, the Carolina&#xD;
      Abecedarian Project, started from 1970s has been shown to have substantial benefits in&#xD;
      boosting adult health. However, most research on early life intervention focus on disease&#xD;
      models such as obese women to improve offspring health outcomes. There is limited research on&#xD;
      postpartum interventions in the community that optimize maternal and infant nutrition through&#xD;
      improving success of breastfeeding, infant growth, diet quality and microbiota to enhance&#xD;
      health in the adulthood&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effects of postpartum nutrition program on i) success of breastfeeding by&#xD;
      comparing the average duration of breastfeeding between intervention group and control group&#xD;
      (primary outcome) ii) diet quality of the infants and mothers (secondary outcome) The diet&#xD;
      quality will be measured by 3-day dietary records using Diet Quality Index-International&#xD;
      (DQI-I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, the DQI-I assesses four categories (variety, adequacy, moderation, and overall&#xD;
      balance) and contains six food items and 11 nutrient items. This scoring scale is complex.&#xD;
      The maximum possible score for each category ranges from 10 to 40 points, and the full score&#xD;
      is 100 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paired t-tests will be used to compare the difference between intervention group and control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) the infant growth by comparing the Z-scores of weight-for-age, length-for-age,&#xD;
      BMI-for-age and head circumference-for-age at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 month old between&#xD;
      intervention group and control group (secondary outcome) Z-score (or SD-score) = (observed&#xD;
      value - median value of the reference population) / standard deviation value of reference&#xD;
      population&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) the microbiota profiles (secondary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of Investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, a randomized controlled trial will be conducted which subjects will be 40&#xD;
      pairs of local Chinese healthy postpartum mothers aged 18-40 years old and their infants. The&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned into 1:1 ratio to the control group or the&#xD;
      intervention group. A study coordinator will randomize subjects by means of a&#xD;
      computer-generated list of random numbers in blocks of 4. Treatment assignments will be&#xD;
      concealed in consecutively-numbered sealed envelopes, which will be opened sequentially upon&#xD;
      subject enrollment.&#xD;
