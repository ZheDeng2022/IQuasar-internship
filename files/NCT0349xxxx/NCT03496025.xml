  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of the trial is to study the activations of paralyzed facial muscles in a unilateral&#xD;
      facial nerve palsy with a multi-channel electrical stimulator. The principle of the device is&#xD;
      to measure muscle activity of the healthy side of the face by surface electromyography (EMG)&#xD;
      and to use this information to stimulate the corresponding muscles of the paralyzed side. The&#xD;
      ultimate goal is to develop a prosthetic device for persons with a facial nerve palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of several different studies. The studies' aims are 1. To study&#xD;
      activations of paralyzed facial muscles by the electrical stimulation. 2. To study different&#xD;
      stimulation pulse waveforms, frequencies, and electrode placement and their effect on the&#xD;
      muscle activations and the tolerability of the stimulation. 3. To study whether a symmetrical&#xD;
      movement on the paralyzed side can be achieved with electrical stimulation when compared to&#xD;
      the movements of the healthy side. 4. To study tolerability of stimulation-elicited eye blink&#xD;
      when watching a film and the effect of the stimulation-induced blink on the eye symptoms, the&#xD;
      visual acuity, and the effects of the stimulation on the lacrimal fluid. 5. To develop a&#xD;
      method for facial pacing, i.e. measuring the muscle activations on the healthy side of the&#xD;
      face and to use this information to stimulate and activate the healthy side of the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty subjects with a chronic facial nerve palsy are recruited to the studies. Each subject&#xD;
      can participate in one or several studies. Another forty subjects with an acute facial nerve&#xD;
      palsy are recruited to the study on the tolerability and effect on the eye symptoms.&#xD;
      Additionally, altogether ninety healthy volunteers are recruited to the studies in order to&#xD;
      gather preliminary information on the tolerability and the effects of the stimulations.&#xD;

    <description>The offline video analysis is done to determine the current threshold at which a movement of the target muscle is produced. Possible activations of the other muscles alongside the target muscle are also observed. The amplitude of the movement is analyzed offline from a video recording either visually by the investigators, or measured with a digital ruler. With visual evaluation, the outcome is measured on a rough level, i.e. whether the stimulated movement was larger in amplitude compared to the voluntary movement. With a digital ruler, the results a presented numerically (millimeters). The stimulated activation is compared to the voluntary activation of the muscle. Further, in some sub-studies, the facial activations are evaluated with the Facial Action Coding System.</description>
