  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate a preventive intervention program designed to support&#xD;
      families (parents and typically developing adolescent siblings) that include a child with an&#xD;
      intellectual and/or developmental disability. Participant families will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to either the treatment condition, in which they will receive psychoeducation and&#xD;
      communication coaching over a four-week period, or the control condition, in which they will&#xD;
      receive self-study materials. All subjects will participate in a pre-test assessment and&#xD;
      three post-test assessments over the course of the year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A critical need exists for an evidence-based program to ameliorate the impact of family&#xD;
      stress and conflict on the overall well-being of parents and TD siblings, as well as&#xD;
      individuals with IDD. Our objective in this study is to test the efficacy for parents, TD&#xD;
      siblings, and children with IDD of an adaptation of the psycho-educational and communication&#xD;
      training approach used in a previously validated prevention/intervention program for&#xD;
      community families, and to examine the mechanisms associated with change processes that occur&#xD;
      as a result of the 4-week program. Our long-term goal is to increase the availability and&#xD;
      affordability of empirically-supported family-systems approaches to reduce family stress and&#xD;
      conflict in families of individuals with IDD. Our central hypothesis is that participation in&#xD;
      the program will support the identified needs of families with a child with IDD, improve the&#xD;
      well-being and adjustment of parents, increase emotional security and adjustment for TD&#xD;
      siblings, and be associated with improvements in adaptive functioning for individuals with&#xD;
      IDD. This central hypothesis is supported by promising qualitative evidence and preliminary&#xD;
      analyses from an ongoing pilot study using the adapted curriculum included in the present&#xD;
      proposal. Our rationale is that providing a family-systems approach to improving the family&#xD;
      environment will support the well-being of each family member, including the child with IDD.&#xD;
      The specific aims are: (1) determining the efficacy of the program for parents, (2a)&#xD;
      determining the efficacy of the program for typically developing siblings, (2b) testing&#xD;
      process models, guided by the Emotional Security Theory (EST; Davies &amp; Cummings, 1994), to&#xD;
      explain how and why and for whom and when changes occur as a result of the program, and (3)&#xD;
      examining the impact of the program on individuals with IDD. Families (n=150) that include a&#xD;
      child with IDD and a TD sibling between 11 and 17 years of age, will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of two groups: (1) parent and typically developing sibling intervention, or (2) resource&#xD;
      only control. Multi-method assessments of all family members will be obtained at pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention visits, and 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. The approach is innovative&#xD;
      because it addresses multiple family members' needs, tests theory about explanatory models&#xD;
      for program impact, and utilizes a brief, psycho-educational format and a RCT design to&#xD;
      evaluate its efficacy. This research is significant because it will create an inexpensive&#xD;
      model program for family-system-level interventions for families of children with IDD,&#xD;
      benefiting parents, siblings and the child with IDD, including evaluations of program&#xD;
      effectiveness in standing community centers.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Individual with IDD falls into one or more of the following categories: 1) meets&#xD;
             criteria for an intellectual disability, which would mean a measured IQ of 70-75 or&#xD;

             expert clinical judgment based on DSM-5 ASD criteria, or 3) has a medically verified&#xD;
             genetic condition (e.g., Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Williams syndrome,&#xD;
             Angelman syndrome, others) that is generally considered to be a developmental&#xD;
             disability, and shows cognitive or adaptive functioning deficits (70-75 or below)&#xD;
             although not necessarily deficits in both categories as would be needed for an&#xD;
             Intellectual Disability diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Siblings identified as typically developing will be excluded 1) with a score of 10 or&#xD;
