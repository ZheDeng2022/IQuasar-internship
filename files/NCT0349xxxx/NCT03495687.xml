    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine differences between respiratory function in female&#xD;
      fibromyalgia patients and healthy controls. The study will also examine differences in spine&#xD;
      mobility and pain intensity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is characterized by persistent widespread pain and affects approximately 1-3% of&#xD;
      the general population. Fibromyalgia is a multifactorial syndrome and much research has been&#xD;
      done and several interesting facts discovered. Still, the etiology is unknown. The autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system may be the cause of several symptoms of this condition and a pattern of&#xD;
      abnormal autonomous functions has been described . Besides the autonomous nerve system the&#xD;
      respiratory system has also potential to impact various body organs mainly by altered blood&#xD;
      gas chemistry. Deviant respiratory function in local pain condition as in cervical and lumbar&#xD;
      spine has been reported. Respiratory function in generalized pain as in people with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia has not been given much consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is an observational cross sectional study with the purpose to examine&#xD;
      respiratory function in a group of females with fibromyalgia and compare with age-matched&#xD;
      controls. Peak expiratory flow (PEF), Chest mobility, spinal mobility and pain palpation&#xD;
      where measured at the same visit. Data about smoking habits was registered and in patients&#xD;
      also the duration of pain. Measurement of the subject's weight and height were recorded and&#xD;
      the body mass index (BMI) was calculated. For evaluation of forced exhalation, a Wright peak&#xD;
      expiratory flow meter was used. PEF was measured three times and the best result was&#xD;
      recorded. Spinal mobility was measured by using the Cervico-thoracic ratio (CTR) method. The&#xD;
      CTR measure was done in a sitting position with the subject instructed to sit in an upright&#xD;
      posture and look straight in front of them. The spinous process of the seventh cervical&#xD;
      vertebra (C7) was palpated as the referent point and a mark was made on the vertex followed&#xD;
      by marks for each motion segment between C7 to the fifth thoracic vertebra (T5) by using a&#xD;
      CTR measuring strip. Then the subjects were told to flex the chin and the trunk forward as&#xD;
      much as possible. Again, the distance between C7 and T5 was measured and the difference&#xD;
      between measurements in upright position and maximum flexed position was calculated in mm for&#xD;
      each segment to a total sum for all segments from C7-T5. A tape measure was used to measure&#xD;
      the mobility of the thorax at maximum inhalation and exhalation at the level of proc.&#xD;
      Xiphoideus. Every measurement was performed three times and the best measurement was&#xD;
      recorded. Manual palpation for pain was done over the upper thoracic spine in the same area&#xD;
      as the spinal mobility was measured, with subjects lying prone on an examination table. A&#xD;
      total of 20 locations were palpated from C7 to T5. First left side facets, and then left side&#xD;
      costotransverse joints in the same segmental level. The same procedure was then used for the&#xD;
      right side. Palpation was done with a force of approximately 4kg/sq cm (equating to blanching&#xD;
      of the thumb or fingernail). After each point was palpated the subject estimated perceived&#xD;
      pain on a visual analogue scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A ratio was also constructed by PEF (l / min) / chest expansion (cm) called&#xD;
      expiratory-inspiratory ratio.&#xD;
