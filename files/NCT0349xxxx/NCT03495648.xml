  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Tanglewood Trail Walking Program is a well-established community health initiative that&#xD;
      encourages community members to walk approximately 1 mile to the Whitesburg Farmers Market&#xD;
      each Saturday. The study aims to determine if walking to the market with a community health&#xD;
      coach results in healthier options being selected at the market.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the summer of 2017, community members of Whitesburg, KY were recruited to join the&#xD;
      Tanglewood Trail Walking Program to the Whitesburg farmers market. Each Saturday,&#xD;
      participants reported whether or not they walked the 1-mile trail to the farmers market and&#xD;
      they reported which fruits and vegetables they purchased. The Walking Program was held June -&#xD;
      Sept 2017. Participants completed questionnaires about fruit and vegetable consumption and&#xD;
      physical activity. Participants also provided physical and biological measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although originally designed to compare data among walkers and non-walkers, the protocol was&#xD;
      changed due to participant feasibility. Data were analyzed by comparing &quot;low engagers&quot; -&#xD;
      those who walked to the market fewer than three times during the program - or &quot;high engagers&quot;&#xD;
      - those who walked three or more times during the program. Data were collected at baseline&#xD;
      and 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data for years 2019 and 2020 of the Tanglewood to Trail walking program are registered&#xD;
      separately in ClinicalTrials.gov.&#xD;

          <description>The ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) risk is a national guideline developed by the American College of Cardiology. It is a calculation of the 10-year risk of having a cardiovascular problem, such as a heart attack or stroke. This risk estimate considers age, sex, race, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, medication use, diabetic status, and smoking status, with a range from 0 to &gt;20. Lower scores indicate lower risk of cardiovascular disease.</description>
