      1. To assess the incidence of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in adult AML patients, and to explore&#xD;
           their associations with the patients' clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular&#xD;
           characteristics as well as with treatment response and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To delineate the similarities and distinctions among mutations at IDH1-R132, IDH2-R140&#xD;
           and IDH2-R172 in AML, both clinically and molecularly (including cytogenetics,&#xD;
           immunophenotyping, mutation co-occurrence patterns).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The results can be references for future selection of targeted therapy (targeting IDH&#xD;
           mutant proteins).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH) are enzymes that catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of&#xD;
      isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG). IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in AML give the enzymes&#xD;
      neomorphic enzymatic activity to transform α-KG to D-2HG, an oncometabolite which acts as a&#xD;
      competitive inhibitor of dioxygenases, and causes dysregulation of TET2 and histone&#xD;
      demethylases, consequently leading to epigenetic reprogramming of a cell, blocking&#xD;
      differentiation and contributing to a transformed phenotype, and leukemogenesis.&#xD;
      Investigators plan to recruit 300 adult AML patients (newly diagnosed or relapsed). 10mL of&#xD;
      peripheral blood or marrow blood will be obtained from routine practice blood/marrow sampling&#xD;
      specimens (no extra venipuncture or bone marrow aspiration would be required) and sent for&#xD;
      routine tests such as cytogenetics, immunophenotyping, and gene mutation analyses. IDH1 R132,&#xD;
      IDH2 R140, and IDH2 R172 mutations will be screened by PCR followed by Sanger sequencing, as&#xD;
      previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will first assess the incidence of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in adult AML&#xD;
      patients, and then explore their associations with the patients' clinical course,&#xD;
      cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics as well as with treatment response and outcome.&#xD;
      Investigators also seek to delineate the similarities and distinctions among IDH mutation&#xD;
      variants at IDH1-R132, IDH2-R140 and IDH2-R172, both clinically and molecularly (including&#xD;
      cytogenetics, immunophenotyping, mutation co-occurrence patterns).&#xD;
