    <textblock>
      This study explores whether it is feasible to use a newly developed activity pacing framework&#xD;
      to standardise how activity pacing is instructed by healthcare professionals in&#xD;
      rehabilitation programmes for patients with chronic pain/fatigue.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Activity pacing is frequently advised in the management of chronic pain/fatigue, including&#xD;
      chronic low back pain, chronic widespread pain/fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue&#xD;
      syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis. However, there is no agreed definition of 'activity&#xD;
      pacing' and it is instructed in various ways. For some, pacing involves adapting/limiting&#xD;
      activities (for example, breaking down tasks/having rests); while for others, pacing involves&#xD;
      having consistent activities/gradually increasing activities. Furthermore, pacing has been&#xD;
      associated with both improved symptoms (decreased fatigue/anxiety/depression) and worsened&#xD;
      symptoms (increased pain/disability).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the high prevalence and cost (personal and financial) of chronic pain/fatigue, it is&#xD;
      imperative that coping strategies such as pacing are clearly defined and evidence-based. This&#xD;
      study involves Stage III in the development of an activity pacing framework to standardise&#xD;
      how pacing is instructed by healthcare professionals. Stage I: Online Survey of pacing&#xD;
      involved 92 healthcare professionals (doctors/nurses/physiotherapists/occupational&#xD;
      therapists/clinical psychologists). The survey findings, together with existing research were&#xD;
      used to develop the pacing framework. The framework was further developed in Stage II:&#xD;
      Nominal Group Technique (consensus meeting), involving four patients and six healthcare&#xD;
      professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage III will test the feasibility of implementing the pacing framework clinically, by using&#xD;
      it to underpin existing rehabilitation programmes for chronic pain/fatigue. Patients will&#xD;
      attend rehabilitation programmes at the study sites as per usual practice. Patients'&#xD;
      participation in this study involves their completion of a booklet of questionnaires. The aim&#xD;
      of this feasibility study is to explore whether the activity pacing framework is usable in&#xD;
      the clinical setting, to explore recruitment/retention rates, together with changes in&#xD;
      symptoms between the start and end of treatment, and at 3-months follow-up. Stage III will&#xD;
      also explore the acceptability of the framework by undertaking interviews with the patients&#xD;
      and healthcare professionals involved in the rehabilitation programmes. Stage III is expected&#xD;
      to last 22 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future study will test the framework in a clinical trial to assess the effects of pacing on&#xD;
      patients' symptoms. The pacing framework has the potential to improve treatments by providing&#xD;
      guidance on the components of pacing found to have benefits for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is funded by a Health Education England/National Institute for Health Research&#xD;
      (HEE/NIHR) Integrated Clinical Academic (ICA) Clinical Lectureship.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change in activity pacing from baseline (pre-treatment: up to one week before the programme) to the end of the 6-week's programme</time_frame>
    <description>The Activity Pacing Questionnaire (APQ) was developed to measure different themes of activity pacing. The APQ was initially validated among a sample of patients with chronic pain/fatigue and contained 26 items. Factor analysis identified five themes of pacing contained within the APQ-26: Activity adjustment, Activity consistency, Activity planning, Activity acceptance and Activity progression.&#xD;
The APQ-26 has been modified for the purpose of this study with the addition of two items to correspond to important aspects of pacing that were not included in the APQ-26. The APQ-28 reflects the content of the activity pacing framework.&#xD;
The APQ-28 will be used to assess the changes in activity pacing from baseline (pre-treatment: up to one week before the programme) to end of the programme (6-week's programme).&#xD;
Each of the five themes of pacing is calculated as a mean score (0-4), where higher scores indicated more implementation of pacing strategies.</description>

    <description>The activity pacing framework will be used to structure and standardise the instructions of pacing in existing rehabilitation programmes for adult patients with chronic pain/fatigue. The activity pacing framework has been developed in Stages I and II of this research. Stage I involved an online survey of activity pacing across healthcare professionals in England. The survey findings, together with existing research were used to develop the first draft of the framework. The framework was refined in Stage II: Nominal group technique (consensus method). The activity pacing framework describes the aims, facets and stages of pacing, together with how pacing relates to different behavioural typologies and other pain management strategies.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>For the feasibility study, patient recruitment occurred between 21st May 2018 and 3rd September 2019. Patients were recruited from those referred to a rehabilitation programme within a physiotherapy-led, out-patient service in a National Health Service (NHS) Trust in Northern England.&#xD;
The acceptability interviews involved patients (as above) and healthcare professionals (HCPs) delivering the programmes. HCP recruitment occurred between 18th September 2019 and 6th November 2019.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This was a single-arm feasibility study. All patients received the same treatment, that is, they all attended the same rehabilitation programme that was underpinned by the activity pacing framework. Excluded from the study were those patients who did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Adult patients attending rehabilitation programmes underpinned by the activity pacing framework.&#xD;
Activity pacing framework: The activity pacing framework will be used to structure and standardise the instructions of pacing in existing rehabilitation programmes for adult patients with chronic pain/fatigue. The activity pacing framework has been developed in Stages I and II of this research. Stage I involved an online survey of activity pacing across healthcare professionals in England. The survey findings, together with existing research were used to develop the first draft of the framework. The framework was refined in Stage II: Nominal group technique (consensus method). The activity pacing framework describes the aims, facets and stages of pacing, together with how pacing relates to different behavioural typologies and other pain management strategies.</description>

        <title>Change in Activity Pacing Questionnaire (APQ-28) From Baseline to the End of the 6-week's Programme</title>
        <description>The Activity Pacing Questionnaire (APQ) was developed to measure different themes of activity pacing. The APQ was initially validated among a sample of patients with chronic pain/fatigue and contained 26 items. Factor analysis identified five themes of pacing contained within the APQ-26: Activity adjustment, Activity consistency, Activity planning, Activity acceptance and Activity progression.&#xD;
The APQ-26 has been modified for the purpose of this study with the addition of two items to correspond to important aspects of pacing that were not included in the APQ-26. The APQ-28 reflects the content of the activity pacing framework.&#xD;
The APQ-28 will be used to assess the changes in activity pacing from baseline (pre-treatment: up to one week before the programme) to end of the programme (6-week's programme).&#xD;
Each of the five themes of pacing is calculated as a mean score (0-4), where higher scores indicated more implementation of pacing strategies.</description>

Activity pacing framework: The activity pacing framework will be used to structure and standardise the instructions of pacing in existing rehabilitation programmes for adult patients with chronic pain/fatigue. The activity pacing framework has been developed in Stages I and II of this research. Stage I involved an online survey of activity pacing across healthcare professionals in England. The survey findings, together with existing research were used to develop the first draft of the framework. The framework was refined in Stage II: Nominal group technique (consensus method). The activity pacing framework describes the aims, facets and stages of pacing, together with how pacing relates to different behavioural typologies and other pain management strategies.</description>

        <title>Activity Pacing at the End of Treatment: Activity Pacing Questionnaire (APQ-28)</title>
        <description>The Activity Pacing Questionnaire (APQ) was developed to measure different themes of activity pacing. The APQ was initially validated among a sample of patients with chronic pain/fatigue and contained 26 items. Factor analysis identified five themes of pacing contained within the APQ-26: Activity adjustment, Activity consistency, Activity planning, Activity acceptance and Activity progression.&#xD;
The APQ-26 has been modified for the purpose of this study with the addition of two items to correspond to important aspects of pacing that were not included in the APQ-26. The APQ-28 reflects the content of the activity pacing framework.&#xD;
The APQ-28 will be used to measure activity pacing at the end of the 6-week's programme.&#xD;
Each of the five themes of pacing is calculated as a mean score (0-4), where higher scores indicated more implementation of pacing strategies.</description>

Activity pacing framework: The activity pacing framework will be used to structure and standardise the instructions of pacing in existing rehabilitation programmes for adult patients with chronic pain/fatigue. The activity pacing framework has been developed in Stages I and II of this research. Stage I involved an online survey of activity pacing across healthcare professionals in England. The survey findings, together with existing research were used to develop the first draft of the framework. The framework was refined in Stage II: Nominal group technique (consensus method). The activity pacing framework describes the aims, facets and stages of pacing, together with how pacing relates to different behavioural typologies and other pain management strategies.</description>

The activity pacing framework has been developed in Stages I and II of this research. Stage I involved an online survey of activity pacing across healthcare professionals in England. The survey findings, together with existing research were used to develop the first draft of the framework. The framework was refined in Stage II: Nominal group technique (consensus method). The activity pacing framework describes the aims, facets and stages of pacing, together with how pacing relates to different behavioural typologies and other pain management strategies.</description>

          <description>The Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) contains seven items that screen for and measure the severity of anxiety in the clinical setting. The items are based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV). This will be measured at baseline (pre-treatment: up to one week before the programme). The total range of scores is 0-21, where 5-9=mild anxiety, 10-14=moderate anxiety and ≥15=severe anxiety.</description>

        <title>Fatigue at the End of Treatment: Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ)</title>
        <description>The Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ) contains two subscales: physical fatigue (seven items) and mental fatigue (four items). This will be measured at the end of the 6-week's programme. The total range for physical fatigue is 7-28 and the range for mental fatigue is 4-16, where higher scores indicated less fatigue.</description>
        <time_frame>6-weeks (end of the programme)</time_frame>
        <population>65 participants completed the 6-weeks questionnaire booklet (T2). However, there were three missing answers on the Physical fatigue subscale (n=62) and one missing answer on the Mental fatigue scale (n=64).</population>

Activity pacing framework: The activity pacing framework will be used to structure and standardise the instructions of pacing in existing rehabilitation programmes for adult patients with chronic pain/fatigue. The activity pacing framework has been developed in Stages I and II of this research. Stage I involved an online survey of activity pacing across healthcare professionals in England. The survey findings, together with existing research were used to develop the first draft of the framework. The framework was refined in Stage II: Nominal group technique (consensus method). The activity pacing framework describes the aims, facets and stages of pacing, together with how pacing relates to different behavioural typologies and other pain management strategies.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The target sample size of n=50 patients at 3-months follow-up (T3) for the feasibility study was attained (actual sample at T3: n=52). Despite recruiting to target for the feasibility study, this sample was not powered with a control arm to determine treatment effectiveness.&#xD;
The generalisability of this study is limited to a sample of predominantly females, of white ethnic origin and recruited from only one Pain Service in Northern England, United Kingdom (UK).</limitations_and_caveats>
