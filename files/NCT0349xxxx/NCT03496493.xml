  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative non-invasive measurement of a patient's peripheral arterial oxygen saturation&#xD;
      has become an accepted standard of care endorsed by anaesthesiologists and their regulatory&#xD;
      bodies throughout the world. Pulse oximeters are an integral item on the World Health&#xD;
      Organisation's Surgical Safety Checklist which is performed prior to the commencement of&#xD;
      every surgical procedure. They are also utilised by other medical professionals and patients&#xD;
      in various scenarios. When compared to conventional bedside pulse oximeters, portable&#xD;
      fingertip devices have the advantages of cost-effectiveness, high portability, ease of use&#xD;
      and battery operation. A review of recent literature reveals a paucity of accuracy studies in&#xD;
      adult patients with various comorbidities in the clinical setting. Most data has been&#xD;
      obtained under ideal laboratory conditions utilizing healthy adult volunteers. This study&#xD;
      aims to pragmatically investigate the performance of a portable fingertip pulse oximeter in&#xD;
      adult patients in a hospital setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, quantitative study is to compare the agreement between the&#xD;
      measured arterial oxygen saturation levels using a portable fingertip versus a conventional&#xD;
      bedside pulse oximeter in adult surgical patients, presenting for elective and emergency&#xD;
      surgery to Groote Schuur Hospital over a four-week period. Adult surgical patients, not&#xD;
      meeting any exclusion criteria, who present for elective or emergency surgery will be&#xD;
      recruited. 200 data pairs (SpO2, heart rate and skin tone) will be recorded in the&#xD;
      perioperative period (operating rooms, recovery room and intensive care unit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing monitoring devices will not be disturbed. The agreement between the two devices will&#xD;
      be compared using a Bland-Altman plot, Microsoft Excel and SPSS software. A root mean square&#xD;
      difference value will also be calculated from these values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No sensitive or personal patient information will be recorded, and pulse oximetry is&#xD;
      essential harmless. Potential cross-infection will be avoided by excluding patients with&#xD;
      known communicable diseases or open wounds/ bodily fluids in the area to have the oximeter&#xD;
      probes applied. The study devices will be disinfected after each use. Recruitment will not&#xD;
      affect clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significance of this study into the performance of portable fingertip pulse oximeters in&#xD;
      adult surgical patients will result in the availability of cheaper devices, deemed as vital&#xD;
      anaesthetic equipment by the WHO and various anaesthetic regulatory bodies, in lower income&#xD;
      medical facilities. It will also give anaesthetists and other medical personal the confidence&#xD;
      to make clinical decisions based on these highly portable devices, thereby making pulse&#xD;
      oximeters more available in resource limited areas. It will also add further data to existing&#xD;
      studies and help assess whether darker skin pigment affects the performance of these devices&#xD;
      in the clinical setting, which is highly relevant in an African country like South Africa.&#xD;
