    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of a targeted therapy and an immune therapy as&#xD;
      a possible treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prexasertib (LY2606368)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LY3300054&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate doses of the investigational drugs to use for&#xD;
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved prexasertib or LY3300054 as&#xD;
      a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prexasertib (LY2606368) is a checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibitor that is being developed as&#xD;
      a treatment for patients with advanced cancer. CHK1 inhibitors work by preventing the cancer&#xD;
      cells from being able to repair damaged DNA (one of the building blocks of a cell) which then&#xD;
      leads to cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A monoclonal antibody is a protein that is made in a laboratory that can target specific&#xD;
      substances in the body. LY3300054 is a monoclonal antibody that targets programmed cell death&#xD;
      ligand 1 (PD-L1). PD-L1 is a protein often produced by cancer cells or surrounding cells that&#xD;
      stops white blood cells from attacking the cancer cells. The drug blocks the protein,&#xD;
      allowing the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer cells.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity or adverse&#xD;
             events as a result of previous treatment prior to entering the study (except&#xD;
             alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years, as no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use&#xD;
             of prexasertib in combination with LY3300054 in patients &lt; 18 years of age, children&#xD;
             are excluded from this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of prexasertib and LY3300054 on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason, women of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must agree to use two highly effective forms of contraception&#xD;
             (see Section 5.5.1) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and&#xD;
             for 6 months after completion of study. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must&#xD;
             also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and for 3 months after completion of prexasertib and LY3300054&#xD;
             administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential enrolling on study must have a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;

             LH and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range for women under 50; radiation-induced&#xD;
             oophorectomy with last menses &gt; 12 months prior; or chemotherapy-induced menopause&#xD;
             with last menses &gt; 12 months prior) or surgically sterile (bilateral oophorectomy or&#xD;
             hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Patients must be willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the&#xD;
             study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, immune therapy, or radiotherapy within 3 weeks&#xD;
             (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C; five-half lives for any investigational or&#xD;
             FDA-approved kinase inhibitors) prior to entering the study. Patients who have&#xD;
             received prior CHK1 inhibitor therapy are excluded. Exposure to prior PD-L1 antibody&#xD;
             will be allowed as long as this was not the most recent treatment prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior radiation to &gt; 25% of the marrow&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have received more than 4 lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy. A line of therapy&#xD;
             is defined as being preceded by disease progression. Discontinuation of a regimen&#xD;
             without progression (for example, due to toxicity) or a switch of an agent within the&#xD;
             same drug class (for example from cisplatin to carboplatin) will not be considered a&#xD;
             new line of therapy. Similarly, maintenance therapy (continuation maintenance or&#xD;
             switch maintenance) will not be considered a new line of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have undergone major surgery within 14 days of starting the study&#xD;
             treatment, or participants who have not recovered to baseline status from the effects&#xD;
             of major surgery received more than 14 days prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial, with the exception of patients with brain metastatic disease that&#xD;
             has previously been treated and remained stable on MRI ≥ 2 months prior to enrollment,&#xD;
             without steroids or anti-epileptic medications. These patients may be enrolled at the&#xD;
             discretion of the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, uncontrolled seizures, myocardial infarction within the past 3 months,&#xD;
             superior vena cava syndrome, unstable spinal cord compression (untreated and unstable&#xD;
             for at least 28 days prior to study entry), or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have experienced a Grade ≥ 3 immune-related AE or an&#xD;
             immune-related neurologic or ocular AE of any grade while receiving prior&#xD;
             immunotherapy, or experienced a toxicity of any grade that led to permanent&#xD;
             discontinuation of prior immunotherapy as a result of the toxicity. Participants with&#xD;
             prior endocrine adverse events of Grade ≤ 2 are permitted to enroll if stably&#xD;
             maintained on appropriate replacement therapy and are asymptomatic. In the setting of&#xD;
             prior immune-related AE, participants must not have required the use of additional&#xD;
             immunosuppressive agents other than corticosteroids for the management of the adverse&#xD;
             event(s), not have experienced recurrence of the adverse event if re-challenged, and&#xD;
             not currently requiring maintenance doses of &gt; 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent per&#xD;
             day at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to prexasertib or LY3300054.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of prexasertib and LY3300054 on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason, pregnant women are excluded from this study. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with prexasertib and LY3300054, breastfeeding women are also&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible&#xD;
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with prexasertib and&#xD;
             LY3300054. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections&#xD;
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy such as prexasertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known active or chronic infection with Hepatitis B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consistent QTc &gt; 470 msec on more than one screening ECG. Patients with a history of&#xD;
             long QTc syndrome or personal or family history of ventricular arrhythmias will be&#xD;
             excluded&#xD;
