      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 7000 total knee replacements (TKAs) are done every year. More than 90% of these&#xD;
      knee replacements are performed with the use of bone cement. Traditionally, a tourniquet has&#xD;
      been, used to reduce the bleeding during surgery, enabling surgeons to perform delicate&#xD;
      dissections in a bloodless operative field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tourniquet can be defined as a constricting or compressing device used to control&#xD;
      temporarily venous and arterial circulation to an extremity. Pressure is applied&#xD;
      circumferentially on the skin and underlying tissues of a limb. This pressure is transferred&#xD;
      to the walls of vessels, causing them to become occluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that applying a tourniquet for more than 1 to 2 hours is associated with a&#xD;
      number of disadvantages, for instance, severe pain and muscle effects during the first&#xD;
      postoperative day, thereby slowing rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other side effects related to tourniquet use, include pulmonary embolus caused by venous&#xD;
      thrombosis and arterial thrombosis as a result of the dislodgement of an arterial plaque.&#xD;
      Furthermore, tourniquet-induced hypertension with general anaesthesia, muscle injury, a wide&#xD;
      spectrum of neurologic injuries, and tissue changes (Oedema compartment syndrome,&#xD;
      post-tourniquet syndrome) have been reported. An important fact is that bleeding affects the&#xD;
      quality of binding between bone and cement and thereby fixation of the knee prosthesis? Since&#xD;
      the introduction of modern cementing techniques, no previous clinical studies have&#xD;
      investigated the advantages or disadvantages of tourniquet use in knee replacement surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims/hypothesis of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the advantages and disadvantages of tourniquet use, including whether not&#xD;
           using a tourniquet reduces pain, facilitates mobilisation and recovery, and shortens&#xD;
           length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study whether use of a tourniquet affects leg muscles during and after surgery, as&#xD;
           measured by with use of microdialysis to quantify level of ischemia .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether prosthesis fixation, measured by RSA, is affected by tourniquet&#xD;
           use. Because third generation cements secure prosthesis fixation, the investigators do&#xD;
           not expect to find any clinically significant migration (less than 2 mm) 2 years after&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope that the results of our study will improve rehabilitation regimes so&#xD;
      that patients will experience less pain after surgery and thus achieve more rapid&#xD;
      mobilisation and return to their daily lives.&#xD;

      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients being able to participate in this study all have to fulfill the given inclusion&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with symptomatic and radiographic verified knee symptoms, selected for primary&#xD;
           unilateral total knee joint replacement (TKA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 50 and above (not older than 85)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI &lt; 35 and height &gt;160 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No severe cardiovascular conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No previously knee surgery done in the same knee&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral and written acceptance&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group concerning 2 x 30 patients will be randomized into two groups. Either an intervention&#xD;
      group, with absence of tourniquet or a control group with tourniquet. Which group they will&#xD;
      belong to, is blinded to patient and surgeon until they reach operation room. The operation&#xD;
      will be performed as usual, but with exception of two additional procedures. During operation&#xD;
      small spheric tantalum pellets are placed around the prosthesis. Furthermore patients are&#xD;
      prepared for microdialysis, which contain placement of 3 catheters: one in each thigh and one&#xD;
      subcutaneously in the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microdialysis is a unique technique to monitor the chemistry of the extracellular space in&#xD;
      living tissue. It is primarily used for In Vivo determinations of endogenous metabolites,&#xD;
      thus serving as an indicator for ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RSA is precision radiology where the small pellets are visual on x-ray. Using computer a 3D&#xD;
      image is created and the pellets serve as markers. These markers will be measured every 6&#xD;
      months showing whether a possible migration of the prosthesis is occurring and thereby&#xD;
      indicating a loosening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out-patient treatment Patients will among other things be followed by clinical functional&#xD;
      scores, registration of analgetica use, conventional X-ray and RSA In the long run the&#xD;
      perspective is that surgery concerning knee replacements will be conducted without the use of&#xD;
      tourniquet and thereby reducing the pain of the patients without compromising the end result&#xD;
      of the operation, namely the fixation of the prosthesis.&#xD;
