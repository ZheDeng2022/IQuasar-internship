      Development of a new MS-based biomarker for the early and sensitive diagnosis of Niemann Pick&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a lipid storage disease that can present in infants,&#xD;
      children, or adults. Neonates can present with ascites and severe liver disease from&#xD;
      infiltration of the liver and/or respiratory failure from infiltration of the lungs. Other&#xD;
      infants, without liver or pulmonary disease, have hypotonia and developmental delay. The&#xD;
      classic presentation occurs in mid-to-late childhood with the insidious onset of ataxia,&#xD;
      vertical supranuclear gaze palsy (VSGP), and dementia. Dystonia and seizures are common.&#xD;
      Dysarthria and dysphagia eventually become disabling, making oral feeding impossible; death&#xD;
      usually occurs in the late second or third decade from aspiration pneumonia. Adults are more&#xD;
      likely to present with dementia or psychiatric symptoms. The diagnosis of NPC is confirmed by&#xD;
      biochemical testing that demonstrates impaired cholesterol esterification and positive&#xD;
      filipin staining in cultured fibroblasts. Biochemical testing for carrier status is&#xD;
      unreliable. Most individuals with NPC have NPC1, caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene; fewer&#xD;
      than 20 individuals have been diagnosed with NPC2, caused by mutations in the NPC2 gene.&#xD;
      Molecular genetic testing of the NPC1 genes detects disease-causing mutations in&#xD;
      approximately 94% of individuals with NPC. Such testing is available clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NPC is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Each sib of an affected individual has a&#xD;
      25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance&#xD;
      of being unaffected and not a carrier. The phenotype (i.e., age of onset and severity of&#xD;
      symptoms) usually runs true in families. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal&#xD;
      testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible when the two disease-causing mutations&#xD;
      have been identified in the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the only accepted and easily accessible lab test, Fillipin staining of skin&#xD;
      fibroblasts, is invasive and has a rather low sensitivity and specificity and genetic&#xD;
      sequencing is tome-consuming and expensive there is an urgent need for the improvement of&#xD;
      diagnostic biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize in the blood (plasma)&#xD;
      of affected patents specific metabolic alterations that allow to diagnose in the future the&#xD;
      disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity. In a pilotstudy, NPC509 has been&#xD;
      identified as a sensitive and specific biomarker (Fig 1). The structure and&#xD;
      pathophysiological role will have to be illucidated further; however preliminary data&#xD;
      suggests that NPC509 is a feasible biomarker for NPC. After the verfication of NPC509 as a&#xD;
      biomarker for NPC, quantification and validation of NPC509 in saliva will allow for an easier&#xD;
      detection method in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though NPC is a pan-ethnic disorder, the prevalence of this autosomal-recessive disorder is&#xD;
      elevated in countries with a higher frequency of consanguinity. Therefore, we estimate that&#xD;
      every 400th newborn in Arabian countries may be eligible for inclusion due to high-grade&#xD;
      suspicion of NPC, while approximately every 2000th newborn in non-Arabian countries may be&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validation of this new biochemical marker from the blood (plasma) of the affected&#xD;
      patients is the goal of the study.&#xD;

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectometry, a blood&#xD;
      sample of maximal 10ml blood will be taken from the patient via using a dried blood spot&#xD;
      filter card. To proof the correct NPC diagnosis in those patients where up to the enrollment&#xD;
      in the study no genetic testing has been done, sequencing of NPC1 and/or NPC2 will be done.&#xD;
