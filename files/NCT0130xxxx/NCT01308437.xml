    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized, parallel group comparison of the immunogenicity safety of&#xD;
      Wockhardt's human insulin and isophane insulin compared with the Novo Nordisk's yeast based&#xD;
      human insulin products (marketed in USA) in type 1 diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two phases of the study, which are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase 1 is a comparative phase in which there will be 2 arms (which are described in the&#xD;
           section below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase 2 is a follow up phase only applicable to Wosulin Arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for 54 weeks for the patients enrolled in Wosulin arm and approximately&#xD;
      28 weeks for the patients enrolled in the comparator arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred and forty two patients will be enrolled considering an estimated dropout rate of&#xD;
      15% for a sample size of approximately 105 evaluable patients per arm. The total planned&#xD;
      enrollment period for this study is approximately 3 months (90 days).&#xD;
