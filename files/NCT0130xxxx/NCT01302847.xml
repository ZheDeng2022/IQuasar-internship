    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG) is an HIV drug in the integrase inhibitor drug class. This study will test&#xD;
      the safety of and immune response to DTG in HIV-1 infected infants, children, and&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DTG is an HIV medicine in the integrase inhibitor drug class. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of DTG in HIV-1&#xD;
      infected infants, children, and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last approximately 48 weeks, followed by long-term safety&#xD;
      follow-up that will last for about 3 years. Participants may be receiving other&#xD;
      antiretroviral (ARV) medications while in this study; these medications will be prescribed by&#xD;
      participants' doctors and will not be provided by the study. This study has two stages. Stage&#xD;
      I will evaluate the short-term tolerability and safety of DTG, allowing the selection of a&#xD;
      dose for further study in Stage II. Stage II will then provide long-term safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and efficacy data for DTG. Participants will be assigned to one of eight&#xD;
      cohorts depending on age (4 weeks to younger than 18 years of age). Participants in cohorts I&#xD;
      and IIA will receive DTG film-coated tablets; participants in cohort IIB will receive DTG&#xD;
      granules for oral suspension or DTG dispersible tablets; participants in cohorts III and IV&#xD;
      will receive DTG granules for oral suspension; and participants in cohorts III-DT, IV-DT, and&#xD;
      V-DT will receive DTG dispersible tablets. Participants will receive DTG orally once or twice&#xD;
      daily, depending on which other ARV medications they are receiving. (All eight cohorts will&#xD;
      be included in Stage I of the study; however, Stage II of the study will not include cohort&#xD;
      IIB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I participants will undergo a physical examination and have blood drawn at each of 10&#xD;
      study visits, occurring on Day 0; Day 5 (+5 days); and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and&#xD;
      48. Stage I participants will also have their blood drawn 8 times over 24 hours during the&#xD;
      Day 5 (+5 days) study visit to measure the amount of drug in the blood stream. Stage II&#xD;
      participants will undergo a physical examination and have blood drawn at each study visit&#xD;
      (Day 0; Day 10; and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48). Blood, plasma, and urine will&#xD;
      also be stored and tested to measure immune response. Females of childbearing potential will&#xD;
      undergo pregnancy testing at every study visit. Questionnaires and assessments will be&#xD;
      performed at select study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 48 weeks, all participants will enter long-term safety follow-up and will continue to&#xD;
      receive DTG. During this time, participants will undergo a physical examination, blood&#xD;
      collection, and questionnaires at most study visits (every 12 weeks for about 3 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: In January 2018, all participants on DTG granules for oral suspension were recommended&#xD;
      to transition to DTG dispersible tablets. Cohorts III and IV are closed to further&#xD;
      enrollments.&#xD;

             different time points (see protocol for more information)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must belong to one of the ARV exposure groups below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1) ARV-treatment experienced (not including receipt of ARVs as prophylaxis or for&#xD;
             prevention of perinatal transmission)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Previously took ARVs for treatment, but not currently taking ARVs:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must have been off treatment for greater than or equal to 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
                  screening, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Currently taking ARVs for treatment but failing:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must be on an unchanged, failing therapeutic regimen within the 4 to 12 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to screening (less than or equal to 1 log drop in HIV-1 RNA within the 4 to&#xD;
                  12 weeks prior to screening). NOTE: To meet this criterion, two HIV RNA levels&#xD;
                  are required: one from a date between 4-12 weeks prior to study screening and a&#xD;
                  second one at study screening. The HIV RNA level at screening must be higher&#xD;
                  than, equal to, or less than or equal to 1 log lower than the prior HIV RNA&#xD;
                  level. NOTE: Dose adjustments for growth or formula substitutions (i.e.,&#xD;
                  switching from single agent to fixed dose combination) during this 4 to 12 week&#xD;
                  period, substitutions of one ARV within the same class for toxicity or&#xD;
                  tolerability management, or discontinuation of ARVs are permitted between the HIV&#xD;
                  RNA measurements and screening or enrollment. OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For participants less than 2 years of age, initiated ARVs for treatment less than&#xD;
                  4 weeks prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2) ARV treatment naive (no exposure to ARVs for treatment; could have received ARVs&#xD;
             for prophylaxis or prevention of perinatal transmission)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If an infant has received nevirapine (NVP) as prophylaxis to prevent perinatal&#xD;
             transmission, he or she must have not received NVP for at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment into Stage I or II.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 RNA viral load greater than 1,000 copies/mL of plasma at screening. NOTE: For&#xD;
             participants enrolling into cohorts IV, IV-DT, and V-DT, the HIV RNA test performed at&#xD;
             screening may be pending at the time of enrollment. If the screening HIV RNA is less&#xD;
             than or equal to 1000 c/mL, the participant should discontinue study drug (see the&#xD;
             protocol for more information).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrated ability or willingness to swallow assigned study medications. NOTE: Film&#xD;
             coated tablets MAY NOT be crushed or dissolved. Dispersible tablets MAY NOT be cut and&#xD;
             must be used in five milligram intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent or legal guardian able and willing to provide signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants of reproductive potential, defined as having reached menarche, and&#xD;
             who are engaging in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, must agree to use&#xD;
             two contraceptive methods while on study and for two weeks after stopping study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males engaging in sexual activity that could lead to HIV-1 transmission must use a&#xD;
             condom.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Optimized background therapy (OBT):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants who are both greater than or equal to 2 years of age and&#xD;
                  ARV-treatment experienced (meeting entry criterion) must have available at least&#xD;
                  one fully active drug for the OBT to enroll. If screening genotype testing is&#xD;
                  inconclusive, historical genotypes obtained within 1 year of screening will be&#xD;
                  considered by the Protocol Team for determination of fully active drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants who are greater than or equal to 2 years of age and ARV-treatment&#xD;
                  naive (meeting entry criterion) can enroll if genotype testing has been obtained&#xD;

          -  Participant has used, or anticipates using, chronic systemic immunosuppressive agents&#xD;
             or systemic interferon (e.g., for treatment of hepatitis C virus [HCV] infection)&#xD;
             within 30 days prior to beginning DTG study treatment. Systemic corticosteroids (e.g.,&#xD;
             prednisone or equivalent up to 2 mg/kg/day) for replacement therapy or short courses&#xD;
             (less than or equal to 30 days) are permitted. (See protocol for more information on&#xD;
             disallowed medications.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place the&#xD;
             participant at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the participant unable to meet&#xD;
             the requirements of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active tuberculosis (TB) disease and/or requirement for treatment that includes&#xD;
             rifampin at the time of the screening visit. However, participants who need rifampin&#xD;
             treatment while on DTG will be allowed to continue in P1093 provided the DTG dose is&#xD;
             adjusted according to the protocol.&#xD;
