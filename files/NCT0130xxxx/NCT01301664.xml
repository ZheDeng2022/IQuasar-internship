    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators explored the hypothesis that osteoarthritic cartilage&#xD;
      fragments can promote chondrogenesis of MSCs. Non-wearing parts of cartilage tissues were&#xD;
      harvested from one osteoarthritic patient during the total knee arthroplasty surgery.&#xD;
      Cartilage fragments and MSCs were wrapped into fibrin glue; and the constructs were implanted&#xD;
      subcutaneously into nude mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators will collect the discard cartilage to develop an acellular&#xD;
      cartilage ECM-derived scaffold in the joint replacement surgery. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will harvest the redundant bone marrow from drilling or useless synovium during&#xD;
      the surgery to separate the mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, these mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      will be transfected with hTERT for rejuvenation and then will be labeled with fluorescent dye&#xD;
      PKH26 for application of animal study. To sum up, the investigators plan to use human,&#xD;
      natural, and discard materials from the joint replacement surgery to develop appropriate&#xD;
      allograft for cartilage repair and hope that one day this ideal would be apply in clinical.&#xD;

      Extracellular matrix (ECM) is thought to participate significantly in guiding the&#xD;
      differentiation process of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In this study, we explored the&#xD;
      hypothesis that osteoarthritic cartilage matrix can promote chondrogenesis of MSCs. Cartilage&#xD;
      matrix was harvested from the health-like parts of osteoarthritic cartilage tissue. Cartilage&#xD;
      fragments and MSCs were wrapped into fibrin glue; and the constructs were implanted&#xD;
      subcutaneously into nude mice. Histological analysis showed a round and elongated cell&#xD;
      appearance with positive Alcian blue staining of cartilage matrix formation in the&#xD;
      constructs. However, the cells in fibrin glue only were condensed like MSCs in pellet&#xD;
      culture. Immunohistochemical staining was abundantly positive for type II collagen in&#xD;
      neo-cartilage regions of cartilage fragment-fibrin glue-MSC constructs, while the constructs&#xD;
      without cartilage fragments were negative in staining for type II collagen. The gene&#xD;
      expressions of type II collagen in the constructs with 60 mg fragments were significantly&#xD;
      elevated after 4 weeks of implantation. Conversely, constructs without cartilage fragments&#xD;
      failed to express type II collagen, which indicated that MSCs could not differentiate into a&#xD;
      chondrogenic lineage. In conclusion, we demonstrated the effects of osteoarthritic cartilage&#xD;
      matrix in promoting chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. This was a favorable method without&#xD;
      exogenous growth factors induction.&#xD;
