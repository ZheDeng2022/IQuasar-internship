  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT), trade name (Glassia ®), is being explored in this phase I/II trial&#xD;
      as a potential disease modifying agent in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) based on its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties. AAT is an acute stress reactant protein that increases during&#xD;
      inflammation. In T1DM inflammation serves a major role in disease progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AAT is a protein produced by the human liver and secreted into the blood circulation. AAT,&#xD;
      which belongs to a group of serine protease inhibitors (SERPINS) is an acute stress reactant&#xD;
      protein that increases during stress conditions, including inflammation. AAT blocks serine&#xD;
      proteases that enhance pro-inflammatory mediators (i.e. IL-1 alpha, IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha) as&#xD;
      well as induces production of anti-inflammatory mediators (i.e. IL-10 and IL-1-receptor&#xD;
      antagonist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) inflammation serves a major role in disease progression.&#xD;
      The inflammatory signature pattern in these patients appears to have been present years&#xD;
      before clinical onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although circulating levels of AAT in T1DM are normal, in majority of cases, the activity of&#xD;
      AAT is severely compromised by non-enzymatic glycations, supporting the conclusion that serum&#xD;
      protease inhibitory capacity is reduced in T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown in different studies, including in vivo and in vitro that AAT has a&#xD;
      protective affect on pancreatic islets. This has been demonstrated in both decrease in&#xD;
      progression of diabetes in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse as well as during&#xD;
      transplantation of islets which presented viability and activity (insulin production) in the&#xD;
      presence of AAT. More specifically, islet cells are protected by human AAT from apoptosis, as&#xD;
      shown by reduced caspase-3 activity after the addition of human AAT to islet culture media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the mentioned anti-inflammatory properties of AAT sided to in vivo and in vitro&#xD;
      studied indicating that AAT may serve as a disease modifying agent in T1DM, the presented&#xD;
      study is suggested.&#xD;
