      Foundations for Health is a 12-week behavioral weight loss interventions primarily conducted&#xD;
      via the internet aimed at helping overweight and obese young adults (ages 18-30) lose weight&#xD;
      by increasing physical activity, decreasing the energy density of the diet, and increasing&#xD;
      consumption of low energy dense self-made meals by providing culinary training skills.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young adulthood is recognized as a key time to focus on health promotion/disease prevention,&#xD;
      as this time is when young individuals begin to transition to independence and thus are&#xD;
      adopting health behaviors that will be carried into later adulthood. Unfortunately, this time&#xD;
      period is often marked by decreases in physical activity and dietary quality. Working with&#xD;
      young adults as they establish their first independent living situation can help set the&#xD;
      foundation for behaviors that may aid with lifelong weight management and chronic disease&#xD;
      prevention. Foundations for Health is the first study to examine the effect of a web-based&#xD;
      lifestyle modification program in combination with culinary skills or lifestyle skills&#xD;
      training sessions on weight loss, dietary intake, and meal preparation behaviors using a&#xD;
      reduced energy dense diet in young adults with a family history of diabetes. Foundations for&#xD;
      Health will provide a 12-week weight loss intervention for overweight and obese young adults,&#xD;
      aged 18 to 35 years. Study participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions:&#xD;
      1) a web-based behavioral intervention that decreases dietary energy density and increases&#xD;
      physical activity; and 2) the same intervention combined with a hands-on culinary skills&#xD;
      training program designed to increase food purchasing and meal self-preparation and&#xD;
      consumption of meals low in energy density. The primary aims of this feasibility study are:&#xD;
      1) determine if the web-based plus culinary training condition has a greater increase in food&#xD;
      purchasing, meal preparation/cooking behaviors, and intake of self-made meals; and a greater&#xD;
      decrease in consumption of &quot;convenience meals&quot; than the web-based condition at 3 months; and&#xD;
      2) determine if the web-based plus culinary training condition has a greater decrease in&#xD;
      dietary energy density and percent energy from fat and a greater increase in fruit and&#xD;
      vegetable consumption than the web-based condition at 3 months.&#xD;

The main dish would be the component of the meal that you feel is making the largest contribution to the meal.</description>
