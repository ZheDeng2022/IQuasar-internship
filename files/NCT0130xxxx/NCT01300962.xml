      This phase I study has been designed to establish the safety, tolerability and maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of four separate regimens for patients with metastatic breast cancer:&#xD;
      dose- escalating BKM120 when combined with capecitabine (Arm A), with capecitabine and&#xD;
      trastuzumab (Arm C), or with capecitabine and lapatinib (Arm D) and dose- escalating BEZ235&#xD;
      when combined with capecitabine (Arm B).&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  To obtain primary, archived paraffin-embedded tissues to evaluate intrinsic breast&#xD;
           cancer subtype (i.e., HER2, luminal B, etc.) and other important predictive biomarkers&#xD;
           (PI3K activating mutations, pAKT, p-mTOR), and explore correlations with therapeutic&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  To examine drug effect in pre- and post-treatment core biopsy specimens (optional) from&#xD;
           appropriate patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore patient motivators for enrolling in early phase studies through patient&#xD;
           interview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a four-arm multi-center, open-label phase I clinical trial testing the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the addition of BKM120 to capecitabine (ARM A); the addition of BYL719 to&#xD;
      capecitabine (ARM B); the addition of BKM120 to capecitabine plus trastuzumab (ARM C); or the&#xD;
      addition of BKM120 to capecitabine plus lapatinib (ARM D) will be safe and tolerable as&#xD;
      evidenced by the DLT seen. Following screening and informed consent, treatment will be&#xD;
      initiated with one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: BKM120 PO daily for 21 days (3 weeks) plus capecitabine PO BID for 2 weeks (no&#xD;
      capecitabine is administered during the third week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: BYL719 PO BID for 21 days (3 weeks) plus capecitabine PO BID for 2 weeks (no&#xD;
      capecitabine is administered during the third week of the cycle)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: BKM120 PO daily for 21 days (3 weeks) plus capecitabine PO BID for 2 weeks (no&#xD;
      capecitabine is administered during the third week) plus trastuzumab by intravenous infusion&#xD;
      on Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM D: BKM120 PO daily for 21 days (3 weeks) plus capecitabine PO BID for 2 weeks (no&#xD;
      capecitabine is administered during the third week) plus lapatinib PO daily for 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consents are separate documents and the patient and the study team know ahead of time&#xD;
      which Arm is open and enrolling and can therefore focus their discussion with the patient on&#xD;
      that ARM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycles in each arm will be repeated every 3 weeks (21 days). Patients will continue on&#xD;
      protocol-based therapy until progression, unacceptable toxicity, study withdrawal, or patient&#xD;
      death.&#xD;

&#xD;
             -Adults of reproductive potential must be able and agree to use appropriate&#xD;
             contraception. Double barrier contraceptives must be used throughout the trial by both&#xD;
             sexes..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study. Women&#xD;
             assigned to ARMS AC and D must use highly effective contraception for 16 weeks after&#xD;
             stopping treatment. Women assigned to ARM A must continue contraceptive measures for 4&#xD;
             weeks after stopping treatment. Women assigned to ARM B must continue contraceptive&#xD;
             measures for 5 weeks after stopping treatment. The highly effective contraception is&#xD;
             defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy&#xD;
                  alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by&#xD;
                  follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of&#xD;
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the&#xD;
                  vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel /film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                       suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For ARMs A, C and D, oral contraception (OC), injected or implanted hormonal methods&#xD;
             are not allowed as BKM120 and potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives. For ARM B, oral contraceptives, injected or implanted hormonal methods&#xD;
             are not allowed as the sole method of contraception, as BYL719 has not been&#xD;
             characterized with respect to its potential to interfere with the PK and/or the&#xD;
             effectiveness of OCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recovered from all reversible toxicities related to their previous treatment&#xD;
                  (other than alopecia) to ≤grade 1 or baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria listed below at baseline will be excluded&#xD;
        from study participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving concurrent endocrine, cytotoxic, or biologic agent(s) or within time limits&#xD;

             above prior to study day 1&#xD;

             ≤ 2 weeks or limited field radiation for palliation ≤2 weeks prior to starting either&#xD;
             BYL719 or BKM120 or have not recovered from side effects of such therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have undergone major surgery ≤2 weeks prior to starting BKM120 or BYL719 or have not&#xD;
             recovered from side effects of such therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with treatment doses of capecitabine (prior radio-sensitizing doses of&#xD;
