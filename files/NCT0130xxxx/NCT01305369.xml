  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys-LTs) are lipid inflammatory mediators that abound in mucosal&#xD;
      inflammation and play a validated role in the pathogenesis of human asthma. It has recently&#xD;
      been demonstrated that the platelet adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor, P2Y12, is required&#xD;
      for LT4-mediated pulmonary inflammation and could be a novel potential therapeutic target for&#xD;
      asthma. Thienopyridines (such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel) are pro-drugs, with proven&#xD;
      antithrombotic efficacy, whose active metabolites selectively inhibit the platelet P2Y12&#xD;
      receptors. One of the drawbacks of thienopyridines is the high inter-individual variability&#xD;
      in pharmacological response, mostly due to the high inter-individual variability in the&#xD;
      capacity of transforming the pro-drug in its active metabolite. Prasugrel is a new member of&#xD;
      the class of thienopyridines, with faster onset of action and a more uniform inhibition of&#xD;
      platelet function compared to the other thienopyridines. Primary objective of our study will&#xD;
      be to test whether or not the inhibition of the platelet P2Y12 receptor by prasugrel reduces&#xD;
      the bronchial hyper-reactivity in patients with chronic asthma. The investigators designed a&#xD;
      randomized, double blind (Subject, Caregiver, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor), crossover,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, prospective study, which will enroll 26 patients. Randomization will be&#xD;
      performed in sequential blocks. Patients will be blindly and randomly allocated to treatment&#xD;
      A (prasugrel 10 mg daily) or B (placebo) for 15 days. After a 15-day wash-out period,&#xD;
      patients who had initially been allocated to treatment &quot;A&quot; will be allocated to treatment&#xD;
      &quot;B&quot;, and vice versa. Measurements will be done at baseline and on day 15 after each&#xD;
      treatment, at the same time (+/- 1 h) of the day. Primary efficacy measure will be changes in&#xD;
      airway hyper-responsiveness, recorded as reduction of FEV1 using the mannitol test induction.&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy measures will be changes in markers of airway inflammation in sputum,&#xD;
      changes in measurement of nitric oxide expiration (as surrogate marker of airway lung&#xD;
      inflammation), count of eosinophil granulocytes in peripheral blood smear, changes in asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation rates and symptom scores. Changes in phosphorylation of platelet VASP&#xD;
      (Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) by ADP, measured with a flow cytometric technique,&#xD;
      will be used as markers of the degree of inhibition of platelet P2Y12 receptors attained in&#xD;
      each subjects by treatment with prasugrel.&#xD;

    <description>Changes in airway hyper-responsiveness, recorded as reduction of FEV1 with the mannitol test induction. Mannitol is considered more specific respect to methacholine for detecting changes in airway hyper-responsiveness in asthma patients, because it mimics the normal pathophysiology of bronchial asthma, causing the release of various mediators of bronchoconstriction</description>
