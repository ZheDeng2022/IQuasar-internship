    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The current standard of care for advanced lung cancer and cancers of the thymus consists&#xD;
      primarily of chemotherapy treatment. The drugs used for chemotherapy depend on the&#xD;
      classification of the cancer in different categories that are based on the appearance of the&#xD;
      cancer in the microscope. Though this approach has been proved to be useful in some ways, the&#xD;
      survival rates of individuals with lung cancer and cancers of the thymus are still very poor.&#xD;
      Recent research has shown that several genetic abnormalities play an important role in the&#xD;
      development and growth of lung cancer and cancers of the thymus, and that it is possible to&#xD;
      improve treatment success rates with drugs that specifically target some of the abnormal&#xD;
      genes. Researchers are interested in determining whether it is possible to analyze the genes&#xD;
      of patients with lung cancer and cancers of the thymus in order to provide personalized&#xD;
      treatment with drugs that target the specific gene abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the effectiveness of genetic analysis in determining targeted therapy for&#xD;
      individuals with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, and thymic&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with either lung cancer or a&#xD;
      cancer of the thymus that is not considered to be curable with the use of surgery or&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination,&#xD;
           blood and urine tests, and tumor imaging studies. Participants will have a tumor biopsy&#xD;
           or provide previously collected tumor tissue for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on the results of the tumor biopsy study, participants will be separated into&#xD;
           different treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with EGFR gene mutation will receive a drug called erlotinib, which&#xD;
           inhibits a protein called EGFR that is thought to be a key factor in the development and&#xD;
           progression of some cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with KRAS, BRAF, HRAS, or NRAF gene mutations will receive a drug called&#xD;
           AZD6244, which inhibits a protein called MEK that is thought to be a key factor in the&#xD;
           development and progression of some cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with PIK3CA, AKT, or PTEN gene mutations will receive a drug called&#xD;
           MK-2206, which inhibits a protein called AKT that is thought to be a key factor in the&#xD;
           development and progression of some cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with KIT or PDGFRA gene mutations will receive a drug called sunitinib,&#xD;
           which inhibits some proteins that are thought to be key factors in the development and&#xD;
           progression of some cancers, including kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have ERBB2 gene mutation or amplification will receive a drug called&#xD;
           lapatinib, which inhibits some proteins that are thought to be key factors in the&#xD;
           development and progression of some cancers, including breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who do not have any of the genetic abnormalities described above will be&#xD;
           offered different options for treatment, including standard of care chemotherapy or&#xD;
           treatment with investigational agents in a different research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 6 weeks of treatment, participants will have imaging studies to evaluate the&#xD;
           status of their cancer. Treatment will continue as long as participants tolerate the&#xD;
           drugs and the disease does not progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who benefit from the first treatment but eventually develop resistance and&#xD;
           progression of their cancer will be offered the chance to have a second tumor biopsy and&#xD;
           undergo a different treatment for their cancer.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A better understanding of the genetic make-up of the individual tumor may offer&#xD;
           potentially improved therapies. This approach may also give rapid access to response&#xD;
           data in patients with sometimes rare genetic abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, it will allow us to test targeted therapies in a select population of&#xD;
           patients that is more likely to have a favorable response based on their molecular&#xD;
           profile and the specific mechanism of action of the drug being tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This approach will also speed up drug development and potentially approval, and rescue&#xD;
           an otherwise ineffective drug candidate for the specific subgroup that can benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility of the use of tumor s molecular profiling and targeted&#xD;
           therapies in the treatment of advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small&#xD;
           cell lung cancer (SCLC) and thymic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the response rate of molecular-profile directed treatments in NSCLC, SCLC&#xD;
           and thymic malignancies patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically confirmed advanced lung cancer or thymic malignancies for&#xD;
           whom surgical resection with curative intent is not feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must either have biopsiable disease and be willing to undergo biopsy for&#xD;
&#xD;
      molecular profiling or have paraffin embedded tissue blocks suitable for molecular&#xD;
&#xD;
      profiling analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals are eligible for EGFR germline mutation testing if they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a personal history of invasive lung cancer or one of the pre-invasive histologies&#xD;
&#xD;
      associated with the development of lung cancer and more than two affected family members with&#xD;
      invasive lung cancer or one of the pre-invasive histologies associated with the development&#xD;
      of lung cancer; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a first-degree relative with a known EGFR germline mutation (EGFR exon 20 T790M, exon 21&#xD;
           V843I, exon 21 R831C and exon 20 R776G).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will have their tumors undergo molecular profiling. Based on these results&#xD;
           and on other eligibility criteria, the patients will be offered enrollment into&#xD;
           different targeted therapy arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the NCI site only, individuals eligible for EGFR germline mutation will undergo&#xD;
           testing for germline mutations affecting the EGFR gene; if a mutation is detected, their&#xD;
           first-degree relatives would be invited to undergo testing for the index germline&#xD;
           mutation found in the proband and appropriate follow-up on trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effective with Amendment I, the participating site, OHSU, will discontinue new&#xD;
           enrollments and data entry for existing patients on the NOS arm on this protocol in&#xD;
           favor of the OHSU protocol L8639, Personalized Cancer Medicine Registry. The data from&#xD;
           these patients will be included with the data from 11-C-0096 (8639) NCI patients at the&#xD;
           time of publication. Any OHSU patients who are eligible for a treatment arm will&#xD;
           continue to be enrolled and followed per protocol.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INITIAL ENROLLMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically confirmed advanced NSCLC, SCLC and thymic malignancies&#xD;
             for whom surgical resection or multimodality therapy with curative intent is not&#xD;
             feasible. For patients with Stage III NSCLC, who can be encompassed by a radiation&#xD;
             port, definitive XRT should have been performed first when possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who meet the eligibility criteria for EGFR germline mutation testing but&#xD;
             who do not have advanced cancer as defined in 3.1.1 may enroll for EGFR germline&#xD;
             mutation testing only and will not be eligible for the treatment or NOS arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with advanced cancer must meet one of the following criteria (does not apply&#xD;
             to firstdegree relatives or individuals with pre-invasive histology enrolling only for&#xD;
             EGFR germline mutation testing):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have biopsiable disease and be willing to undergo biopsy for&#xD;
                  molecular profiling&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Patients must have enough and adequate archival material from a previous biopsy to perform&#xD;
        molecular profiling analyses. The adequacy of the material provided will be determined by&#xD;
        the principal investigator in conjunction with the laboratories performing the molecular&#xD;
        profiling analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have previously undergone a successful molecular profiling of their&#xD;
             tumor with mutation analysis of the genes described in section 5.2, as part of this&#xD;
             protocol (crossover patients) or other molecular profiling protocols such as the Lung&#xD;
             Cancer Mutation Consortium protocol among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had major surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior&#xD;
             to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to&#xD;
             agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents or other medications&#xD;
             for the treatment of their malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with symptomatic brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
             However, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastases and whose brain&#xD;
             metastatic disease status has remained stable for at least 1 week after the end of&#xD;
             brain radiation may be enrolled to undergo molecular profiling at the discretion of&#xD;
             the principal investigator. In addition, brain metastatic disease should be stable for&#xD;
             at least 4 weeks, before the patients can be enrolled in any of the experimental&#xD;
             treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an&#xD;
             inability to take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical&#xD;
             procedures affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their&#xD;
             ability to swallow and retain tablets are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any uncontrolled medical illness that precludes the patient from undergoing a biopsy&#xD;
             for molecular profiling and / or receiving treatment under one of the experimental&#xD;
             arms of the study should be excluded. These conditions include but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ongoing or uncontrolled, symptomatic congestive heart failure (Class III or IV as&#xD;
                  defined by the NYHA functional classification system (see Appendix D).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unstable angina pectoris&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance&#xD;
                  with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with QTc prolongation (defined as a QTc interval equal to or greater than 500&#xD;
             msec) or other significant ECG abnormalities are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Caution should be used if patients are required to use a concomitant medication that&#xD;
             can prolong the QT interval and efforts should be made to switch to a different&#xD;
             medication before the patient begins treatment under an experimental arm. See Appendix&#xD;
             E for a table of medications with the potential to prolong the QTc interval. A&#xD;
             comprehensive list of agents with the potential to cause QTc prolongation can be found&#xD;
             at: http://www.azcert.org/medical-pros/drug-lists/bycategory.cfm&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The eligibility of patients taking medications that are potent inducers or inhibitors&#xD;
             of that enzyme will be determined following a review of their case by the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator. (A list of potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors can be found in Appendix&#xD;
             F). Every effort should be made to switch patients taking such agents or substances to&#xD;
             other medications before they begin treatment with one of the experimental drug&#xD;
             included in this protocol, particularly patients with gliomas or brain metastases who&#xD;
             are taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant agents. A comprehensive list of medications&#xD;
             and substances known or with the potential to alter the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib&#xD;
             through CYP3A4 is provided in Appendix F.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with tumor amenable to potentially curative therapy as assessed by the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because many of the FDA approved agents&#xD;
             and investigational agents in this trial have the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated in this protocol. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
