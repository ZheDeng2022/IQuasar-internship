  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The national Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in Guinea-Bissau focuses its efforts&#xD;
      exclusively on children below 12 months of age; children who have reached 12 months of age&#xD;
      are no longer entitled to vaccines through the EPI program. This has affected the measles&#xD;
      vaccination coverage, approx. 30% of the children in the rural area do not receive measles&#xD;
      vaccine (MV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies from the Bandim Health Project (BHP) have shown that MV has a profound impact on&#xD;
      survival, reducing mortality by approximately 50% - far more than can be explained by&#xD;
      prevention of measles deaths. Hence, MV seems to have non-specific beneficial effects on&#xD;
      survival, and the current policy may have important consequences for overall child mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the implications of the current policy of only vaccinating children below 12 months&#xD;
      of age, the investigators will conduct a cluster randomized trial, in which children will&#xD;
      receive their vaccines according to the current national EPI policy (National policy) or&#xD;
      receive MV regardless of age and whether some doses of MV may be lost (MV-for-all policy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that among children enrolled after 12 months of age, mortality&#xD;
      is 50% lower in children randomised to receive MV compared with children randomised to follow&#xD;
      the national policy and not receive MV.&#xD;
