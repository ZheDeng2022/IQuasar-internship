  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This novel fibrinolytic agent is a 136 amino acid single chain protein secreted by some&#xD;
      strains of Staphylococcus aureus and readily produced by recombinant DNA technology. Two&#xD;
      natural variants of recombinant staphylokinase, THR-100 and SakSTAR, have been developed for&#xD;
      investigational use in preliminary trials. Like SK, it forms an equimolar complex with&#xD;
      plasmin which in turn activates plasminogen to plasmin. Unlike SK, the complexed, activated&#xD;
      molecule (which undergoes proteolytic cleavage of the first ten amino acids to generate&#xD;
      active staphylokinase) has a high degree of fibrin-selectivity in a human plasma milieu. This&#xD;
      fibrin-selectivity is due in large measure to potent activation at the clot surface by trace&#xD;
      amounts of plasmin, and rapid inactivation of the circulating complex by antiplasmin. Hence,&#xD;
      it provides an interesting and promising alternative therapy.&#xD;

      STUDY SUMMARY/PROTOCOL OUTLINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Number: BBIL/STA/O5/2007 Protocol Name: A PROSPECTIVE PHASE III PARALLEL, RANDOMISED&#xD;
      CONTROLLED TRIAL USING DOUBLE-BOLUS THR-100 (RECOMBINANT STAPHYLOKINASE) Vs STREPTOKINASE IN&#xD;
      PATIENTS WITH ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug under Study: THR-100 (Recombinant Staphylokinase)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intended Indication: Acute Myocardial Infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized, Parallel Group, Multicenter and Active-Comparator Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population: Patients aged 30 to ≤ 75 years presenting with acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction within 12 hours of onset of symptoms presumed secondary to an acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients: 120 subjects are to be recruited into the trial, with patients randomized&#xD;
      in a 1:1 allocation ratio to THR-100 and Streptokinase over three centers. This sample size&#xD;
      of 120 subjects provides power of 0.90 with a significance level of 0.05 to yield a&#xD;
      statistically significant early patency difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives: To demonstrate efficacy of THR100 as compared with streptokinase by&#xD;
      assessment of 12-lead Electrocardiogram, specific cardiac Enzymes levels, pain relief and&#xD;
      TIMI-90. (Non-Inferiority study) Secondary Objectives: To evaluate the safety profile of&#xD;
      recombinant SAK in comparison with Streptokinase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Levels: Dose levels (all administered intravenously). THR-100: 15 mg double-bolus&#xD;
      (15mg/15ml), separated by 30 minutes (total 30 mg) Streptokinase: Standard regimen (1.5&#xD;
      million IU) is made up in 150 ml of physiological saline or glucose solution and administered&#xD;
      intravenously over a period of 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Parameters: Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 12-lead Electrocardiogram, ≥50% resolution of ST segment in single ECG lead of maximum&#xD;
           deviation present at 90 minutes and 24 hours after start of thrombolytic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Changes in cardiac Enzyme levels of CK-MB and Cardiac Troponin I or T at 6 hrs, 8 hrs,&#xD;
           12-16 hrs and 24 hours after start of thrombolytic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Significant Relief of pain (a 3 point reduction on a 0-5 subjective scale) at end of 2&#xD;
           and 12 hrs after start of thrombolytic therapy. (0-No pain, 1-Slight pain, 2-Mild pain,&#xD;
           3-Moderate pain, 4- Severe pain, 5-Very severe pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessment of culprit coronary vessel patency (TIMI- grade 3) at 90 minutes. (TIMI-&#xD;
           Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction). Angiography shall be performed only in patients&#xD;
           who fulfil the following guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;

      leads V1-V6 and ≥0.3 mV ST elevation in ≥1 lead V1-V6 3. Sum of ST elevation in V1-V6 plus&#xD;
      Sum of ST depression in II, III, aVF ≥0.8 mV (OR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No WPW or LBBB or IV-conduction block or Pacemaker rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
