  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Phase III clinical trial for mucosal or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Equivalence between the&#xD;
      standard and alternative schemes with meglumine antimoniate&quot; has begun in October 2008 at the&#xD;
      Laboratory of Leishmaniasis Surveillance at Evandro Chagas Clinical Research Institute&#xD;
      (IPEC), FIOCRUZ, aiming to compare efficacy and safety of the standard recommended schedule&#xD;
      with an alternative regimen of meglumine antimoniate (MA) in the treatment of mucosal or&#xD;
      mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (ML or MCL)). It is a study with blind evaluation by the doctors&#xD;
      and the responsible for statistical analysis. Patients diagnosed with Ml or MCL, eligible for&#xD;
      the trial, are randomly allocated into one of the schemes with meglumine antimoniate and&#xD;
      monitored before, during and after it. There is no single regimen applicable to all forms of&#xD;
      leishmaniasis around the world. Therapeutic regimens applied to treat people living in other&#xD;
      geographic areas result in mixed outcomes. Ideally, the most appropriate regimens should be&#xD;
      established for each endemic area, based on its efficacy, toxicity, difficulties of&#xD;
      administration and cost. Given the problems and limitations of the use of pentavalent&#xD;
      antimonials at 20 mg / kg / day, a less toxic alternative regimen with 5mg/kg/day, continuous&#xD;
      up to the cure deserves to be better evaluated. Treatment must lead to the healing of mucosal&#xD;
      lesions and prevent late scarring tissues and disabilities development. The indication of&#xD;
      high doses of MA is based on the evidence that there could be induction of resistance with&#xD;
      use of subdoses. However, clinical studies with extended follow-up in Rio de Janeiro have&#xD;
      suggested that regular low MA doses (5mg / kg / day) in a systemic way may constitute an&#xD;
      effective scheme, achieving cure rates similar to higher dose, with lower toxicity, ease of&#xD;
      implementation and lower cost. Published studies on efficacy and safety of alternative&#xD;
      schemes with meglumine antimoniate failed to provide conclusive results, for various&#xD;
      methodological biases. The need to compare the effectiveness and safety between treatment&#xD;
      schemes with meglumine antimoniate currently recommended in Brazil for the treatment of ML or&#xD;
      MCL and an alternative scheme with low dose of antimony is the motive for this study in Rio&#xD;
      de Janeiro.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Introduction. Pentavalent antimonials are first line drugs for the treatment of&#xD;
           leishmaniasis. WHO and Brazilian Ministry of Health recommend treating patients with&#xD;
           mucosal (ML) or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) with doses of 20mg/kg/day,&#xD;
           intramuscularly or intravenously, for a period of three to four weeks. In the Reference&#xD;
           Centre on Leishmaniasis - IPEC - FIOCRUZ, the dose of 5mg/kg/day IM has been effective&#xD;
           and well tolerated in the treatment. ML is treated for 30 continuous or intermittent&#xD;
           days, in series of 10 days interspersed with periods of 10 days without medication, up&#xD;
           to 12 series of treatment (120 medication days), with a lower incidence of adverse&#xD;
           effects and lower treatment dropout rates. The evolution of the lesions is usually&#xD;
           similar to that observed with continuous treatment. In all cases patients should be&#xD;
           monitored with clinical examination, electrocardiogram, blood count, liver function,&#xD;
           renal and pancreatic tests. Some side effects can be observed, although they not&#xD;
           necessarily lead to discontinuation of treatment: arthralgia, myalgia, anorexia,&#xD;
           abdominal pain, rash, fever, headache, edema, and herpes zoster. Electrocardiographic&#xD;
           abnormalities most frequent are heart rhythm and ventricular repolarization&#xD;
           disturbances: flattening or inversion of T wave and corrected QT space widening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background: Ideally, the most appropriate antimoniate therapeutic regimens should be&#xD;
           established for each endemic area, based on their efficacy and toxicity, without&#xD;
           ignoring the difficulties of administration and cost. The treatment of ML or MCL must&#xD;
           achieve the healing of mucosal lesions and prevention of severe scarring of mucosal&#xD;
           tissues and consequent disabilities. The recognition, recommendation and acceptance of&#xD;
           new regimens should be preceded by demonstration of their superiority to currently&#xD;
           recommended treatments. We aim to compare the effectiveness and safety among treatment&#xD;
           schemes with meglumine antimoniate currently recommended in Brazil for the treatment of&#xD;
           ATL and an alternative scheme with low doses of antimony.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objectives. 3.1. General Objective. To compare the effectiveness and safety of meglumine&#xD;
           antimoniate at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day for 30 days or 5 mg continuous up to 120 days, in&#xD;
           the treatment of patients with ML or MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2. Specific Objectives. 1. To compare the frequencies of epithelialization and&#xD;
           reduction of mucosal infiltration (assessed on days 30, 120, 150 from the beginning of&#xD;
           the treatment) between the two groups. 2. To compare the frequencies of good late&#xD;
           therapeutic response (maintenance of epithelialization, with total regression of&#xD;
           infiltration and no re-emergence of a skin lesion) between the two groups, up to two&#xD;
           years. 3. To compare the frequency and severity of adverse clinical, laboratory and&#xD;
           electrocardiogram effects between the two groups, controlling for age above or below 60&#xD;
           years. 4. To compare the time in days until the epithelialization and reduction of&#xD;
           infiltration of the lesions between the two groups, according to the nasal,&#xD;
           oropharyngeal or laryngeal location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subjects and methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. 1. Study design: Controlled clinical trial with standard and alternative treatment,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, phase III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2. Description of interventions: Meglumine antimoniate (Aventis, São Paulo, Brazil) is&#xD;
      stored and ministered under actual conditions employed by the health services in Brazil. A&#xD;
      single lot of medication will be used in all patients. Each patient will be included in one&#xD;
      of two treatment groups with meglumine antimoniate IM: 1) 20mg / kg / day for 30 continuous&#xD;
      days. Patients with remaining active lesions in the day 120 from the beginning of the&#xD;
      treatment will be re-treated with the same regimen. 2) 5mg / kg / day continuous until the&#xD;
      epithelization and resolution of mucosal infiltration, respecting the limit of 120 days of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no cross-over between the groups for the purpose of this study. The data from&#xD;
      those patients who require permanent discontinuation of a scheme will be assessed in the&#xD;
      group that were randomized, ie, by intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3. Sampling plan. 4.3.1 Sample size. The comparison of the effectiveness between the two&#xD;
      schemes will probably reveal superiority of the alternative scheme (continuous low dose) for&#xD;
      the following outcomes: 1) frequency of good initial response (epithelialization and&#xD;
      resolution of mucosal infiltration) on day 150. 2) frequency of good late response&#xD;
      (maintenance of epithelialization and total regression of infiltration) up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We considered the significance level of 5% and 80% power to calculate the sample sizes needed&#xD;
      to compare the groups. Initially, a 76-total of patients will be required (38 patients in&#xD;
      each group) to compare the standard group with the alternative group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Allocation strategy (randomization). Eligible individuals who agree to participate (by&#xD;
      signing an informed consent) will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups,&#xD;
      according to order of arrival, until the completion of the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5. Eligibility Criteria (see item: Eligibility Criteria). 4.6. Outcomes. 4.6.1&#xD;
      Effectiveness Outcome: Definition: 1. Initial therapeutic response - presence or not of&#xD;
      complete epithelization of all lesions until day 150. 2. Late therapeutic response in mucosal&#xD;
      leishmaniasis: maintenance of epithelialization and total regression of the infiltration up&#xD;
      to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.6.2 Safety Outcomes (adverse events): definition, intensity and relationship to study drug.&#xD;
      Adverse events (AE) are considered as any events, adverse or unexpected, evidenced by the&#xD;
      investigator or reported by the patients, beginning during the use of the drug or within 30&#xD;
      days after stopping it. The investigation of AE will be made by spontaneous recall and&#xD;
      questioned by a physician in a standardized form every 10 days during the medication and in&#xD;
      day 30 after completion of treatment. All EA should be monitored until their disappearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classification of the severity of adverse events (clinical, laboratory and&#xD;
      electrocardiographic) will take place according to &quot;AIDS Table for Grading Severity of Adult&#xD;
      Adverse Experiences, 1992&quot;. The causal relationship to study drug (= AE) will be evaluated by&#xD;
      the investigator and classified as follows: a) Definite (Highly Likely); b) Probable; c)&#xD;
      Possible; d) Remote (Probably not); e) Definitely not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.7. Medications allowed. There will be no restrictions on the use of symptomatic medications&#xD;
      and for other diseases except those listed in the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.8. Management of adverse effects. The AE will be noted in the appropriate form and shall&#xD;
      contain: a description of the adverse effect, its intensity, relation with the investigated&#xD;
      drug, start date, completion date, duration and conduct taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.9. Masking. We chose to perform the measurements of outcomes of interest (effectiveness)&#xD;
      and adverse events (security) by a physician who is not aware of what is the regimen used by&#xD;
      the patient. It is intended to minimize measurement biases of the different outcomes&#xD;
      according to treatment regimen to which each patient belongs. The results of laboratory tests&#xD;
      are provided by the clinical pathology laboratory without information about the treatment&#xD;
      group. The manager of the database will preserve the secrecy of this information by coding&#xD;
      the groups for analysis for the epidemiologist (s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.10. Criteria for definitive discontinuation of study treatment: a) Interruption driven by&#xD;
      clinical, laboratory or electrocardiographic AE Grade 4; b) Interruption exceeding 10 days&#xD;
      attributed to clinical, laboratory or electrocardiographic adverse event Grade &lt;3; c)&#xD;
      Spontaneous cessation of the use of prescribed medication beyond five consecutive doses, due&#xD;
      to fault of the administration (noncompliance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.11. Criteria for study withdrawal: a) definitive interruption of treatment; b) pregnancy;&#xD;
      c) introduction of immunosuppressive or potentially toxic drugs; d) intercurrent disease,&#xD;
      unrelated to study drug, but with manifestations equivalent or superior to clinical grade 3&#xD;
      AE; e) poor initial or late therapeutic response; f) patient abandonment to continue the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.12. Procedures for confidentiality break. The randomization codes used for allocation of&#xD;
      numbering and allocation of patients may be revealed in cases of necessity of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.13. Monitoring the study. The parameters (outcomes) of effectiveness and safety will be&#xD;
      monitored according to the timetable for implementation. The principal investigator and&#xD;
      coordinators will supervise the field work, controlling for quality deviation and this&#xD;
      Protocol. Important items to be monitored: adhesion to the Protocol (follow-up losses will be&#xD;
      minimized through active search), appropriate records of outcomes and adverse events;&#xD;
      adequacy of stored products; quality of procedures for laboratory tests; minimization of&#xD;
      missing data; periodic transmission of data for data entry. Written reports of field will be&#xD;
      retained for consideration by the committees. Serious adverse events will be reported to the&#xD;
      Ethical Committee and perhaps decision to interrupt the test will be made. External&#xD;
      Committee: a committee of outside monitoring of the trial shall be constituted , consisting&#xD;
      of three members, experts in the treatment of leishmaniasis and execution of clinical trials.&#xD;
      The committee will carry out audits of documentation and activities relevant to the clinical&#xD;
      trial, controlling for possible protocol breaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.14 Control of storage of medications. The ampoules required for complete treatment of the&#xD;
      whole sample will be stored in IPEC Pharmacy. A trained professional team will include the&#xD;
      patients, in day 1 consultation, following the randomization list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.15. Data Analysis Plan. Data analysis will be carried out following the principle of&#xD;
      intention to treat. The data from those patients who require permanent discontinuation of a&#xD;
      scheme will be analyzed according to the group for what they had been allocated initially,&#xD;
      not being re-assigned to another group to resumption of treatment (no cross-over between the&#xD;
      groups for the purposes of this study). We will describe the simple frequencies of&#xD;
      categorical variables and measures of central tendency and dispersion of continuous&#xD;
      quantitative variables for each antimony scheme. The proportion of dichotomous outcome of&#xD;
      presence or absence of good early and late therapeutic response with the alternative regimen&#xD;
      will be compared to the standard one through chi-square test, and the days until the extent&#xD;
      of epithelialization and reduction of infiltration of lesions by nasal, oropharyngeal or&#xD;
      laryngeal location will be studied through survival time analysis between the two groups&#xD;
      (log-rank statistic). If necessary, nonparametric tests will be used. Effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety will be also evaluated through relative risk (RR), absolute risk reduction (ARR) and&#xD;
      relative risk reduction (RRR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Ethical considerations. 6.1 Risks and benefits. The main potential benefit of this test is&#xD;
      the possibility of subsidizing the use of lower doses of antimony, potentially less toxic and&#xD;
      less costly. The risks consist of general adverse events, which will be thoroughly&#xD;
      scrutinized and treated. This project was submitted to the Ethics in Research Committee&#xD;
      (CEP/IPEC) and National Ethics in Research Council (CONEP). All patients sign an informed&#xD;
      consent approved by CEP/IPEC. This project follows the recommendations of the National Health&#xD;
      Council.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2. Informed consent. In plain language and explaining the objectives, risks, benefits and&#xD;
      identifying those responsible for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Expected Results. We hope the different schemes are equivalent in effectiveness, and with&#xD;
      diverse toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Financial support. This project is supported in part with funds approved by MCT/CNPq /&#xD;
      MS-SCTIE-DECIT 25/2006.&#xD;
