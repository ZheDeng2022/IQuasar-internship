  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perhaps the use of a more selective anti-inflammatory drug, capable of inhibiting enzyme&#xD;
      specific for pain may be more effective in preventing the tooth sensitivity caused by the&#xD;
      inflammatory response produced by in-office bleaching. To the extent of the authors´&#xD;
      knowledge, no study has so far addressed the use of a selective anti-inflammatory drug&#xD;
      specific for pain enzyme on tooth sensitivity, being this the aim of the present&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;

      Study design This was a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical&#xD;
      trial, with an equal allocation rate to receive either one of two treatments. The study took&#xD;
      place in the clinic of the Brazilian Association of Dentistry in Guarapuava, Paraná from&#xD;
      August 2010 to December 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in this clinical trial were at least 18 years old and had good general and&#xD;
      oral health. Participants were recruited by means of radio and TV advertisement. A total of&#xD;
      247 participants were examined in a dental chair to check whether they met the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. The participants were required to have six caries-free maxillary anterior&#xD;
      teeth, without resto- rations on the labial surfaces. The central incisors had to be shade C2&#xD;
      or darker as judged by comparison with a value- oriented shade guide (Vita Lumin, Vita&#xD;
      Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany). Participants who had undergone tooth-whitening&#xD;
      procedures, presented anterior restorations, were pregnant/lactating, had severe internal&#xD;
      tooth discoloration (tetracycline stains, fluorosis, and pulpless teeth), were taking any&#xD;
      type of medicine, had bruxism habits, or any other pathology that could cause sensitivity&#xD;
      (such as recession and dentin exposure) were excluded from the study, since they would not be&#xD;
      immediately eligible for a cosmetic treatment, such as bleaching. Participants who reported&#xD;
      some earlier or present health problems in the stomach, heart, kidney and liver, or&#xD;
      participants continuously using any with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant action were&#xD;
      excluded from the study. Sample size calculation The primary outcome of this study was the&#xD;
      absolute risk of TS. The absolute risk of TS was reported to be approximately 86 % for the&#xD;
      bleaching product Whiteness HP Maxx (FGM, Joinville, SC, Brazil). Thus, 30 patients were&#xD;
      required to have an 80 % chance of detecting, as significant at the two-sided 5 % level, a&#xD;
      de- crease in the primary outcome measure from 86 % in the control group to 41 % in the&#xD;
      experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomly stratified by sex into the placebo and etoricoxib groups. The&#xD;
      randomization process was performed by computer-generated tables by a third person not&#xD;
      involved in the research protocol. Details of the allocated groups were recorded on cards&#xD;
      contained in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. These were prepared by a third&#xD;
      person not involved in any of the phases of the clinical trial. Once the participant was&#xD;
      eligible for the procedure, and completed all baseline assessments, the allocation assignment&#xD;
      was revealed by this envelope being opened by the mentioned third person. Neither the&#xD;
      participant nor the operator knew the group allocation, both being blinded to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants from the placebo group received a placebo (Talco pharma SM-200-Henrifarma&#xD;
      produtos químicos e farmacêuticos LTDA, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) and participants from the&#xD;
      etoricoxib group received a dose of a selective COX- 2 inhibitor etoricoxib 60 mg (Arcoxia,&#xD;
      MSD, Campinas, SP, Brazil). All the participants were watched to ensure that they took the&#xD;
      drugs or placebo 1 h before treatment. The drugs were similar in appearance. A second dose of&#xD;
      placebo or etoricoxib (60 mg) was administered 24 h after the first dose. At the time the&#xD;
      participants were required to take the second dose of the medicine, the research auxiliary&#xD;
      called him/her and asked him/her to take the medicine. This procedure was implemented to&#xD;
      increase adherence to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gingival tissue of the teeth to be bleached was isolated using a light-polymerized resin&#xD;
      dam (Top Dam, FGM, Joinville, SC, Brazil). The 35 % hydrogen peroxide gel (Whiteness HP Maxx,&#xD;
      FGM) was used in three 15-min applications for both groups in accordance with the&#xD;
      manufacturer's directions. The in-office bleaching agent was refreshed every 15 min during&#xD;
      the 45-min application period. Two bleaching sessions with 1 week interval between them were&#xD;
      performed. All participants were instructed to brush their teeth regularly using fluoridated&#xD;
      toothpaste (Sorriso Fresh, Colgate- Palmolive, São Paulo, SP, Brazil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shade evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shade evaluation was recorded before and 30 days after the bleaching treatment using two&#xD;
      methods: subjective evaluation using a shade guide (Vita Lumin, Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad&#xD;
      Säckingen, Germany) and an objective evaluation using the spectrophotometer (Easyshade,&#xD;
      Vident, Brea, CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the subjective examination, the 16 shade guide tabs were arranged from highest (B1) to&#xD;
      lowest (C4) value, so that the color C2 was set. Although this scale is not linear in the&#xD;
      truest sense, the changes were treated as though they represented a continuous and&#xD;
      approximately linear ranking for the purpose of analysis. The measurement area of interest&#xD;
      for shade matching was the middle one third of the facial surface of the anterior central&#xD;
      incisor. For calibration purposes, five patients who were not included in the sample because&#xD;
      they were used in the pilot study, participated in the training phase of this study. The two&#xD;
      examiners, blinded to the allocation assignment, scheduled these patients for bleaching and&#xD;
      evaluated their teeth against the shade guide at baseline and 30 days after the procedure.&#xD;
      The two examiners were required to have an agreement of at least 85 % (Kappa statistic)&#xD;
      before beginning the study evaluation. For the objective evaluation, a preliminary impression&#xD;
      of the maxillary arch was made using dense silicone Adsil (Vigodent S/A Indústria e&#xD;
      Comércio, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil). The impression was extended to the maxillary canine&#xD;
      and served as a standard color measurement guide for the spectrophotometer. A window was&#xD;
      created on the labial surface of the molded silicone guide for the central incisor to be&#xD;
      evaluated. The window was made using a metal device with well-formed borders, with a radius&#xD;
      of 3 mm. Only one operator took all the measurements in all 30 patients, using Vita Easyshade&#xD;
      (Easyshade, Vident, Brea, CA) before and 30 days after the bleaching therapy. The shade was&#xD;
      determined using the parameters of the Easyshade device where the following values were&#xD;
      indicated: L*, (a*), and (b*), in which L* represents the value from 0 (black) to 100 (white)&#xD;
      and a* and b* represent the shade, where a* is the measurement along the red-green axis and&#xD;
      b* is the measurement along the yellow-blue axis. The color comparison before and after&#xD;
      treatment is given by the difference between the two colors (ΔE), which is calculated using&#xD;
      the formula: ΔE=((ΔL*)2+(Δa*)2+(Δb*) 2)1/2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TS evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients recorded their perception of TS during the first and second bleaching sessions&#xD;
      using three pain scales. A 5-point verbal rating scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 =&#xD;
      considerable, and 4 = severe], a 0 to 100 numerical rating scale and a visual analogue scale&#xD;
      using a 10-cm horizontal line with words &quot;no pain&quot; at one end and &quot;worst pain&quot; at the&#xD;
      opposite end were used in this study. Subjects were asked to record whether they experienced&#xD;
      TS during the treatment up to 1 h after, from 1 to 24 h and from 24 to 48 h after bleaching.&#xD;
      The worst scores/numerical values obtained in both bleaching sessions were considered for&#xD;
      statistical purposes. The values were arranged into two categories: percentage of patients&#xD;
      that reported TS at least once during treatment (absolute risk of TS) and overall TS&#xD;
      intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis was performed after the intention-to-treat protocol and involved all&#xD;
      participants who were randomly assigned. The statistician was blinded to the study groups.&#xD;
      The agreement between the examiners' objective evaluation was evaluated using the kappa&#xD;
      statistic. The primary outcome absolute risk of TS was compared by using the Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test at a 5 % level of significance. The relative risk as well as the confidence interval for&#xD;
      the effect size was calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TS intensity (secondary outcome) was also statistical- ly analyzed. The mean/median and&#xD;
      standard deviation/interquartile range of the three pain scales were calculated. Color&#xD;
      change, another secondary endpoint, was used to assess the efficacy of the bleaching&#xD;
      treatment. For subjective evaluation, the means and standard deviations of SGU at baseline&#xD;
      and 30 days after bleaching for each group were calculated. In order to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      bleaching therapies were effective or not, the data from SGU of both groups were submitted to&#xD;
      a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. A post-hoc analysis (Tukey's test) was used to make&#xD;
      pairwise comparisons. The ΔL, Δa, Δb, and ΔE values were evaluated by Student's t test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data sets were plotted on histograms and inspected for normal distributions. Some data&#xD;
      did not appear to be normally distributed, and therefore, nonparametric statistical tests&#xD;
      were used to compare the various treatments. Statistical analyses of three pain scales&#xD;
      comparing the two groups at the three different assessment points were performed using the&#xD;
      Mann- Whitney U test. Comparisons between times within each group were performed using the&#xD;
      Friedman tests. In all statistical tests, the significance level was set at p = 0.05 values&#xD;
      less than or equal to 5 % indicated significant differences.&#xD;
