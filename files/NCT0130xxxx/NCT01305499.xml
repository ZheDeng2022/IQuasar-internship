  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to help us learn how to best use new drugs which may be active&#xD;
      against acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Two study drugs will be tested: 5AC (5-azacitidine) and&#xD;
      entinostat. 5AC improves blood counts in 50 - 60% of patients with MDS and has also shown&#xD;
      promise in AML. Entinostat has undergone early testing in patients with MDS and AML. It has&#xD;
      decreased the blast count in some patients' blood and bone marrow and has improved the blood&#xD;
      counts in some patients. The combinations of these two classes of drugs are well tolerated&#xD;
      and appear to work well together in laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study at Johns Hopkins University administered 5AC and entinostat in an overlapping&#xD;
      schedule to patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia&#xD;
      (CMMoL), and AML. The impressive results from this study have led to another phase II trial&#xD;
      to further examine this drug combination versus 5AC alone in these patients. In this study,&#xD;
      we want to see how the timing of when 5AC and entinostat are given affects the magnitude of&#xD;
      the disease response.&#xD;

      1. To estimate the major response rate (complete and partial responses by the International&#xD;
           Working Group (IWG) response criteria) in patients with AML who are &gt;= 60 years old and&#xD;
           unable to tolerate or decline cytotoxic chemotherapy or patients who have relapsed&#xD;
           despite one prior regimen and are treated with (a) 5AC 50mg/m2&#xD;
           subcutaneously/intravenously for 10 days on days 1 - 10 of a 28 day cycle given in&#xD;
           combination with entinostat 8 mg (flat dose) administered orally on days 3 and10 of each&#xD;
           cycle or (b) the same regimen of 5AC with entinostat given on days 10 and 17.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the overall response rate (complete, partial, and hematologic improvement-&#xD;
           major by IWG criteria) following treatment with two different dose schedules of&#xD;
           5-Azacytidine and entinostat in patients with AML &gt;= 60 years old who are unable to&#xD;
           tolerate or decline cytotoxic chemotherapy or those who have relapsed despite one prior&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify changes in gene promoter methylation and gene expression in response to&#xD;
           combination therapy with 5AC and entinostat and compare the dynamics and kinetics of&#xD;
           these alterations in promoter methylation and gene re-expression in the two different&#xD;
           dosing schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effect of entinostat on the induction of hyperacetylation of histones&#xD;
           from peripheral blood and/or bone marrow samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate changes in DNA damage in response to combination therapy using gammaH2AX&#xD;
           determination by western blotting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate immune parameters after exposure to 5AC and entinostat when given at either&#xD;
           dosing schedule and to evaluate these in relation to clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate duration of response.&#xD;
