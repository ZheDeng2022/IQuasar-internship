  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no effective treatment for late infantile MLD once clinical symptoms are&#xD;
      evident. METAZYM is a recombinant human arylsulfatase A developed for an intravenous ERT for&#xD;
      the treatment of late infantile MLD. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of intravenous rhASA treatment in a patient with late infantile MLD who&#xD;
      had previously received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the&#xD;
      deficiency of the Arylsulfatase A enzyme (ARSA), resulting in accumulation of galactosyl&#xD;
      sulfatide (cerebroside sulfate), a major constituent of the myelin sheath. Accumulation of&#xD;
      galactosyl sulfatides leads to a progressive degeneration of the white matter in the central&#xD;
      and peripheral nervous system (CNS, PNS) and neuronal degeneration. The late infantile form&#xD;
      of MLD, which usually is diagnosed in the second year of life, is the most frequent and&#xD;
      severe form of the disease. The prognosis is severe, leading to vegetative stage or death&#xD;
      within few years after the diagnosis. There is no treatment for patients affected with this&#xD;
      early onset form of the disease. In patients with late-onset MLD (juvenile and adult forms),&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can stabilize the cerebral demyelination.&#xD;
      This treatment is however inefficient in patients with late infantile MLD at a symptomatic&#xD;
      stage. The overall objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rhASA treatment in a&#xD;
      patient with late infantile MLD who had received HCT at a presymptomatic stage of the&#xD;
      disease. Patient will receive rhARSA (100 U/kg) intravenously every other week for a period&#xD;
      of 18 months.&#xD;
