  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project's objective is to explore the impact of Mindfulness-Based-Stress-Reduction (MBSR)&#xD;
      on pain regulation, social stress, basic affective and attention functions, and on the brain,&#xD;
      immune, and endocrine mechanisms that subserve these processes. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that participants undergoing MBSR training will show decreased&#xD;
      emotional distress on self-report measures, increased sustained attention on a behavioral&#xD;
      task, decreased stress levels on a social stress test, decreased general psychosocial stress&#xD;
      as indexed by diurnal salivary cortisol profile, changes in inflammatory response, modulation&#xD;
      of cellular aging, and different neural patterns in response to thermal pain and aversive&#xD;
      visual stimuli as indexed by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test these hypotheses, the study will recruit 50 participants through the UW-Madison&#xD;
      Integrative Medicine Program. All participants will be randomly assigned either to an 8-week&#xD;
      MBSR program or to an 8-week training program in health-enhancement. At the conclusion of the&#xD;
      study, participants will be invited to participate to the second class should they be&#xD;
      interested. Participants will complete self-report questionnaires, behavioral tasks, fMRI&#xD;
      scanning, cortisol sampling, and blood sampling before training begins, after the first&#xD;
      program ends, and again four months after the first program ends and prior to the second&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If hypotheses are supported, the study may benefit participants by reducing their&#xD;
      psychological distress, increasing their well-being, and helping them better manage pain and&#xD;
      aversive stimuli. There are no other direct benefits to participants. Potential risks&#xD;
      associated with fMRI include ferromagnetic collision, neurostimulation effects, and&#xD;
      psychological discomfort. Potential risks to subjects include slight potential discomfort in&#xD;
      providing saliva samples, discomfort of painful thermal stimulation, stress associated with&#xD;
      the Trier Social Stress Test, some psychological discomfort from viewing disturbing&#xD;
      photographs as part of the compassion fMRI study, and breach of confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent for the present study will entail both written and verbal descriptions of the&#xD;
      protocol. Subjects will be informed that their participation is completely voluntary, and&#xD;
      that they can withdraw at any time.&#xD;
