    <textblock>
      The target enrollment goal for the trial was to enroll 36 subjects. However due to a&#xD;
      challenging protocol inclusion/ exclusion criteria, only one subject was enrolled since the&#xD;
      trial was initiated in June 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the following in participants undergoing coronary artery scaffolding/stenting for&#xD;
      significant coronary artery disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The acute (post-implantation) effect of an implanted bioresorbable vascular scaffold&#xD;
           (BVS) or metallic drug eluting stent (mDES) on coronary blood flow and physiological&#xD;
           responsiveness of the target coronary artery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The long-term (2 years) effect of an implanted BVS or mDES on coronary blood flow and&#xD;
           physiological responsiveness of the target coronary artery&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Prospective, randomized, single-blinded, multi-center clinical investigation comparing&#xD;
           target vessel and non-intervened, self-control vessel within participants and between&#xD;
           participants undergoing BVS or mDES deployment for the treatment of a single de novo&#xD;
           native coronary artery lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigation will include two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study device (BVS) arm: Abbott Vascular's Everolimus-Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular&#xD;
                Scaffold&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control device (mDES) arm: Abbott Vascular's Everolimus-Eluting XIENCE V or XIENCE&#xD;
