  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the interproximal plaque removal ability of&#xD;
      Philips Sonicare Interproximal Cleaning Device to floss (Crest Glide) and Waterpik&#xD;
      Waterflosser. In addition, we seek to learn more about the results of using this device on&#xD;
      plaque accumulation and what biological processes influence the makeup of plaque and&#xD;
      reduction of gingivitis.&#xD;

      Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint of this study is the residual protein concentration in&#xD;
      posterior sites following single use treatment with either manual toothbrush, manual&#xD;
      toothbrush + Sonicare IP cleaning prototype, manual toothbrush + Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser&#xD;
      or manual toothbrush + floss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints Gingival bleeding index and Modified gingival index following single use&#xD;
      treatment with either MTB, MTB + IP cleaning prototype, MTB + Waterpik Waterflosser or MTB +&#xD;
      floss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons of the concentration levels of 272 different pathogens between treatment groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarker profiles following the different treatment modalities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints based on adverse events and intraoral exam (soft tissue evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IP cleaning satisfaction questionnaire following treatment with either MTB, MTB + IP cleaning&#xD;
      prototype, MTB + Waterpik Waterflosser or MTB + floss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Duration of Study The planned duration of a subject's participation in this study is&#xD;
      approximately 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation Criteria/Stopping Rules If in the opinion of the investigator, the health or&#xD;
      safety of a subject is affected adversely by participation in the study or non-compliance to&#xD;
      at-home oral hygiene regimen adversely effects test product familiarization or plaque&#xD;
      regrowth, the subject will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls to Minimize Bias All eligible subjects will be randomized at Visit 1. Randomization&#xD;
      of Subjects and Balance of Test Groups Subjects will be randomized to one of the four&#xD;
      treatment groups according to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by gender to&#xD;
      complete with approximately 68 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding The examiner and laboratory personnel will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance of randomization Codes In order to minimize bias, this study will be randomized&#xD;
      and single blind - the Examiners performing the interproximal plaque sampling and gingivitis&#xD;
      assessment are the designated blinded personnel. Unblinding of study data will not occur&#xD;
      until after all study procedures have been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Regimen and Product Labeling The devices used in this study are subject only to&#xD;
      Class I (general controls) and considered exempt from the premarket notification procedures&#xD;
      and not subject to section 510(k), 515, or 520(m,) of the FDC Act in order to be legally&#xD;
      marketed. Thus, the study does not meet the definition of an Applicable Clinical Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive an ADA Reference manual toothbrush, timer, dentifrice and, if&#xD;
      assigned, an IP cleaning device (either Sonicare Prototype, Crest Glide Floss or Waterpik&#xD;
      Ultra Water Flosser (WP 100) with the Classic Jet Tip). Subjects are to brush twice daily for&#xD;
      two minutes and, if assigned, use their IP cleaning device once daily, in the evening, after&#xD;
      toothbrushing. The Directions for Use for all devices can be found in the protocol Appendices&#xD;
      and should be reviewed with the subjects who shall demonstrate proper usage at the time of&#xD;
      product assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Treatments not Permitted on Study Once enrolled on-study, the use of any&#xD;
      additional oral hygiene treatments and aids other than those prescribed is prohibited. A list&#xD;
      of prohibited devices and aids includes but is not limited to mouthwash, chewing gum,&#xD;
      whitening products, non-assigned interproximal cleaning aids/devices or breath films. The use&#xD;
      of any dentifrice other than that dispensed at Visit 2 is prohibited. In the event that an&#xD;
      enrolled subject requires dental care outside the scope of the study, he/she will be&#xD;
      discontinued from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of antibiotics or antibacterial agents while participating on the study is also&#xD;
      prohibited and subjects who are required to use them will be removed from the dataset for&#xD;
      endpoint analysis. The use of prescription strength and repeat dose of non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants (including Aspirin) for longer than 2 days is also&#xD;
      prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All deviations from the prescribed treatment will be documented and continued eligibility&#xD;
      will be reassessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Sample Size Sample size justification is based on considerations of&#xD;
      statistical power for detecting a difference in mean residual protein concentration (RPC)&#xD;
      between the manual toothbrush group and the manual toothbrush + Sonicare Interproximal (IP)&#xD;
      Cleaning Prototype group. A sample size of 17 per group at visit 3 (the anticipated sample&#xD;
      size after allowance for dropout) will provide 80% power for detecting a difference in mean&#xD;
      RPC between groups of 4.71 (Âµg/ml) assuming a subject-level standard error of the average of&#xD;
      two RPC measurements of 4.76 (the square of this standard error is the variance determined&#xD;
      from assuming an RPC IP site-specific standard deviation of 6.15, and an intramouth&#xD;
      correlation of the two RPC measurements of 0.2, as estimated from a statistical model (see&#xD;
      8.6) for preliminary data that adjusts for baseline RPC).&#xD;
