    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigator will be approaching pregnant women to undertake 2 years of&#xD;
      weekly respiratory and nappy specimen collection from their healthy new born infant. These&#xD;
      specimens will be mailed to the Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases (Qpid) Laboratory&#xD;
      where they will be stored and batched tested for viruses and bacteria. As well as this,&#xD;
      parents will keep a simple daily symptom diary for their child, allowing us to match&#xD;
      detection of viruses and bacteria to periods when the study child did or did not have&#xD;
      symptoms. This will help our understanding of what finding these viruses and bacteria in&#xD;
      specimens from children really means.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, community-based longitudinal birth cohort study of respiratory&#xD;
      and gastrointestinal pathogen detection in Brisbane infants. The enrollment target of 138&#xD;
      children will take 2 years to achieve, each child will be followed until their second&#xD;
      birthday, and a final year will be required for specimen and data analysis; for a total&#xD;
      duration of the study of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women are to be recruited antenatally over a period of two years from study commencement&#xD;
      (mid-2010). These hospitals serve communities from the north of Brisbane, a city of almost 2&#xD;
      million people, and every year each has roughly 5,200 (RBWH) and 1,700 (North West) annual&#xD;
      deliveries respectively. The investigators will follow 138 infants from birth until their&#xD;
      second birthday. Where a family drops out of the study or is lost to follow-up, they will be&#xD;
      replaced to maintain overall person-time for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progressive 2 year recruitment plan allows for seasonal and year-to-year variation in&#xD;
      respiratory virus activity. Eligible infants will be healthy term babies without conditions&#xD;
      that predispose to more frequent or severe infectious episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will keep a simple, daily, infection symptom diary, completed using tick boxes and&#xD;
      numbers, which the investigators will request be returned on a 4-weekly basis. A similar&#xD;
      diary was used for a 12-month cohort study conducted in Melbourne (2003-2004) with excellent&#xD;
      return rate and acceptability by study families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study families are to be contacted monthly by their preferred method of communication&#xD;
      (telephone, SMS, or email) to encourage continued performance of study tasks and answer study&#xD;
      related questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be asked to identify acute respiratory illness (ARI) and acute gastroenteritis&#xD;
      (AGE) in study children. These are defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ARI: presence of at least one yellow OR at least two blue symptoms on a single day; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AGE: three or more watery or looser-than-normal stools OR vomiting on a single day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When an ARI or AGE occur, parents will be asked to complete an impact diary for the duration&#xD;
      of illness. Parents will be asked to contact us in the event of hospitalisation due to any&#xD;
      cause. Parents will be asked to provide consent for hospital/GP release of information to&#xD;
      allow study staff to collect details of episodes of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cord blood will also be collected at birth and stored for later identification of&#xD;
      pathogen-specific antibodies and immune mediators linked to disease susceptibility. A&#xD;
      respiratory and stool swab will be collected from study neonates within one day of birth. At&#xD;
      this visit, the investigators will collect a respiratory swab from the parent/s of the child&#xD;
      - this will allow us to compare presence of pathogens in the neonate and parents, and will be&#xD;
      the only time parents will be swabbed. Parents will be trained in the process of collecting&#xD;
      the study swabs at this visit. All material and instructions required for this process will&#xD;
      be provided to parents at no cost. Telephone and visiting support to assist and guide&#xD;
      specimen collection will be available for study parents at all stages during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be asked to routinely collect two specimens on the same day of the week as the&#xD;
      initial visit, weekly until the end of the study. The specimens are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a combined anterior nares swab, collected from both nostrils using a single,&#xD;
           rayon-budded swab. The swab comes with its own transport tube containing a VTM-soaked&#xD;
           sponge in the base. The completed swab is placed in the transport tube and the VTM&#xD;
           sponge is squeezed to bath the swab; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a stool swab from a dirty nappy, collected and handled using the swab similar to the&#xD;
           anterior nares swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both swabs are mailed back to Qpid Laboratory as soon as possible after collection, using&#xD;
      pre-addressed, reply post, padded envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All specimens will be batch tested for a variety of pathogens using validated PCR methods&#xD;
      developed at Qpid. Samples from children with ARI or AGE for whom a known agent cannot be&#xD;
      identified, will be made available for further investigations for the presence of as yet&#xD;
      unidentified viruses.&#xD;
