  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MAMAS study is built on the premise that simple recommendations for diet and exercise may&#xD;
      not be enough to encourage healthy weight gain during pregnancy. Psychological skills&#xD;
      training may be necessary to help women deal with stress and cravings; learn to regulate&#xD;
      difficult emotions; increase awareness; and encourage healthy eating and physical activity.&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to find out whether a behavioral stress reduction intervention can&#xD;
      help women achieve healthy weight gain during pregnancy and reduce stress.&#xD;

      The MAMAS study is adapting and testing interventions - &quot;Moms in Joy,&quot; based on Emotional&#xD;
      Brain Training (EBT) (developed by Laurel Mellin) and &quot;Mindful Moms,&quot; (MIND) based on the&#xD;
      Mindful Motherhood Training (developed by Cassandra Vieten, PhD), Mindfulness-Based-Eating&#xD;
      and Awareness Training (MB-EAT) (developed by Jean Kristeller, PhD), and other mindfulness-&#xD;
      and acceptance-based interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase of this study, the investigators conducted in-depth focus groups with over&#xD;
      60 overweight, low to middle-income, pregnant women to learn more about what they might be&#xD;
      looking for in such an intervention. In the second phase, which began in fall 2010, 48 low-&#xD;
      to middle-income overweight pregnant women were randomly assigned to one of the&#xD;
      interventions. Based on the knowledge gained from Phase 2, we refined the MIND intervention&#xD;
      and are conducting an efficacy trial in Phase 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase 3, we will enroll 220 overweight, low to middle-income, pregnant women in a&#xD;
      trial of MIND to test feasibility and to examine changes in hypothesized mechanisms (stress,&#xD;
      opioid tone), non-homeostatic eating, and in health outcomes (abdominal fat, insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, weight change) in the intervention group (n=110). Intervention participants will&#xD;
      complete a battery of psychological and clinical measures (weight, BMI, waist/hip ratio, body&#xD;
      composition) at baseline, post-intervention, 32-34 weeks gestation, and 3 and 9 months&#xD;
      postpartum. Control participants (n=110) will complete the same battery of psychological&#xD;
      measures at baseline and 8-10 weeks after baseline. All study participants will complete&#xD;
      brief psychological, weight and waist/hip ratio measures at 6 months postpartum.&#xD;
      Additionally, we will obtain prenatal and labor/delivery medical records for all study&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently pregnant, target 8-19 weeks gestation (intervention starts at 12-19 weeks&#xD;
             gestation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Singleton gestation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 to 45 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-pregnancy BMI 25-41 and &lt; 300 pounds&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Income to poverty ratio â‰¤ 500% specific to family size&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to provide informed consent or speak English (intervention is in English)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Needle phobic or fainting in response to blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Substance abuse, mental health, or medical condition that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             investigators, will make it difficult for the potential participant to participate in&#xD;
             the group intervention and/or affects baseline metabolism or body composition (e.g.,&#xD;
             hypertension, asthma, arthritis, severe food allergies, HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eating disorder which would make it difficult for the potential participant to follow&#xD;
             the exercise, diet, and mind-body training guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Polycystic ovarian syndrome treated with Metformin since this is indicative of insulin&#xD;
             resistance and makes long term weight loss difficult, which are relevant outcomes in&#xD;
             this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes or positive early diabetes screening test in the current pregnancy (weight&#xD;
             loss is affected by insulin resistance)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous or current mindfulness meditation practice with a typically sitting&#xD;
             meditation of 20 or more minutes two or more times per week&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent weight loss (more than 5% within past 6 months). In addition, women with a&#xD;
             history of known coronary artery disease (CAD), or typical or atypical anginal chest&#xD;
             pain will require a letter from the participant's physician that he or she has been&#xD;
             adequately evaluated and that a moderate exercise program is appropriate. A study&#xD;
             physician must review the case and agree. Study participation involves a moderate&#xD;
             exercise program. Although moderate exercise is recommended for persons with CAD, we&#xD;
             want to ensure that steps have been taken to limit the risks of the exercise&#xD;
             component.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic use of systemic (oral or IV) corticosteroids in the 6 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment (steroid use may reduce the efficacy of the intervention)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of gastric bypass surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Multiple gestation&#xD;
