  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if higher-than usual doses of daily folic acid has&#xD;
      an effect on the rate of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or gestational hypertension in&#xD;
      pregnant women while determining status of folic acid, vitamin B12, homocysteine and vitamin&#xD;
      D in pregnancy.&#xD;

      Subjects (DoD beneficiaries) will be recruited from all non-diabetic female subjects whom are&#xD;
      at least 18 years of age and are empanelled for care at Nellis Air Force Base. Upon arrival&#xD;
      at the mandatory New Obstetrics (OB) Orientation, potential subjects will be offered an&#xD;
      opportunity to participate in this study. A total of 650 subjects will be recruited. After&#xD;
      consent and HIPAA Authorization is obtained, the subjects will have Baseline blood pressure,&#xD;
      fasting glucose, folic acid, vitamin B12, homocysteine, vitamin D measurements, and weight,&#xD;
      height, race, ethnicity, parity, vegetarian status recorded. Subjects will be written a&#xD;
      prescription and sent to the Clinical Pharmacy where they will be randomized via block&#xD;
      randomization. After randomization, they will receive either placebo or 4 milligrams of folic&#xD;
      acid (in addition to the standard of care pre-natal vitamins) from the pharmacy--thus&#xD;
      investigators and subjects will be blinded as to their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Placebo plus standard of care pre-natal vitamins (which include 1 milligram of folic&#xD;
      acid) a day for the duration of pregnancy Group 2: Will take an additional 4-milligrams of&#xD;
      folic acid a day for the duration of pregnancy plus standard of care pre-natal vitamins&#xD;
      (which include 1 milligram of folic acid)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Placebo will be a gelatin capsule filled with starch which does not increase the risks to&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-natal vitamins dispensed at the MOFH Clinical Pharmacy include 1 milligram of folic&#xD;
      acid. The folic acid is manufactured by West Ward Pharmaceutical Corp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those subjects in Group 2 will be taking a total of 5 milligrams of folic acid (1 milligram&#xD;
      of folic acid is contained in their standard of care pre-natal vitamins and they will be&#xD;
      given an additional 4 milligrams of folic acid as part of this research study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo is manufactured by Green Valley Medical Supply Company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to receive routine obstetrics care and take their prescription for the&#xD;
      duration of their pregnancy. Per the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG),&#xD;
      patients will be tested for gestational diabetes either at 2nd trimester for those with risk&#xD;
      factors of prior GDM, age &gt;34 or body mass index &gt;25 or at 28 weeks for standard risk women.&#xD;
      There will be an unblinded person to monitor any adverse effects that may occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 28 weeks gestation, weight, height, diagnosis of GDM, gestational hypertension,&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia, post-partum hemorrhage, maternal death will be recorded, and will be asked if&#xD;
      they took the study medications as prescribed (studies have shown that patient recall is as&#xD;
      accurate as pill counts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At delivery, folic acid, B12, homocysteine, vitamin D will be measured and weight, height,&#xD;
      diagnosis of GDM, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, post-partum hemorrhage, maternal&#xD;
      death, birth weight, shoulder dystocia, neonatal/fetal mortality will be recorded, and will&#xD;
      be asked if they took the study medications as prescribed (studies have shown that patient&#xD;
      recall is as accurate as pill counts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the first 200 subjects, an interim power analysis to identify whether the&#xD;
      trial can be stopped early. At this point and at the conclusion of the study, the data will&#xD;
      be de-identified and analyzed. A paper will be written and submitted to a scientific journal&#xD;
      at the conclusion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When subjects have completed the study, the Pharmacy will then de-randomize the information&#xD;
      and send to the Principal Investigator for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any time during the study, the subject decides to withdraw from the study, they will be&#xD;
      referred to their Primary Care Manager to initiate standard of care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any subjects experience fetal demise or maternal death, the Principal Investigator will&#xD;
      consult with Obstetrics to initiate proper clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Folic acid is a common supplement in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;In accordance with 21 CFR 312.2(b)(i-v), an IND exemption is requested based on the&#xD;
      following provisions: (i) The investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a&#xD;
      well-controlled study in support of a new indication for use nor intended to be used to&#xD;
      support any other significant change in the labeling for the drug; (ii) If the drug that is&#xD;
      undergoing investigation is lawfully marketed as a prescription drug product, the&#xD;
      investigation is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the&#xD;
      product; (iii) The investigation does not involve a route of administration or dosage level&#xD;
      or use in a patient population or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or&#xD;
      decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product; (iv)&#xD;
      The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements for institutional review&#xD;
      set forth in part 56 and with the requirements for informed consent set forth in part 50; and&#xD;
      (v) The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements of ยง312.7.&quot;&#xD;
