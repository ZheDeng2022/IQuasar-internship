  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the past two decades, there current concept has evolved significantly that&#xD;
      ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) may not only impose a direct mechanical stress and&#xD;
      subsequent injury to the lungs, but may also induce local as well as systemic inflammation&#xD;
      responses, generally referred as biotrauma.1 Patients with ARDS often die of severe systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and multiorgan dysfunction2 rather than refractory&#xD;
      hypoxemia. Ranieri et al found that patients with less severe ARDS, i.e., a lung injury score&#xD;
      of 2.5 or less, receiving ventilation with lung protective strategy involving low tidal&#xD;
      volume (7.5 mL/kg PBW) and high PEEP could attenuate the pulmonary and systemic cytokine&#xD;
      response compared with conventional ventilation with high tidal volume.3 Stuber et al found&#xD;
      an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung and plasma of patients with ARDS within&#xD;
      1 hour after switching the patients from a protective to non-protective ventilator strategy.4&#xD;
      The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) was recently identified as a marker&#xD;
      of injury to the alveolar type I epithelial cells5. Clinical studies showed that the plasma&#xD;
      level of RAGE was associated with severity of lung injury and clinical outcome, and low tidal&#xD;
      volume strategy ventilation accelerated the decline in plasma RAGE levels. These results&#xD;
      suggest plasma RAGE level might be a reliable biomarker of alveolar epithelial injury in&#xD;
      acute lung injury and may associated with ventilator induced lung injury6. Although, current&#xD;
      approach to mechanical ventilation of a patient with ARDS emphasizes the use of lower tidal&#xD;
      volumes with lower plateau pressures to avoid causing lung overdistension and ventilator&#xD;
      associated lung injury (VILI)7; however, in the real world, some studies showed that strictly&#xD;
      reduction of tidal volume to 6ml/kg PBW was modest in modern time, and was noticed only in&#xD;
      patients with greater lung injury scores8. The benefit of VT strictly reduction to 6ml/kgPBW&#xD;
      and its effect on VILI in patients with less severe ARDS whose Pplat are already below 30&#xD;
      cmH2O are controversy9. One of the possible solutions is to look at the biomarkers of injury&#xD;
      to alveolar epithelial cells. Of these potentially promising markers, the receptor for&#xD;
      advanced glycation end-product (RAGE) is of great interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that a strategy with strict low tidal volume in less severe ARDS and ALI&#xD;
      patients with good compliance may be beneficial to this patient population. Therefore, we&#xD;
      wish to propose a prospective single-center study to investigate the effect of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation strategy on the plasma level of RAGE in patients with less severe ARDS and acute&#xD;
      lung injury.&#xD;
