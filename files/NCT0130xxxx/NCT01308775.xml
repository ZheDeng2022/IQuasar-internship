    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that will compare two systems of breast cancer follow up care and will&#xD;
      evaluate a number of parameters indicating quality and efficiency of care delivery as well as&#xD;
      patient satisfaction with care. Approximately 100 breast cancer patients who have completed&#xD;
      the acute phase of treatment will be randomized to one of two follow up care plans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 200,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in the year 2006. Many of these women&#xD;
      will be rendered free of cancer, but will need ongoing disease specific care and&#xD;
      surveillance. The estimated number of breast cancer survivors in the year 2003 was 2.3&#xD;
      million (1). With outcomes improving after the diagnosis of early breast cancer, the number&#xD;
      of breast cancer survivors in follow up care will continue to increase and eventually result&#xD;
      in an unmanageable load on the subspecialties of medical and surgical oncology. Most of these&#xD;
      patients continue to be seen by an oncology specialist for at least five years after their&#xD;
      cancer diagnosis, but this type of follow up may not be necessary or optimally utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternate Strategies for Health Care Delivery Studies suggest that oncology follow up care is&#xD;
      costly to the health care system no matter who the provider is, and in some cases, diagnostic&#xD;
      tests are overused (2). In a randomized trial of 296 women with a history of breast cancer in&#xD;
      Great Britain, transfer of routine follow-up care to a family physician did not result in an&#xD;
      increase in the time to diagnosis of recurrence (3). Patient satisfaction was greater and&#xD;
      health service costs were less, and anxiety and health related quality of life were&#xD;
      unaffected (4, 5). A similar multicenter trial of 968 early-stage breast cancer patients in&#xD;
      Canada who had completed adjuvant treatment randomized patients to follow up in a cancer&#xD;
      center or with their own family physician (6). This study found no statistically significant&#xD;
      differences in number of recurrences, deaths, recurrence related serious clinical events, or&#xD;
      patient reported health-related quality of life questionnaires between the groups. While&#xD;
      transferring oncology follow-up care back to primary care physicians seems a reasonable&#xD;
      alternative, the shortage of primary care physicians in certain regions of the US and around&#xD;
      the world, limits this approach (7, 8). A study in Sweden compared nurse-led follow-up vs.&#xD;
      physician follow-up in 264 consecutively selected women with newly diagnosed Stage I or II&#xD;
      breast cancer (9). Outcomes included measures of patient well-being, satisfaction, access to&#xD;
      medical care, and medical safety. Questionnaires containing the Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale (HADS), and the Satisfaction and Accessibility (SaaC) scale were obtained at&#xD;
      baseline and twice a year over a period of 5 years. Number of contacts with health care&#xD;
      services, number of diagnostic procedures, and time to recurrence or death were monitored.&#xD;
      Ratings of HADS and SaaC scales did not show any statistically significant differences&#xD;
      between the follow-up groups. The levels of anxiety and depression were generally low, and&#xD;
      levels of patient satisfaction high. There were no differences between the groups concerning&#xD;
      time to recurrence or death suggesting that follow-up care with an experienced nurse&#xD;
      professional is safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various strategies have been studied to evaluate alternatives to routine clinic visits and&#xD;
      referrals to subspecialists in order to improve access to care and to lower health care&#xD;
      costs. One such study tested the hypotheses that virtual outreach would reduce number of&#xD;
      contacts with the health care system, reduce the number of medical tests and interventions,&#xD;
      and have a positive impact on patient satisfaction. A randomized controlled trial was&#xD;
      conducted which compared standard outpatient referral to joint teleconsultations between&#xD;
      general practitioners (GP), specialists, and patients (10). Patients randomized to virtual&#xD;
      outreach underwent a joint teleconsultation, in which they and their GP consulted with a&#xD;
      hospital specialist via a videolink. In this study, patients in the virtual outreach group&#xD;
      were more likely to be scheduled for a follow-up appointment, but fewer tests and&#xD;
      investigations were ordered. In the 6-month period following the initial consultation, there&#xD;
      were no significant differences in number of contacts or outpatient visits with GP, inpatient&#xD;
      stays, procedures, or prescriptions between the randomized groups. Patient satisfaction was&#xD;
      greater after a virtual outreach consultation, and patient enablement and the physical and&#xD;
      psychological scores of the Short Form-12, did not differ between the randomized groups.&#xD;
      Interestingly, health care costs over 6 months were greater for the virtual outreach&#xD;
      consultations than for conventional outpatients, but overall cost, time, and productivity&#xD;
      savings to patients were identified. This study represents an example of how technology can&#xD;
      be utilized to streamline care and provide more patient centered services, but that these&#xD;
      services may not save money overall in the health care system. The need to assess the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness and patient outcomes of alternate surveillance and follow up strategies&#xD;
      was recently highlighted in a review article by Tolaney (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      UCSF and Dynamic Clinical Systems (DCS) Collaboration The UCSF Breast Care Center has&#xD;
      embarked upon collaboration with Dynamic Clinic Systems to implement a computer based,&#xD;
      patient centered system of symptom reporting and data collection to improve clinical care to&#xD;
      our patients and generate databases of patient reported symptoms and outcomes information for&#xD;
      research purposes. Dynamic Clinical Systems (DCS) is a provider of real-time Web-based&#xD;
      applications focusing on the patient-clinician interaction. The DCS approach enables patients&#xD;
      to provide health data electronically. Clinicians may use this data for research, medical&#xD;
      documentation, and registries depending on the type of data collected and the consent of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this system, patients will report their own health information via the DCS web-based&#xD;
      Integrated Survey System (ISS). The process is as follows: A real-time interface downloads&#xD;
      appointments from the hospital scheduling system into ISS. Survey groups are automatically&#xD;
      scheduled based on pre-defined timing parameters. Prior to sending the patient their first&#xD;
      survey, each patient will be called and welcomed to the program and asked if they use the&#xD;
      internet. If they do, they will be given instructions for completion of surveys at home. If&#xD;
      they need assistance, they will be given an appointment to come to our resource center and&#xD;
      work with our staff member to complete the survey. The patient will be notified (via&#xD;
      automatically-generated email from ISS or hospital letter/phone) to either sign on and take&#xD;
      the survey from home or come to clinic early to take the survey. Once logged in, the patient&#xD;
      has the opportunity to indicate online consent (to be approved by CHR) to share data for&#xD;
      research purposes. An analyst will monitor the progress of survey completion and will call&#xD;
      any patient whose surveys are not complete prior to their clinic appointment to facilitate&#xD;
      survey completion. At the end of the process, a patient summary report is generated in ISS&#xD;
      displaying a summary of patient survey answers, longitudinal comparisons of previous surveys,&#xD;
      red flags and warnings, and quality measures. The clinician uses this report during the&#xD;
      clinic visit to focus the discussion on highlighted items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCS is a service vendor who has built and who services the online-questionnaire platform. All&#xD;
      content in the questionnaires has been created and reviewed by the investigators at UCSF&#xD;
      (with the exception of standardized surveys such as the SF-36 and other validated&#xD;
      questionnaires). Other than this, the DCS has no role in this study, and it does not receive&#xD;
      or have access to information regarding study outcomes (such as in terms of patient visits or&#xD;
      interventions) from either arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to implement and evaluate a comprehensive survivorship program, supported by this&#xD;
      interactive web-based system for reporting physical and psychological symptoms. The system&#xD;
      will capture structured data that then can be used to drive translation of research findings&#xD;
      to improve care for survivors. The System for Individualized survivorship care, based on&#xD;
      patient Self-reported data, with review by Nurse practitioners, targeted Education, and&#xD;
      Triage to appropriate services to improve symptom management and outcomes will be called&#xD;
      SIS.NET&#xD;
