  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a rising incidence of incidentally detected small renal tumours due to improved&#xD;
      imaging techniques. Traditionally, patients diagnosed with these small renal masses undergo&#xD;
      surgery and therefore there is limited data about the natural history of these tumours.&#xD;
      Several small series have reported that most of these small masses grow slowly and might not&#xD;
      require early intervention and that only some masses grow rapidly requiring immediate&#xD;
      surgery. Presently, the investigators have not been able to identify prospectively which&#xD;
      masses are going to grow slowly. The investigators plan to use computed tomography (CT) and&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) parameters, microsatellite analysis and tissue analysis to&#xD;
      determine which masses will behave more aggressively. Additionally, the observations on the&#xD;
      natural history of small renal masses need to be validated with a multicentric and&#xD;
      systematically followed cohort.&#xD;

      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since most renal cell carcinomas (RCC's) that are now detected by imaging as small renal&#xD;
      masses, grow slowly and remain asymptomatic for years, we hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small RCC's that are destined to metastasize do so early or after they reach a larger&#xD;
           size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delayed surgical treatment of asymptomatic, incidentally detected, small RCC's WILL NOT&#xD;
           have a significant impact on overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The majority of small RCC's MAY NOT need to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RCC's that are destined to progress can be identified by abnormal perfusion patterns on&#xD;
           imaging and by their cellular and genomic characteristics on needle biopsy.&#xD;

    <description>Time to tumour progression will be measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of progression or, if progression has not occurred, until the date of last follow-up.</description>

    <description>Defined by volume (cm3 ) measured over time (years). Tumour bi-dimensional diameter will be recorded and reported to allow comparison with the literature to date. Tumour volume will be calculated from follow-up images using the formula for ellipsoid volume: 0.5326 x X x Y x Z.</description>
