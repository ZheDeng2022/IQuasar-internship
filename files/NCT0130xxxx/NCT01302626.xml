      Aim of the study: The main aim is to collect data of patients with lung cancer, and to&#xD;
      perform different analyses on this data. The data contains information on patient and tumor&#xD;
      characteristics, imaging, and treatment characteristics. With this data it is possible to&#xD;
      improve and validate the predictive model for survival and long term toxicity in lung cancer&#xD;
      by multicentric prospective data collection. The long term aim, beyond this specific study,&#xD;
      is to build a Decision Support System based on the predictive models validated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The general hypothesis is that we get a better prediction in terms of AUC (area&#xD;
      under the curve) of survival and long term toxicity when we combine multifactorial variables.&#xD;
      These variables consist of information from clinical data, imaging data, data related to&#xD;
      treatment type and treatment quality.&#xD;

      1. Treatment of lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
           Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in The Netherlands, with an annual&#xD;
           incidence exceeding 8,000. Two main variants of lung cancer can be identified: small&#xD;
           cell and non-small cell lung cancer (SCLC and NSCLC respectively), the latter comprising&#xD;
           approximately 80% of the lung cancer cases. Despite treatment improvement, the prognosis&#xD;
           of NSCLC remains poor, with a median survival of 8 months after diagnosis, and a 5 year&#xD;
           survival of less than 13%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Radiotherapy plays a key role in the treatment of NSCLC. Over the years,&#xD;
           radiotherapeutical treatment options have increased tremendously. These include dose&#xD;
           escalation, more intensive schedules and concurrent chemo-radiotherapy. These schedules&#xD;
           have improved both local control and survival in patients. However, they also induce&#xD;
           more toxicity, and the radiation oncologist faces the challenging task of choosing the&#xD;
           optimal therapy for each patient: taking into account tumor characteristics as well as&#xD;
           the patient's condition. In other words: the physician must estimate the expected&#xD;
           therapeutic ratio often on a background of insufficient outcomes information.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The same problem arises in other therapies for lung cancer, chemotherapy and surgery. In&#xD;
           early disease, surgery is the mainstay of the treatment of lung cancer patients. This&#xD;
           can be combined with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prediction of response&#xD;
&#xD;
           A major problem in lung cancer management is the lack of data dealing with predictive&#xD;
           factors for prognosis and treatment outcome. The currently used staging system (TNM)&#xD;
           does not accurately predict outcome within homogeneous treatment groups. As a result, an&#xD;
           individualized therapeutic ratio cannot be calculated, leading to either over- or&#xD;
           under-treatment of many patients and hampering further optimization of any therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Attempts were undertaken to refine and improve the risk stratification, leading to the&#xD;
           development of several prediction models. The performance of the models is usually&#xD;
           expressed as the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic&#xD;
           (ROC). The maximum value of the AUC is 1.0; indicating a perfect prediction model. A&#xD;
           value of 0.5 indicates that patients are correctly classified in 50% of the cases, e.g.&#xD;
           as good as chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           While high prediction accuracy (AUC=0.85) has been achieved for a population of NSCLC&#xD;
           patients of all stages, treated with different modalities, it is a more challenging task&#xD;
           to predict survival accurately when focusing on a subgroup. A pretreatment prediction&#xD;
           model for patients treated with surgery yielded an AUC of 0.61 while a pretreatment&#xD;
           model for patients treated with radiotherapy resulted in an AUC of 0.75. Further&#xD;
           improvement of the radiotherapy model was obtained by adding information about blood&#xD;
           biomarkers and this extended model yielded an AUC of 0.83. Investigating other blood&#xD;
           biomarkers or possible combinations of biomarkers is a challenge and our results&#xD;
           underline the importance of using these data in addition to clinical and imaging&#xD;
           parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Survival remains certainly an outcome of major importance, but the last decades other&#xD;
           treatment-related outcome measures, such as radiation induced lung injury or esophageal&#xD;
           damage, became more important for the evaluation of treatment results.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pneumonitis or radiation induced lung injury has been subject of many studies. However,&#xD;
           results are quite difficult to interpret, because many different variables, dosimetric&#xD;
           parameters as well as other treatment or patient related characteristics, have been&#xD;
           identified, studies showed inconsistent or even conflicting results, and sample sizes&#xD;
           were often very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recently, Chen et al. published a neural network model for prediction of grade 2 or&#xD;
           higher pneumonitis, which yielded an AUC of 0.74 in the test dataset31. Compared to&#xD;
           other models, these results are promising, although external validation of the model is&#xD;
           warranted before it can be used in clinical practice. Our group developed a model&#xD;
           predicting dyspnea ≥ grade 2 according to CTCv3.0. Patient as well as dosimetric&#xD;
           parameters were incorporated in the model, which resulted in a cross-validated AUC of&#xD;
           0.62.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In summary, existing models perform rather well, but there is a lot of room for&#xD;
           improvement by adding new factors as well as applying advanced model building&#xD;
           techniques. Prediction models still have to be developed for a number of clinically&#xD;
           relevant outcomes. Finally, incorporating confidence intervals in the prediction as well&#xD;
           as quantifying the gain in prediction precision if a certain diagnostic/ prognostic test&#xD;
           is performed, would certainly be of great value for clinical use of the models&#xD;
           (http://www.predictcancer.org/).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Strategies to improve prediction models for lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to improve the prediction models for survival as well as toxicity outcome one can&#xD;
      include many variables as possible predictors including imaging, genomics and proteomics&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important feature for prognosis on the FDG-PET-scan is the maximal Standardized Uptake&#xD;
      Value (SUVmax). There is a statistically significant difference in 2-year survival between&#xD;
      patients with a high pretreatment SUV and a low pretreatment SUV. Patients with a low SUVmax&#xD;
      had a 2-year survival of 90.6%, while patients with a high SUVmax had a 2-year survival of&#xD;
      only 58.6%. There is a significant correlation between high SUVmax and a high HIF1α staining&#xD;
      in the biopsies, which is a marker for hypoxia. Non significant relations were shown for CA&#xD;
      IX, Ki67 and Glut-1 and SUVmax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides FDG, new PET-tracers are being developed. One of the new tracers is HX4, which is a&#xD;
      hypoxia tracer. Regulation of tissue oxygen homeostasis is critical for cell function,&#xD;
      proliferation and survival. Evidence for this continues to accumulate along with our&#xD;
      understanding of the complex oxygen-sensing pathways present within cells. The&#xD;
      microenvironment of tumors in particular is very oxygen heterogeneous, with hypoxic areas,&#xD;
      which may explain much of our difficulty in treating cancer effectively. This is true when&#xD;
      comparing levels of hypoxia among different patient tumors, but also within individual&#xD;
      tumors. Accumulating evidence implicates the biological responses to hypoxia and the&#xD;
      alterations in these pathways in cancer as important contributors to overall malignancy and&#xD;
      treatment efficacy. This has recently prompted several investigations into the possibility of&#xD;
      imaging and targeting treatment at the biological responses to hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Gene signatures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of gene signatures can help to improve the predictive value of the model. An example&#xD;
      of this, is the proliferation signature investigated by Starmans et al. Two different&#xD;
      signatures of 110 genes were compared in prognostic value. Both showed a very good prognostic&#xD;
      value on breast cancer data sets. The AUC (area under the curve) improved when the&#xD;
      proliferation signature were added to the models of clinical factors. Another gene profile&#xD;
      was tested on early stage NSCLC. This profile consists of 72 genes and is validated on stage&#xD;
      I and II NSCLC patients of five centers. It was possible to identify early-stage NSCLC&#xD;
      patients with high and low risk for disease recurrence and death within 3 years after primary&#xD;
      surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Tumor biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxia is (besides in serum) also measurable in the tissue itself. Several markers of&#xD;
      hypoxia are predictive for survival. An example is HIF1α, which is upregulated is case of&#xD;
      hypoxia. A higher staining of HIF1α is correlated with a worse prognosis in NSCLC. CA IX&#xD;
      correlated with severe and chronic hypoxia, and has a strong association with a poor outcome&#xD;
      in NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another marker is Ki67, which is expressed in proliferating cells. A higher Ki67 indicates&#xD;
      more proliferation, and in a systemic review of Martin et. al. a worse prognosis was shown&#xD;
      when Ki67 expression is increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Application of machine learning techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
      The availability of genomic data, together with improved imaging modalities, leads to&#xD;
      unprecedented amounts of biological and medical data, which can only be dealt with using&#xD;
      computational methods, not only for storing the data, but also for integrating, analyzing,&#xD;
      displaying and eventually understanding it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Machine learning offers a number of techniques for these purposes. These techniques can&#xD;
      overcome problems encountered with conventional statistical methods especially if data is&#xD;
      highly correlated, many variables are available but a limited number of patients&#xD;
      (high-dimensional data), or many different models have to be tested for their predictive&#xD;
      value. In the field of radiotherapy and especially for the prediction of treatment responses,&#xD;
      machine learning is an upcoming modality. Successes over traditional statistics have already&#xD;
      been published 43and first promising results for building predictive models concerning&#xD;
      survival of non-small-cell lung-cancer are already found in the literature.&#xD;
