  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer may be caused by a build-up of genetic defects, or damaged genes within the&#xD;
      body's cells. When genes are damaged, the body may be unable to produce a group of proteins,&#xD;
      called cytokines, used by the immune system to fight cancer and some infections. The&#xD;
      investigational gene transfer agent EGEN-001 contains the human gene for the cytokine&#xD;
      interleukin-12 (IL-12) in a special carrier system designed to enter the cells and help the&#xD;
      body to produce cytokines.Therefore Therefore, the purpose of the EGEN-001 therapy is to&#xD;
      attempt to enhance the body's natural ability to recognize and fight cancer cells.&#xD;

      This multi-center, Phase I/II study will be conducted with an open-label, non-randomized&#xD;
      design. The study will enroll up to 30 patients who had gone through cytoreductive surgery&#xD;
      and HIPEC treatment 6-8 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients will be treated with EGEN-001 24&#xD;
      mg/m2 intra-peritoneally (IP) once every week for 12 weeks and then once every two weeks&#xD;
      until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, but for no more than one year. Patients&#xD;
      who develop progressive metastases will receive standard chemotherapy concomitant with&#xD;
      EGEN-001. Hence, the initial EGEN-001 treatment period will be without chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy regimen will be FOLFOX or FOLFIRI administered every 2-3 weeks. Patient&#xD;
      with progressive disease a second time will be taken off-study. Those who remain&#xD;
      progression-free will receive EGEN-001 for up to one year.&#xD;
