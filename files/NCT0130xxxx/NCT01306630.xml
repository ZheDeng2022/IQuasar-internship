  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-finding study of tivozanib administered in&#xD;
      combination with capecitabine. During the dose-escalation portion, sequential cohorts of&#xD;
      subjects with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled in order to establish the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD). If the MTD is not reached, the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be&#xD;
      determined. In the expansion cohort, subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast or&#xD;
      colon cancer will be enrolled at MTD (or RP2D) to further evaluate safety and activity of&#xD;
      this combination in these tumor types.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study of orally administered&#xD;
      tivozanib in combination with capecitabine to approximately 24 subjects with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors and, in the expanded MTD cohort, subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast&#xD;
      or colorectal cancer. This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetic, and antineoplastic&#xD;
      activity. The number of cohorts evaluated and the maximum doses to be administered will&#xD;
      depend upon the observed tolerability. Dose level &quot;0&quot;, tivozanib HCl 1.5 mg and capecitabine&#xD;
      1000 mg/m² BID, is the starting dose level. Once assigned to a cohort, each subject will&#xD;
      continue to be treated at the same dose level and schedule throughout the course of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>Disease and response assessments will be determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST Version 1.0). Disease assessment is to include disease classification, tumor marker assessments, and diagnostic imaging / measurement of marker lesions.
