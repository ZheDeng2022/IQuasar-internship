  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, obesity rate has increased so much in the latest years, that we call it obesity&#xD;
      epidemic. Overweight could result of an unbalanced energetic balance for years. The person&#xD;
      who regularly consumes more calories than she expends will find herself with a positive&#xD;
      energetic balance, which results in a weight gain. A daily overconsumption of only 10&#xD;
      calories comes with a weight gain throughout one year. A way to avoid this overconsumption is&#xD;
      to eat food that increases satiety. Satiety can be defined as the time interval after food&#xD;
      ingestion, during which hunger and desire to eat are suppressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective of the study is to investigate in a pilot study the impact of a&#xD;
      drinkable yogurt enriched in proteins and fibres on satiety.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted according to an estimate crossover randomized double-blind and&#xD;
      include two treatments to drink that will be tested in each one month apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Experimental drinkable yogurt enriched in proteins and fibres&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Placebo drinkable yogurt (isocaloric and isovolumetric)&#xD;
&#xD;
      One the eve of the two tests, participants will consume the same meal at dinner time. During&#xD;
      the test days, participants should arrive between 6:30 and 8:30 and will be isolated in a&#xD;
      private room suitable for this type of testing. Any reference to time of the day will be&#xD;
      eliminated until the end of tests. First, participants will consume a standardized breakfast&#xD;
      which corresponds to about 10 to 15% of energy needs of the day. The food provided at&#xD;
      breakfast (toast, butter, peanut butter, cheese, orange juice) will be the same in both&#xD;
      tests. Participants must consume all food within a period of 15 minutes. Two hours after the&#xD;
      start of the test, participants will receive a snack in the form of yogurt (experimental,&#xD;
      placebo) they will consume within a period of 5 minutes. Two hours later, participants will&#xD;
      receive a lunch buffet consists of food ready to eat. The foods present in the buffet will&#xD;
      have an overall energy value of about 1500 kcal, which exceeds the energy needs of&#xD;
      participants for this meal. They will be encouraged to consume foods until satiety over a&#xD;
      maximum of 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satiety will be measured by visual analogue scale throughout the test, either immediately&#xD;
      before breakfast and snack as well as predetermined times thereafter until the lunch.&#xD;
      Participants will have access to water throughout the test. The weight of food consumed and&#xD;
      the water intake will be calculated in the absence of the participants and will be used to&#xD;
      calculate the energy intake at lunch.&#xD;
