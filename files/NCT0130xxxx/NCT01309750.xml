  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile is a bacteria that can infect the colon and cause severe diarrhea in&#xD;
      patients after recent antibiotic use. The current standard of care treatment for severe C.&#xD;
      diff. consists of oral vancomycin and/or intravenous metronidazole. When treatment is&#xD;
      unsuccessful, it can lead to need for removal of the entire colon or even death. In fact,&#xD;
      mortality rates in the literature range from 11-37% for C. diff. The most commonly quoted&#xD;
      mortality rate is 14% for severe infection. It is believed that the failure of treatment may&#xD;
      stem from an adynamic ileus (paralysis of the small bowel). This ileus may prevent the oral&#xD;
      vancomycin from reaching the colon and therefore it does not treat the problem. Vancomycin&#xD;
      functions by direct contact with the colon. It is presumed that this paralysis of the small&#xD;
      intestine is present but has never been proven. The objective of the study is to prove that&#xD;
      there is an adynamic ileus present in c. diff colitis and therefore lead to investigations&#xD;
      into improved treatment.&#xD;

      Patients in the intensive care unit are eligible to participate in the study A pregnancy test&#xD;
      will be checked if applicable. Patients that are enrolled and consented in the study will be&#xD;
      given 300ml of water containing 5 millicurie (mCi) of technetium-99m (Tc-99m)&#xD;
      diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA). This nuclear tracer/water mix will either be drank&#xD;
      orally or placed down a nasogastric tube to begin the study. The patient will have to have&#xD;
      nothing else to eat or drink for the duration of the study. The patients will have a nuclear&#xD;
      scan performed at 2, 4, and 6 hours after ingestion of the nuclear tracer. The images at 2&#xD;
      and 6 hours will be taken in the nuclear medicine department while the 4 hour image will be&#xD;
      taken in the ICU. The 2 and 6 hour studies must be conducted in the nuclear medicine&#xD;
      department to allow for special equipment to be used. This equipment is necessary to allow&#xD;
      for computer calculation to be made. The 4 hour scan is to check for progress of the tracer&#xD;
      and does not require calculations/measurements. Therefore, a mobile scanner can be utilized.&#xD;
      The image will be taken for 60 seconds. The images obtained will then be interpreted by the&#xD;
      nuclear medicine department to determine the transit time of the tracer from the stomach to&#xD;
      the terminal ileum and cecum. The data obtained from the subjects will be compare to&#xD;
      previously obtained data for normal subjects. A normal study has been defined as 40% of the&#xD;
      tracer reaching the terminal ileum by 6 hours. Any time longer than 6 hours is deemed an&#xD;
      abnormal study with delayed small bowel transit time.&#xD;
