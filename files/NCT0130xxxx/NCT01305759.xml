      The project runs as a Ph.d. project at the Faculty of Health Sciences- University of&#xD;
      Copenhagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark the investigators operate around 16.000 artificial hips and knees yearly, mainly&#xD;
      due to osteoarthritis. The numbers has increased with 13,9% for hips and 50,7% for knees in&#xD;
      the period 2004 to 2007. In 10% of the cases, or approximately 1.600 patients, the patient is&#xD;
      younger than 50 years - mid-life, working, socially active and sexually active. The&#xD;
      investigators have a tendency within in the orthopedic society to mainly focus on the&#xD;
      technological aspects of the procedure and tend to forget that this is a key event for the&#xD;
      patient with widespread consequences for the patient and his future life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip- and knee arthroplasties is without no doubt two of the most important and successfully&#xD;
      surgical procedures ever introduced. The economical cost for osteoarthritis treatment has&#xD;
      exploded in the developed world over the last decade, with a yearly growth on 8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the limited lifetime for an artificial hip or knee, this treatment can be&#xD;
      unfortunate for the young patient. This has over the last years led to an increased interest&#xD;
      for joint preserving surgery. Over the last twenty years it has been tried to delay the time&#xD;
      for total hip arthroplasties for patients with hip dysplasia with the aid of Ganz osteotomy.&#xD;
      Since this technique was introduced back in 1988, the research on the topic has had its main&#xD;
      focus on optimizing the operation technique. So as with surgery with artificial hip or knee&#xD;
      the investigators have a lack of knowledge regarding the social, work related, psychological&#xD;
      and sexual aspects of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The consequences of an artificial hip or knee joint regarding patients' social-life,&#xD;
      work, psychological and sexual aspects gain very little attention international. The&#xD;
      investigators apply most of our research funds exclusively to research and development of the&#xD;
      surgical track and procedure, new prosthesis designs or coatings. The investigators find this&#xD;
      study highly relevant because this kind of studies has been preformed for several chronic&#xD;
      diseases but not osteoarthritis and its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study the investigators wish to examine the social, work related, psychological and&#xD;
      sexual aspects of end stage osteoarthritis. This will lead the way for improved information&#xD;
      to the patient and improve the surgeons' possibilities for chosen the correct time for&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark approximately 16.000 artificial hips or knees are inserted yearly. A increasing&#xD;
      number that probably will continue to increase due to demographic factors and the populations&#xD;
      rising demands on a active life in the old age. However of the 16.000 artificial joints&#xD;
      approximately 10% are inserted in patients under fifty years(1;2). This group of patients is&#xD;
      mid-life and thereby for most parts working and socially- and sexually active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total hip arthroplasty(THA) or total knee arthroplasty(TKA) is unquestionably one of the most&#xD;
      successfully operations there has been introduced, and is capable of relieving pain,&#xD;
      optimizing the function of the joint and optimizing the quality of life(3;4). In the resent&#xD;
      years the main focus has been on optimizing the surgical track, whereby most of the patient&#xD;
      today are only admitted to the hospital in 1-2 days. This progress has had a tremendous&#xD;
      impact on patients, the departments and the health care system. Joint replacement surgery&#xD;
      with THA or TKA is a key event for the patient and can recreate the patient's mobility but as&#xD;
      well has widespread (but still undocumented) consequences for the patient and his future&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preoperative treatment and planning of the correct time of surgery, it is imported to&#xD;
      know, how the patient is affected of a disabling joint disease like end-stage&#xD;
      osteoarthritis(OA) and which consequences it has to the patient to have an artificial joint.&#xD;
      It is known, that patients with OA has a two-fold increased risk of depression(8-13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These aspects of the treatment has so far not had the desirable attention, neither national&#xD;
      or international At Hvidovre Hospital, Frederiksberg Hospital and Køge Hospital the&#xD;
      Orthopaedic departments has many years of experience with joint replacement surgery at&#xD;
      specialist level. The structures of the departments are based on modern fast-track&#xD;
      principals, with clearly defined goals for preoperative information, pre- and postoperative&#xD;
      regimes and discharged criteria. Thereby insuring a smooth course, short rekonvalens and a&#xD;
      minimizing of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the limited lifetime for an artificial hip or knee, this treatment can be&#xD;
      unfortunate for the young patient. This has over the last years led to an increased interest&#xD;
      for joint preserving surgery. Over the last twenty years it has been tried to delay the time&#xD;
      for total hip arthroplasties for patients with hip dysplasia with the aid of Peri Acetabular&#xD;
      Osteotomy(PAO). Hip dysplasia is seen equally in both sexes. However it is more often&#xD;
      symptomatic in females(14). In Denmark PAO is performed at Copenhagen University Hospital,&#xD;
      Odense University Hospital and Aarhus University Hospital. The procedure is preformed on&#xD;
      symptomatic (mainly sharp groin pain) patients in hope of delaying the development of OA.&#xD;
      Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is believed to be the pathology, where repeated trauma to&#xD;
      the acetabular labrum and adjacent chondral structures can result in labral tears and&#xD;
      chondral delamination, leading to groin pain and over time OA. However there are only a few&#xD;
      minor studies concerning which impact this procedure has on the young patients life in term&#xD;
      of psychological, sexually and social wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included are both men and women from twenty to sixty years old who are admitted to&#xD;
      undergo primary uni- or bilateral THA or TKA at Hvidovre Hospital, Frederiksberg Hospital or&#xD;
      Køge Hospital as a result of end-stage OA, rheumatoid arthritis or another joint disease&#xD;
      diagnosed by one of the departments doctors with specialty in joint replacement surgery. The&#xD;
      included patients in the PAO study has all had PAO at Aarhus University Hospital between&#xD;
      1999-2002 and were at the age of fifteen or more at the time of surgery. To avoid&#xD;
      co-morbidity confounders the joint disease has to be the only main disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the Health-Related-Quality-Of-Life(HRQoL) consequences of end-stage hip or knee&#xD;
           OA? The investigators will examine this with SF-36, a standardized and validated&#xD;
           questionnaire that explores HRQOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the relation between the pre- and postoperative joint function and the patients&#xD;
           HRQoL, and do this relation reflects the patient's social class and attachment to the&#xD;
           workforce.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Which preoperative parameters have the strongest relation on the postoperative out-come?&#xD;
           The highly nuanced picture the investigators get of the patients pre- and postoperative&#xD;
           condition will enable us to answer this question.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How is the patient's relation to the workforce-affected by the patient's joint disease&#xD;
           and operation? Are the investigators able to operate the patient back in work? Do the&#xD;
           patient lose he's job because of the operation? Do the patient's with a job preoperative&#xD;
           keep their job will those without a job preoperative do not recover their working&#xD;
           ability because of the operation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. It is known that patients with OA has a two fold increased risk of depression. Is the&#xD;
           depression due to the patients underlying disease? Or is the depression due to&#xD;
           modulations in pain perception which lead to a lower pain threshold that again leads to&#xD;
           the increased prevalence of symptomatic OA? If the THA or TKA is curative for the&#xD;
           patient's depression, the investigators may assume that the depression is due to the&#xD;
           patients disabling disease and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. It is known that patients with hip OA experience sexual-problems. How is this affected&#xD;
           by joint replacement surgery? A Danish study has shown that older men -average age 70&#xD;
           years- who receives a THA has a highly increased risk of postoperative impotence -26%&#xD;
           compared to the expected 3% for an age matched group. Other studies have shown that&#xD;
           females experience an improvement of there sexual-life after THA. Unfortunately, there&#xD;
           are only quite few and small studies concerning these subjects. The investigators wish&#xD;
           to explore these subjects and the similar subjects for TKA, this has not previously been&#xD;
           explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Over the last three decades there has been an increasing focus on joint preserving&#xD;
           surgery, mainly in the form of PAO. This procedure is preformed on public hospitals in&#xD;
           Aarhus University Hospital, Odense University Hospital and Copenhagen University&#xD;
           Hospital. Aarhus University Hospital holds the leading experience in Denmark and&#xD;
           performs approximately 75 procedures a year. However there is now documentation on how&#xD;
           this procedure affects the patients HRQoL or sexual-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main part of this study runs as a prospective questionnaire based study of the patients,&#xD;
      which are having a THA or TKA at Hvidovre University Hospital, Frederiksberg University&#xD;
      Hospital and Køge Hospital. A smaller part of the study is a retrospective questionnaire&#xD;
      based study of the patients, which in the period 1999-2002 underwent PAO at Aarhus University&#xD;
      Prior to planned surgery with THA or TKA the patient receive a questionnaire. This will be&#xD;
      followed by a questionnaire 3, 6 and 12 months postoperative. Twelve months postoperative the&#xD;
      patient will have and ambulatory control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who underwent PAO at Aarhus University Hospital in the period 1999-2002 are&#xD;
      posted a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusions of patients started April 2010 and runs at least to the summer of 2011 or when&#xD;
      at least 250 patients are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results are expected to be published in international English language journals and the&#xD;
      research and findings will be defended as a PhD ad the Faculty of Health Sciences- University&#xD;
      of Copenhagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposes of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate how end-stage OA and joint replacement surgery affects the patients HRQoL and&#xD;
      herby which impact this procedure has on the young patients life in term of psychological,&#xD;
      sexually and social wellbeing. Next the investigators wish to investigate how the patients'&#xD;
      attachment to the workforce is affected bye end-stage OA and joint replacement surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate how patients with other disabling joint diseases with need for joint&#xD;
      replacement surgery is affected as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Edification of a database to reveal complications over years for this well-defined young&#xD;
      patient population, who has a higher demand to there prosthesis and as a consequence put them&#xD;
      to a higher stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate which impact PAO has on the young patients life in term of HRQoL,&#xD;
      psychological, sexually and social wellbeing.&#xD;
