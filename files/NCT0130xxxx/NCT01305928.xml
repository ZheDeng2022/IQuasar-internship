  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-discharge support is a key component of effective treatment for hospitalized smokers,&#xD;
      but very few hospitals provide it. Linking hospitalized smokers with free, proactive tobacco&#xD;
      quitlines is an ideal way to provide supportive contact at discharge, because quitlines are&#xD;
      effective and cost effective for smoking cessation. Many hospitals are beginning to fax-refer&#xD;
      smokers to quitlines at discharge. Fax referral is convenient and is part of the current&#xD;
      culture of medical communication channels. However, less than half of fax-referred smokers&#xD;
      are successfully contacted and enrolled in quitline services. &quot;Warm hand-off&quot; is a novel&#xD;
      approach to care transitions in which health care providers directly link patients that have&#xD;
      substance abuse and mental health problems with specialists, using face-to-face or phone&#xD;
      transfer. Warm hand-off achieves very high rates of treatment enrollment for these highly&#xD;
      vulnerable groups.&#xD;

      The objective if this application is to determine the relative effectiveness, and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, of warm hand-off versus fax referral for linking hospitalized smokers&#xD;
      with tobacco quitlines. This study employs a two-arm, individually randomized design. It is&#xD;
      set in two large Kansas hospitals that have dedicated tobacco treatment interventionists on&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who are discharged to another facility (for long term care or rehabilitation)&#xD;
             will be included in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria include lacking access to a telephone post-discharge,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  acute life-threatening medical conditions (for example, cardiac arrest, acute&#xD;
             respiratory failure, septic shock),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  communication barriers (intubation, unable to speak or hear),&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  terminal illness with less than a 12 month life expectancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  non-Kansans because residents of other states may receive quitline services from a&#xD;
             different vendor which would confound intervention effects and make it difficult to&#xD;
             obtain quitline adherence data&#xD;
