  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib&#xD;
      (Velcade) in combination with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide for adult&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma. The secondary objectives are&#xD;
      to assess the tolerability and safety, the response rate, rate of autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplant and CD34+ progenitor cell collection and engraftment after treatment with this&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;

      Once subjects are determined to be eligible and informed consent is obtained,patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled into a starting dose cohort of 1.0mg/m2. Based upon a satisfactory safety profile,&#xD;
      additional patients will be enrolled into the 1.3, 1.5 and 1.7mg/m2 cohorts. Each of these&#xD;
      dosing cohorts will only be enrolled if satisfactory safety profiles in each of the lower&#xD;
      dosing cohorts are obtained. As the process continues, multiple cohorts will be receiving&#xD;
      various dosing regimens simultaneously. If a DLT occurs in ≥2 out of 6 patients at the&#xD;
      initial dose level, then 3 more patients will be accrued at dose level -1 (0.7mg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bortezomib will be given on days 1 (prior to rituximab) and 4, rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1,&#xD;
      carboplatin AUC 5 and ifosfamide with mesna, each 5 gm/m2, on day 3 and etoposide 100 mg/&#xD;
      m2/day on days 2, 3 and 4 of a 21-day cycle. They will also receive filgrastim on days 6-13&#xD;
      or pegfilgrastim on day 6. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) include any grade 3 or 4&#xD;
      non-hematologic toxicities (except alopecia and grade 3 febrile neutropenia), grade 4 febrile&#xD;
      neutropenia (life-threatening sepsis) and grade 4 neutropenia persisting past day 35 or grade&#xD;
      3 or 4 thrombocytopenia persisting past day 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is a DLT at a given bortezomib dose level, 3 more subjects will be enrolled at that&#xD;
      dose; if there are 2 or more DLTs then the MTD will be defined as the previous dose level. If&#xD;
      at that dose level, &gt;50% of subjects required bortezomib dose reduction, the MTD will be&#xD;
      defined as the next lower dose level. Subjects will continue to be accrued in order to treat&#xD;
      a minimum of 10 patients at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who are candidates for autologous stem cell transplant will have CT scan of the neck,&#xD;
      chest, abdomen and pelvis after 2 cycles. Subjects with PD or SD will be taken off study.&#xD;
      Those with CR, PR or response not meeting PR criteria will undergo a total of 3 cycles of&#xD;
      bortezomib + RICE. After the 3rd cycle of bortezomib + RICE, whole body PET/CT scan and bone&#xD;
      marrow biopsy will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who achieve CR or PR will then proceed to stem cell mobilization and collection by a&#xD;
      standard regimen, followed by autologous stem cell transplant with a preparative regimen to&#xD;
      be determined by the investigator. Those with SD or PD will be taken off study. While the&#xD;
      mobilization and ASCT procedures are not part of the phase I protocol, outcomes of ASCT will&#xD;
      be followed, including CD34+ progenitor cell collection, clinical response to transplant and&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are not candidates for autologous stem cell transplant will have CT scan of the&#xD;
      neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis after the 2nd and 4th cycles. Those who are responding will&#xD;
      continue for a maximum of 6 cycles.&#xD;
