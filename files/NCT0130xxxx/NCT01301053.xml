    <textblock>
      The investigators believe that there remains a gap in implementing insulin infusions in&#xD;
      critically ill patients to maximize the benefit and minimize adverse events like episodes of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. Based on the published experience with Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM), the&#xD;
      investigators believe that it is safe to use in critically ill patients. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators believe that in combination with a protocol with low risk for hypoglycemia at&#xD;
      baseline, that CGM can eliminate this risk fully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study the safety and feasibility of the continuous glucose monitor use in 20 critically&#xD;
           ill patients for 7 days (the current maximum recommendation for sensor use). Safety data&#xD;
           will include the rate of significant bleeding (hematoma) or infection (cellulitis) from&#xD;
           sensor use. Feasibility data will evaluate the amount of missing glucose data over the&#xD;
           7-day sensor life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomize patients treated with the current UVA intensive care insulin protocol for&#xD;
           insulin management to the addition of &quot;brakes&quot; that reduce insulin administration based&#xD;
           on continuous glucose monitoring data between hourly reference glucose data to prevent&#xD;
           episodes of hypoglycemia (blood glucose &lt;70 mg/dl) and severe hypoglycemia (blood&#xD;
           glucose &lt;50 mg/dl). This will serve as pilot data to power a larger study in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principle focus of this project is to collect pilot data for a larger study that will&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is safe in critically ill&#xD;
      patients and provides important information that can prevent hypoglycemia. This study will&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of CGM along with the current UVA intensive care insulin protocol&#xD;
      in critically ill hyperglycemic patients as well as to provide some information that may help&#xD;
      estimate differences necessary to power future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following statements summarize the background for this protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hyperglycemia is prevalent in critical illness, even without prior diabetes, and is&#xD;
           associated with increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The physiology between critical illness and hyperglycemia may be secondary to&#xD;
           inappropriate tissue oxygenation or intense inflammatory mediator release leading to&#xD;
           elevated counter-regulatory hormones that stimulate endogenous glucose production and&#xD;
           promote insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Early research by Van den Berghe suggested that controlling hyperglycemia by insulin&#xD;
           infusion improved outcomes; however, this has been contested in part by the&#xD;
           Normoglycemia in Intensive Care Evaluation-Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation&#xD;
           (NICE-SUGAR) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The results of the NICE-SUGAR study may reflect differences in control glucose range or&#xD;
           in the high incidence of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hypoglycemia has been shown to be associated with increased mortality in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Glucose variability is associated with ICU mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Continuous glucose monitoring has been shown to be safe for up to 7 days in critically&#xD;
           ill patients and may prevent episodes of hypoglycemia&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Admitted to an intensive care unit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient will require an insulin infusion or is currently prescribed an insulin&#xD;
             infusion during the ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Below 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cancer, active diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moribund, Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)/Do Not Intubate (DNI), or death is predicted within&#xD;
             24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state will be&#xD;
             excluded as they are managed on a different insulin protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with type 1 diabetes will be excluded as they have unique insulin needs that&#xD;
             might confound a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plan for or anticipated need for any MRI during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of acetaminophen within 24 hours prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of a medication on the UVa formulary containing maltose, galactose, or xylose that&#xD;
             could affect a glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinoline quinine (GDH-PQQ) glucose test&#xD;
             strip (hepatitis B immune globulin (HepaGamB®), tositumomab [Bexxar®], abatacept&#xD;
             [Orencia®], Octagam 5%, and RH immune globulin [WinRho®])&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of an appropriate abdominal site for insertion of the Dexcom sensor (e.g.&#xD;
             extensive scarring, lack of adequate subcutaneous tissue, local infection, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Restrictions on use of other drugs or treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  According to the Dexcom SEVEN® PLUS and G4 Platinum users manuals, the Dexcom System&#xD;
             must be removed prior to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Therefore, if the subject&#xD;
             requires an MRI, the sensor will be removed from the patient and the reason for&#xD;
             removal will be noted. This will not be an Adverse Event, but will conclude the&#xD;
             patient's participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the subject requires the use of acetaminophen-containing medications as part of&#xD;
             their clinical care while using the system sensor the subject will be out of the study&#xD;
             because this drug may affect the performance of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the subject requires use of a medication on the UVa formulary containing maltose,&#xD;
             galactose, or xylose that could affect a glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinoline&#xD;
             quinine (GDH-PQQ) glucose test strip (hepatitis B immune globulin [HepaGamB®],&#xD;
             tositumomab [Bexxar®], abatacept [Orencia®], Octagam 5%, and RH immune globulin&#xD;
             [WinRho®]) the subject will be out of the study because this drug may affect the&#xD;
             performance of the unit glucometer used for reference values and calibration of the&#xD;
             continuous glucose monitor. Study participation would be stopped at that time.&#xD;
