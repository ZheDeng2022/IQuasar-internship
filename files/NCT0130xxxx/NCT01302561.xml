  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a functional fiber,&#xD;
      galactooligosaccharide, can help maintain immune strength and digestive health in free-living&#xD;
      older adults. It is hypothesized that older adults consuming the fiber daily for 24 weeks&#xD;
      over cold and flu season will have more healthy days due to a proliferation of beneficial&#xD;
      bacteria within the colon which alters cytokine production and enhances natural killer cell&#xD;
      function. Immune and gastrointestinal health will be evaluated via daily questionnaires&#xD;
      obtained from 80 participants and from the collection of blood and fecal samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled trial will be used.&#xD;
      Healthy older adults will be recruited from the Gainesville area via direct mailing, flyers,&#xD;
      list servs, presentations to clubs/organizations/church groups, social networks, etc.&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained and once the informed consent is signed the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion form will be reviewed to determine whether a subject qualifies for the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization, height, weight, age, and a stool sample will be obtained. On the day&#xD;
      of randomization, blood will be drawn and saliva will be collected for baseline immune&#xD;
      function studies from all subjects who qualify based on the final criteria (i.e., cannot have&#xD;
      a cold on the day of randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be stratified based on body mass index and age and randomized via sealed&#xD;
      envelope to the treatment (5 g GOS) or placebo groups (n=40/group). The fiber will be&#xD;
      provided in small packets containing 2.5 g of fiber and 2.5 g sucrose (treatment) or 5 g of&#xD;
      sucrose (placebo). Subjects will be instructed to add the contents of the packet to coffee,&#xD;
      tea, water, milk, or other non-carbonated drink, hot cereal or pudding and mix well. Subjects&#xD;
      will be told to consume two packets per day and maintain a daily study log. The daily&#xD;
      questionnaire will ask about intake of the fiber, cold symptoms, and general health (i.e.,&#xD;
      new medications, doctor visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between weeks two and three of the intervention, a second stool sample will be obtained.&#xD;
      After three weeks of the intervention, subjects will receive the influenza vaccination and&#xD;
      blood and saliva will be collected for immune function studies. Two weeks postvaccination&#xD;
      (i.e., 5 weeks of intervention), blood and saliva will be collected for immune function&#xD;
      studies. Subjects will continue the intervention and maintain daily logs for a total of 24&#xD;
      weeks. Subjects will also be asked to complete a questionnaire on a monthly basis regarding&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms and typical level of exercise.&#xD;
