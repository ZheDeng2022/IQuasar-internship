    <textblock>
      This is a placebo controlled randomised clinical trial.Patients attending Yorkshire Early&#xD;
      Arthritis Clinics and diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis with symptom duration of 3-12&#xD;
      months will be recruited. They will be randomised to blinded therapy with either methotrexate&#xD;
      and intravenous corticosteroid at baseline, or methotrexate and intravenous infliximab&#xD;
      according to the standard treatment regime. Patients will be followed regularly, and at each&#xD;
      visit, if the patients are not in remission, they will be given an intramuscular injection of&#xD;
      corticosteroid. After 26 weeks, all patients will be unblinded and those with an inadequate&#xD;
      treatment response will be treated according to a dose escalation algorithm until they&#xD;
      achieve remission. Those in remission will continue on blinded therapy and if 6 months of&#xD;
      remission is achieved the intravenous agent (infliximab or placebo) will be withdrawn.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of biologic therapy (infliximab) as&#xD;
      induction therapy against current best practice therapy: early introduction of methotrexate&#xD;
      in combination with steroid induction therapy and dose modification according to predefined&#xD;
      disease activity measures (as informed by the literature, and based around a pragmatic dose&#xD;
      escalation protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses of imaging findings will be undertaken on a subgroup of patients at&#xD;
      sites able to perform such assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging techniques used include&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. DEXA&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. US&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Peripheral MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      End point&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end points of the study are defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of 78 weeks of therapy in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal due to any reason including toxicity or inefficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal due to completion of the dose escalation regime and disease remains active&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal due to meeting NICE criteria for biologics during the dose escalation regime&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, patients will continue to be followed in the Yorkshire Rheumatology&#xD;
      clinics as part of their routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who withdraw will be asked to have a withdrawal visit with X-Rays of hands and&#xD;
      feet to allow assessment of the primary endpoint.&#xD;
