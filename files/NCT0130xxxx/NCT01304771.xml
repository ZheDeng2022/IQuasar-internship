  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are viable commensal microorganisms that promote the establishment of beneficial&#xD;
      microflora. Animal and human studies demonstrate that probiotics can enhance body's immune&#xD;
      response to stimuli. Mayo Clinic in conjunction with Agri-King Corporation has developed a&#xD;
      novel synbiotic called AKSB (Agri-King Synbiotic) that contains a probiotic bacterium&#xD;
      (Enterococcus faecium, microencapsulated SF68 or Ventrux ME 30), a probiotic yeast&#xD;
      (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lynside® Pro-Lay 1), and a prebiotic (fructo-oligosaccharide&#xD;
      [FOS], NutraFlora®). This phase I placebo-controlled trial of AKSB in normal human&#xD;
      volunteers, over 65 years of age, is designed to study the safety of this probiotic when&#xD;
      patients are also receiving an influenza vaccine. If this study shows that AKSB is safe then&#xD;
      our aim is to do a larger study to see if we can improve influenza vaccine immune response&#xD;
      while taking the probiotic compared to placebo.&#xD;
