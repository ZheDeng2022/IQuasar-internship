      The purpose of the study includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a treatment manual and pilot test this treatment intervention which is&#xD;
           designed to prevent and reduce psychological distress in parents who have infants&#xD;
           hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To conduct a treatment intervention study in which parents of NICU infants will receive&#xD;
           a 6-12 session treatment designed to reduce psychological distress, and to compare&#xD;
           outcomes with parents who do not receive the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to learn whether or not a simple psychotherapeutic and psychoeducational intervention&#xD;
      offered to parents of NICU infants can prevent or minimize the development of symptoms of&#xD;
      psychological distress in parents, including symptoms of anxiety and depression and&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&#xD;

      There are three phases to this research study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. DEVELOPMENT OF A TREATMENT MANUAL TO HELP REDUCE PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IN PARENTS OF&#xD;
           NICU INFANTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We currently have pilot data on a three session intervention designed to reduce&#xD;
           psychological distress in NICU parents. In this phase of hte study, we plan to augment&#xD;
           this intervention by adding an additional three sessions for a total of six sessions&#xD;
           which will comprise our new treatment manual. To accomplish this, we will conduct a&#xD;
           comprehensive review of the content of all current empirically based cognitive behavior&#xD;
           therapy (CBT) treatments for PTSD, abstract the key elements, compare the key elements&#xD;
           with our current treatment for PTSD and construct a fourth session using a combination&#xD;
           of Stress Inoculation Training techniques (including relaxation training, thought&#xD;
           stopping, cognitive restructuring) and imaginal re-exposure. A similar process will be&#xD;
           used to identify parent-child interventions currently available used with premature or&#xD;
           other vulnerable young children. The redefinition of the infant and reeducation of the&#xD;
           mother to promote sensitivity toward and attachment with the infant are likely topics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PILOT THE MANUALIZED TREATMENT IN AN OPEN TRIAL WITH 10 NICU MOTHERS, SOLICIT FEEDBACK&#xD;
           AND MODIFY INTERVENTION SESSIONS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To obtain clinically relevant feedback and prepare for any unforeseen logistical issues,&#xD;
           we will pilot the six session treatment intervention in 10 mothers whose newborns are&#xD;
           hospitalized in the LPCH NICU. The recruited parents will be representative of the&#xD;
           population of mothers that the intervention is intended for-English and Spanish speaking&#xD;
           mothers of infants &gt;= 28 weeks, over 1000 grams, born at LPCH or transferred within 72&#xD;
           hours with CRIB scores, a measure of medical severity, of 15 or less. Children&#xD;
           transferred for cardiac surgery and those with congenital abnormalities will not be&#xD;
           eligible. Mothers will be approached by a member of the NICU staff within 72 hours of&#xD;
           the infant's admission to the NICU. The mother will be given an information sheet about&#xD;
           the project and invited to speak with the study coordinator. Potential subjects who give&#xD;
           informed consent will complete the three screening instruments, the Stanford Acute&#xD;
           Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SASRQ), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression&#xD;
           Inventory-I (BDI I) and the sociodemographic questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Within 48 hours, one of the study psychologists, will contact enrolled mothers,&#xD;
           establish a schedule for the 6 sessions and initiate the course of treatment. The&#xD;
           sessions will be individual and held at a time and location convenient for the mother.&#xD;
           We expect that most sessions will be in the LPCH NICU in private offices suitable for&#xD;
           therapy sessions. Should the infant be discharged from the NICU prior to the 6th&#xD;
           session, the remaining sessions will be scheduled at home, LPCH or the Department of&#xD;
           Psychiatry. Following the 6th session, the mothers will be contacted by the study&#xD;
           coordinator who will administer the instruments chosen for the post intervention&#xD;
           assessment and assess satisfaction with the treatment sessions. Specific questions will&#xD;
           include: What did you like/dislike about the treatment?; Which sessions were most/least&#xD;
           helpful?; Could the treatment be structured differently?; Was the timing/length of the&#xD;
           sessions appropriate?; Were the techniques taught useful?; How satisfied were you with&#xD;
           this intervention? All evaluation materials including changes in pre/post scores on our&#xD;
           instruments will be summarized and presented to our Scientific Advisory Group. Once&#xD;
           consensus is reached on the revised manual, the manual will be rewritten to incorporate&#xD;
           feedback and data obtained in the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CONDUCT A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF THE TREATMENT INTERVENTION COMPARED TO AN INFORMATION,&#xD;
           USUAL CARE, SUPPORT CONTROL CONDITION.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible mothers (N=100) will be randomly assigned to receive either: (1) the manual driven,&#xD;
      CBT-based trauma focused plus mother redefinition/education intervention; or (2) information,&#xD;
      usual care/support. The intervention is expected to last 3 weeks with two 45-55 minute&#xD;
      sessions weekly. Participants in both conditions will be assessed at baseline, within one&#xD;
      week after the completion of the intervention or at 4-5 weeks for the control group and at&#xD;
      6-months post-baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information/usual-care/support condition was chosen to control for possible symptom&#xD;
      changes due to routine clinical contacts common in the NICU, the effect of time, the effect&#xD;
      of attention and any effects due to repeated assessments. Parents in the information/usual&#xD;
      care/support group will receive one 45 minute information session on the policy, procedures&#xD;
      and environment of the NICU by a Neonatal Nurse Practitioner (Table 4). We have chosen to use&#xD;
      a Nurse Practitioner for the information comparison because this is a role they often assume&#xD;
      at LPCH. This session is based on an LPCH Hospital Information Packet that is routinely&#xD;
      distributed to all NICU parents, although generally without any instruction or face-to-face&#xD;
      review of its content. Women in this group will be followed up by telephone or in the NICU&#xD;
      one week after the information session to answer any questions that they may have. In&#xD;
      addition, mothers will be referred to the existing parent mentor program for support and&#xD;
      coping strategies. By adding the parent mentor support we expect that the contact will be&#xD;
      similar to the intervention group and, thus, will approximate an attention-matched comparison&#xD;
      condition. Mothers in this group will also receive the care that is typical for NICU parents&#xD;
      including contacts with nurses, physicians, social workers, chaplaincy and developmental&#xD;
      psychologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty of the participants in the intervention arm will be randomized to receive an expanded&#xD;
      intervention of 6 additional sessions (sessions 7-12). These sessions will elaborate on the&#xD;
      themes identified in Session 4 and follow the current models of PTSD treatment that generally&#xD;
      provide a minimum of 12 sessions. These sessions will likely use cognitive restructuring to&#xD;
      address distortions about the NICU experience. Specific issues explored will be&#xD;
      individualized to each parent but may include parental guilt, parental anxiety about their&#xD;
      infant's medical health, and difficulties related to the perceived absence of a parental&#xD;
      role. There will also be a strong emphasis on the use of stress inoculation training to&#xD;
      assist parents in developing strategies to manage trauma symptoms. The 30 participants in the&#xD;
      intervention arm who are not randomized to the expanded intervention will be offered contact&#xD;
      with the existing parent mentor program. Parent mentors offer support, coping strategies and&#xD;
      suggestions on how to normalize life after the NICU hospitalization. Should an infant die,&#xD;
      the mother will be disenrolled from the study and assisted with a referral for conventional&#xD;
      mental health support services.&#xD;
