    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder affecting up to 20% of the general&#xD;
      population. Despite the prevalence of the disorder, it remains poorly understood. This is&#xD;
      reflected in a symptom based diagnostic scheme, the lack of a suitable biological marker and&#xD;
      inadequate treatment options. Current knowledge suggests the disorder is as a result of a&#xD;
      dysregulated brain-gut axis, a complex construct describing the bidirectional communication&#xD;
      systems underpinning normal gastrointestinal functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize here that the disruption of this brain-gut axis is facilitated&#xD;
      by an increased degradation of tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway. This metabolic&#xD;
      abnormality has the potential to impact on both GI and CNS signaling through its effects on&#xD;
      serotonergic signaling and the impact of metabolites like kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid&#xD;
      on cognitive processes respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous data from our laboratory indicated increased tryptophan degradation in IBS patients&#xD;
      and suggested the metabolites produced as putative biological markers of the condition. In&#xD;
      this study the investigators aim to reconcile cognitive impairment in IBS with GI and CNS&#xD;
      symptom severity and kynurenine pathway metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will establish these baseline measures in IBS compared to control subjects.&#xD;
      A battery of cognitive assessments will be carried out using a computerized testing system.&#xD;
      Standardized rating scales will be used to assess GI and CNS symptom severity. GC-MS/MS, a&#xD;
      recently acquired technology platform in our laboratory, will be used to quantify plasma&#xD;
      quinolinic acid levels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is based on the hypothesis that the disruption of this brain-gut axis in irritable&#xD;
      bowel syndrome (IBS) is a consequence of increased degradation of tryptophan along the&#xD;
      kynurenine pathway. The investigators aim to fully characterize this putative metabolic&#xD;
      abnormality and determine its impact on both gastrointestinal (GI) and central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) signaling by examining the relationship between individual pathway metabolites, GI&#xD;
      symptoms and cognitive processing in IBS patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increased degradation of tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway has been reported in both&#xD;
      depression and IBS (Clarke et al 2009a; Fitzgerald et al 2008; Myint et al 2007). Although&#xD;
      such studies have suggested an alteration in the production of quinolinic acid as a&#xD;
      consequence of this disruption, actual levels of this NMDA receptor agonist remain to be&#xD;
      measured and are essential to the full characterization of pathway disruption. The relevance&#xD;
      of this strategy is confirmed by studies that have implicated peripheral quinolinic acid&#xD;
      measures as surrogate marker of disease activity in juvenile idiopathic inflammatory&#xD;
      myopathies (Rider et al 2002). Moreover it has been demonstrated that increasing plasma&#xD;
      levels of this neurotoxic metabolite can influence CNS processes (Yan et al 2005) and that an&#xD;
      increased peripheral production of kynurenine can increase central quinolinic acid&#xD;
      concentrations (Raison et al 2009a). A correlation between alterations in the kynurenine&#xD;
      pathway, GI disturbances and cognitive outcomes remains to be fully defined. In this study,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to obtain a complete profile of plasma kynurenine pathway&#xD;
      metabolites in IBS patients with and without comorbid depression. Temporal instability in&#xD;
      symptom profile is a hallmark of IBS and represents a considerable obstacle to biomarker&#xD;
      discovery (Clarke et al 2009b). The preliminary data generated here will potentially be used&#xD;
      as the basis for future grant applications that will propose a longitudinal study of these&#xD;
      putative biomarker candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND/SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder accounting for up to&#xD;
      20% of cases presenting at gastroenterologist clinics in the western world with an&#xD;
      unexplained female predominance (Ersryd et al 2007). Although the typical symptoms are&#xD;
      commonly experienced in the general population, the abdominal pain and disturbances in&#xD;
      defecatory function experienced by IBS sufferers are on a scale that positions the disorder&#xD;
      as one of the leading causes of work absenteeism and presenteeism in western societies.&#xD;
      Clearly the burden it places on the individual sufferer and society as a whole is substantial&#xD;
      and is further compounded by its draining of healthcare resources (Clarke et al 2009b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the widespread prevalence of the disorder is it still poorly understood and is&#xD;
      largely characterized by the lack of a reliable validated biological marker. This is&#xD;
      reflected in the reliance on symptom based diagnostic criteria in conjunction with the&#xD;
      exclusion of other gastrointestinal disorders (Drossman 2006). Further complications arise in&#xD;
      the form of the psychiatric comorbidity so frequently observed among the IBS population&#xD;
      (Spiller 2004). It is perhaps unsurprising then that treatment options are inadequate and&#xD;
      advances in our understanding of the disorder are urgently required to address the unmet&#xD;
      medical needs of its sufferers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and its role as a precursor to many biologically active&#xD;
      agents ensures its importance in the consideration of a variety of disease states including&#xD;
      schizophrenia (Barry et al 2009; Schwarcz and Pellicciari 2002), depression (Myint et al&#xD;
      2007) and inflammatory bowel disease (Forrest et al 2003). Although much of the attention to&#xD;
      date has focused on the production of serotonin from tryptophan, the often-overlooked&#xD;
      kynurenine metabolic pathway (Appendix figure 1) consumes over 95% of the available&#xD;
      peripheral tryptophan in mammals (Clarke et al 2009a). The first step in this cascade&#xD;
      involves the conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine with reports suggesting that the majority&#xD;
      of CNS concentrations of the metabolite are drawn from the periphery (Myint et al 2007). This&#xD;
      is an important consideration and validates the use of plasma tryptophan metabolites in&#xD;
      biomarker studies. This first rate limiting step in the metabolic cascade is catalysed by&#xD;
      either the ubiquitous indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) or the largely hepatic based&#xD;
      tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). Crucially in the context of stress related disorders like&#xD;
      IBS and depression, the activity of both enzymes can be induced by agents which are stress&#xD;
      responsive-IDO by inflammatory mediators and TDO by corticosteroids (Ruddick et al 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once formed, kynurenine essentially participates in two important but alternate metabolic&#xD;
      scenarios-one leading to the formation of the neuroprotective kynurenic acid and the other&#xD;
      leading to the production of the neurotoxic quinolinic acid (Ruddick et al 2006). The&#xD;
      neuroprotective effects of kynurenic acid are attributed to its competitive blockade of the&#xD;
      NMDA receptor at the glycine co-agonist site. Conversely quinolinic acid has excititoxic&#xD;
      properties due to its potent activation of the NR2A and NR2B NMDA receptor subunits (Schwarcz&#xD;
      and Pellicciari 2002). Clearly any imbalance in the production of these bioactive ligands&#xD;
      could lead to profound disturbances in CNS glutamatergic signaling and thus affect&#xD;
      glutamate-driven behaviours such as learning and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent progress in the study of IBS has largely been brought about by a theoretical view of&#xD;
      the condition as a disorder of the brain-gut axis (Ohman and Simren 2007). Within this&#xD;
      construct, stressful insults are now thought to be integral to the destabilization of normal&#xD;
      brain-gut axis signaling. Higher brain centres are involved both in the processing of&#xD;
      afferent GI signals and the communication of changes in an individuals emotional state to the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract (Mayer 2000a; Mayer 2000b). The emotional motor system, consisting of&#xD;
      the limbic system and paralimbic structures such as the medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala&#xD;
      and hypothalamus, is one such centre. The importance of these structures in the maintenance&#xD;
      of normal cognitive function implies that brain-gut axis perturbations could manifest as&#xD;
      cognitive impairment across a number of domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other lines of evidence also support an altered neuropsychological state in IBS. An emerging&#xD;
      body of research points to the presence of a low grade inflammation in this disorder (Barbara&#xD;
      and Stanghellini 2009; Clarke et al 2009b). It has recently been reported that baseline&#xD;
      interleukin-6 levels, the cytokine that is most consistently reported to be elevated in IBS&#xD;
      (Clarke et al 2009b), is predictive of cognitive symptoms of depression at follow up in a&#xD;
      longitudinal study (Gimeno et al 2009). It has also been demonstrated that patients with&#xD;
      chronic fatigue syndrome, a disorder that has also been linked with increased inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators (Raison et al 2009b), have associated cognitive deficits (Thomas and Smith 2009).&#xD;
      Previous studies from our laboratory have highlighted the relationship between the&#xD;
      inflammatory profile in IBS and an increased degradation of tryptophan along the kynurenine&#xD;
      pathway (Clarke et al 2009a; Fitzgerald et al 2008). Moreover, cancer patients treated by&#xD;
      cytokine immunotherapy experience related and persistent cognitive alterations (Capuron et al&#xD;
      2001) and the cognitive alterations accompanying infection are also present in apyretic sick&#xD;
      subjects (Capuron et al 1999). The increased tryptophan degradation observed following this&#xD;
      immunotherapy is considered to be a key mediator of the resulting neuropsychological&#xD;
      alterations (Capuron et al 2002; Raison et al 2009a). Cumulatively, these studies suggest&#xD;
      that IBS is a disorder possessing a molecular signature (increased, inflammation and&#xD;
      disturbed tryptophan metabolism) indicative of cognitive deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite the uncovering of this molecular signature in IBS, the widespread acceptance&#xD;
      of the brain-gut axis model and the high psychiatric comorbidity, a comprehensive cognitive&#xD;
      profiling of the IBS patient population has not been performed. The cognitive assessments&#xD;
      that have been reported support a cognitive phenotype in the disorder but to date have&#xD;
      focused on singular aspects of affective memory performance (Kilkens et al 2005; Kilkens et&#xD;
      al 2004) or verbal IQ deficits (Dancey et al 2009). Moreover, there has been, to our&#xD;
      knowledge no study correlating cognitive function with mechanistically-oriented biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the benefits of such a correlation can be accrued however, a more complete assessment&#xD;
      of cognitive dysfunction in IBS is urgently required. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test&#xD;
      Automated Battery (CANTAB) is a computerized cognitive assessment program that covers within&#xD;
      its remit a broad section of cognitive domains (Fray and Robbins 1996). The battery has been&#xD;
      validated in the assessment of cognitive dysfunction across a wide range of disease states&#xD;
      including psychiatric disorders such as anxiety (Kaplan et al 2006) and both unipolar and&#xD;
      bipolar mood disorders (Elliott et al 1996; Sweeney et al 2000). Insights gained from&#xD;
      neuroimaging studies in IBS which highlight the higher brain centres functioning abnormally&#xD;
      in the syndrome (Mayer et al., 2008) can be used to inform the initial choice of tests to be&#xD;
      applied to IBS subjects. Investigations in other disorders that are reported to have an&#xD;
      inflammatory component such as chronic fatigue disorder where assessments of free recall,&#xD;
      reaction time and vigilance in conjunction with the Stroop colour-word interference task to&#xD;
      measure distraction from irrelevant stimuli have yielded interesting results (Thomas and&#xD;
      Smith 2009). The specific executive function assessments which can be applied include the&#xD;
      Stocking of Cambridge Task (SOC) which assesses a subject's ability to rearrange a set of&#xD;
      balls in a specified minimum number of moves and minimum time and the&#xD;
      intradimensional/extradimensional (ID/ED) attentional set shifting task (adapted from the&#xD;
      Wisconcin Card Sorting Test (WCST)) used to assess a subjects ability to maintain attention.&#xD;
      CANTAB visual memory tasks such as the spatial recognition memory task (SRM) and the paired&#xD;
      associates learning task (PAL) can be used to assess deficits in memory (Michopoulos et al&#xD;
      2008). Taken together, these tests are sensitive to dysfunction across a number of different&#xD;
      brain regions (Sweeney et al 2000). Recently the cognitive assessments available in the&#xD;
      CANTAB battery have been used in conjunction with measures of clinical insight to assess the&#xD;
      association between poor insight and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia (Donohoe et al&#xD;
      2009). This may also be relevant to IBS where an increased awareness of and concern about&#xD;
      bodily sensations and GI functioning is well established (Posserud et al 2009). It will also&#xD;
      be important to rule out alternative explanations for any alterations that are observed&#xD;
      included task irrelevant thoughts related to the disease. Few attempts have been made to link&#xD;
      such findings to GI symptoms and putative biological marker candidates.&#xD;
