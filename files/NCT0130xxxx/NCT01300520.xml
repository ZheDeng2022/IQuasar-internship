    <textblock>
      The current method of incision localization in many surgical procedures requires a doctor to&#xD;
      reference a medical image, such as an X-ray, to judge where on the body an incision should be&#xD;
      made. However, the precise information of the scan is not shown on the patient's skin.&#xD;
      Surgeons commonly use palpation to locate the point of incision. They may feel for the area&#xD;
      directly or find landmarks under the skin and estimate the location from there. The following&#xD;
      factors further complicate palpation: overweight patients, foreign bodies that are difficult&#xD;
      to feel for under the skin, fractures with little displacement, or locations under dense&#xD;
      muscles. These difficulties are compounded for new surgeons, since palpation is a skill&#xD;
      derived through experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many circumstances the surgeon only needs to know where to insert the tool or place the&#xD;
      incision - they do not necessarily need to know the depth of the area of interest. If&#xD;
      palpation proves ineffective, they may be forced to use fluoroscopy. By referencing the&#xD;
      fluoroscopy image the surgeon moves a radiopaque marker, such as their surgical tool, closer&#xD;
      to the area of interest. Fluoroscopy is time-consuming, and exposes medical personnel and the&#xD;
      patient to radiation. Many fluoroscopic images may be required in a single procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By identifying the efficacy of this new medical device, &quot;Target Tape&quot;, there is the potential&#xD;
      outcome of making smaller incisions, faster localization, a reduction in fluoroscopy use and&#xD;
      a reduced chance in surgical error and the associated costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Tape is a non invasive device that is in a grid or ruler format that is placed against&#xD;
      the subject's skin. The grid/ruler pattern will then appear on the medical imaging scan.&#xD;
      Standard surgical skin ink is then used to place these markings in a defined pattern on the&#xD;
      skin. This pattern mimics the Target Tape grid or ruler pattern. The medical practitioner can&#xD;
      correlate these skin markings to the medical scan image to make their incisions in more&#xD;
      accurate locations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consent must first be obtained from the prospective patient before Target Tape can be&#xD;
      incorporated into the procedure. When a target procedure is scheduled to occur, the surgeon&#xD;
      will first determine if Target Tape would be appropriate to use. The procedure will need to&#xD;
      be able to integrate Target Tape into it using the Method of Use described above. The&#xD;
      decision to then pursue the procedure will be under the discretion of the medical&#xD;
      practitioner and consent from the patient. Depending on the procedure, the medical&#xD;
      practitioner may need to communicate to the OR or the radiology department to integrate&#xD;
      Target Tape into their protocol, since the practitioner making the incisions(s) may not&#xD;
      always be the one applying it. Examples of procedures that may utilize Target Tape may be&#xD;
      stabilization of fractures, interlocking screw insertions during tibia or femur nailings,&#xD;
      breast biopsies, foreign body removals, thoracic and spinal surgeries. Once the procedure is&#xD;
      determined to be appropriate to accommodate Target Tape, the medical practitioner will&#xD;
      approach the prospective patient and explain how the device will be utilized, the benefits&#xD;
      and potential risks associated with it, and answer any questions the patient may have. A&#xD;
      representative from Aeos Biomedical may be on hand to aid with this process and may also&#xD;
      observe said procedure to record the necessary information. The consent form will then be&#xD;
      signed and Target Tape will then be utilized during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology of creating an outcome measure will occur over 2 stages with multiple steps&#xD;
      in each stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I: Proof of Concept&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Specify measurement goals&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proof of Concept Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Item generation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Item reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Verification 5. Verification Testing 6. Reliability 7. Validity 8. Interpretability&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Subjects (ii) Involved Groups (iii) Data Collection (iv) Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      6) Statistical Analysis Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Orthopaedic surgeons, up to 10 patients, per procedure type&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Spinal surgeons up to 10 patients, per procedure type&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Plastic surgeons up to 10 patients, per procedure type&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Thoracic surgeons up to 5 patients, per procedure type&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Radiologists up to 10 patients, per procedure type&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of medical practitioners in each type of procedure may fluctuate. Furthermore,&#xD;
      this is not a definitive list of specialties. It is foreseeable that a greater variety of&#xD;
      procedures from other specialties may be included in the proof of concept testing. Moreover,&#xD;
      the number of patients may vary depending on the relative magnitude of the observations and&#xD;
      feedback from the medical practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample sizes for each segment of this stage corresponds to sample sizes used to create&#xD;
      outcome measures in the different populations. After Stage 1 has been completed, the sample&#xD;
      sizes for Stage 2 will be assessed and a statistical model will be created at that time. A&#xD;
      preliminary estimate would require 5 times the sample size per procedure within Stage 1 to be&#xD;
      a sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variable generation - There is no statistical analysis at this step. It is anticipated that&#xD;
      up to 10 procedures would have used the device with at least two different doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variable reduction - The list of items generated in the step above will be administered to&#xD;
      doctors who will be asked to rate the items according to importance. Any items that are&#xD;
      deemed insignificant will be removed from the list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verification Testing It is anticipated that 5 times the sample size for each procedure will&#xD;
      occur in this step. Subject to the testing results of Stage 1, there will be a set of&#xD;
      significant performance variables determined for each respective target procedure. Target&#xD;
      Tape would then be randomly utilized in the procedures, with controls for who is performing&#xD;
      the procedure and patient characteristics. Observation of the significant performance&#xD;
      variable occurs for all the procedures&#xD;
