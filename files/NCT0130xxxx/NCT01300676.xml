  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite evidence supporting the benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), only 15% of&#xD;
      postmenopausal women currently use HRT (1). The leading reasons why women refuse or&#xD;
      discontinue HRT are fear of malignancy, side effects such as vaginal bleeding, weight gain,&#xD;
      depressed mood, and breast tenderness, and social reasons such as regarding menopause as a&#xD;
      natural transition, not as a disease that requires treatment. Millions of women expressed&#xD;
      their concern on the safety of hormone replacement therapy since the data from the Women's&#xD;
      Health Initiative (WHI) study was released, which reported an increased risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, stroke and thromboembolic disease with conjugated&#xD;
      equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate compared with placebo (2). The study has&#xD;
      also demonstrated that quality of life (3) and cognition (4) were no better in the HRT group&#xD;
      than the placebo group. In view of these problems, women are increasingly turning to&#xD;
      alternative therapies in an effort to manage their menopausal symptoms (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menopause is associated with decreasing sex steroid levels. The effect of menopause on&#xD;
      circulating androgen levels has been studied by several investigators with variable findings.&#xD;
      The levels of testosterone and androstenedione appear to show a small but significant&#xD;
      decrease just before or within the first 2 years after menopause, with a decrease in&#xD;
      testosterone amounting to approximately 15% (5,6). Unlike the abrupt decrease in estradiol&#xD;
      levels associated with menopause, circulating testosterone, DHEA, and DHEAS levels decrease&#xD;
      more gradually, beginning in the years before menopause and continuing thereafter (6,7). As a&#xD;
      consequence, some women may experience symptoms of androgen decrease in the period before&#xD;
      cessation of menses. By giving Tualang Honey to these postmenopausal women, it is postulated&#xD;
      that the symptoms of androgen deficiency or menopausal symptoms should be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have also reported that tualang honey given to ovariectomised rats, an&#xD;
      animal model for postmenopausal states for two weeks significantly increased the free&#xD;
      testosterone and progesterone plasma levels, but no significant effect was seen in the&#xD;
      beta-estradiol level. There were significant increased in the thickness of vaginal epithelium&#xD;
      and vaginal epithelial-muscular layers. Proliferation of the squamous epithelium with&#xD;
      vacuolation of some of the squamous cells were noted in the honey treated animals implying&#xD;
      that there were increased in mucopolysacharide content. Uterine weight, endometrial and&#xD;
      circular muscle thickness were significantly increased in honey treated animal with cystic&#xD;
      changes noted over the glands (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no clinical studies looking at the effects of Tualang Honey on&#xD;
      perimenopausal women. In view of the initial evidence that it is a phytoestrogen from animal&#xD;
      studies and has androgenic properties as well, it should have a beneficial effect to these&#xD;
      women in terms of improvement in their menopausal symptoms, changes in their endogenous&#xD;
      hormonal profile and increase in bone mineral density.&#xD;

           Description of Methodology Study Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a randomized, prospective, clinical study to evaluate the effects of honey in&#xD;
           comparison with hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Subjects will be confined to&#xD;
           postmenopausal women. The study period will be four months, 41 subjects will be&#xD;
           recruited for each group. A total of 82 patients will be recruited in this study.&#xD;
           Eligible subjects consenting to participate will be randomly assigned to one of the two&#xD;
           groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
           GROUP 1: Subjects receiving 20 g/day of Tualang Honey GROUP 2: Subjects receiving&#xD;
           hormonal replacement therapy (Femoston)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
           About 10 ml of fasting blood samples will be collected for hormonal profiles at baseline&#xD;
           and at the end of the study. The hormones to be assayed will be serum follicle&#xD;
           stimulating hormone (FSH), Luteinising Hormone (LH), estradiol and total testosterone.&#xD;
           Blood will also be taken for safety profile (haematology, liver function test and liver&#xD;
           function test) and for cardiovascular parameters such fasting lipids and fasting blood&#xD;
           sugar. Bone density will be check using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) at&#xD;
           baseline and end of the study. Subjects will be thoroughly examined by Medical&#xD;
           Specialists who are part of the Clinical Trial Team at every 2-monthly visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           The calculated sample size for the study is based on a standard statistical approach,&#xD;
           often called as power calculations, which is widely used to calculate sample size in&#xD;
           clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The formula is as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
           N = p1 x (100 - p1) + p2 x (100-p2) x f (α, β)&#xD;
&#xD;
           (p1 - p2) 2&#xD;
&#xD;
           In our pre-clinical trial (ovariectomised rat), about 40% increase in mean testosterone&#xD;
           level was observed among the low dose group. Assuming a similar increase of ~10% is also&#xD;
           obtained in the placebo group, and at a power of 80%, the calculated number of subjects&#xD;
           per group would be 29. Taken into consideration that there will be about 40% drop-out&#xD;
           rate, each treatment group would therefore be 41 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Actual calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Set p1 = 40; p2 = 10; α β = 7.9&#xD;
&#xD;
           N = 40 (100-40) + 10 (100-10) x 7.9 = (40 x 60 + 10 x 90) x 7.9 (40-10)2 900&#xD;
&#xD;
           = 29&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  40% dropout = 29+ 12 =41 subjects per treatment arm There will be 2 groups, 41&#xD;
                subjects X 2 groups = Total of 82 patients need to be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY PROCEDURE Pre study screening&#xD;
&#xD;
           Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
           Healthy females, who have been considered for entry into the study, will be informed&#xD;
           about the study and asked if they would like to participate. Subjects agreeing to&#xD;
           participate must provide informed consent prior to any study specific assessments or&#xD;
           procedures being informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be fully explained to the subject by the investigator. The investigator&#xD;
           will provide the subject with a comprehensive explanation of the proposed treatment&#xD;
           including , but not limited to, the nature of the therapy, alternative therapies, any&#xD;
           known previously experienced adverse reactions, the investigational status of the tested&#xD;
           extract and also the study aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of&#xD;
           the study, including any discomfort they may experience as a result of study&#xD;
           participation. A summary of this information will also be provided to the subject in&#xD;
           writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subject must have the opportunity to clarify with the Investigator any issues they&#xD;
           did not understand and if necessary, ask further questions. The subject must be given&#xD;
           adequate time to consider whether they wish to participate in the study. The subject&#xD;
           must be informed that they are to withdraw consent at any time, without penalty or loss&#xD;
           of benefits to which the patient is otherwise entitled.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator will obtain the subject's informed consent. The person, who obtains the&#xD;
           informed consent, signed and dated the informed consent form. If this person is not the&#xD;
           investigator, then the investigator must also sign and personally date the written&#xD;
           informed consent form. A copy of the patient information sheet and the signed consent&#xD;
           form must be provided to each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following assessments were performed for all subjects during the screening process&#xD;
           and recorded in the Clinical Record Form&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subject initials&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demographic details including weight and height&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical examination and investigations including pelvic ultrasonography and DEXA&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Brief medical history relating to past and current illnesses&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Concomitant medication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collect fasting blood sample for the following laboratory evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient randomisation/blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subject will be randomized using Block Randomization. The assignment of Tualang Honey&#xD;
           will be blinded to patients using ID numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient's withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator may cease study treatment and withdrew the subject or the subject may&#xD;
           withdraw herself from participation in the study at any time. The reason for the&#xD;
           withdrawal of a patient will be recorded in the CRF. Subject will be followed-up for a&#xD;
           minimum of 30 days following the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Possible reasons for patient withdrawal include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The need to take medication, which may interfere with study measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient experiences an intolerable / unacceptable adverse event&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient exhibits non-compliance with the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient unwilling to proceed and / or consent is withdrawn&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigator withdraws patient for reasons unrelated to the study drug (e.g.&#xD;
                undercurrent illness)&#xD;
&#xD;
           SAFETY ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
           Protocol specific clinical assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening day and end of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Demographic details will be recorded at screening. The subject's body weight, blood&#xD;
           pressure will be measured at 2 monthly periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medical history and adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the screening visit, a physical examination will be conducted to determine the&#xD;
           patient's current medical conditions and past clinically significant events. This&#xD;
           includes all events that have occurred within the last three months and any other&#xD;
           earlier event related to the inclusion and exclusion criteria or the subject's disease.&#xD;
           This will be recorded at the screening visit. Throughout the study period, subject will&#xD;
           be directly questioned about the occurrence of any new signs and symptoms and any&#xD;
           changes from baseline will be recorded as an adverse event. Diary will be given to the&#xD;
           patient to chart the proper timing and date for ingestion of honey.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A physical examination will be repeated at the end of the treatment and exit evaluation&#xD;
           to assist in determining if there had been any changes to the patient's health during&#xD;
           the study period. Physical examination details will not be recorded in the CRF, unless&#xD;
           there are changes from the baseline that warrant recording as a new adverse event or&#xD;
           change to an existing adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
           All visits&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vital signs (supine blood pressure, pulse rate) will be recorded at every visit. Patient&#xD;
           is supine or semi-recumbent for five minutes prior to evaluating vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Concomitant medication&#xD;
&#xD;
           Concomitant medication included all co-administered drugs and treatment such as&#xD;
           analgesics, tonics, herbals or traditional medicines and vitamin and/or mineral&#xD;
           supplements. All concomitant medication taken within 7 days prior to commencement of&#xD;
           study drug administration and for the duration of the study will be recorded in the CRF,&#xD;
           including indication, dose, frequency, date and route administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SAFETY REPORTING&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse event definition&#xD;
&#xD;
           An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence (including&#xD;
           clinically significant laboratory findings) in a patient or clinical investigation&#xD;
           subject administered a pharmaceutical drug, and which did not necessarily have a causal&#xD;
           relationship to the treatment. Adverse event may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The significant worsening of the disease or symptoms of the disease under&#xD;
                investigation following administration of the drug&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any undercurrent illness with an onset after administration of the drug&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exacerbation (i.e. increase in frequency or intensity) of a pre-existing condition&#xD;
                or event&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serious adverse event definition&#xD;
&#xD;
           A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any&#xD;
           dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Results in death&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Is life-threatening. A ' life-threatening' adverse event refers to an event, which&#xD;
                puts the patient at risk of death. It does not refer to an event, which&#xD;
                hypothetically might cause death if it is more severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.&#xD;
                Hospitalization is defined as the patient being hospitalized overnight, or the&#xD;
                patient's hospital stay being prolonged for at least an additional overnight stay.&#xD;
                Hospital admissions for elective surgery, for social reasons or for normal disease&#xD;
                management procedures that are not the result of the worsening of an underlying&#xD;
                condition will not be considered a serious adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Is a malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Is the result of an overdose? An important medical event, which jeopardizes the&#xD;
                patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the&#xD;
                above outcomes from occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data will be entered, cleaned and analyzed using SPSS version 12. Means and standard&#xD;
           deviations for numerical variables and frequency and proportion for categorical&#xD;
           variables will be reported along with histogram or bar chart if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For univariable analysis the independent t-test and one way ANOVA will be used to&#xD;
           compare numerical outcome variables among the three treatment groups and chi square for&#xD;
           categorical outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For mutivariable analysis, repeated measure ANOVA will be used for analysis to adjust&#xD;
           for confounding variables. Level of significance is set at 5% and results will be&#xD;
           presented with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
