    <textblock>
      This study is to confirm the safety and technical of MRI guided High Intensity Focused&#xD;
      Ultrasound (HIFU) for Palliation for Pain of Skeletal Metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI guided high intensity focused ultrasound uses ultrasound to heat and thermally ablate&#xD;
      tissue. The MRI system identifies the ultrasound path and monitors heat rise in the tissue.&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to show treatment safety and effectiveness. MR-guided HIFU will be&#xD;
      performed in patients who pass inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone metastases are common among patients with advanced cancer and have been reported in up&#xD;
      to 85% of cancer patients at autopsy. Complications of bone metastases include pain,&#xD;
      functional limitation, decreased quality of life, pathological fracture, spinal cord&#xD;
      compression and cauda equina syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External beam radiotherapy is the current standard treatment for patients with painful&#xD;
      uncomplicated bone metastases. Unfortunately up to 30 % of patients treated with radiotherapy&#xD;
      do not respond to therapy, and 30% of responders have their pain recur at some point after&#xD;
      treatment. Radiotherapy re-treatment is also limited by cumulative doses delivered to&#xD;
      sensitive structures. Ablative techniques such as cryotherapy and percutaneous radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation are not similarly limited by cumulative effects, however, they are invasive&#xD;
      procedures that place patients at risk of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) is a non-invasive, outpatient modality&#xD;
      being investigated for the treatment of cancer. In MR-HIFU, a specially designed transducer&#xD;
      is used to focus a beam of ultrasound energy into a small volume at a specific target site in&#xD;
      the body. The focused beam produces therapeutic hyperthermia in the target field but only&#xD;
      harmlessly warms the immediately surrounding tissue. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is used&#xD;
      both to focus the ultrasound beam on the target field in the bone (the metastatic lesion and&#xD;
      adjacent periosteum containing the nerves and vasculature for the tumor) and to perform&#xD;
      real-time thermal mapping at and around the target. The mechanism of action of pain response&#xD;
      is thought to be thermal periosteal denervation and / or thermal ablation of the tumor mass&#xD;
      that diminishes pressure on the surrounding tissue.&#xD;
