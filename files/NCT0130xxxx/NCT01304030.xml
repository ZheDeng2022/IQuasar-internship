    <textblock>
      Our research hypothesis is that residents who participate in the empathy and relational&#xD;
      skills training modules will significantly improve in these skills as compared to a control&#xD;
      group of residents who receive residency training as usual that includes the current standard&#xD;
      training in the doctor-patient relationship. To evaluate this hypothesis, we will use a&#xD;
      two-pronged approach to assessment. The first prong is the residents' self assessment of&#xD;
      empathy and the second is from the patients' perspective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a randomized controlled trial assigning resident physicians (N=100) to&#xD;
      either: (a) empathy and relational skills training; or (b) control group receiving standard&#xD;
      residency training as usual. Over the course of six weeks, each resident physician in the&#xD;
      experimental group will receive three 60-minute training sessions focused on empathy and&#xD;
      relational skills (the residents assigned to the control condition will receive standard&#xD;
      residency training as usual). The emerging neuroscience of emotions and empathy has provided&#xD;
      the neurobiological and physiological bases for our Empathy Training Modules to enhance&#xD;
      patient-doctor communication. These innovative modules provide the basic science and video&#xD;
      modeling for empathy training. Based on cutting edge mirror neuron research, our training&#xD;
      modules offer a novel approach to empathy and relational skills training that teaches&#xD;
      physicians about the neurobiology and physiology of emotions in difficult or stressful&#xD;
      patient interactions. We have developed professionally produced high definition training&#xD;
      modules that portray difficult patient-physician interactions. Importantly, these videos also&#xD;
      include physiological displays of emotion for both members of the dyad so that one can easily&#xD;
      observe the degree to which patient and physician are physiologically concordant or&#xD;
      discordant with one another. The empathy training is conducted at a deeper level of&#xD;
      physiological awareness and regulation that promises to be more effective than traditional&#xD;
      didactic teaching by integrating the technology of psychophysiology. The goal of raising&#xD;
      awareness of physiologic indices during a patient-doctor interaction is to present an&#xD;
      objective measure of emotional response to both explicit and implicit stimuli, which promises&#xD;
      to be a powerful teaching tool to enhance empathic physician behaviors.&#xD;
