  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate identification of and subsequent delayed therapy for patients with hypoperfusion&#xD;
      (including hypovolemia, congestive heart failure and sepsis) is a common problem faced by&#xD;
      physicians and intensivists caring for critically ill patients. Bedside clinical assessment&#xD;
      is notoriously inaccurate in diagnosing complex etiologies of hemodynamic disturbances and in&#xD;
      deciding on the appropriate therapy. Invasive techniques which are often required to guide&#xD;
      diagnosis and therapy have significant risks associated with them, are costly, and are time&#xD;
      consuming. New technology has been developed that allows for instantaneous, noninvasive&#xD;
      monitoring of key hemodynamic parameters, like stroke volume, peak velocity and cardiac&#xD;
      output. This new technology has the potential to improve recognition of the etiology of&#xD;
      hemodynamic disturbances and assist the clinician in optimizing therapy based on changes in&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters. There is significant potential for this to be translated into&#xD;
      improved outcomes in critically ill patients, but this has never been studied.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with life-threatening hypotension are commonly cared for in intensive care units&#xD;
      (ICUs). Pathophysiologic perturbations due to disease states such as sepsis, hypovolemia, and&#xD;
      congestive heart failure may lead to tissue hypoxia, a critical development which precedes&#xD;
      multi-organ failure and death. Not only is it difficult to rapidly identify patients heading&#xD;
      down this path, but the execution of effective hemodynamic resuscitation to slow or reverse&#xD;
      this process is challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cornerstone of hemodynamic resuscitation is volume administration. The goal of volume&#xD;
      administration is to maximize cardiac output, and thereby systemic oxygen delivery, by&#xD;
      optimizing cardiac preload. Bedside clinical assessment is inadequate for judging whether or&#xD;
      not this goal has been achieved. Invasive techniques, such as central venous pressure (CVP)&#xD;
      monitoring and pulmonary artery catheterization, carry risks, are costly and time-consuming,&#xD;
      and may yield misleading data. Doppler ultrasound-based technology has been developed that&#xD;
      allows for instantaneous, non-invasive monitoring of key hemodynamic parameters, such as&#xD;
      cardiac output. This technology may facilitate determining the etiology of hemodynamic&#xD;
      disturbances and assist the clinician in optimizing therapy based on changes in hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters. This randomized, controlled trial was designed to determine the impact of a&#xD;
      volume resuscitation protocol, guided by non-invasive Doppler ultrasound technology, on&#xD;
      outcomes in medical ICU patients with vasopressor-dependent hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants were recruited between January 19, 2010 and December 26, 2010 from two&#xD;
      medical ICUs at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, a 1252-bed urban teaching hospital. The Washington&#xD;
      University School of Medicine Human Research Protection Office approved the study, and&#xD;
      informed consent was obtained from participants or their authorized representatives.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years; administration of vasopressors, defined as a&#xD;
      continuous infusion of norepinephrine at a dose &gt;5 mcg/min, dopamine ≥5 mcg/kg/min or any&#xD;
      dose of another vasopressor; and passage of &lt;18 hours since initiation of vasopressors at&#xD;
      doses specified above. Exclusion criteria were hemorrhagic shock, need for immediate surgery,&#xD;
      imminent risk of death in the next 48 hours (as judged by the attending ICU physician), level&#xD;
      of care decision that precluded implementation of the study protocol, enrollment in any other&#xD;
      clinical study, and pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were assigned to treatment groups using blocked randomization to receive either&#xD;
      volume resuscitation guided by the ultrasound cardiac output monitor (USCOM; USCOM Ltd.,&#xD;
      Sydney, Australia) or observation. The USCOM is a non-invasive device that uses&#xD;
      continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound measurements of blood flow in the ascending aorta or&#xD;
      pulmonary artery to estimate stroke volume (SV). Prior to the beginning of the study, one of&#xD;
      the study investigators (LMD) underwent a supervised training period with the USCOM in 50&#xD;
      patients to insure reproducibility of the obtained measurements. Subjects randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention group underwent a baseline USCOM measurement of SV by a single operator (LMD),&#xD;
      followed by a pressurized infusion of 1 L of normal saline (NS) over approximately 15&#xD;
      minutes, after which the SV measurement was repeated. If the SV increased by ≥15%, the&#xD;
      patient was deemed volume-responsive, and another 1 L NS bolus was administered. This process&#xD;
      was repeated until the SV did not increase by ≥15%, two hours had elapsed since study&#xD;
      enrollment, or 4 L of NS had been infused, whichever occurred first. With the exception of&#xD;
      initial fluid management in the intervention group, as described above, use of all diagnostic&#xD;
      and treatment modalities were at the discretion of the ICU physicians. Subjects in the&#xD;
      control group underwent no intervention; ongoing care was carried out at the discretion of&#xD;
      the ICU physicians. ICU physicians were unaware of subjects' group assignments and the USCOM&#xD;
      data acquired in the intervention group.&#xD;
