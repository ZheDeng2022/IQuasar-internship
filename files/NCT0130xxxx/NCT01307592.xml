      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, oxaliplatin, and ,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer cell&#xD;
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others&#xD;
      find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Lenalidomide&#xD;
      may stop the growth of non-Hodgkin lymphoma by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Giving&#xD;
      rituximab and chemotherapy together with lenalidomide may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving rituximab, gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin together with lenalidomide works in treating patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of conversion to complete response (CR) after switching to&#xD;
           lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
           whose maximum response to gemcitabine hydrochloride, rituximab, and oxaliplatin is a&#xD;
           partial response (PR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the overall survival of these patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the progression-free survival of patients with CR and PR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the treatment-related toxicity of this regimen combination in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin: Patients with B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
           receive rituximab IV on day 1; all patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30&#xD;
           minutes and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 or day 2*. Treatment repeats every 14&#xD;
           days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients with T-cell lymphoma proceed to chemotherapy on day 1 without receiving&#xD;
      rituximab; patients with B-cell lymphoma receive chemotherapy on day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are reevaluated after 4 courses of therapy. Patients who achieve a complete response&#xD;
      (CR) receive 2 more courses of therapy and then proceed to bone marrow transplantation (BMT);&#xD;
      those that do not receive a BMT receive maintenance lenalidomide for 2 years. Patients who&#xD;
      achieve a partial response (PR) and who are not candidate for autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (ACT) are treated with lenalidomide**. Once patients with PR achieve a CR or&#xD;
      &lt; CR with lenalidomide treatment, they proceed to maintenance lenalidomide for 2 years,&#xD;
      unless they become candidates for ACT***. Patients with stable disease or progressive disease&#xD;
      after 4 courses of therapy are treated with lenalidomide, unless they become eligible for&#xD;
      ACT***.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: **Patients in whom a delay of &gt; 4 months would occur for ACT are treated with&#xD;
      lenalidomide until 3 weeks prior to ACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: **Once eligible, patients proceed to ACT as soon as feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance lenalidomide: Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21.&#xD;
           Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically for toxicity analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
