      Pressure intermittent coronary sinus occlusion (PICSO) in patients with coronary artery&#xD;
      disease improves collateral flow index to higher than 30%. PICSO used in this patient&#xD;
      population is safe, feasible and effective. Safety, feasibility and effectiveness will be&#xD;
      tested by periprocedural and logistic data.&#xD;

      1 Background Good collateral flow in case of obstructive coronary artery disease and acute&#xD;
      myocardial has beneficial effects on morbidity and mortality. Pressure controlled&#xD;
      Intermittent Coronary Sinus Occlusion (PICSO) carries a promise of improving myocardial flow,&#xD;
      decreasing microvascular obstruction and decreasing the rate of peri-procedural and acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction without the increased risk of bleeding such as is encountered with&#xD;
      gp2b3a inhibitors. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of PICSO in&#xD;
      patients with stable coronary artery disease and experimental short coronary artery&#xD;
      occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Objective The purpose of the study is to determine whether PICSO is safe and feasible with&#xD;
      a femoral approach, and in what amount of cases PICSO is effective to increase collateral&#xD;
      flow index (CFI). In this study an adapted collateral flow pressure index (CFpI) will be used&#xD;
      and is calculated as the ratio of the distal LAD pressure during LAD balloon occlusion&#xD;
      (PLADoccl.) and the Aortic pressure (Pao). CFI&gt;30% has been shown in several studies to be a&#xD;
      significant predictor of inducible ischemia as measured by intracoronary ST-segment changes.&#xD;
      The study is a non-randomized single centre trial using a Bayesian statistical model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Specific This study is a study in 10 elective patients with coronary artery disease&#xD;
      assessing the safety and feasibility of adjunctive PICSO treatment during PCI using a femoral&#xD;
      vein approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Together with the preclinical experience using the Miracor technology, we therefore believe&#xD;
      that the planned cohort of 10 patients is sufficient to corroborate earlier experiences on&#xD;
      the safety of the procedure as well as present technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the effectiveness, 10 sets of measurements before and after the procedure in each patient&#xD;
      will provide insight into the clinical significance since each patient will serve as her or&#xD;
      his control.&#xD;
&#xD;
