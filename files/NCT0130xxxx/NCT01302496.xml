  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CTLA-4 blocking monoclonal antibody ipilimumab (MDX-010, BMS-734016), has demonstrated&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity in a subgroup of patients with Stage III (unresectable) or Stage IV&#xD;
      melanoma (measurable per modified WHO criteria), who have received prior treatment with any&#xD;
      regimen (non-experimental or experimental), except a CD-137 agonist or a CTLA4 inhibitor or&#xD;
      agonist and relapsed, failed to respond (CR or PR) or did not tolerate that regimen (Wolchok,&#xD;
      Neyns et al. 2009; O'Day, Maio et al. 2010). Ipilimumab exerts its therapeutic effect&#xD;
      presumably by activating T-lymphocytes that infiltrate the tumor mass to destroy the&#xD;
      malignant cells by mechanisms of cytotoxic cellular interaction. Autologous TriMix-DC vaccine&#xD;
      can induce a T-cell repertoire that recognizes in a HLA-restricted way the melanoma&#xD;
      associated antigens MAGE-A3, MAGE-C2, tyrosinase and gp100. Administration of ipilimumab&#xD;
      together with TriMix-DC vaccine therapy may be a more effective treatment for patients with&#xD;
      advanced melanoma as compared to either modality alone.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 26 weeks after the&#xD;
             last dose of investigational product, in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is&#xD;
             minimized. In general, the decision for appropriate methods to prevent pregnancy&#xD;
             should be determined by discussions between the investigator and the study subject.&#xD;

             successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or&#xD;

               -  Amenorrhea &gt; 12 consecutive months without another cause, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For women with irregular menstrual periods and taking hormone replacement therapy&#xD;

             such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to&#xD;
             prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile (eg,&#xD;
             vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
             WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L&#xD;
             or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours before the start of ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Men of fathering potential must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid&#xD;
             conception throughout the study [and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of&#xD;
             investigational product] in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;

             cancer, superficial bladder cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, including&#xD;
             ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease, are excluded from this study, as are patients&#xD;
             with a history of symptomatic disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive&#xD;
             sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [eg,&#xD;
             Wegener's Granulomatosis]); motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g.&#xD;
             Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator will make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the&#xD;
             interpretation of AEs, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases (for up to&#xD;
             1 month before or after any dose of ipilimumab).&#xD;

             inhibitor or agonist, or PD-1 antagonist;.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL 2, interferon, or other non-study&#xD;
             immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive agents; other&#xD;
             investigation therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids (used in the&#xD;
             management of cancer or non-cancer-related illnesses);&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Concomitant therapy with and need of uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation (e.g.&#xD;
             because of a recent thrombo-embolic event or cardiac valve prothesis).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Previous treatment with other investigational products, including cancer&#xD;
             immunotherapy, within 30 days preceding study recruitment;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Previous treatment in another ipilimumab clinical trial or prior treatment with a&#xD;
             CD137 agonist, CTLA-4 inhibitor or agonist;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for&#xD;
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious) illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), defined above in Section 4.1, who:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception to avoid&#xD;
                  pregnancy for their entire study period and for at least 8 weeks after cessation&#xD;
                  of study drug, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  have a positive pregnancy test at baseline, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  are pregnant or breastfeeding. Sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method&#xD;
                  of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of&#xD;
                  failure is minimized. Before study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the&#xD;
                  importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation and the potential&#xD;
                  risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. All WOCBP MUST have a negative&#xD;
                  pregnancy test before first receiving ipilimumab. If the pregnancy test is&#xD;
                  positive, the patient must not receive ipilimumab and must not be enrolled in the&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Persons of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception throughout treatment and for at least 8 weeks after ipilimumab is&#xD;
             stopped.&#xD;
