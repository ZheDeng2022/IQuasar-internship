      The propose of this study is to generate normative data of the tree-dimensional&#xD;
      echocardiographic(3-DE) measurements for cardiac structure and function in a large cohort of&#xD;
      normal infants, children,and adolescents. The investigators also sought to investigate the&#xD;
      utility of 3-DE in evaluating infants, children and adolescents with congenital and acquired&#xD;
      heart diseases.&#xD;

      I. SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure and calculate Z Scores of cardiac structures and function using 3-DE in a&#xD;
           large cohort of healthy infants, children, and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the utility of 3-DE in infants, children and adolescents with congenital&#xD;
           and acquired heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congenital heart disease (CHD)is one of the most common congenital malformations and is&#xD;
      associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Acquired heart diseases are also common&#xD;
      and have significant impact on the health of the young. As the therapeutic strategies are&#xD;
      evolving, reliable non-invasive methods to image the cardiovascular system and quantitatively&#xD;
      assess cardiac function with accuracy and reproducibility are pivotal to define the natural&#xD;
      history, to evaluate the results of intervention and to assess long-term&#xD;
      outcome.Three-dimensional echocardiography (3-DE) has important clinical applications to CHD.&#xD;
      Because of growth throughout childhood,interpretation of these measurements requires&#xD;
      normalization of the dimensions of cardiac structures to the size of the body. This is&#xD;
      commonly done by the calculation of Z scores for the measurement of interest. Currently&#xD;
      available normative data in the medical literature are limited to one-dimensional and&#xD;
      two-dimensional echocardiography measurements only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will generate normative data of the 3-DE measurements for cardiac structure&#xD;
      and function in a large cohort of healthy infants, children,and adolescents. We will also&#xD;
      investigate the utility of 3DE for assessing the cardiovascular structures and cardiac&#xD;
      function for congenital and acquired heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 800 study subjects will be enrolled in the study after approval by the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board. Echocardiography data will be prospectively collected. The&#xD;
      subjects will be divided into 5 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1. (n=300) Patients with normal cardiac anatomy and function by echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2. (n=300) Patients with various congenital heart diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3. (n=100) Patients with sickle cell disease and at risk for ventricular remodeling and&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4. (n=50) Patients with Duchenne and muscular dystrophy at risk for ventricular&#xD;
      remodeling and dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 5. (n=50) Patients with Marfan syndrome or the aortic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study, heart rate and blood pressures will be obtained for each study subject. The&#xD;
      subjects will be placed in a left recumbent position and ECG attached. After a complete&#xD;
      conventional echocardiographic assessment of each subject, real-time 3-DE /Doppler study will&#xD;
      be performed with 3-DE system. The 3-DE study will take about 30 minutes. After each study,&#xD;
      all data will be saved and processed off line. Indication for the clinical echocardiogram&#xD;
      will include cardiac murmur, syncope or chest pain but with a normal echocardiogram. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from each patient and legal representatives after a full explanation&#xD;
      of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conventional echocardiography All patients will undergo a complete 2- dimensional, color&#xD;
           flow Doppler, and spectral Doppler examination. Examination will be performed using a&#xD;
           commercially available ultrasound system (IE33 system, Philips, Andover, Mass). All&#xD;
           measurements will be made offline using a computer workstation(Xcelera,Philips Medical&#xD;
           Systems,Andover,MA). All measurements will be made according to American Society of&#xD;
           Echocardiography protocol. For any given structure, measurement will be made if&#xD;
           excellent and unambiguous views were available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Transthoracic 3-DE The 3-DE/Doppler studies will be performed using the IE33 (Philips,&#xD;
           Andover, MA,USA) ultrasound machine with X3-1 or X7-2 matrix-array transducers. The X7-2&#xD;
           matrix-array transducer is a new tool and particularly well suited for small children.&#xD;
           The patient will be in a decubitus position. Image acquisition will be performed from an&#xD;
           apical window with the LV as the region of interest based on international&#xD;
           recommendations. To encompass the complete LV into the 3D dataset, a full volume scan&#xD;
           will acquire in harmonic mode from four R-wave triggered subvolumes. This scan will&#xD;
           carried out during an end-expiratory breath hold a few seconds when possible. The 3D&#xD;
           dataset will be stored in a DICOM format on a CD-ROM and transferred to separate&#xD;
           workstations for off-line data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Image off-line analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. QLAB Semiautomated Border Detection Method:A semiautomated border detection biplane LV&#xD;
           volume analysis was performed using off-line QLAB version 8.0 software (Philips). The LV&#xD;
           end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) (smallest LV volume) frames are&#xD;
           identified.On both of these end-diastolic and end-systolic frames,five identification&#xD;
           points are marked: the septal, lateral, anterior, and inferior mitral annulus and the&#xD;
           apex (from either one of the views). Then the software automatically delineates the LV&#xD;
           endocardial border and, by sequential analysis, creates a LV mathematical model or&#xD;
           &quot;cast&quot; that represents the LV cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TomTec Semiautomated Method:LV volume analysis will be performed off-line using TomTec&#xD;
           4D LV-Analysis software. TomTec requires triplane manual tracing of the endocardial&#xD;
           border after which the software selects a fitting geometric model and the total LV&#xD;
           endocardial border is automatically delineated with possible manual corrections. Based&#xD;
           on the six initial contours, a spatiotemporal interpolation model (like a pulsating&#xD;
           balloon) is created by rotational and temporal interpolation of these contours.&#xD;
           According to the initial balloon, the algorithm starts to detect the endocardial border&#xD;
           continuously in the entire 4D dataset (without large gaps due to interpolation), like&#xD;
           deforming the balloon in the LV until it best fits the walls in each frame. Adjustments&#xD;
           can be made manually after this step in oblique, sagittal, and coronal planes.&#xD;
           Subsequently, a final reconstruction of the LV model and a time-volume curve are&#xD;
           created. LV-EDV and LV-ESV are the largest and smallest volume, respectively, from this&#xD;
           time-volume curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All numerical values are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation. The real- time 3-DE&#xD;
      measurements will be compared with other clinical data and measurements, such as cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization or magnetic resonance imaging. Statistical significance will be defined as&#xD;
      P&lt;0.05. All statistical analyzes will be done using SAS for Windows version9.1 and Microsoft&#xD;
      Excel (Microsoft Office 2007) for all analysis.&#xD;
