  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, non-controlled study designed to obtain&#xD;
      survival and outcome data on the Continuum Metal on Polyethylene Acetabular System when used&#xD;
      in primary total hip arthroplasty.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety and performance of the Continuum Metal on Polyethylene Acetabular System will be&#xD;
      confirmed by the assessment of survival and outcome data. Assessments will include standard&#xD;
      scoring systems, radiographs and adverse event records. Data will be used to monitor pain,&#xD;
      mobility, and survivorship of the Continuum Metal on Polyethylene Acetabular system in&#xD;
      primary total hip arthroplasty. Metal ion (cobalt, chromium and titanium) and renal function&#xD;
      (BUN, Creatinine and GFR) levels will be analyzed for a subset of the enrolled study&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

        Patients from surgeons medical practice who are candidates for primary hip arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study population will be comprised of 300 males and females who require primary total&#xD;
        hip arthroplasty. Subjects will be enrolled at up to 7 clinical sites. Subjects must be&#xD;
        geographically accessible throughout the study and be willing and able to attend required&#xD;
        follow-up appointments. Candidates who express interest in study participation will be&#xD;
        offered informed consent, and eligibility will be determined based upon the&#xD;
        inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
