      Obesity surgery is expensive, although highly competitive to the cost of obesity related&#xD;
      disease. An important step would be to reorganize obesity surgery into a day surgical&#xD;
      procedure. Some reports already exist in the literature but the number of publications are&#xD;
      sparse, and the description of the condition of the patient is limited. Our primary aim,&#xD;
      therefore, is to investigate the influence transverses abdominis plane block has on pain&#xD;
      after laparoscopic gastric bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of adequate postoperative analgesia are clear, and include a reduction in the&#xD;
      postoperative stress response, reduction in postoperative morbidity and in certain types of&#xD;
      surgery, improved surgical outcome. The benefits of utilizing regional analgesic techniques&#xD;
      compared to systemic analgesics include reduction in pain intensity, decreased incidence of&#xD;
      side effects from systemic analgesics and improved patient comfort. Effective pain control&#xD;
      thereby accelerates recovery from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substantial component of the pain experienced by patients after abdominal surgery is&#xD;
      derived from the abdominal wall incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block was first described in 2001 in a letter by Dr.&#xD;
      Rafi. McDonnell et al have developed and tested the block and describes it as a landmark&#xD;
      technique. TAP Block involves blocking the sensory afferent nerves that supply the anterior&#xD;
      abdominal wall including the skin, muscles and the parietal peritoneum. Hebbard et al&#xD;
      subsequently described an ultrasound guided technique for the TAP block which they named the&#xD;
      Posterior TAP block. The posterior TAP block provides analgesia on the lower abdominal wall.&#xD;
      Hebbard also described another ultrasound-guided technique called the Oblique Sub costal TAP&#xD;
      block which provides analgesia for surgery on the upper abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some debate over the extent of sensory blockade achieved by TAP block. Nerves&#xD;
      supplying the anterior abdominal wall are derived from T16 to L1 and pass through this plane&#xD;
      before supplying the anterior abdominal wall. Earlier studies showed a T7-L1 spread of the&#xD;
      block after a single posterior TAP injection, while some newer studies revealed that the&#xD;
      block failed to spread above T10 so was suitable only for lower abdominal procedures. In&#xD;
      contrast the oblique sub costal TAP block can provide an effective analgesia after surgery&#xD;
      that involves dermatome T6 to T10, in other word provide analgesia for surgery on the upper&#xD;
      abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies looking at posterior TAP block have demonstrated reduced postoperative morphine&#xD;
      consumption and improved pain scores at rest and on movement in patients undergoing lower&#xD;
      midline laparotomy, open appendectomy, laparoscopic appendectomy total abdominal&#xD;
      hysterectomy, caesarean section and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The duration of the&#xD;
      morphine-sparing effect after a single shot injection into the posterior TAP has been&#xD;
      reported to range from 12 to 48 hours. Pain scores both in rest and on movement are reduced&#xD;
      compared to placebo in up to 48 hours after surgery. Single shot TAP blocks have also been&#xD;
      used to provide analgesia in patients admitted to the ICU the analgesia provided by the block&#xD;
      lasted between 16 to 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been a report from Leicester General Hospital of the effectiveness of inserting&#xD;
      catheters into the oblique sub costal TAP. The obtained block provided analgesia for more&#xD;
      than 72 hours in patients who have had surgery on the upper abdominal wall (hepatobiliary&#xD;
      surgery). They also describe the block as being effective rescue analgesia in patients in&#xD;
      whom the epidural is ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are to our knowledge no clinical trials on the analgesic efficacy of single&#xD;
      shot oblique sub costal TAP blocks for surgery of the upper abdominal wall. Niraj et al&#xD;
      reports that they have observed the duration of postoperative analgesia to be 6 to 8 hours&#xD;
      after single shot sub costal TAP. While Patil et al reports of sensory blockade for 5 hours&#xD;
      along the dermatomal level T7-L1 after single shot posterior TAP block combined with sub&#xD;
      costal TAP block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oblique sub costal TAP block could be a viable alternative for providing analgesia during the&#xD;
      postoperative period. The block can be performed easily using ultrasound guidance, has an&#xD;
      excellent safety profile, provides effective dynamic analgesia and has a significant&#xD;
      morphine-sparing effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study involves the utilization of ultrasound to locate the oblique subcostal&#xD;
      TAP, injection of bupivacaine or placebo (saline) into the TAP on each side and comparison of&#xD;
      the analgesic efficacy of the TAP injection with that of placebo during two weeks in patients&#xD;
      who have had gastric bypass.&#xD;
