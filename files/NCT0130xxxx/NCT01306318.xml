    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the bioavailabilities of a single fixed&#xD;
      dose combination of eperisone 50 mg plus diclofenac 50 mg capsules with the bioavailabilities&#xD;
      of eperisone 50 mg tablets and diclofenac 50 mg tablets in healthy human adult male subjects&#xD;
      under fasting conditions.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the single-dose oral bioavailabilities of&#xD;
      eperisone and diclofenac from Epry-D (containing eperisone hydrochloride 50 mg and diclofenac&#xD;
      sodium 50 mg) capsules of Eisai Pharmaceuticals India Private Limited, India with those from&#xD;
      Epry (eperisone hydrochloride) 50 mg tablets of Eisai Pharmaceuticals India Pvt. Ltd., and&#xD;
      voltaren (diclofenac sodium) 50 mg tablets of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Ltd., India in healthy&#xD;
      human adult male subjects under fasting conditions. The secondary objective of this study is&#xD;
      to monitor the safety and tolerability of a single dose of eperisone hydrochloride 50 mg and&#xD;
      diclofenac sodium 50 mg formulation when administered in healthy human adult male subjects&#xD;
      under fasting conditions. The participants will be screened for demographic data, medical&#xD;
      history, general physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray&#xD;
      (Posterior to Anterior view), hematology, clinical bio- chemistry, serology, urine analysis,&#xD;
      tests for alcohol and drugs of abuse. A total of 24 healthy adult male volunteer participants&#xD;
      will be housed in the clinical study facility at least 11 hours before administration of the&#xD;
      Investigational Product (IP) and will continue to remain in the clinical study facility for&#xD;
      at least 12 hours after administration of the IP in each study period. After overnight&#xD;
      fasting for at least 10 hours, either one Epry-D capsule or one Epry 50 mg tablet and one&#xD;
      Voltaren 50 mg tablet will be administered orally to each participant in sitting posture,&#xD;
      with 240 plus or minus 2 mL of water at room temperature, in each study period, as per the&#xD;
      randomization schedule. Administration of the IP will be performed by trained study&#xD;
      personnel. Dosing activity will be followed by mouth check to assess the compliance to&#xD;
      dosing. A total of 22 (6 mL) blood samples will be collected from each subject in&#xD;
      pre-specified vacuum tubes containing K2 EDTA in each study period.&#xD;
