  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to find out if a dietary intervention mainly focusing on&#xD;
      fructose reduction has a preventive effect on the development and progression of NAFLD and&#xD;
      the metabolic syndrome in overweight children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the intervention study a total of 100 overweight and 50 normal weight children, aged 5-8&#xD;
      years have to be included. At the beginning, two 24-h dietary recalls are performed to assess&#xD;
      nutritional intake and fructose consumption. Anthropometric parameters (body weight and&#xD;
      height) are measured to calculate BMI and BMI-SDS of the children. Physical activity during&#xD;
      leisure time as well as socio-demographic status and &quot;family background&quot; are assessed using&#xD;
      different questionnaires. An ultrasound examination of the liver is performed in all&#xD;
      participants for detection of signs of fatty liver. From each child included in the study a&#xD;
      fasting blood sample is taken to determine the following blood parameters: ALT, AST, γ-GT,&#xD;
      uric acid, blood lipids (TG, HDL, LDL, Total cholesterol), blood alcohol, PAI-1 and endotoxin&#xD;
      concentration. A part of the blood sample is used for DNA-analysis. In all children systolic&#xD;
      (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure are also measured. An oral glucose tolerance test&#xD;
      (OGTT) is performed after an overnight fast of 12 h (glucose concentration: 1.75 g/kg body&#xD;
      weight, maximum 75g). Simultaneously a glucose hydrogen breath test is performed to assess&#xD;
      small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). After the check-ups at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study, children are divided into two study groups: the intervention group and the control&#xD;
      group. Based on the daily fructose intake assessed at the beginning of the study, children&#xD;
      participating in the intervention group are advised to reduce their daily fructose intake by&#xD;
      50%. In the first study year, every three months and in the second study year, every six&#xD;
      months, nutritional counseling is repeated in small groups in which parents and children are&#xD;
      separately trained. If families participating in the control group wish, they receive a&#xD;
      dietary counseling based on the references of the &quot;DGE&quot; at the beginning of the study. After&#xD;
      the first and the second study year the examinations are repeated in all participants&#xD;
      (ultrasound examination only after the second study year).&#xD;
