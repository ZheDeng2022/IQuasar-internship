    <textblock>
      This phase I trial will use the combination of irinotecan and BKM120 in patients with&#xD;
      advanced colorectal cancer who have failed on or have become intolerant of at least one line&#xD;
      of therapy for advanced colorectal cancer and who are candidates for irinotecan therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although survival of patients with advanced colorectal cancer has improved in the last two&#xD;
      decades, the overwhelming majority of these patients will still succumb from this disease. It&#xD;
      is the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the United States. We have witnessed&#xD;
      significant leaps in understanding colorectal cancer carcinogenesis as well as in&#xD;
      identification of a number of prognostic and predictive factors associated with this&#xD;
      malignancy. With the use of combination chemotherapy and the addition of targeted agents, the&#xD;
      median survival of patients with advanced colorectal cancer has improved from 4-6 months with&#xD;
      supportive care to over 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecularly directed therapy for cancer holds promise to a more personalized approach to&#xD;
      treating cancer. Increase understanding of tumorigenesis has resulted in the identification&#xD;
      of promising targets of therapy for more strategic approach to treatment of this malignancy.&#xD;
      However, even with the development of molecularly directed treatment, the therapy for&#xD;
      advanced colorectal cancer remains to be primarily palliative in nature to majority of&#xD;
      patients. There is definite need for a more effective therapy, agents with more acceptable&#xD;
      toxicity profiles, and drugs that could be administered without significant demand on time&#xD;
      and activity for individual patients receiving these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I trial of the combination of irinotecan and BKM120 in patients with advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer who have failed on or have become intolerant of at least one line of&#xD;
      therapy for advanced colorectal cancer and who are candidates for irinotecan therapy. This&#xD;
      study will attempt to estimate the Maximum Tolerated Dose of the combination of irinotecan&#xD;
      and BKM120.&#xD;

             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (eg age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or 6 months of spontaneous&#xD;

             surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least 6 weeks ago.&#xD;
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;

             bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during treatment for 8 days&#xD;
             after stopping treatment and for additional 12 weeks after study drug discontinuation.&#xD;
             Highly effective contraception is defined as: true abstinence: Periodic abstinence&#xD;
             (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are&#xD;
             not acceptable methods of contraception. Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks ago. In&#xD;
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been&#xD;
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the&#xD;
             absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b): Placement of an intrauterine&#xD;
             device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or&#xD;

             foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository; Oral contraception, injected or implanted&#xD;
             hormonal methods are not allowed as BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fertile males must use condom during treatment, for 8 days after stopping treatment&#xD;
             and for additional 12 weeks after study drug discontinuation and should not father a&#xD;
             child in this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of another malignancy within 3 years, except cured basal cell skin carcinoma&#xD;
             or excised cervical carcinoma in situ&#xD;
