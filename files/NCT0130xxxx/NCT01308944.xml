      This research is looking at the effect of biobehavioral factors such as stress and whether&#xD;
      these factors alter how the body responds to chemotherapy, one of the purposes of this study&#xD;
      is to determine if the addition of a beta-blocker such as Propranolol (Inderal) is tolerable&#xD;
      when given with chemotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed ovarian, fallopian tube, or&#xD;
      primary peritoneal cancer. An additional purpose of the study is to understand if behavioral&#xD;
      factors such as depression and anxiety can alter different blood markers that affect tumor&#xD;
      vascularity. The Investigator wishes to determine whether the use of beta-blocker drugs such&#xD;
      as Inderal, might alter these behavioral factors by drawing blood prior to and after the&#xD;
      administration of Inderal as well as giving behavioral questionaires at different time&#xD;
      points. Beta-blockers are commonly used for the treatment of hypertension, protection of the&#xD;
      heart after a heart attack, and irregularities in heartbeats. Altering these factors might&#xD;
      boost the immune system and affect other areas of cancer biology, thereby allowing the&#xD;
      chemotherapy to be more effective. The significance of this research is that it may help&#xD;
      improve our treatments of this disease in the future.&#xD;

After surgery, the patient will resume the propranolol once tolerating clear liquids in the hospital and will remain on them until completion of chemotherapy.&#xD;
After completion of chemotherapy, the patient will be weaned off the medication over the following two weeks.</description>
