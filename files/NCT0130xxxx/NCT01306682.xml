      This randomized, placebo controlled trial will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (TIV) in HIV-infected pregnant women, dynamics of transplacental&#xD;
      anti-influenza antibody transfer to their newborns and kinetics thereof during early infancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Determining the contribution of influenza to early childhood morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa and the potential to prevent influenza disease through vaccination may&#xD;
      contribute to reducing childhood deaths; since influenza illness is a vaccine preventable&#xD;
      disease for which vaccines are developed, licensed and available at reasonable cost.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, infants at highest risk for serious disease are those under 6 months of age,&#xD;
      for whom trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) is poorly immunogenic and not&#xD;
      licensed. As pregnant women also have an increased risk of serious illness (3.3-5.5 fold for&#xD;
      hospitalization for influenza-associated acute cardio-respiratory illness) from influenza&#xD;
      infection, one strategy to prevent the complications of influenza in pregnant women and young&#xD;
      infants is through maternal TIV immunization, which is recommended by the WHO. This could&#xD;
      result in direct protection of the women and protection of the young infant consequent to&#xD;
      transplacental transfer of TIV induced antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barriers to administration of vaccines during pregnancy including lack of information on&#xD;
      effectiveness and concerns about safety probably explain the virtual non-existent use of TIV&#xD;
      in pregnant women from low-middle income countries, including South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunogenicity and efficacy of TIV in HIV-infected adults was only recently documented in&#xD;
      an African setting. A placebo-controlled, community-based randomized, placebo controlled&#xD;
      trial, conducted in South Africa reported that TIV was associated with a 75% reduction in&#xD;
      influenza-confirmed illness. The results of the study also confirmed the safety of TIV among&#xD;
      African HIV-infected adults. The study, however, only included 7 women who were pregnant. In&#xD;
      addition to no differences in solicited adverse event rates, there was also no difference in&#xD;
      either CD4+ cell count changes or HIV viral control in those on antiretroviral treatment&#xD;
      between TIV vaccinees compared to placebo recipients. This allayed previous concerns&#xD;
      regarding the potential negative effect of TIV which centered around the observed transient&#xD;
      increase in HIV-1 viral load, even in HIV infected individuals on ART and who were&#xD;
      virologically suppressed (viral load &lt;400 copies/ml). Decreases in CD4+ lymphocyte counts&#xD;
      have also been observed in HIV-infected individuals post TIV vaccination. These changes,&#xD;
      however, even in past studies were infrequent (4-18%) and resolved at later time-points and&#xD;
      were considered to be clinically non-significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only recently has data become available from Bangladesh in which the benefit of maternal TIV&#xD;
      vaccination was demonstrated by a 63% (95%CI 5 to 85) reduction in laboratory-confirmed&#xD;
      influenza illness in infants under 24 weeks of age in children born to mothers vaccinated&#xD;
      with TIV and a 36% reduction in clinical illness in vaccinated mothers. There has, however,&#xD;
      not been any study on the effectiveness of maternal immunization with TIV on influenza-&#xD;
      associated morbidity and mortality either in the mothers or infants in African settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the encouraging results on maternal immunization from Bangladesh, and the preliminary&#xD;
      data supporting that TIV is efficacious mainly in HIV-infected non-pregnant adults, further&#xD;
      data are needed to advocate for routine use of TIV during pregnancy in settings with a high&#xD;
      prevalence of HIV. Reasons for this include that the impact of maternal HIV on the kinetics&#xD;
      of TIV induced transplacental antibody transfer cannot be derived from available data. This&#xD;
      is important as the primary focus of this proposal, and major potential public health benefit&#xD;
      of maternal TIV vaccination, is targeted at protection of young infants. HIV infection is&#xD;
      known to decrease placental integrity and lower antibody levels in the fetus and newborn.&#xD;
      Furthermore, maternal hypergamma-globulinemia that is characteristic of HIV-infection may be&#xD;
      associated with decreased neonatal antibody levels. This paradox is explained by the limited&#xD;
      number of placental antibody receptors, resulting in IgG antibodies competing for available&#xD;
      receptors and thereby decreasing vaccine-specific antibody transport. Preterm birth increases&#xD;
      with HIV, chronic maternal disease or malnutrition. Transfer of maternal antibody which is&#xD;
      gestational age dependant, may be more affected by maternal immunization in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa where these conditions are common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this project is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of TIV&#xD;
      vaccination of HIV-infected pregnant women&#xD;
