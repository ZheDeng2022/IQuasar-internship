      CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Tumor and its therapy have adverse effects on the nutritional status&#xD;
      of cancer patients, leading to nutritional support. The aim was to study enteral nutrition&#xD;
      indications, as well as its compliance and the impact on nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND SETTING: Clinical trial, IOP, Unifesp-EPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Patients older than 1 year followed during anticancer therapy were included from&#xD;
      January 2002 to January 2004. They received industrialized oral supplementation - Nutren 1.0&#xD;
      or Jr (IOS) and were followed on a weekly basis and reevaluated on weeks 3, 8 and 12: at&#xD;
      these times, if inadequate outcome was observed, tube feeding with the same supplement (TFR)&#xD;
      was indicated.&#xD;
