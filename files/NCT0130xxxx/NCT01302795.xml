  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective open label evaluation of Canakinumab (Ilaris) for treatment of&#xD;
      subjects with pyoderma gangrenosum.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the start of the study (week 0), all patients will receive one subcutaneous injection of&#xD;
      150mg Canakinumab. Patients are then going to be examined at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 2 weeks, all patients are going to be evaluated for response by Physician's global&#xD;
      assessment (PGA) of the target lesion. Patients with PGA 0-1 are not going to receive another&#xD;
      injection at this timepoint, while patients with PGA 2-4 are going to receive another 150mg&#xD;
      Canakinumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 4 weeks, in case of PGA 4, patients are going to be offered a first or second line drug as&#xD;
      an alternative therapy (corticosteroids, cyclosporin A or infliximab, dosage see below&#xD;
      &quot;Alternative therapy in case of missing response&quot;) and stay within the trial (due to the long&#xD;
      half-life of canakinumab) until week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 8, patients with PGA 0 receive another 150mg Canakinumab only, and patients with PGA&#xD;
      4 are not going to receive additional study drug, but are strongly encouraged to attend&#xD;
      following medical visits for observation until the end of the study and/or switch to a first&#xD;
      or second line drug as alternative therapy (see below). All other patients with PGA 1-3&#xD;
      receive the total accumulative dose of Canakinumab that they had received on week 0 and 2,&#xD;
      namely 150 or 300mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration for each individual is going to be 16 weeks. At week 8 and 16, safety&#xD;
      laboratory investigations with blood differential (Neutrophil granulocytes, monocytes,&#xD;
      eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, thrombocytes, erythrocytes, hemoglobin), AST, ALT, y-GT,&#xD;
      AP, Bilirubin (total), Creatinine, Na, K, CRP are going to be determined.&#xD;

    <description>As secondary parameter, the change in surface area of the target lesion of pyoderma gangrenosum at week 2, 4, 8, 16 as compared to week 0 will be assessed by measuring the two-dimensional surface by tracing the border of the lesions on transparent foil as well as with Canfield photography.</description>
