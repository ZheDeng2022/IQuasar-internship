      Study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty male type 2 diabetics, recruited from the outpatient clinic at the National University&#xD;
      Hospital, Singapore, will be randomized to receive two tablets of either 100 mg zinc&#xD;
      gluconate (GNC, USA) or placebo (99% microcystalline cellulose, 1% magnesium stearate) per&#xD;
      day for 3 months. Subjects aged 21 years and above who fulfilled the American Diabetes&#xD;
      Association criteria for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus will be included in this&#xD;
      study. We will exclude those who: had consumed over-the counter or prescription drugs,&#xD;
      vitamin/mineral supplements or traditional Chinese remedies, suffered acute infection less&#xD;
      than 30-days prior to the start of the study, had been diagnosed with active neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      disease or hematological diseases, had hemoglobin less than 10g/dL, had previous use of&#xD;
      narcotic drugs or regular alcohol intake in excess of 14 units per week. Each participant&#xD;
      will provide written informed consent prior to their participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementation and sampling of blood and urine&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hospital research pharmacist will be engaged to randomize, blind the assigned treatment&#xD;
      groups and count the remaining tablets so as to assess compliance. Blood and spot urine&#xD;
      samples will be taken following an 8-hour fast at baseline (before supplementation), days 3&#xD;
      and 7, months 1, 2 and 3 during supplementation and 1 month following the intake of zinc or&#xD;
      placebo (washout). An aliquot of blood will be collected in plain or EDTA tubes for serum or&#xD;
      plasma separation respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markers of oxidative damage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples collected into EDTA tubes will be centrifuged, indomethacin and butylated&#xD;
      hydroxytoluene added into the plasma, and fresh urine samples placed in polypropylene tubes.&#xD;
      The prepared samples will be stored at -80oC until analysis. Oxidative stress related&#xD;
      biomarkers, F2-IsoPs, F4-NPs, HETEs, COPs and allantoin, will be measured by gas&#xD;
      chromatography-mass spectrometry using methods as previously described. Briefly, mixed heavy&#xD;
      isotopes, 8-iso-PGF2α-d4, IPF2α-VI-d4, [18O2] F4-NP (gift from Prof. Jason D. Morrow&#xD;
      (deceased), Eiscosanoid Core Laboratory at Vanderbilt University), 5(S)-HETE-d8,&#xD;
      12(S)-HETE-d8, 15(S)-HETE-d8, 20-HETE-d6 and arachidonic acid-d8 and docosahexaenoic acid-d5,&#xD;
      and 7-OH cholesterol-d7, 24-OH cholesterol-d7 and 26 (27)-OH cholesterol-d5 and&#xD;
      7-keto-cholesterol-d7 will be added into plasma for quantification of the oxidative stress&#xD;
      markers. To measure the total (free and esterified) forms of F2-IsoPs, F4-NPs and HETEs&#xD;
      products, 1 M potassium hydroxide prepared in methanol will be added to plasma (1:1) and&#xD;
      hydrolysis performed at 37oC for 30 minutes. Thereafter, methanol, 5 M HCl and 40 mM formic&#xD;
      acid (pH 4.6) will be sequentially added and mixed. The plasma mix will then purified using&#xD;
      anionic exchange solid phase extraction (SPE). To measure the free forms in plasma and urine&#xD;
      (F2-IsoPs and HETEs), 40 mM formic acid (pH 4.5) will be added to the plasma or urine sample,&#xD;
      mixed and then purified by SPE. Urinary creatinine levels will be measured to standardize&#xD;
      urinary F2-IsoPs and HETEs (Sigma Diagnostic kit, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purified samples will then be derivatized and analyzed using gas chromatography&#xD;
      (Hewlett-Packard 6890, Agilent Technologies, USA) coupled to a mass selective detector&#xD;
      (Hewlett-Packard 5973N, Agilent Technologies, USA) (GC-MS). For F2-IsoPs, F4-NPs, HETEs (a&#xD;
      mixture of 5(S)-, 12(S)-, 15(S)- and 20-HETEs), and total arachidonate and total&#xD;
      docosahexanoate measurements, negative chemical ionization (NCI) mode will be applied and&#xD;
      chromatographic separations will be carried out on a fused silica capillary column coated&#xD;
      with cross-linked 5% phenylmethylsiloxane (HP-5, Agilent Technologies, USA). To determine&#xD;
      COPs, electron ionization mode will be applied and chromatographic separations carried out on&#xD;
      a fused silica capillary column coated with cross-linked 5% phenylmethylsiloxane (Ultra 2&#xD;
      J&amp;W, USA). Concentrations of the lipid oxidation products will be calculated by comparing the&#xD;
      peak area of each compound with the relevant deuterated internal standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For allantoin and urate analysis, 25 ul plasma will be centrifuged using Nanosep filters (10&#xD;
      kDa) and to the filtrate, 25 ul of 4 mM 15N allantoin and 100 ul acetonitrile will be added,&#xD;
      mixed and then dried under nitrogen gas. The dried sample will then be derivatized with 50 ml&#xD;
      N-(butyl-dimethyl-silyl)-2,2,2-trifluoro-N-methyl-acetamide (MTBSTFA) in pyridine (1:1 v/v)&#xD;
      at 50oC for 2 h. Allantoin will be analyzed by GC-MS. Separations will be carried out on a&#xD;
      fused silica capillary column coated with cross-linked 5% phenylmethylsiloxane (Ultra 2,&#xD;
      Agilent, USA). Derivatized allantoin samples (1 µl) will be injected into the GC-MS.&#xD;
      Quantification of allantoin will be calculated by comparison with the heavy isotope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For urate analysis, 80 ul water will be added to 20 ul plasma, mixed and then centrifuged&#xD;
      using Nanosep filters (10 kDa). The filtrate will then be injected into an HPLC (Agilent&#xD;
      Technologies, USA) coupled to a UV detector. Chromatographic separation will be achieved&#xD;
      using 250 mm Zorbax SB-C8 columns under isocratic condition where 2 mM NH4H2PO4 (pH 2.95)&#xD;
      will be used for the mobile phase. The area of the eluted uric acid peak will be measured and&#xD;
      the concentration determined against the linear calibration curve constructed with the&#xD;
      samples spiked with pure urate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters of serum and hematological indices&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood glucose, HbA1c and insulin, serum hsCRP, cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglyceride and iron&#xD;
      will be measured using the Cobas C111 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland). Serum zinc&#xD;
      and copper levels will be determined at the Referral Laboratory at the Singapore General&#xD;
      Hospital, and white and red blood counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit concentrations, platelets,&#xD;
      neutrophils and lymphocytes, will be assessed using the Full Blood Count Analyzer (Sysmex,&#xD;
      Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular indices&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique of pulse wave analysis will be used to determine the aortic pressure and&#xD;
      augmentation index (AIx). Pulse wave velocity recordings will be made from the radial artery&#xD;
      using a Millar tonometer, and data will be collected and analyzed using the SphygmoCor&#xD;
      (SphygmoCor 2000 v7.0, PWV Medical, Sydney, Australia), which allowed continuous recording of&#xD;
      the radial artery pressure waveform. The AIx will be calculated by dividing the difference in&#xD;
      pressure between the first and second systolic peaks of the aortic pressure waveform by the&#xD;
      calculated aortic pulse pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of plasma nitrate/nitrite will be adapted from that of Tsikas. In brief, to 200&#xD;
      µl of plasma heavy label 15N NO3- and 15N NO2- will be added, 800 µl acetone and 100 µl&#xD;
      pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFBBr) will be added, mixed and incubated at 50°C for 60 min. The&#xD;
      acetone portion will be evaporated under nitrogen and then 500 µl of toluene will be added&#xD;
      and mixed vigorously for 1 min. The organic extract will be obtained by centrifuging at 2000&#xD;
      rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Derivatized samples will be analyzed by GC-MS/NCI. Separations will be&#xD;
      carried out on a fused silica capillary column coated with cross-linked 5% phenyl methyl&#xD;
      siloxane. Derivatized samples (1µl) will be injected into the GC injection port using a&#xD;
      splitless mode. Quantification of nitrate/nitrite will be calculated by comparing the peak&#xD;
      area of each compound with the relevant heavy labelled internal standard 15N NO3- and 15N&#xD;
      NO2-.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using by GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Macintosh&#xD;
      (GraphPad Prism Software, CA, USA). All values will be expressed as mean SD. Paired Student's&#xD;
      t-test will be performed between baseline and each time point during supplementation and&#xD;
      after the wash-out period. Any significant changes detected by Student's t-test will be&#xD;
      confirmed by ANOVA with repeated measures to assess the effects of zinc over time.&#xD;
