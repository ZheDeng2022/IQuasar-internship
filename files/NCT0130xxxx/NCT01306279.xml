  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the treatment burden and excess morbidity and mortality associated with acute infective&#xD;
      exacerbations in cystic fibrosis, a clear understanding of the mechanisms involved in the&#xD;
      origins of an infective exacerbation and the response to antibiotics is vital to improving&#xD;
      long-term outcomes in CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine 3 areas of interest in CF exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bacterial biodiversity and its clinical significance&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The role of bacteria which are able to rapidly mutate (hypermutators)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inter-bacterial communication and its role in infective exacerbations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased microbiological diversity represents a balanced community of bacteria. The presence&#xD;
      of a diverse population of bacteria in CF infections therefore predicts a better outcome for&#xD;
      treatment than when a population consists of a small number of more virulent organisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa hypermutators can mutate much more often than ordinary Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa bacteria. Hypermutators are likely to grow better when the bacteria are under&#xD;
      stress, such as during antibiotic treatment or during an infection. They are, however, weaker&#xD;
      organisms because of the multiple mutations they have undergone. Their presence does not&#xD;
      relate to clinical outcome but may be associated with the emergence of antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria communicate with each other by secreting and responding&#xD;
      to chemicals known as quorum sensing (QS)molecules. As well as affecting the behaviour of&#xD;
      bacteria, these QS molecules can cause inflammation in the lung of CF patients. Selective&#xD;
      growth of QS-producing organisms can trigger lung exacerbations in CF. If antibiotics kill&#xD;
      this population of bacteria and QS molecule levels drop in the lung, patients recover from&#xD;
      infection quickly. Failure to kill these bacteria with antibiotics allow QS molecule levels&#xD;
      to remain elevated and patients to have prolonged infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will sequentially recruit patients attending our CF centre with an infective exacerbation&#xD;
      of CF, who are chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will record spirometry, blood markers of inflammation, quality of life questionnaires and&#xD;
      investigate sputum samples for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Routine microbiology&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bacterial diversity using 16s RNA identification techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Relative abundance of P.aeruginosa hypermutators&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Levels of quorum sensing molecules&#xD;
&#xD;
      These observations will be undertaken before commencing intravenous antibiotic therapy, on&#xD;
      days 7, 10 and the last day of antibiotic therapy. Patients will also be reviewed one month&#xD;
      after the end of antibiotic therapy where spirometry and a sputum sample will be collected&#xD;
      for the above investigations.&#xD;
