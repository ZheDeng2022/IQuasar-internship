      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tuberculosis is a disease of the lungs caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#xD;
           (M. tuberculosis). The most popular and least expensive tool used to detect the presence&#xD;
           of the tuberculosis bacteria is called sputum smears, which is a lab test used to look&#xD;
           for bacteria in the sputum via a microscope. However, the test s results are not always&#xD;
           accurate, and the test cannot determine if the bacteria will be resistant to standard&#xD;
           tuberculosis treatments. The most sensitive test currently available is called sputum&#xD;
           culture, in which a sputum sample is used to check for the growth of tuberculosis&#xD;
           bacteria. However, this test takes at least a month to produce accurate results, and&#xD;
           requires expensive equipment that is not available in many countries where M.&#xD;
           tuberculosis is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The urea breath test (UBT) has been used to detect infection with Helicobacter pylori, a&#xD;
           bacteria associated with stomach ulcers, by testing individual breath samples.&#xD;
           Researchers are interested in determining whether breath samples can also be used to&#xD;
           detect the presence of M. tuberculosis in the lungs of subjects with tuberculosis, and&#xD;
           to see if tuberculosis treatments are successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess the sensitivity and specificity of urea breath testing in the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment response of pulmonary tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who either have been diagnosed with tuberculosis or&#xD;
           are healthy volunteers with no past history of tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted in Bamako, Mali.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will involve three groups: two pilot groups of individuals who have already&#xD;
           been diagnosed with tuberculosis, and a primary study group of both healthy volunteers&#xD;
           and individuals who have been diagnosed with tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, as well&#xD;
           as blood, sputum, stool, and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First pilot group (one visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants should not eat, drink, or smoke for at least 1 hour prior to the UBT test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a baseline exhaled air sample, and then will receive the UBT&#xD;
           test, which involves a dose of Pranactin -Citric dissolved in water. Additional exhaled&#xD;
           air samples will be collected at eight time points (10, 20, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, and&#xD;
           240 minutes after the dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second pilot group (one or two visits):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants should not eat, drink, or smoke for at least 1 hour prior to the UBT test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a baseline exhaled air sample, and then will receive the UBT&#xD;
           test. Half of the participants will receive a dose of bismuth (Pepto-Bismol) prior to&#xD;
           collection of air samples to see how this affects the results of the UBT test.&#xD;
           Additional exhaled air samples will be collected at three time points specified by the&#xD;
           study researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the following day, participants will return for a second visit to provide three more&#xD;
           exhaled air samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary study group (five visits for participants with tuberculosis, two visits for&#xD;
           healthy volunteers):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have two visits, following the procedures given for the second&#xD;
           pilot group. Half will receive a dose of bismuth prior to collection of air samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with tuberculosis will have three additional visits (days 6, 10, and 16&#xD;
           following the first study visit) to provide additional sputum and exhaled air samples to&#xD;
           monitor the progress of tuberculosis treatment.&#xD;

      Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease that affects the population worldwide, with 9 million people&#xD;
      being infected every year. It is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
      Reports show that a person dies from tuberculosis every 20 seconds worldwide. Current&#xD;
      diagnostic techniques are either inadequate at detecting TB cases with precision, or they are&#xD;
      time consuming, expensive, and require laboratory equipment not available in developing&#xD;
      countries, where the disease is endemic. Furthermore, rates of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) TB&#xD;
      are estimated to be over 5 percent of the incident cases globally and extremely&#xD;
      drug-resistant (XDR) TB rates are on the rise. These statistics highlight the need for new&#xD;
      and improved diagnostic tools for TB, as well as biomarkers that can quickly detect drug&#xD;
      resistant organisms or treatment failures to first-line antimicrobials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urea breath test (UBT) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the&#xD;
      detection of Helicobacter pylori. It is known that H. pylori possesses a urease enzyme that&#xD;
      degrades urea in the stomach, producing carbon dioxide (CO (2)), which is then exhaled and&#xD;
      can be detected in the lungs. Mycobacterium tuberculosis like H. pylori possesses a urease&#xD;
      enzyme, which converts urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia. In a preclinical study, Jassal and&#xD;
      colleagues demonstrated that TB-infected rabbits convert [(13)C]-labeled urea into&#xD;
      [(13)C]-carbon dioxide ((13)CO(2)) in a matter of minutes. The (13)CO(2) in exhaled breath&#xD;
      could be rapidly detected with an isotopic ratio mass spectrometer or a small ultraviolet&#xD;
      (UV) absorbance spectrometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the current study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      UBT in the diagnosis and treatment response of pulmonary TB. Secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      assess the specificity of UBT for M. tuberculosis (UBT-TB) diagnosis in volunteers with and&#xD;
      without H. pylori infection, examine the benefit of bismuth to make UBT-TB more specific for&#xD;
      M. tuberculosis, and evaluate the correlation of the labeled (13)CO(2) signal with sputum&#xD;
      colony forming unit (CFU) counts and the lower limit of signal detection versus CFU counts.&#xD;
