      SPLIT-THICKNESS SKIN GRAFT TAKE AND MICROBIOLOGICAL EVALUATION IN BURNED PATIENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION: Infection is cause of increased morbidity and mortality in burn patients, and&#xD;
      its control is a major challenge also for skin graft integration. Wound and soft tissue&#xD;
      infection rates are higher than microbiological diagnosis rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: To evaluate partial skin graft integration in relation to microbiological analysis&#xD;
      of wounds in burn patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This project will be a transversal, prospective, analytical, controlled study in&#xD;
      humans, conducted in a single center, at Burn Care Unit of Department of Plastic Surgery at&#xD;
      Federal University of São Paulo from October, 2010 to October, 2011. Data will be collected&#xD;
      to characterize demographic and clinical aspects. Data analysis will be performed using&#xD;
      Student's t-test and Friedman analysis of variance.&#xD;

      SPLIT-THICKNESS SKIN GRAFT TAKE AND MICROBIOLOGICAL EVALUATION IN BURNED PATIENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION: Early excision and partial skin graft is state-of-the-art in burns treatment.&#xD;
      Otherwise, infection is cause of increased morbidity and mortality in burn patients, and its&#xD;
      control is a major challenge also for skin graft integration. Wound and soft tissue infection&#xD;
      rates are higher than microbiological diagnosis rates. This difference is related to moderate&#xD;
      sensibility of cultures in general. Precise bacterial diagnostic and its susceptibility to&#xD;
      specific antibiotics are prerequisite for adequate treatment of burn patients and skin graft&#xD;
      integration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: To evaluate partial skin graft integration in relation to microbiological analysis&#xD;
      of wounds in burn patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This project was approved at Ethics Committee at Federal University of São Paulo&#xD;
      (1272/10). It will be a transversal, prospective, analytical, controlled study in humans,&#xD;
      conducted in a single center, at Burn Care Unit of Department of Plastic Surgery at Federal&#xD;
      University of São Paulo from October, 2010 to October, 2011. Thirty patients will be included&#xD;
      in this study after reading and signing a consent form. Data will be collected using an&#xD;
      evaluation sheet to characterize demographic and clinical aspects, including partial skin&#xD;
      graft integration, use of topical and systemic antibiotics and infection rates in all sites&#xD;
      (blood, urine, skin, tracheal aspirate and bronchial lavage). Data analysis will be performed&#xD;
      using Student's t-test and Friedman analysis of variance.&#xD;
