  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if participation in one of three different health&#xD;
      management groups will elicit genomic and biochemical changes and decrease perceived stress&#xD;
      levels and symptoms in healthy, stressed adults. The investigators expect that changes in&#xD;
      self-reported psychological stress and symptoms will be directly linked to changes in&#xD;
      biological indicators (genomic expression profiles and neuroendocrine and pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers).&#xD;

      This randomized, controlled trial will determine the relative strength of correlation between&#xD;
      changes in stress outcome measures (self-report questionnaire, genomic expression,&#xD;
      biochemical assay) in moderately to severely stressed healthy subjects randomized to one of&#xD;
      three health education interventions at both end-intervention and at a 6-month long-term&#xD;
      follow-up. This study will also determine which of the different outcome measures exhibit the&#xD;
      greatest degree of sensitivity, reliability and consistency at both end-intervention and&#xD;
      long-term follow-up.&#xD;
