  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study is to test a combination of low dose local anesthetic&#xD;
      Bupivacaine diluted in patient's CSF with lipophilic opiate Fentanyl for optimal spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia during Cesarean Section. The dilution of Bupivacaine with CSF in our study would&#xD;
      result in effective spinal anesthesia with relatively limited motor block, quick recovery of&#xD;
      motor function and relatively long lasting analgesia. We expect lower incidence of side&#xD;
      effects with this combination than with convenient dose of Bupivacaine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia is the most frequent type of anesthesia used for Cesarian Section. However,&#xD;
      despite decades of safe utilization there is still controversy about the best combination of&#xD;
      local anesthetics and additives needed to obtain the optimal result. The objectives of this&#xD;
      study is to test a combination of low dose local anesthetic Bupivacaine diluted in patient's&#xD;
      CSF with lipophilic opiate Fentanyl for compliance with the criteria of optimal spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia. Bupivacaine is the most frequently used local anesthetic in the last twenty years&#xD;
      . It characterized by fast onset, high potency and long action . Albeit this is intrinsic&#xD;
      characteristic of specific local anesthetic, its manifestation can be affected by&#xD;
      concentration. It has been shown that dilution of local anesthetic with CSF can result in&#xD;
      sensory block with less profound motor block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus dilution of Bupivacaine with CSF in our study would serve double function: it would&#xD;
      speed the recovery from the spinal anesthesia and minimize the expression of the motor&#xD;
      block.Addition of opiates to local anesthetics has been widely used . It has been shown that&#xD;
      this addition improves quality of spinal anesthesia and prolongs analgesia without&#xD;
      significant prolongation of recovery from motor block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, we would use well known safe local anesthetic Bupivacaine in low dose and low&#xD;
      concentration (after dilution with patient's CSF) in conjunction with highly lipophilic&#xD;
      opiate Fentanyl. We suppose it will result in effective spinal anesthesia with relatively&#xD;
      limited motor block, quick recovery of motor function and relatively long lasting analgesia.&#xD;
      We expect lower incidence of side effect with this combination than with convenient dose of&#xD;
      Bupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good pain relief and swift restoration of ability to ambulate will be important for&#xD;
      prevention of postoperative complications, will diminish the need for systemic analgetic&#xD;
      drugs that can affect nursing and will increase patients' satisfaction.&#xD;
