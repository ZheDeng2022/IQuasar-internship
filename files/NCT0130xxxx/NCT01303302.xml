      Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of gastric contractility modulation (GCM) stimulation&#xD;
      using the TANTALUS System in the improvement of glycemic control measured by changes in&#xD;
      HbA1c. Effects of GCM on weight loss and associated co-morbid conditions will also be&#xD;
      evaluated&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, single blind, randomized, cross-over study. Subject enrollment will&#xD;
      continue until forty (40) eligible participants have been randomized into one of the two&#xD;
      groups. Subjects will undergo baseline valuation (Visit 1) during which the stability of&#xD;
      their glycemic parameters, medical treatment and medical condition will be assessed. Subjects&#xD;
      meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria at Visit 2 will be implanted. Approximately three&#xD;
      days prior to their implantation, subjects will be seen for their 'pre-implant' medical&#xD;
      evaluation (Visit 3). One week after implant (Visit 5, Week 1)subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      into one of two groups (A and B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Group A&quot; subjects will have their device programmed to deliver GCM signal including the&#xD;
      setting of automatic eating detection parameters for the first 24 week period (Period 1). At&#xD;
      Visit 10, (week 25 and end of Period 1), Group A subjects will have their devices turned&#xD;
      &quot;OFF&quot; for the next 24 weeks period (Period 2). At Visit 15, (week 49 and end of Period 2),&#xD;
      Group A subjects will have their devices turned &quot;On&quot; for the next 24 weeks period (Period 3)&#xD;
      &quot;Group B&quot; subjects will not have their device activated for the first 24 weeks (Period 1) of&#xD;
      their study. At Visit 10 (week 25 end of Period 1), Group B subjects devices will have their&#xD;
      device turned &quot;ON&quot; (i.e. activated to deliver CGM signals) for the 24 weeks period (Period&#xD;
      2). At Visit 15, (week 49 and end of Period 2), Group B subjects will have their devices&#xD;
      turned &quot;OFF&quot; for the next 24 weeks period (Period 3).&#xD;
