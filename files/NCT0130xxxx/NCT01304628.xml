  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate if single subcutaneous (SC) doses of PL-3994,&#xD;
      administered to patients with asthma can achieve a clinically meaningful increase in&#xD;
      pulmonary function (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second: FEV1) while maintaining an&#xD;
      acceptable safety profile. The study will characterize the bronchodilator effect, dose and&#xD;
      safety of PL-3994 in a population of moderately severe, stable asthmatics following overnight&#xD;
      withdrawal of beta-2 agonists.&#xD;
