      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Varenicline (Chantix ) is a drug that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      to help people stop smoking. Varenicline is very effective in helping some people quit&#xD;
      smoking, but is less effective for others. Researchers are interested in conducting more&#xD;
      in-depth studies into how varenicline works, including its effect on smokers' responses to&#xD;
      items that may trigger cigarette cravings, in order to develop better smoking cessation&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To examine the effectiveness of varenicline as an effective medication for tobacco&#xD;
      addiction by studying its effect on nicotine reinforcement, nicotine-seeking behavior,&#xD;
      cue-elicited craving, and performance impairment and craving after overnight tobacco&#xD;
      deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who have been smoking at least 10 cigarettes per&#xD;
      day for at least 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will require 12 study visits. Some visits will be brief and other visits that&#xD;
           involve test sessions will last up to 8 hours. If no sessions are repeated, the study&#xD;
           will take 26 days. Participants will not be required to attempt to quit smoking during&#xD;
           this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full physical examination and medical history,&#xD;
           blood and urine tests, and other tests as required by the study researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take two sets of pills during the study: the first set during the&#xD;
           first 12 days of the study, followed by a 2-day break, then the second set during the&#xD;
           last 12 days. Some of the pills will contain varenicline, and others will be placebos.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 of the study, participants will come to the National Institute on Drug Abuse to&#xD;
           receive the first set of pills. Participants will take the first pill before leaving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 8, participants will have a training session that will measure the amount of&#xD;
           carbon monoxide in the breath. Participants will also complete several questionnaires&#xD;
           about smoking habits and current mood, and will have a chance to practice the procedures&#xD;
           they will do in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Days 9 and 10, participants will have behavioral test sessions that will last 7 to 8&#xD;
           hours. Day 9 will involve tests of cue response to items that may trigger cigarette&#xD;
           cravings, and tests of general nicotine cravings over several hours. Day 10 will involve&#xD;
           tests of general nicotine cravings over several hours, and then tests of&#xD;
           nicotine-seeking behavior. Participants will be provided with lunch during these all-day&#xD;
           sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 11, participants will have memory and attention tests, and will provide a blood&#xD;
           sample. Participants will not be allowed to smoke for 12 hours before the start of the&#xD;
           next test on Day 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 12, participants will provide a breath sample, and will have two sets of memory&#xD;
           and attention tests before they will be permitted to start smoking again. There will be&#xD;
           no tests on Days 13 and 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Starting on Day 15, participants will repeat the schedule of tests from Days 1 through&#xD;
           12 with the second set of pills.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine several potential mechanisms by which varenicline functions as an effective&#xD;
           medication for tobacco addiction: a) nicotine reinforcement (forced-choice procedure),&#xD;
           b) nicotine-seeking behavior (operant response task), c) cue-elicited craving, and d)&#xD;
           performance impairment and craving after overnight tobacco deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To validate our laboratory measures by using a medication with known efficacy in the&#xD;
           treatment of tobacco addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 50 healthy adult smokers to attain 25 completers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a placebo-controlled, crossover design comparing the effects of varenicline and&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      During cue-reactivity sessions, primary measures include tobacco craving, mood, and autonomic&#xD;
      responsivity (heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance, and skin temperature). During&#xD;
      forced-choice sessions, the primary measure is the percentage of nicotine cigarette puffs&#xD;
      chosen during choice trials. During operant response sessions, primary measures include&#xD;
      breakpoint (final ratio completed), total number of responses, and number of cigarette puffs&#xD;
      earned and taken. During the tobacco deprivation session, primary measures include&#xD;
      self-reported withdrawal, tobacco craving, mood, and cognitive task performance (accuracy and&#xD;
      response time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study measures include baseline demographic and smoking history, level of nicotine&#xD;
      dependence, tobacco craving, and mood.&#xD;
