    <measure>Symptoms and Complaints</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms/complaints were assessed on a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 denoting unfavorable symptoms/complaints. Symptoms/complaints were recorded at each post-dispensing visit based on the subject's experience with the study lens worn prior to the visit. The symptoms/complaints parameters were: Burning/stinging upon insertion; Comfort upon insertion, Overall comfort, and Comfort at the end of the day; Ease of handling/insertion, and Ease of handling/removal; Dryness; Itchiness; Redness; Vision; Lens cleanliness; and Overall impression.</description>

    <description>Graded slit lamp findings for each eye, including epithelial edema, epithelial microcysts, corneal staining, limbal and bulbar injections, upper lid tarsal conjunctival abnormalities, corneal neovascularization, and corneal infiltrates were graded for severity on a scale from 0 (No Finding) to 4 (Severe Finding). The outcome measure is any finding &gt; grade 2, across abnormalities.</description>

             disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be adapted lens wearers, wear a lens in each eye and each lens must be&#xD;
             of the same manufacture and brand.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be myopic and require lens correction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be habitual wearers of toric soft contact lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any systemic disease currently affecting ocular health or which in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion may have an effect on ocular health during the course of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects using any systemic or topical medications that will, in the Investigator's&#xD;
             opinion, affect ocular physiology or lens performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an active ocular disease or who are using any ocular medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any grade 2 or greater finding during the slit lamp examination.&#xD;
             Subjects with corneal infiltrates, of ANY GRADE, are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any &quot;Present&quot; finding during the slit lamp examination that, in the&#xD;
             Investigator's judgment, interferes with contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are allergic to any component in the study care products.&#xD;

          <description>Symptoms/complaints were assessed on a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 denoting unfavorable symptoms/complaints. Symptoms/complaints were recorded at each post-dispensing visit based on the subject's experience with the study lens worn prior to the visit. The symptoms/complaints parameters were: Burning/stinging upon insertion; Comfort upon insertion, Overall comfort, and Comfort at the end of the day; Ease of handling/insertion, and Ease of handling/removal; Dryness; Itchiness; Redness; Vision; Lens cleanliness; and Overall impression.</description>
