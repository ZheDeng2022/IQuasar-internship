      N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is a surrogate neuronal marker and its proton magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy (1H MRS) signal decreases with increasing neuronal mortality associated with&#xD;
      cerebral hypoxia-ischaemia. The MRS lactate (Lac)/NAA peak-area ratio increases during and&#xD;
      after severe cerebral hypoxia-ischaemia reflecting mitochondrial injury and impaired&#xD;
      oxidative phosphorylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: (1) To establish normative ranges for thalamic 1H MRS NAA concentration and Lac/NAA in&#xD;
      healthy newborn infants (2) To examine the accuracies of thalamic 1H MRS NAA concentration&#xD;
      and Lac/NAA for predicting adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in neonatal encephalopathy (NE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective observational study Methods: Year 1: Following 1H MRS methodology&#xD;
      optimisation 40 healthy control infants will be recruited to collect normative data. Year 2&#xD;
      to 3: 115 infants with NE, undergoing therapeutic hypothermia will be recruited. MRS will be&#xD;
      performed aged less than 4 days and 7 to 14 days and thalamic NAA levels and Lac/NAA will be&#xD;
      quantified; Qualitative interviews to evaluate parental understanding of this biomarker. Year&#xD;
      4, 5: Outcome assessment by BSID III at 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Mean thalamic NAA levels and Lac/NAA and appropriate confidence intervals in normal&#xD;
      infants, and thalamic NAA levels and Lac/NAA in infants with NE according to&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome. Areas under curves for thalamic NAA and Lac/NAA will be examined&#xD;
      separately for early &amp; late MRS. Accuracy of early MRS will inform utility of this&#xD;
      investigation in decisions about withdrawal of life support; late MRS will inform about&#xD;
      efficacy as a surrogate end point in clinical trials. Qualitative interviews will be&#xD;
      thematically analysed and reported.&#xD;

      2. 1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To examine the accuracy of 1H MRS thalamic [NAA] for predicting&#xD;
      adverse neurodevelopment in infants with NE undergoing therapeutic hypothermia&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVE 2.2.1 To examine inter and intra-center variability of thalamic [NAA]&#xD;
      levels in healthy adult volunteers 2.2.2 To further develop normative ranges for 1H MRS&#xD;
      thalamic [NAA] and other quantitative measures of potential utility in healthy term newborn&#xD;
      infants 2.2.3 To compare the prognostic accuracy of 1H MRS thalamic [NAA] and other MRS&#xD;
      quantities with that of the Lactate/NAA peak-area ratio acquired early (aged ≤ 4 days) and&#xD;
      with that acquired late (aged 5 to 14 days) 2.2.4 To examine parental attitudes towards MR&#xD;
      use in decisions about withdrawal of life support and counselling about long term outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. METHODS Prospective observational study; the index test (1H MRS) and gold-standard test&#xD;
      (neurological outcome at 18 months) will be performed independently and blinded to each&#xD;
      other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Recruitment Control infants will be recruited from the postnatal wards at the&#xD;
      participating hospitals. The MR scans will be performed before the infant is first discharged&#xD;
      from hospital as far as possible (for example following a Caesarean delivery) i.e. within the&#xD;
      first week of life. A lead research midwife will be identified in each of the participating&#xD;
      hospitals who will approach the parents for recruitment and informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NE infants will be recruited from neonatal intensive care units. MR scans will be performed&#xD;
      twice after informed parental consent. The first scan at less than 4 days of age (if&#xD;
      clinically feasible) and the second scan between 5 to 14 days of age. The first scan will be&#xD;
      performed while the infant is still in the intensive care unit at the participating centre.&#xD;
      At the time of the second MR scan, it is likely most babies would be off the ventilator.&#xD;
      Sedation would be used if required in these babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Neurodevelopmental evaluation Neurodevelopmental outcomes will be assessed at 18 months&#xD;
      of age using Bayley Scale of Infant Development® (Version 3) blinded to the MRS information.&#xD;
      Favourable outcome will be defined as survival without disability, no disability being&#xD;
      defined as all of: developmental quotient (DQ) &gt;84 (BSID III), no neuromotor impairment&#xD;
      (neurological exam score ≥73 and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) ≤I) [19],&#xD;
      and normal vision and hearing on clinical examination. Unfavourable outcome will be defined&#xD;
      as death or, in survivors, moderate or severe disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Post-mortem evaluation If the infant dies (UCH cases only), parents will be given options&#xD;
      of conventional autopsy or minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) at Great Ormond Street Hospital&#xD;
      (GOSH) using the protocol established for the MaRIAS (Magnetic Resonance Imaging Autopsy&#xD;
      Study)[20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6 Qualitative interviews About 6 months after death or discharge a parental sub group from&#xD;
      20 NE cases recruited by stratified purposeful sampling from Royal Victoria Infirmary&#xD;
      (Newcastle) will be invited to participate in an interview by a psychology Research Fellow.&#xD;
      The parental understanding of, and attitudes towards use of, MR techniques for predicting&#xD;
      long term outcomes and making decisions about withdrawal of life support (during hospital&#xD;
      stay), will be collected thematically and analysed (aim 2.2.3). Tape recorded transcripts of&#xD;
      parental interviews will be analysed and emerging themes grouped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. ENDPOINTS AND DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      1H MRS thalamic [NAA] (mean (SD); mmol/kg wet weight brain tissue) in NE infants will be&#xD;
      compared with outcome. Sensitivity and specificity with 95% CI and area under the curve&#xD;
      (Standard Error) will be reported for [NAA] and Lac/NAA peak-area ratio and the clinical&#xD;
      significances of unit changes in these measures in terms of unit changes in motor and&#xD;
      cognitive outcome scores examined. The prognostic accuracy of early acquisition 1H MRS will&#xD;
      be compared with late acquisition using area under curve and diagnostic odds ratios. The&#xD;
      accuracy of [NAA] for prediction of outcome will be compared with conventional MRI. 1H MRS&#xD;
      thalamic [NAA] (mean (SD)) in healthy term infants will be reported.&#xD;
