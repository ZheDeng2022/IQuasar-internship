    <textblock>
      The T and B cells repertoire diversity represent one of the immune defence level which&#xD;
      controls the integrity of the organism and determines its ability to recognize and control&#xD;
      infectious attacks and development of tumours. The study of the lymphocytes TCR and BCR&#xD;
      diversity could permit to better understand how lymphopenia act on overall survival and to&#xD;
      improve detection of high risk patients who could benefit of adapted therapies for better&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The therapeutic management recommendations of patients with metastatic cancer offer standard&#xD;
      treatment in specific situations. But, there is always a subgroup of patients who do not&#xD;
      benefit from treatment and which has a very low survival. The risk of death for patients is&#xD;
      very variable depending on the initial cancer site, tumor aggressiveness and chemosensitivity&#xD;
      of tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's therefore important to have relevant prognostic tools to predict such an excess of&#xD;
      relative toxicity or drug resistance. Simple prognostic factors for survival as the&#xD;
      performance status (PS) have already been highlighted in several studies. Thus, the&#xD;
      possibility to identify a group of patients with a higher risk of mortality could be of major&#xD;
      interest for clinicians. In fact such stratification will allow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To limit this risk by adjusting the therapy and/or associated treatments (antibiotic&#xD;
           prophylaxis, dose reduction ...),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop protocols for testing innovative strategies specific to this high risk&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of these innovative protocols would be designed to correct lymphodivpenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to show that T divpenia (low TCR combinatorial diversity &lt;30%) is a&#xD;
      risk factor for early death after chemotherapy (early death: any death occurring within 3&#xD;
      months (lung cancer) or within 6 months (breast cancer) after the start of chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish that the divpenia factor is independent of clinical and biological&#xD;
           prognostic factors (PS, LDH, haemoglobin, lymphopenia or ANC) to predict a early death,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish that the prognostic score NDL which will combine in a two-dimensional graph&#xD;
           the CD4 count or total lymphocytes count and TCR repertoire diversity will allow a&#xD;
           better stratification of lympho-divpenic patients who will benefit from more appropriate&#xD;
           treatments,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize other circulating markers this could improve the identification of the&#xD;
           early death risk (phenotypic markers, cytokines ...) in combination with the previous&#xD;
           settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognostic models have been established in many tumor types at the initial stage or at time&#xD;
      of the relapse (breast and lung cancers ...). It seems necessary to highlight other clinical&#xD;
      and biological prognostic factors that would estimate a lower survival at 6 months, whatever&#xD;
      the nature or the original site of the tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strong prognostic value of lymphopenia in the early death after chemotherapy or&#xD;
      hematologic toxicity of chemotherapy has recently been established in several tumor models.&#xD;
      25% of patients with metastatic solid cancers have a systemic immune dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further analysis incorporating prior any treatment (D0) a systematic phenotypic analysis of&#xD;
      lymphocyte subpopulations in the patients' blood showed that a significant reduction in the&#xD;
      absolute number of peripheral CD4+ T cells (&lt;450/μl) was an independent factor risk of early&#xD;
      death and febrile neutropenia in patients with solid cancers of different origin (lymphoma,&#xD;
      myeloma, sarcoma, breast cancer) treated with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, early death remains rare events and a more recent study has established that a&#xD;
      lymphopenia (&lt;1000 lymphocytes/µl) was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival&#xD;
      in patients with solid tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown the importance of combinatorial diversity of T and B lymphocytes&#xD;
      repertoire (TCR/BCR) in the efficiency of the immune response against infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preliminary analysis of TCR repertoire diversity, in a retrospective cohort of patients&#xD;
      with metastatic breast cancer, demonstrated the independent predictive value of divpenia for&#xD;
      overall survival in these patients. This research has demonstrated that patients with cancer&#xD;
      had a very large disparity in immune TCR diversity and that it was not always correlated with&#xD;
      lymphocyte count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These preliminary data show that the discriminating power of TCR diversity is greater than&#xD;
      the measurement of cell count. The combined analysis of these data in a NDL® graph may help&#xD;
      to better discriminate patients at risk for which it is necessary to develop new therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
