    <textblock>
      To compare, in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, the effects of IMM-101 in&#xD;
      combination with gemcitabine to gemcitabine alone on safety and tolerability (including QoL),&#xD;
      clinical signs and symptoms of disease, selected markers of tumour burden and immunological&#xD;
      status, and disease outcome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the IMM 101 treated group received an initial dose of IMM-101 followed by a&#xD;
      maximum of 12 cycles of Gemcitabine (plus IMM-101); patients in the control group received&#xD;
      Gemcitabine alone. All patients were to receive Gemcitabine once weekly for 3 consecutive&#xD;
      weeks out of every 4 weeks. Patients in the IMM 101 treated group were to receive IMM 101&#xD;
      every 2 weeks for the first 3 doses, followed by a 4 week rest, then IMM-101 every 2 weeks&#xD;
      for the next 3 doses. After this time, patients received doses every 4 weeks. Gemcitabine&#xD;
      treatment began at least 14 days after the first dose of IMM-101 in the IMM 101 treated&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who completed the Main Study and who provided informed consent were eligible to&#xD;
      participate in a long term treatment Sub-Study. All patients received IMM-101 in the&#xD;
      open-label, single arm, Sub-Study irrespective of whether they had been randomised to&#xD;
      Gemcitabine or Gemcitabine plus IMM-101 in the main study.&#xD;

    <measure>Safety and Tolerability.</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of Informed Consent to 30 days post last dose of study medication</time_frame>
    <description>A clinically relevant deleterious effect of IMM-101 on safety and tolerability profiles was judged by:&#xD;
Local and systemic toxicities.&#xD;
Number, type and degree of toxicities as measured by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0.&#xD;
Adverse events were collected from time of Informed Consent to 30 days post last dose of study medication IMM-101 does not appear to confer an incremental safety burden beyond that associated with chemotherapy and the disease itself. No new safety signals were identified from this study. The numbers of SAEs by preferred term were low, such that no trends could be inferred from these data and no significant SAEs attributable to IMM 101 were observed.</description>

          <title>Gemcitabine Plus IMM-101</title>
          <description>Patients in the experimental arm received IMM-101 in addition to Gemcitabine (Gem). The treatment regimen with IMM-101 was every 2 weeks for the first 3 doses followed by a rest of 4 weeks then every 2 weeks for the next 3 doses followed by every 4 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
For patients in the experimental group, GEM was initiated at least 14 days after first dose of IMM-101.&#xD;
GEM plus IMM-101 was offered until intolerable toxicity or withdrawal from the study up to a maximum of 12 cycles (i.e. approximately 48 weeks).&#xD;
IMM-101: IMM-101 is a suspension of heat-killed whole cell M. obuense in borate-buffered saline.&#xD;
A single 0.1 mL intradermal injection of IMM-101 (10 mg/mL)will be administered every 2 weeks for the first 3 doses followed by a rest of 4 weeks then every 2 weeks for the next 3 doses followed by every 4 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
Chemotherapy plus IMM-101 will be offered until intolerable toxicity or withdrawal from the study up to a maximum of 12 cycles of GEM.&#xD;
Patients who completed the Main Study and who provided informed consent were eligible to participate in a long term treatment Sub-Study where all patients received IMM-101.</description>

          <title>Gemcitabine Monotherapy</title>
          <description>Patients in the control arm received normal standard of care - up to 12 cycles of Gemcitabine. Dosing of Gemcitabine was as per the normal prescribing information for pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
Gemcitabine was administered intravenously at 1000 mg/m2 over 30 minutes once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks out of every 4 weeks until intolerable toxicity or withdrawal from the study up to a maximum of 12 cycles (i.e. approximately 48 weeks).&#xD;
Dosage reduction with each cycle or within each cycle was applied based upon the grade of Gemcitabine-related toxicity experienced by the patient using centre's standard protocol.&#xD;
Patients who completed the Main Study and who provided informed consent were eligible to participate in a long term treatment Sub-Study where all patients received IMM-101.</description>

Number, type and degree of toxicities as measured by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0.&#xD;
Adverse events were collected from time of Informed Consent to 30 days post last dose of study medication IMM-101 does not appear to confer an incremental safety burden beyond that associated with chemotherapy and the disease itself. No new safety signals were identified from this study.

    <limitations_and_caveats>This proof of concept study was not formally sized to test a specific pre-defined efficacy hypothesis. However, it has provided important insights into the potential for efficacy improvements with the use of IMM-101 in combination with chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
Safety assessment based on AE &amp; SAE profiles in each treatment arm had limitations as GEM is associated with frequent AEs and was given in both treatment arms. Thus, assessment of causality was difficult to interpret.</limitations_and_caveats>
