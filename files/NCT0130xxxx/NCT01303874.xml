      TRIAL DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Description This is a 18-month, double-blind, randomized, multicentre, outpatient study.&#xD;
           The approximate duration of subject participation will be 18 months and the approximate&#xD;
           total duration of the study will be 42 months. The duration of subject enrollment will&#xD;
           be approximately 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Discussion of Trial Design The study is designed to directly compare the effectiveness&#xD;
           of combination therapy with MTX + ETN versus&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Principal research question/objective To determine the number of patients in clinical&#xD;
           remission at 12 months of follow-up, as defined as the absence of symptoms and signs of&#xD;
           inflammatory arthritis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early arthritis is frequently undifferentiated. It is well recognised that a substantial&#xD;
      proportion of patients with an undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis will go on to develop&#xD;
      persistent synovitis, with the strongest predictor of persistence being disease duration &gt; 12&#xD;
      weeks (1-4). Studies have shown that patients with early oligoarthritis who fail to respond&#xD;
      within 2 weeks to corticosteroid injections have a high likelihood of persistent disease (2).&#xD;
      It is therefore clear that these patients with early inflammatory arthritis need definitive&#xD;
      treatment, but the optimal therapeutic strategy is yet to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal&#xD;
      inflammatory and immune responses. It plays an important role in the inflammatory process of&#xD;
      rheumatoid and other arthritis, and the resulting joint pathology. Elevated levels of TNF are&#xD;
      found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA. Two distinct receptors for TNF exist&#xD;
      naturally as monomeric molecules on the cell surfaces and in soluble forms. Biological&#xD;
      activity of TNF is dependent upon binding to either cell surface TNF receptors (TNFR).&#xD;
      Etanercept (ETN) is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the p75 TNFR linked to the Fc&#xD;
      portion of human IgG1, and is capable of binding two TNF molecules. Etanercept inhibits&#xD;
      binding of both TNF-alpha and TNF-beta to cell surface TNFRs, rendering TNF biologically&#xD;
      inactive. Agents that block TNF are effective in all types of arthritis (with the exclusion&#xD;
      of connective tissue diseases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is generally agreed that there is a window of opportunity in active early inflammatory&#xD;
      arthritis in which definitive treatment may give a disproportionate improvement compared to&#xD;
      treatment at a later time, and may well be able to induce remission in a subgroup of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in early rheumatoid arthritis (&lt; 12 months) have shown that remission-induction with&#xD;
      the TNF-antagonist infliximab provides a significant reduction in MRI-evidence of synovitis&#xD;
      and erosions at 12 months with evidence of sustained functional and quality of life benefits&#xD;
      at 2 years, despite withdrawal of infliximab at 12 months (5). Results from the TEMPO study&#xD;
      show that treatment of established rheumatoid arthritis with ETN+MTX achieves remission in&#xD;
      about 40% patients (6). TNF antagonists also have the therapeutic benefit of rapid and&#xD;
      sustained suppression of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of patients with early undifferentiated arthritis with ETN+MTX is hypothesised to&#xD;
      prevent progression of persistent disabling disease in a significant number of patients.&#xD;
      Induction of remission at this time in the disease course may result in sustained remission,&#xD;
      reduce the need for further treatment, and be most cost effective therapeutic strategy.&#xD;
