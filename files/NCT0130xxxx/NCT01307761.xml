      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some sonographic appearance can help in selection of the correct thyroid nodes to aspirate&#xD;
      with US(ultrasound)-guided FNA(fine needle aspiration) biopsy. Findings suggestive for&#xD;
      malignant thyroid cancer include micro-calcification, blurred margins, intra-nodular vascular&#xD;
      pattern, marked hypoechogenicity or taller-than-wide shape.1-3 However, no single criteria&#xD;
      can perfectly predict malignant thyroid nodules. Applied multiple US criteria for the&#xD;
      differentiation of thyroid nodule has an overall accuracy ranging from 59.5 to 73.4%.3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our study is to retrospectively evaluate the predictors of malignant thyroid&#xD;
      nodules and established an useful scoring system based on sonographic findings and&#xD;
      demographic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted according to the principle of Helsinki declaration and the&#xD;
      guidelines of the institutional ethical committee. We want to retrospectively review the&#xD;
      medical records of 479 nodules which underwent head and neck ultrasound(US) examination and&#xD;
      US-FNA cytology from 2007 July to 2010 Dec at Department of Otolaryngology, Far Eastern&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. No patient included in this series had a previous&#xD;
      diagnosis of thyroid malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment for US studies consisted of a color Doppler US unit (Philips HDI 5000, Bothell, WA)&#xD;
      and a 5-12 MHz broadband linear array transducer. Nodules were measured with AP and&#xD;
      transverse (T) diameters in transverse section. Settings of power Doppler sonography were set&#xD;
      for high sensitivity with a low wall filter to allow detection of vessels with low blood&#xD;
      flow. The color gain was increased until background noise appeared and then reduced until the&#xD;
      noise was suppressed, thus ensuring maximum sensitivity according to Bude and Rubin's&#xD;
      description.4 The vascularity types are classified as avascular, peripheral and intra-nodule&#xD;
      types1,5. The echo structure (predominantly solid or cyst), internal echo (homogeneous or&#xD;
      heterogenicity), echogenicity (hyperechoic, isoechoic, hypoechoic), presented&#xD;
      micro-calcification, and characteristics of nodule margin (well-defined or ill defined) were&#xD;
      assessed. Thyroid incidentalomas are thyroid nodules without clinically apparent tumor but&#xD;
      are incidentally found by US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US-FNA was carried out with the array probe guiding the placement of a 22-gauge fine needle&#xD;
      after informed consent was obtained. The final diagnosis of a lesion as benign (n=449) or&#xD;
      malignancy (n=30) was confirmed by FNA biopsy. The relationship between demographic data,&#xD;
      sonographic features and final diagnosis, i.e. benign or malignant disease was analyzed in&#xD;
      all 479 nodules. In univariate analysis, Chi-square test or Fisher exact test was performed&#xD;
      to compare for categorical variables, and student t- test for continuous variables. A&#xD;
      stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to identify significant&#xD;
      independent variables for prophesying malignant nodal disease. The level of significance was&#xD;
      set at p &lt; 0.05. The predictive formula was based on multivariate logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis and programmed into a real-time, computerized sonographic reporting system.&#xD;
      Hosmer-Lemeshow test6 was carried out to verify the significance of the prediction model. The&#xD;
      association between prediction score and malignant nodal disease was analyzed using the&#xD;
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. An optimal cutoff point was determined at the&#xD;
      point of greatest &quot;sensitivity&quot; with the corresponding smallest &quot;1-specificity&quot;.7 The c-value&#xD;
      as a measure for the area under the curve represented the diagnostic accuracy of the model.8&#xD;
      All statistical analyses were accomplished using SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute,&#xD;
      Inc, Cary, North Carolina).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results: A simple and practical sonographic scoring system would be built to provide&#xD;
      the physician prompt and reliable probability guidance for FNA cytology while managing&#xD;
      thyroid nodule.&#xD;
