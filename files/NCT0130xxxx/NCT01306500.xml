  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the role of gastric lavage in preventing feeding&#xD;
      problems in babies born through meconium stained amniotic fluid. It is a routine practice in&#xD;
      many hospitals to perform gastric lavage in all babies born with meconium stained amniotic&#xD;
      fluid after stabilisation without any supporting evidence. It is believed that meconium is an&#xD;
      irritant and its presence in stomach causes gastritis and vomiting and hence the basis for&#xD;
      this practice. Orogastric tube insertion and subsequent gastric lavage is not without&#xD;
      complications. Potential complications will be prevented and health resources will be saved&#xD;
      if this procedure is not proven to be beneficial. Therefore the investigators decided to&#xD;
      study if gastric lavage reduces incidence of vomiting and other feeding difficulties as well&#xD;
      as incidence of respiratory difficulties in babies born with MSAF.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meconium passage in newborn infants is a developmentally programmed event normally occurring&#xD;
      within first 24-48 hours of birth. The meconium staining of amniotic fluid occurs in 12% of&#xD;
      all live births per annuum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The routine use of gastric lavage in MSAF babies has been advocated for a long time as a part&#xD;
      of the conventional treatment. Meconium in stomach is hypothesized to act as an irritant and&#xD;
      cause vomiting and retching. Surprisingly this recommendation is also made in some textbooks&#xD;
      without supporting evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orogastric tube insertion and subsequent gastric lavage can cause complications like&#xD;
      bradycardia, apnea, vomiting, trauma, aspiration and esophageal or gastric perforations. Some&#xD;
      researchers have found that gastric suction done at birth is associated with long term risk&#xD;
      for functional intestinal disorder. The sequence of prefeeding behaviour is disrupted in&#xD;
      children who undergo gastric suction and it can delay initiation of breast feeding. Small&#xD;
      elevation in mean arterial blood pressure, increased retching have also been reported The&#xD;
      role of gastric lavage in preventing feeding problems and secondary meconium aspiration&#xD;
      syndrome has not been systematically evaluated. If this procedure is not proven to be&#xD;
      beneficial it will prevent potential complications which may arise due to it in a significant&#xD;
      number of babies. Also in a resource limited country the cost of materials required and time&#xD;
      of medical personnel will be saved. Hence the purpose of this prospective randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial is to compare the incidence of feeding problems and secondary meconium&#xD;
      aspiration syndrome, in gastric lavage group vs no lavage group.&#xD;
