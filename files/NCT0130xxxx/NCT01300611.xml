  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of TXA127 on neutrophil and platelet&#xD;
      counts in adult patients who have undergone a double cord blood transplant. The study will&#xD;
      also evaluate the effect of TXA127 on chemotherapy-induced mucositis, an inflammation of the&#xD;
      mucous membranes in the digestive tract (mouth to anus) and immune reconstitution which helps&#xD;
      patients fight infections. For patients undergoing CBT, both neutrophil and platelet&#xD;
      normalization and immune reconstitution can be delayed. TXA127 has shown to be well tolerated&#xD;
      by patients and appears to induce a rapid production of neutrophils and platelets in the&#xD;
      bloodstream as well as increase the immune system components. It has also been shown to&#xD;
      reduce the severity of chemotherapy-induced mucositis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cord blood as a hematopoietic stem cell source has multiple advantages. Cord blood is&#xD;
      normally discarded at birth and can easily be collected and stored. Availability of numerous&#xD;
      CB banks has resulted in genetically diverse CB units including those from non-Caucasians.&#xD;
      Once a suitable CB unit is located, confirmatory typing can be quickly performed and a donor&#xD;
      unit can be shipped to the transplant center. Furthermore, because a CB graft results in a&#xD;
      lower incidence of graft-versus-host-disease, one or two antigen-mismatched units are&#xD;
      acceptable for transplantation. Despite these advantages, CB has a significant drawback which&#xD;
      is that the number of hematopoietic stem cells obtained from a unit of CB is significantly&#xD;
      lower than from a bone marrow (BM) harvest or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest. Both&#xD;
      engraftment and immune reconstitution are delayed in patients undergoing CB transplant.&#xD;
      TXA127 is pharmaceutically-formulated angiotensin 1-7, a non-hypertensive derivative of&#xD;
      angiotensin II (which contains the 8th amino acid conferring receptor binding to blood&#xD;
      pressure receptors). TXA127 has multilineage effects on hematopoietic progenitors in vitro&#xD;
      and in vivo. The hematopoietic properties demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies&#xD;
      support the investigation of TXA127 to reduce time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment&#xD;
      following transfusion of limited number of CD34+ cells.&#xD;
