  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke, a leading cause of disability in the aging population, increases the risk for&#xD;
      diabetes, subsequent stroke recurrence, and cardiovascular disease complications. The&#xD;
      downsizing of private and federal health care resources, along with the anticipated increase&#xD;
      in stroke rates as our population ages, mandate that alternative strategies be developed to&#xD;
      reduce the public health burden of stroke. This pilot study may facilitate our knowledge of&#xD;
      the timing of paretic leg muscle atrophy, fiber type shift, and the progression of worsening&#xD;
      of glucose tolerance after stroke. Knowledge of the skeletal muscle changes occurring in the&#xD;
      sub-acute stroke period is essential to create new guidelines incorporating exercise&#xD;
      rehabilitation, much like cardiac rehabilitation, in order to facilitate and improve the&#xD;
      health care of veteran stroke survivors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The vast majority of cerebrovascular accidents are reported in persons older than 55 years of&#xD;
      age and occur in over 780,000 persons each year in the U.S. As our adult population ages, the&#xD;
      number of strokes in the United States is anticipated to double, reaching nearly 1.5 million&#xD;
      annually by the year 2050. Following stroke, patients remain at continued high risk for&#xD;
      recurrent stroke with almost a third of them suffering recurrent stroke within 5 years, even&#xD;
      despite optimal medical management. Age and cardiac disease are among the most important&#xD;
      longitudinal predictors of cardiovascular health outcomes and survival after stroke. Notably,&#xD;
      75% of chronic stroke survivors have residual disability emphasizing the need for&#xD;
      rehabilitation strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge of the skeletal muscle changes that occur in the early phases after stroke is&#xD;
      essential to create new guidelines which incorporate exercise rehabilitation, much like&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation, in order to facilitate and improve the health care of stroke&#xD;
      survivors.&#xD;

      Blood samples will be analyzed for metabolic biomarkers. Muscle tissue is collected for&#xD;
      measurements of muscle phenotype. A urine pregnancy test is performed in women of child&#xD;
      bearing age before CT imaging to exclude pregnant women due to the risk to an unborn fetus.&#xD;
