      This study evaluates the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients who received treatment&#xD;
      with stereotactic radiation for early stage lung cancer and who are at high risk for&#xD;
      microscopic metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy in the form of cisplatin/docetaxel or cisplatin/pemetrexed will be administered&#xD;
      approximately six weeks after Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). Patients will then&#xD;
      undergo follow up clinical evaluation and imaging to evaluate treatment response and for&#xD;
      surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient population of 65 patients will be required. Enrollment in this protocol is planned&#xD;
      by multi center involvement in the state of Kentucky as part of the Kentucky Trial Network&#xD;
      (KTN).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC, cT1-T3 (&lt;= 5cm) (AJCC 7ed).&#xD;
             The following histologies are eligible: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large&#xD;
             cell carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine, or non-small cell carcinoma not otherwise&#xD;
             specified; bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma is a subtype of NSCLC but will be&#xD;
             excluded from this study because assessment of multifocal disease spread through the&#xD;
             airways is difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Required CT of the chest and abdomen with contrast unless medically contraindicated&#xD;
             (evaluating both lungs, mediastinum, liver, and adrenals) and Whole Body Positron&#xD;
             Emission Tomography (PET) for staging. An integrated PET/Computed Tomography (CT) will&#xD;
             meet the CT and PET requirements for staging. Images must be read by a trained&#xD;
             radiologist and performed 8 weeks prior to initiation of treatment. PET imaging must&#xD;
             allow adequate visualization of the primary tumor, draining lymphatics in hilar and&#xD;
             mediastinum, adrenals, and skeleton.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0915 inclusion criteria, patients with&#xD;
        hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes ≤ 1cm and no abnormal hilar or mediastinal uptake on PET&#xD;
        will be considered N0. Patients with &gt; 1 cm hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes on CT or&#xD;
        abnormal PET (including suspicious but non-diagnostic uptake) may still be eligible if&#xD;
        directed tissue biopsy of all abnormally identified areas are negative for cancer.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary lesion size not within the acceptable criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of regional metastases or distant metastases following appropriate staging&#xD;

             invasive malignancy that has been treated definitively and the patient remains disease&#xD;
             free for &gt; 3 years with life expectancy &gt; 3 years. Previous skin cancers and carcinoma&#xD;
             in situ treated definitively are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients assigned to pemetrexed/cisplatin therapy must NOT have squamous cell&#xD;
             histology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma is excluded because assessment of multifocal disease&#xD;
