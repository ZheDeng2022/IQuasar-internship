  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of our study is to examine characteristics of bacteria that are&#xD;
      discovered in urine from pediatric patients that utilize either LoFric® or non-LoFric®&#xD;
      catheters for self intermittent catheterization. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      hydrophilic nature of the LoFric® catheter will alter the microbial environment and reduce&#xD;
      clinically significant urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic bladder compared&#xD;
      to a similar population using standard catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be comparing the incidence of clinical urinary tract infections&#xD;
      between patients that use standard catheters and those that use LoFric catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, patient satisfaction using LoFric catheters compared to standard catheters will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will randomize patients with neurogenic bladder into 2 groups after the&#xD;
      have been matched for age, gender and mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group will continue with their current intermittent catheterization system (a&#xD;
      non-LoFric® catheter) while the second group will receive sufficient LoFric® catheters to&#xD;
      complete the study. The investigators will collect the urine at the start of the study, and&#xD;
      then at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months and sent for culture. If a child develops a urinary tract&#xD;
      infection, the investigators will have the patient collect the urine and the urine will be&#xD;
      cultured and the organism will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using an existing bladder cell line, the investigators will inoculate the bladder cells with&#xD;
      any bacteria that grows from any sample and then determine the interleukin-6 response of the&#xD;
      bladder cell line following inoculation with the bacteria. This will determine if the&#xD;
      initiate a high or low cytokine response which the investigators have correlated to clinical&#xD;
      risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will provide a patient satisfaction survey at the start of the study, prior&#xD;
      to randomization and at the completion of the study to determine satisfaction with LoFric®&#xD;
      catheters.&#xD;
