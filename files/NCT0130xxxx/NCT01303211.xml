    <textblock>
      Major epidemics of meningococcal meningitis occur in countries of the African Sahel and&#xD;
      sub-Sahel every few years. Most of these epidemics are caused by meningococci belonging to&#xD;
      serogroup A. Until recently there has been no serogroup A conjugate vaccine available to&#xD;
      prevent epidemics in Africa because none of the major pharmaceutical companies wanted to&#xD;
      develop such a vaccine for commercial reasons. For this reason a public private partnership&#xD;
      was established in 2001, the Meningitis Vaccine Project (MVP), with support from the Bill and&#xD;
      Melinda Gates Foundation, to develop an affordable new serogroup A meningococcal conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine for Africa. The new vaccine, MenAfriVac™, received WHO pre-qualification in 2010 and&#xD;
      mass campaigns started in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger in 2010. It is expected that full&#xD;
      coverage through mass vaccination campaigns will be achieved by the end of 2011 in these&#xD;
      three countries. A case-control study will be conducted in Mali and Niger during the epidemic&#xD;
      seasons of 2012 and 2013 to assess the efficacy of MenAfriVac™.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Massive epidemics of meningococcal disease continue to occur every few years in countries of&#xD;
      the African Sahel and sub-Sahel - the African meningitis belt. In 2009 there were more than&#xD;
      50,000 reported cases in Nigeria alone. Most of these epidemics are caused by meningococci&#xD;
      belonging to capsular polysaccharide serogroup A. African epidemics can be contained by&#xD;
      existing meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines, saving many lives, but epidemics are not&#xD;
      prevented by use of these vaccines. Recently, a new serogroup A meningococcal&#xD;
      polysaccharide/protein conjugate vaccine (MenAfriVac), which may be able to prevent&#xD;
      epidemics, was prequalified by the World Health Organization. This vaccine was developed by&#xD;
      the Meningitis Vaccine Project (MVP) and is being produced at a cost ($0.40 per dose) that is&#xD;
      affordable by countries of the African meningitis belt. Mass vaccination campaigns started in&#xD;
      Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger at the end of 2010. Full coverage will be achieved in 2011 with&#xD;
      progressive deployment to other countries in the meningitis belt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and immunogenicity of MenAfriVac have been established through phase 1 and phase 2&#xD;
      trials conducted in India and Africa but no efficacy trials have been undertaken.&#xD;
      Prequalification was granted on the assumption that the high level of immunogenicity&#xD;
      demonstrated in African populations would be reflected by a similar degree of efficacy. This&#xD;
      is likely, but it is important that the efficacy of this vaccine is established definitively&#xD;
      before large sums are spent on deploying the vaccine across the African meningitis belt.&#xD;
      Therefore, a case control study to determine the efficacy of MenAfriVac in preventing&#xD;
      serogroup A meningococcal meningitis in Mali and Niger is proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A case-control study will be conducted in Mali and in Niger during the 2011, 2012 and 2013&#xD;
      meningitis seasons. Cases of meningitis will be detected through existing routine&#xD;
      surveillance systems and their etiology established using standard microbiology or rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic tests. Cases of proven serogroup A meningococcal meningitis (culture, antigen or&#xD;
      PCR positive) will be matched with two hospital and two community controls who will, in turn,&#xD;
      be matched with the cases for age and place of residence. A questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered to cases and controls which asks about previous meningococcal vaccination and&#xD;
      other risk factors for meningococcal disease which might confound or modify assessment of the&#xD;
      impact of vaccination with MenAfriVac. A blood sample will be collected for measurement of&#xD;
      serogroup A meningococcal bactericidal and tetanus antibodies, as well as total&#xD;
      immunoglobulin levels. Determination of vaccination status will be facilitated by the fact&#xD;
      that vaccination cards will be issued to all recipients at the time of vaccination by the&#xD;
      mass vaccination teams. Vaccine efficacy will be determined by comparing the odds of exposure&#xD;
      to MenAfriVac in cases and controls.&#xD;
