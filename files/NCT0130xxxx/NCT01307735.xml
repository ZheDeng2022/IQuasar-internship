    <textblock>
      Myocarditis is an inflammatory heart disease primarily of viral origin that can lead to heart&#xD;
      failure and death. Despite an unfavorable long-term outcome and mortality rate as high as&#xD;
      50%, classification, diagnosis, and treatment of myocarditis remains controversial. The gold&#xD;
      standard for clinical diagnosis is direct sampling of the heart muscle, which often misses&#xD;
      the infected area and thus reliability of the test is questionable. While the cause and&#xD;
      clinical presentation of myocarditis are often unclear, inflammation of the heart muscle can&#xD;
      be clearly imaged by Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to recent international consensus on CMR protocol for myocarditis and the unique ability&#xD;
      of CMR to visualize cardiac structure, function, and characterize tissue, CMR has become the&#xD;
      primary tool for clinical assessment. This study aims to test the accuracy of CMR in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of myocarditis and to validate whether CMR acquired in an early stage of&#xD;
      myocarditis can provide incremental prognostic information. In order to effectively gather&#xD;
      relevant clinical data, an online, multi-centre international registry will be established&#xD;
      across twenty different medical institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CMR accurately detects active myocardial inflammation in patients with myocarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CMR acquired in an early clinical stage of myocarditis provides incremental prognostic&#xD;
           information superior to standard clinical diagnostic tools.&#xD;

      Study Rationale Because of its unique combination of morphological and functional imaging&#xD;
      with tissue characterization, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become the&#xD;
      non-invasive diagnostic tool of choice for assessing myocarditis. Recently, standard&#xD;
      diagnostic CMR criteria for myocarditis have been proposed (&quot;Lake Louise Criteria&quot;), based on&#xD;
      signal intensity patterns in T2-weighted images and T1-weighted images before and after&#xD;
      contrast administration 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is however a lack of prognostic data using these criteria. Furthermore, the clinical&#xD;
      utility of these criteria in a real-life scenario is not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic CMR criteria for the prediction of&#xD;
      functional outcome and quality of life in patients with myocarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Myocarditis Myocardial inflammation, most often caused by myocardial involvement&#xD;
      in systemic viral illness, although typically of benign outcome, may result in persisting&#xD;
      myocardial damage. Clinical outcomes include heart failure and death. Chronic myocarditis can&#xD;
      progress to dilated cardiomyopathy which result in dilation and decompensation of one or both&#xD;
      ventricles resulting in heart failure, with the need for cardiac transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic approach to myocarditis The diagnosis of myocarditis is generally considered after&#xD;
      exclusion of other causes of acute heart disease and established by a combination of history,&#xD;
      physical examination with non-invasive or invasive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      History and clinical examination have to precede further diagnostic testing although the&#xD;
      initial onset of myocarditis often is insidious, symptoms are non-specific, and clinical&#xD;
      signs absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG findings, such as ST changes, AV block or arrhythmias may be associated with myocarditis,&#xD;
      although their sensitivity is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serological biomarkers of myocardial injury such as creatine kinase and troponin may be&#xD;
      increased; however, the prevalence of an increased troponin T in biopsy-proven myocarditis is&#xD;
      limited, likely due to the lack of extensive necrosis in many cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) usually is considered the gold standard in definitively&#xD;
      diagnosing myocarditis. In 1986, a group of pathologists defined EMB criteria for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of myocarditis, known as &quot;The Dallas Classification System&quot;. This classification&#xD;
      suggested that a minimum of three, but recommended that five separate biopsy specimens had to&#xD;
      be taken for accurate pathological analysis. A major limitation of this technique is that it&#xD;
      is invasive, with a mortality rate of 0.4% and certain contraindications9. Myocardial injury&#xD;
      caused by viral infection could also have a focal distribution, which EMB may not be able to&#xD;
      detect. Only 10 to 25% of patients with clinically suspected myocarditis have confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis by EMB11. High interobserver variability in the interpretation of EMB, and with the&#xD;
      associated sampling errors, the clinical value of this technique is questioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indium-111(111In)-antimyosin antibody (AMA) scintigraphy uses specific antibodies targeted at&#xD;
      damaged myocytes, and thus, is able to detect in vivo necrosis. A major drawback of this&#xD;
      technique, however, is that it cannot differentiate between different etiologies of&#xD;
      myocardial necrosis. It is also not suitable to detect inflammation in the absence of cell&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognostic value of diagnostic markers There is a paucity of data on the prognostic value of&#xD;
      the various diagnostic tools. LV dysfunction is considered the most important indicator for&#xD;
      worse outcome in myocarditis. In recent studies, however, LV dysfunction was infrequently&#xD;
      observed3; therefore, this marker may not be helpful in most clinical scenarios, especially&#xD;
      in less severe cases with persisting symptoms despite preserved cardiac function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) Hallmark features of acute myocarditis&#xD;
      are interstitial lymphocytic infiltration with edema and hyperemia, and myocardial necrosis3.&#xD;
      Interestingly, these can be readily identified by CMR in a non-invasive approach, using a&#xD;
      combination of non-contrast and Gadolinium-enhanced techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR offers several advantages, as opposed to other diagnostic modalities. It does not use&#xD;
      radiation or harmful contrast agents, the field of view is not limited and tissue&#xD;
      characterization can be combined with functional assessment of the ventricles in the same&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first clinical study using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in patients with&#xD;
      acute myocarditis showed that CMR is a suitable tool to detect myocardial inflammation and&#xD;
      showed a spread of tissue changes from focal to diffuse myocardial involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous pilot data, the same group further introduced T2-weighted CMR imaging in&#xD;
      acute myocarditis as a specific marker for myocardial edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Areas of Gd accumulation in CMR images acquired late after contrast administration (&quot;Late&#xD;
      enhancement&quot;) reflect irreversible injury and were reported in about 60% of reported&#xD;
      myocarditis cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic sensitivity of a comprehensive CMR protocol is 67%, with a specificity of 91%&#xD;
      and a diagnostic accuracy of 78%, which exceeds that of other diagnostic approaches. As&#xD;
      sub-clinical myocarditis is also an immune response phenomenon, it is speculated that CMR&#xD;
      parameters used for diagnosing acute myocarditis will also be relevant for imaging&#xD;
      sub-clinical myocarditis. CMR is increasingly accepted as the emerging standard diagnostic&#xD;
      test for myocarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognostic CMR data in myocarditis Follow-up data on CMR in myocarditis are still scarce. In&#xD;
      a pilot study, Wagner et al. studied the evolution of the relative enhancement in the early&#xD;
      course of the disease and after months in patients with myocarditis compared with 26 healthy&#xD;
      patients. They demonstrated that myocardial contrast enhancement decreases to normal values&#xD;
      in many patients within a follow-up of 30 months. In 2/19 patients, left ventricular function&#xD;
      did not recover. Interestingly, contrast enhancement on day 28 was predictive of the ejection&#xD;
      fraction and of clinical outcome after 30 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, Zagrosek et al. provided CMR follow-up data on 36 patients 18±10 months after&#xD;
      myocarditis. They demonstrated that in the acute phase, T2 ratio and relative enhancement was&#xD;
      elevated in most of the patients (86% and 80% respectively) and significantly decreased at&#xD;
      follow-up, this was associated with improvement both in clinical and left ventricular&#xD;
      function parameters. Late enhancement was present in 22 patients (63%) and persisted in 21/22&#xD;
      patients. The acute phase T2 ratio correlated significantly with the change in end-diastolic&#xD;
      volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predictive value of each of the CMR markers for inflammation (hyperemia, edema) and&#xD;
      necrosis/fibrosis, however, is not known, especially when compared to LV function at&#xD;
      presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary objective will be to compare CMR criteria for myocarditis at presentation&#xD;
           with LV volumetric and functional outcome markers as acquired in a follow-up CMR study&#xD;
           in patients with diagnostic CMR criteria for myocarditis and in a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objective will be to compare compare CMR criteria for myocarditis at&#xD;
           presentation with quality of life at 12 months after presentation in the same groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CMR Criteria for Myocarditis (&quot;Lake Louise Criteria&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evidence for myocardial inflammation will be present if at least 2 of 3 CMR criteria are&#xD;
           positive. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Early Gd enhancement ratio equal to or greater than 4.0;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  regional or global T2 signal intensity ratio equal to or greater than 2.0;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  at least one focus of late enhancement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. LV function&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ejection fraction,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LVEDV,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LVESV,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LVEDVI,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LVESVI,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stroke volume,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cardiac index,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  End-systolic wall stress&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quality of life will be quantified by a standardized questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Patients referred for a CMR study at the Stephenson Cardiovascular MR Centre for&#xD;
      suspected myocarditis will be screened. Patients with CMR-derived evidence for myocarditis&#xD;
      (i.e. at least two positive Lake Louise Criteria in at least one CMR scan during the&#xD;
      clinically acute phase of the disease) will be considered &quot;myocarditis-positive&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a control group, patients referred for suspected myocarditis but not fulfilling the&#xD;
      diagnostic CMR criteria for myocarditis and with normal systolic LV function. Both groups&#xD;
      will receive the same standard protocol as per the Consensus Group recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be performed between 4 and 8 weeks after the initial episode and at 1 year.&#xD;
      Data will include CMR results and quality of life assessment as quantified by a standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inpatients identified by study nurses in collaboration with supervising cardiologists&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Outpatients in Cardiology clinics Imaging protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      All CMR imaging will be performed on a 1.5T MRI system (Avanto®, Siemens Medical Solutions,&#xD;
      Erlangen, Germany), with the use of a 32-channel cardiac phased array coil for functional and&#xD;
      late enhancement images and the body coil for T2-weighted images and early Gd enhancement&#xD;
      images. The protocol will be performed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left ventricular function Steady-state free precession (SSFP) gradient echo sequence Six&#xD;
           rotational long axis views, with each slice thickness of 10mm, and zero spacing in&#xD;
           between slices will be performed to cover the entire left ventricle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2 weighted imaging Short TI inversion recovery (STIR) spin echo sequence Three short&#xD;
           axis slices will be obtained at basal, mid, and apical regions. Each slice will be 15mm&#xD;
           thick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point, gadolinium-DTPA will be injected intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early enhancement imaging T1-weighted turbo spin echo sequence Three short axis slices&#xD;
           will be obtained at basal, mid, and apical regions before and immediately after (over 4&#xD;
           minutes) administration of 0.1ml/kgBW Gd-DTPA. Each slice is 10mm thick, and the&#xD;
           acquisition is T1-weighted and free-breathing. If image quality is insufficient in short&#xD;
           axis views, axial slices will be acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Late enhancement imaging Inversion-recovery prepared gradient echo sequences with&#xD;
           individual determination of inversion time according to maximal suppression of&#xD;
           myocardial signal, a stack of short axis views and a set of rotational long axis views&#xD;
           will be acquired 10 minutes after Gd-DTPA infusion. All of the left ventricle will be&#xD;
           covered in short-axis slices.&#xD;
