  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of MRI-guided&#xD;
      focused ultrasound thermal ablation of a designated area in the brain of patients suffering&#xD;
      from medication-refractory Essential Tremor, using the ExAblate transcranial system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ExAblate system is a medical device that involves a focused ultrasound system and an MRI&#xD;
      scanner. ExAblate delivers a pulse of focused ultrasound energy, or sonication, to the&#xD;
      targeted tissue. In this particular study the targeted tissue is a unilateral thermal lesion&#xD;
      created in the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment begins with a series of standard diagnostic MR images to identify the location&#xD;
      and shape of tumor to be treated. The ExAblate computer uses the physician's designation of&#xD;
      the target volume to plan the best way to cover the target volume with small spots called&#xD;
      &quot;sonications&quot;. These treatment spots are cylinder shaped. Their size depends on sonication&#xD;
      power and duration. During the treatment, a specific MR scan, which can be processed to&#xD;
      identify changes in tissue temperature, provides a thermal map of the treatment volume to&#xD;
      confirm the therapeutic effect. The thermal map is used to monitor the treatment in progress,&#xD;
      and confirm that the ablation is proceeding according to plan, thus closing the therapy loop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ExAblate transcranial operates a helmet-shaped transducer (currently utilizing&#xD;
      1000-element phased array transducer) positioned above the subject head. The ExAblate&#xD;
      transcranial system also includes means to immobilize the subject head, cool the interface&#xD;
      water, and software for CT analysis and phase correction computation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ExAblate transcranial system is an experimental device and is being investigated in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
