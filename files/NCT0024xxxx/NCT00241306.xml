      Introduction : The theory of a bipolar organization of language was revised in the light of&#xD;
      neuroimaging results and language seems to be processed in a large scale cognitive network.&#xD;
      The organization and function of this neural network may be modified by several factors&#xD;
      including gender and age. There is some controversy about sex differences in language&#xD;
      according to behavioural and neuroimaging studies :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a small but significant difference favouring females was observed for language&#xD;
           abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a greater bi hemispheric functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)activation was&#xD;
           described in females during language tasks, but Frost et al found no differences during&#xD;
           a language comprehension task according to gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age differences were mainly studied in childhood, but no consistent functional imaging data&#xD;
      on aging are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective : To study the influence of gender and age on cortical fMRI activations during a&#xD;
      silent semantic task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects : 48 right-handed native French-speaking subjects were included in 4 groups of 12&#xD;
      according to age and gender : young female (YF), Young Male (YM), Old Female (OF), and Old&#xD;
      Male (OM). Old subjects had no Alzheimer's disease or other dementia according to their MMS&#xD;
      score (&gt; 26) and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fMRI : Data were collected on a 1.5 T General Electric Signa MR scanner. Functional&#xD;
           images covered the whole brain and were scanned using a single-shot echoplanar imaging&#xD;
           sequence (FOV : 24 cm ¡thickness : 5 mm - 64 x 64 matrix - TE : 60 ms ¡ TR : 3s ¡ flip&#xD;
           angle : 90°). The paradigm followed a box car design and 3 periods of activation (30 s&#xD;
           duration) alternated with 3 periods of fixation (30s duration). During the active&#xD;
           condition subjects had to mentally generate words corresponding to the semantic category&#xD;
           (animals, furniture, or fruit) displayed through MR-compatible special goggles.During&#xD;
           the control condition, they were requested to concentrate on their breathing. Data were&#xD;
           analyzed using the FSFAST package. MR data were motion corrected using AFNI and then&#xD;
           smoothed with a FWHM of 5 mm. The voxel intensities were rescaled such that the in-brain&#xD;
           grand mean was 1000 for all subjects. The hemodynamic response was modeled as a gamma&#xD;
           function (delay : 2.25 s - dispersion :1.25 s). The offset and linear drift in the BOLD&#xD;
           signal were removed by estimating those components simultaneously with the amplitude of&#xD;
           the hemodynamic response. A t-test was then performed on the amplitude of the&#xD;
           hemodynamic response to determine which voxels had significant paradigm-related&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anatomical MR : Results were displayed on the inflated cortical surface for each&#xD;
           subject. A group analysis was performed using a surface coordinate system and random&#xD;
           model effect and General linear model using age and gender as regressors.&#xD;
