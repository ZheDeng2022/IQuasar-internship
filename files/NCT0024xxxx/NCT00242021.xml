  <brief_summary>

      The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of fatty acid composition of a fat&#xD;
      supplement:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. acutely (after single intake) on subjective and objective measurements of hunger,&#xD;
           satiety and wellness, on energy intake, and postprandial hormonal changes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. in the long-term (after one week) on (regulators of) fat tissue metabolism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the physiological factors regulating the food intake pattern is satiety. Satiety is&#xD;
      defined as the absence of ingestive motivation, which ends when the next meal is initiated&#xD;
      (Blundell et al., 1996). Food intake affects a number of physiological objective parameters&#xD;
      in blood known to be involved in signaling satiety, such as glucose (Melanson et al, 1999;&#xD;
      Chapman et al, 1999; Campfield et al, 1996), insulin (Speechly et al, 2000) and&#xD;
      cholecystokinin (CCK) (Gutzwiller et al., 2000; Beglinger et al., 2001; French et al., 2000;&#xD;
      Degen et al., 2001; Burton-Freemanet al., 2002, 2004). More recently, the gastric hormone&#xD;
      ghrelin was identified as a marker for hunger and meal initiation (De Graaf et al, 2004).&#xD;
      Ghrelin concentrations in blood were highly correlated with subjective measures of appetite.&#xD;
      PYY, a gut hormone produced postprandially, will be measured in this study because it has&#xD;
      been mentioned that this hormone inhibits food intake (Batterham et al., 2003). The baseline&#xD;
      level of PYY is lower in obese subjects than in lean subjects. The two groups different in&#xD;
      body weight will therefore show different baseline levels, and perhaps different curves as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Humans do not only eat in response to a metabolic or physiological need. Humans also respond&#xD;
      to a significant extend to other internal subjective and emotional signals (cues). The exact&#xD;
      relations between the physiological internal signals and subjective and emotional internal&#xD;
      signals are not known. Besides also external and social factors modulate&#xD;
      physiological-derived hunger and satiety signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present clinical trial, the effect of fatty acid composition of a fat supplement will&#xD;
      be studied on hunger and satiety. In the supplement a mixture of fatty acids known for their&#xD;
      satiating effect will be tested and will be compared with a control supplement containing&#xD;
      fatty acids normally consumed with breakfast.&#xD;
