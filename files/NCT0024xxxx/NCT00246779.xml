  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery is a major consumer of blood products worldwide. The nature of the surgery&#xD;
      when the heart-lung machine is used, is such that the patient's blood is significantly&#xD;
      diluted by intravenous fluids. This dilution further compounds the blood's ability to form&#xD;
      blood clots to seal the wound, thus increasing bleeding after surgery. The problem of this&#xD;
      dilution is particularly severe in patients with low body weight, of whom a large percentage&#xD;
      are women undergoing heart surgery. As a result, in this population there is an increased&#xD;
      risk of needing a blood transfusion during and after surgery. The effects of this dilution&#xD;
      can be potentially reversed by filtering the blood and removing the fluid after the principal&#xD;
      part of the procedure has been completed through a process referred to as modified&#xD;
      ultrafiltration (MUF). This procedure has been shown to be effective in several small&#xD;
      clinical studies, however the interpretation of the results has been complicated by the fact&#xD;
      that the studies were not &quot;blinded&quot;. In other words, because the physicians and surgeons&#xD;
      making the decisions about blood transfusions knew what treatment the patients received (i.e.&#xD;
      MUF or not) it may have biased their judgement and affected the validity of the findings of&#xD;
      the studies. The investigators believe that MUF may be a useful procedure to limit blood&#xD;
      transfusions, particularly in patients of low body size, and weight undergoing heart surgery.&#xD;
      This can only be demonstrated in a large clinical trial, and in the best case scenario, in a&#xD;
      trial in which total blinding has been undertaken. However, blinding in this manner is quite&#xD;
      difficult to achieve and it is necessary first to demonstrate that this is possible. Further,&#xD;
      as the trial will involve several heart centers, it is essential to demonstrate that the&#xD;
      relatively complex study interventions can be carried out in each of the centers in a&#xD;
      reproducible manner. With this data in hand, the investigators will be able to submit for&#xD;
      funding at a later date for a very large trial to determine if MUF decreases the need for&#xD;
      blood transfusions in heart surgery patients. The investigators will also be able to&#xD;
      determine the effect of this in terms of helping conserve blood as a benefit to the&#xD;
      blood-banking agency (the Canadian Blood Service).&#xD;

      The demographic of the cardiac surgery population has progressively changed such that there&#xD;
      is a greater proportion of older patients and females who by virtue of their co-morbidities&#xD;
      and smaller average size have an increased risk of receiving blood products during and after&#xD;
      surgery. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is the major contributing factor to this adverse event,&#xD;
      as the technique is not only associated with coagulation and platelet abnormalities, but also&#xD;
      by necessity, significant hemodilution as a consequence of the pump prime and the&#xD;
      cardioplegia solution used to induce cardiac arrest. The hemodilution and the resultant&#xD;
      decreased hematocrit (Hct) may trigger transfusion by the surgical team and there is evidence&#xD;
      that platelet and coagulation function may be further compromised, resulting in worsening of&#xD;
      postoperative bleeding. Modified ultrafiltration (MUF), a technique commonly utilized in&#xD;
      pediatric cardiac surgery to reverse the effects of hemodilution after CPB, utilizes a&#xD;
      circuit with an inflow attached to the aortic cannula, an ultrafiltration device, and outflow&#xD;
      of the hemoconcentrated product directed back into the right atrium. Although MUF has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be effective at increasing the Hct, this technique has not received general&#xD;
      acceptance as a blood conservation technology in the adult cardiac surgery population for&#xD;
      several reasons. First, the necessary prolongation of the operative time with MUF may be&#xD;
      perceived to be inconvenient by the operating staff and this may dissuade their use of this&#xD;
      technique. Second, the results from the limited adult trials utilizing MUF, though positive&#xD;
      in terms of blood conservation, have not shown changes of a magnitude that would routinely&#xD;
      impact standard of care. It is possible that the perceived benefits of MUF in these trials&#xD;
      have been less than impressive primarily due to the inclusion of patients at low risk of&#xD;
      bleeding and the lack of blinding, thus contributing to the concern of treatment bias.&#xD;
      Finally, none of these trials have been blinded and thus treatment bias may have contributed&#xD;
      to the results. We believe that ultimately the use of MUF in this target population must be&#xD;
      tested in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. However, the logistics of carrying out&#xD;
      a trial of this magnitude must be established beforehand in a pilot trial that convincingly&#xD;
      demonstrates the feasibility of blinding of this operative intervention, as well as the&#xD;
      reproducibility of the model in several clinical centers. We are proposing to carry out a two&#xD;
      phase multi-centre (University of Ottawa Heart Institute [OHI], Kingston General Hospital,&#xD;
      Royal Victoria Hospital, University Hospital London) randomized controlled trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility of an experimental model testing MUF versus a &quot;sham&quot; circuit in low-body&#xD;
      weight (= 65 kg) patients at high risk to receive transfusion. In Phase I (n = 16 patients -&#xD;
      4 patients/center), the model will be optimized, and in Phase II (n = 64 patients - 16&#xD;
      patients/center) the project will be expanded and the blinding tested. The primary outcome&#xD;
      will involve the success of blinding of the treating physicians (surgeon, anesthetist, and&#xD;
      intensivist) in Phase II as measured by a novel Blinding Index. The information derived on&#xD;
      the study model will be used to support a proposal in the subsequent definitive multi-center&#xD;
      trial for which we will seek funding in the following year (n = 278/group). The primary&#xD;
      outcome of the definitive trial will address the mean number of units of blood transfused in&#xD;
      patients treated with or without MUF. There is also evidence in an animal model of the&#xD;
      benefit of MUF to limit neurologic injury related to cardiac surgery. This aspect has not&#xD;
      been assessed in a clinical model and therefore we intend to address this by evaluating the&#xD;
      impact of MUF on early and late neurocognitive dysfunction related to CPB as a secondary&#xD;
      outcome in the definitive trial. The proposed pilot and the definitive trial have the&#xD;
      potential to address the role of MUF in adult cardiac surgery as a blood conservation&#xD;
      technology. The potential application has significant implications as the procedure is&#xD;
      inexpensive, easily teachable and physiologically sound. Further, it has very considerable&#xD;
      relevance to women undergoing heart surgery due to their relative small body weight and&#xD;
      increased current transfusion risk. As such, we believe that the magnitude of the findings&#xD;
      from these trials will greatly impact current care in cardiac surgery worldwide.&#xD;
