  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a larger dose of the aldosterone antagonist&#xD;
      spironolactone combined with an ACE inhibitor (captopril) and a beta-blocker (carvedilol) is&#xD;
      effective in reverse pulmonary artery remodeling in patients with pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension (PAH)secondary to congenital heart disease&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of PAH involves multiple mechanisms. However, three common factors are&#xD;
      thought to cause the increased pulmonary vascular resistance that characterizes this&#xD;
      devastating disease: vasoconstriction, pulmonary vascular proliferation and remodeling, and&#xD;
      thrombosis in situ. Advances in our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in PAH&#xD;
      suggest that endothelial dysfunction with chronic impaired production of vasoactive mediators&#xD;
      plays a key role. Reduced production of vasoactive mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO) and&#xD;
      prostacyclin, along with prolonged overexpression of vasoconstrictors such as endothelin-1&#xD;
      (ET-1), not only affect vascular tone but also promote vascular remodeling. Thus, these&#xD;
      substances represent logical pharmacological targets. Animal studies showed ET-1 could&#xD;
      stimulate aldosterone secretion in different species, both in vivo and in vitro. This&#xD;
      stimulation involves the ET-B alone and both ET-A and ET-B receptor subtypes in rats and&#xD;
      humans. Animal studies also showed spironolactone combined with ACE inhibitor could normalize&#xD;
      blood pressure, prevents upregulation of vascular ET-1, restore nitric oxide (NO)-mediated&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction. Beta-blockers have ability to reduce dp/dt in pulmonary artery, as&#xD;
      well as left ventricle, thus prevent further damage to the dysfunctional endothelium.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we observed from our practice that the aforementioned therapy could lower&#xD;
      pulmonary artery pressure in patents with pulmonary hypertension secondary to left&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction. Thus, we hypothesize spironolactone combined with ACE inhibitor and&#xD;
      beta-blocker has the ability to reverse remodeling of pulmonary artery in PAH patients.&#xD;
