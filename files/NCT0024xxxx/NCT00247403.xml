    <textblock>
      Ionizing radiation produces cancer cell death by creating high levels of reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species (ROS), such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, in irradiated cells. Cancer cells&#xD;
      are preferentially affected by ROS. The investigators, therefore, propose that interfering&#xD;
      with the detoxification of ROS will make radiation more toxic to cancer cells. Several&#xD;
      cellular mechanisms exist to detoxify ROS, and glucose metabolism plays an important role in&#xD;
      many of these mechanisms. The investigators propose that interfering with glucose metabolism&#xD;
      will sensitize cancer cells to radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' central hypothesis is that 2DG will sensitize cancer cells to ionizing&#xD;
      radiation by inhibiting the use of glucose to detoxify reactive oxygen species produced by&#xD;
      radiation. As an initial step to evaluate this hypothesis, the investigators have designed&#xD;
      this phase I study.&#xD;

      Radiosurgery is a proven treatment option for intracranial metastases. This trial is an&#xD;
      initial effort to potentiate the therapeutic effect of single dose stereotactic radiosurgery&#xD;
      by combining a radiation sensitizing agent, 2DG, with radiosurgery in the treatment of&#xD;
      intracranial metastases. Our preclinical studies indicate the degree of cancer cell&#xD;
      radiosensitization using 2DG increases with increasing radiation dose. We therefore are&#xD;
      interested to use 2DG with radiosurgery, since this technique allows for delivery of a large&#xD;
      single dose of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial seeks to determine the maximum tolerable one time dose of 2DG that can be&#xD;
      delivered to subjects receiving stereotactic radiosurgery. We will also measure the&#xD;
      physiologic effects of 2DG on glucose and reactive oxygen species metabolism.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brain metastases from histologically confirmed extracranial cancer or previously&#xD;
             confirmed intracranial carcinoma. Carcinoma must be staged using the American Joint&#xD;
             Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria version 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Morphologically well-defined tumor mass on computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance&#xD;
             imaging [MRI] (largest diameter less than 40 mm) after resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intracranial mass or masses â‰¤ 4 cm in greatest diameter. Patients with multiple masses&#xD;
             will be eligible if their radiosurgery treatment time is expected to last less than&#xD;
             one hour (typically a maximum of 6 lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Standard institutional radiotherapeutic treatment is stereotactic radiosurgery&#xD;
             delivered using bite-plate localization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greater than or equal to 21 years of age. Pediatric subjects represent a minority of&#xD;
             patients who otherwise meet the eligibility criteria. Inclusion of children in a&#xD;
             different study would be considered if therapy is found to be effective in adults and&#xD;
             not as part of this trial because the safety of 2DG in children has not been&#xD;
             investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky greater than or equal to 70% at time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  serum glucose &lt; 200 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) &lt; 8.5 %&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraceptive use in men and women of childbearing potential prior to, and for the&#xD;
             duration of, this study. The teratogenic effects of ionizing radiation are well&#xD;
             documented, and 2DG has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nursing of infants must be suspended during the study. There is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in infants nursing from patients treated with 2DG,&#xD;
             therefore breastfeeding must be discontinued for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to ingest 50 ml of fluid either by mouth or feeding tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion of women and minorities: Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups&#xD;
             are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with diabetes mellitus, elevated HbA1c or elevated blood glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects requiring a headring ('halo') immobilization for standard stereotactic&#xD;
             localization. Patients with metastases adjacent to optic chiasm, optic nerve or other&#xD;
             radiosensitive tissue necessitating the accuracy of a headring will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of myocardial infarction in the past year and/or dependent on&#xD;
             beta-adrenergic blocking agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an uncontrolled seizure disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the nursing mother with 2DG, breastfeeding must be&#xD;
             discontinued while the nursing mother is treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study. The teratogenic effects of ionizing&#xD;
             radiation are well documented, and 2DG has the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test result immediately prior to the study and should they become pregnant or suspect&#xD;
             that they are pregnant during the study, they must inform their treating physicians&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion of prisoners and other vulnerable populations: Prisoners and other&#xD;
             vulnerable populations, such as children, will not be enrolled.&#xD;
