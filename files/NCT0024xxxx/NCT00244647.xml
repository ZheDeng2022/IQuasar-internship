  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The process of re-narrowing of a coronary artery following a revascularization procedure such&#xD;
      as angioplasty, begins at the time of the procedure. Restenosis has long been considered a&#xD;
      major problem for effective long-term interventional success. This often results in repeated&#xD;
      procedures to deal with recurrent stenosis (or restenosis) of the original targeted vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a substantial body of literature suggesting that local MYC protein production in the&#xD;
      injured coronary artery is a major stimulus and potential cause of restenosis that appears&#xD;
      after stent placement. This study is based upon the hypothesis that stopping MYC protein&#xD;
      production in the vessel has will help reduce restenosis (vessel re-narrowing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVI BioPharma Inc., has utilized its proprietary antisense chemistry to design a drug that&#xD;
      interferes with MYC production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and potential effectiveness of a single&#xD;
      intravenous slow-push dose of RESTEN-MP at the time of stent placement to reduce in-stent&#xD;
      restenosis following balloon angioplasty and stent placement. The post-dose follow-up period&#xD;
      is up to six-months.&#xD;

      The process of restenosis following a revascularization procedure, begins at the time of&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Restenosis has long been seen a major impediment of&#xD;
      effective long-term interventional cardiology, necessitating repeated procedures to deal with&#xD;
      in situ recurrent stenosis of the original targeted vessel. The restenosis rates are between&#xD;
      30 to 50% of patients treated with balloon angioplasty and between 15 to 30% of patients&#xD;
      treated with bare metal stents. There is currently high enthusiasm for drug-eluting stents&#xD;
      already approved for the market and which have an overall restenosis rate of &lt;3% as reported&#xD;
      in published reports for most clinical trial patient populations. However, there are subsets&#xD;
      of patients (e.g., diabetic patients and patients with diffuse small vessel disease) that&#xD;
      have restenosis rates around 10% despite the use of drug-eluting stents. It is probably too&#xD;
      early to conclude that the currently approved drug-eluting stents are a panacea to relieve&#xD;
      coronary arterial obstruction due to atherosclerotic heart disease. In fact, with the&#xD;
      increased usage of the current drug-eluting stents on the market, there are reports of&#xD;
      problems such as late stent malposition, subacute and late thromboses, and aneurysm&#xD;
      formations due to the vessel toxicity associated with this method of treatment. There remains&#xD;
      a definite need for a simple, safe and durable solution to restenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of devices such as intravascular ultrasound has led to a greater&#xD;
      understanding of restenosis mechanisms, especially after coronary artery stenting. It is&#xD;
      presumed that the pathogenesis of coronary artery restenosis after a revascularization&#xD;
      procedure entails two major processes. The first component (viz., recoil and remodeling)&#xD;
      involves the mechanical collapse and constriction of the treated vessel; however, coronary&#xD;
      stents provide luminal scaffolding that eliminates recoil and remodeling. The second&#xD;
      component of coronary artery restenosis after a revascularization procedure is the&#xD;
      endothelial response to injury. Whereas, the former focus in modulating the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms involved in restenosis centered mainly on inhibition of&#xD;
      platelet aggregation and function, current targets of pharmaceutical agents for this&#xD;
      condition have shifted to inhibitors of the cell cycle, smooth muscle cell proliferation and&#xD;
      migration, synthesis of extra-cellular matrix, and inflammatory mediators. Many different&#xD;
      agents are currently being evaluated in pre-clinical and clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVI-4126, the active ingredient of RESTEN-MP, is a proprietary antisense drug designed to&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of human &lt;c-myc&gt; gene to translate mRNA into MYC protein.&#xD;
      Slow-push intravenous administration of RESTEN-MP in pharmacological doses in the restenosis&#xD;
      porcine model prevented subsequent in-stent stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the standard safety assessments, assessments of the potential therapeutic&#xD;
      value of RESTEN-MP as a neointimal hyperplasia inhibitor include late loss between the time&#xD;
      of stent placement and 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
