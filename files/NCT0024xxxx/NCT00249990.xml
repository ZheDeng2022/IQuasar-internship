      The purposes of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 To determine the efficacy of liposomal 9-Nitro-20 (S)-Camptothecin (L9NC) administered by&#xD;
      aerosolization to patients with metastatic endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 To determine toxicity profile of L9NC administered by aerosolization for 5 consecutive&#xD;
      days per week X 8 weeks, every 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 To perform a pharmacology study of L9NC in the plasma and the lungs after aerosolization.&#xD;
      A specific protocol will be written for this part.&#xD;

      RATIONALE: Camptothecin (CPT) is a plant alkaloid isolated from Camptotheca acuminata in&#xD;
      1966. As a topoisomerase I inhibitor, it has powerful anticancer properties and has been used&#xD;
      clinically in the treatment of a variety of cancers. It possesses significant toxicity,&#xD;
      especially involving the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract that has limited its use.&#xD;
      Derivatives of 20-(S)-camptothecin have been made to increase the aqueous solubility of these&#xD;
      compounds and/or modify the A-ring to increase membrane association. The 9-nitrocamptothecin&#xD;
      (9-NC) derivative to be used in this study is insoluble in water, but has demonstrated potent&#xD;
      antitumor effects in mice and antitumor effect in humans. However, the therapeutic index is&#xD;
      low. In order to increase the therapeutic index, a liposomal formulation has been developed,&#xD;
      which can be administered as an aerosol. In humans, dose of 0.52 mg/m2/day 5 days per weeks&#xD;
      for eight 8 weeks of a 10 week course were well tolerated in the Phase I study. Partial&#xD;
      responses were noted in patients with endometrial cancers. The recommended starting dose of&#xD;
      L9NC in the Phase II study is 0.52 mg/m2/day to be administered once a day by aerosol&#xD;
      (mouth-only breathing) for five consecutive days per week x 8 weeks followed by a 2 week&#xD;
      rest. Courses are 10 weeks. This dose corresponds to approximately 1/6 of the MTD of oral&#xD;
      9-NC administered to untreated cancer patients.&#xD;
