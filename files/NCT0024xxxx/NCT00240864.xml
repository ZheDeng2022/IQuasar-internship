  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the onset of pain relief from a single dose of&#xD;
      acetaminophen and ibuprofen in subjects experiencing postoperative dental pain following the&#xD;
      surgical extraction of at least three molars.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to&#xD;
      determine the onset of analgesia following the administration of a single dose of 1000 mg of&#xD;
      acetaminophen, 400 mg of ibuprofen or placebo in subjects experiencing acute postoperative&#xD;
      dental pain secondary to the surgical extraction of at least three molars, with at least one&#xD;
      being a partial or complete bony mandibular third molar impaction. After reporting moderate&#xD;
      to severe pain following dental surgery, subjects record their baseline pain intensity and&#xD;
      are treated with a single oral dose of acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or placebo. Subjects&#xD;
      evaluate their pain intensity and pain relief relative to baseline at various timepoints up&#xD;
      to 4 hours after taking study medication. Pain intensity is assessed using a five-point scale&#xD;
      consisting of none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), moderately severe (3), and severe (4). Pain&#xD;
      relief from baseline is evaluated on a five-point scale consisting of none (0), a little (1),&#xD;
      some (2), a lot (3), and complete (4). At the end of the first hour of the observation period&#xD;
      or at the time of taking supplemental analgesic medication (rescue treatment), whichever&#xD;
      occurs first, subjects make an overall (global) assessment of the study medication, based on&#xD;
      a five-point scale consisting of poor (0), fair (1), good (2), very good (3), or excellent&#xD;
      (4). Subjects are required to remain at the study site for the duration of the four-hour&#xD;
      observation period. The primary efficacy assessments are pain intensity differences from&#xD;
      baseline and pain relief at each measurement time. Safety is assessed by monitoring adverse&#xD;
      events occuring throughout the study. The primary hypotheses are that there is a difference&#xD;
      between acetaminophen and placebo and between ibuprofen and placebo at some time point for&#xD;
      the proportion of subjects reporting non-zero pain relief. The patients receive a single oral&#xD;
      dose of one of the following three treatments: Two acetaminophen 500 mg caplets and two&#xD;
      placebo ibuprofen capsules, two placebo acetaminophen caplets and two ibuprofen 200 mg&#xD;
      capsules, or two placebo acetaminophen caplets and two placebo ibuprofen capsules.&#xD;
