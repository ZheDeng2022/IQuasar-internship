  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that a well-designed hepatitis C (HCV) video education&#xD;
      curriculum for active drug injectors will lead to measurable improvements in HCV testing&#xD;
      rates, HAV and HBV vaccination rates, as well as knowledge and attitudes about this&#xD;
      condition. The investigators will use a short 10 minute video designed for active drug users&#xD;
      to and assess its impact vs. a usual-care counseling intervention. The investigators will&#xD;
      measure and compare its impact at baseline, 4 weeks after video viewing, and 12 weeks after&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Active drug injectors are at high risk for contracting and transmitting HCV. Very few&#xD;
      culturally-specific tools have been developed to improve outcomes in this population. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that measurable improvements in HCV testing rates, hepatitis A and B vaccination&#xD;
      rates, and knowledge, attitudes, and motivations toward behavior change may be elicited by&#xD;
      such a curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will investigate the impact of a short HCV education video on active drug&#xD;
      injectors at a syringe exchange program. Subjects will be enrolled in one of two cohorts: a&#xD;
      usual-care cohort, which will receive the program's standard HCV counseling; vs an&#xD;
      intervention cohort, which will view the education video. Subjects will undergo written&#xD;
      testing for knowledge, attitudes about transmission behaviors, and motivations toward&#xD;
      behavior change before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, 4 weeks after&#xD;
      the intervention, and 12 weeks after the intervention. Additionally, we will measure and&#xD;
      compare the rates of HCV testing and HAV/HBV vaccinations before and at the end of the 12&#xD;
      week time point in both cohorts.&#xD;
