  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthritis is a major cause of disability. Of the nearly 70 million persons in the US with&#xD;
      arthritis and/or chronic joint symptoms, nearly 8 million are disabled because of their&#xD;
      arthritis. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are two of its most common&#xD;
      and disabling forms. Despite evidence that physical activity can improve functional and&#xD;
      health related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes and lower health care costs, the proportion&#xD;
      of the US population engaging in the recommended amount of physical activity is low and even&#xD;
      lower among those with arthritis. Moreover, there is considerable variation in clinicians'&#xD;
      promotion of physical activity for arthritis clients. Care providers infrequently ask clients&#xD;
      about their physical activity behavior and report feeling unprepared to promote physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This application studies the effects of a behavioral intervention aimed at promoting physical&#xD;
      activity, including lifestyle physical activity, on arthritis-specific and generic HRQOL&#xD;
      outcomes. The proposed physical activity management program (PAM) is based on a chronic care&#xD;
      model in which allied health professionals promote patient self-management activities outside&#xD;
      of traditional physician office encounters. The program is an individualized counseling and&#xD;
      referral intervention, conducted by physical activity managers, directed by a theory-based&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment of individual patient barriers and strengths related to physical&#xD;
      activity performance. The specific aims of this randomized, controlled trial of 480 clients&#xD;
      with RA and knee OA followed for 24 months are to test the effectiveness of physical activity&#xD;
      management combined with physician physical activity promotion (PAM group) compared to&#xD;
      physician physical activity promotion only (control group) in improving arthritis-specific&#xD;
      and generic HRQOL, observed measures of function, and objectively measured and self-reported&#xD;
      physical activity levels. In addition, exploratory analyses will be done to assess whether&#xD;
      the improvements in HRQOL and physical activity performance associated with the PAM program&#xD;
      are mediated by increases in physical activity levels and theory-based motivational&#xD;
      variables, respectively. This study is intended to generate feasible methods by which health&#xD;
      care providers and health care systems can increase physical activity levels in clients with&#xD;
      arthritis and to result in widely applicable strategies for health behavior change.&#xD;

      Research Design Overview This five-year study is a randomized controlled trial of 480 clients&#xD;
      with arthritis conducted at three sites on the Northwestern University Feinberg School of&#xD;
      Medicine campus, the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago Arthritis Center (RIC-AC), the&#xD;
      Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation Rheumatology Division Ambulatory Center (NMFF-Rheum),&#xD;
      and the NMFF General Internal Medicine Ambulatory Center (NMFF-GIM). After a 6 month startup&#xD;
      period, two hundred forty clients with RA (120 from RIC-AC and 120 from NMFF-Rheum) and 240&#xD;
      clients with knee OA (120 from RIC-AC, 60 from NMFF-Rheum, and 60 from NMFF-GIM) will be&#xD;
      recruited over a 24 month period, and each subject will be followed for 24 months.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by diagnosis, site, and disease-specific physical functional&#xD;
      status. Half the clients will be randomized to the PAM intervention and half to the control&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent variables include demographic characteristics, arthritis severity and comorbid&#xD;
      conditions, and other IMCHB model variables: motivation (self-regulation efficacy), cognitive&#xD;
      appraisal (perceived competency), and affective response (mental health). Outcomes measured&#xD;
      by blinded interviewers/assessors include self-reported and objective measures of physical&#xD;
      activity, self-reported measures of disease specific and generic health-related quality of&#xD;
      life, and observed measures of physical function. All independent variables and outcomes are&#xD;
      measured at baseline and nearly all independent variables and all outcomes are measured at 3,&#xD;
      6, 12, 18, and 24 months of follow-up. The primary analysis tests the effectiveness of PAM&#xD;
      compared to control groups in improving disease-specific health related quality of life&#xD;
      (HRQOL). Secondary analyses test 1) the effectiveness of PAM compared to control groups in&#xD;
      improving generic HRQOL, 2) the effectiveness of PAM compared to control groups in improving&#xD;
      observed measures of function and cardiovascular fitness, 3) the effectiveness of PAM&#xD;
      compared to control groups in increasing physical activity performance, 4) whether PAM's&#xD;
      effectiveness in improving HRQOL is mediated by it's ability to increase physical activity&#xD;
      and 5) whether PAM's effectiveness in improving physical activity performance is mediated by&#xD;
      changes in theory-based motivation variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description and justification of the study population Given that there are more than 100&#xD;
      different forms of arthritis (defined here as any chronic condition affecting the joints and&#xD;
      surrounding tissues), we have chosen clients with two well-defined and pathophysiologically&#xD;
      distinct diseases to study, knee osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Knee OA&#xD;
      is a prototype of a chronic degenerative arthropathy that has a high prevalence and is&#xD;
      associated with a great amount of disability. RA is a prototype of the most common chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory arthropathy, again associated with a high rate of disability. We expect that if&#xD;
      the PAM program is effective in improving the physical activity and health status levels of&#xD;
      these two distinctly different groups of arthritis clients, then it should be effective for&#xD;
      many other, if not all, other arthritis clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case definitions. Classification criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology&#xD;
      (ACR) will be used for clients with both knee OA and RA. The criteria utilizing knee x-rays&#xD;
      will be used to increase the specificity of the knee OA criteria. These are standard case&#xD;
      definitions that are used routinely in the rheumatology literature and have been shown to&#xD;
      have high sensitivity and specificity.108, 109 Selection criteria. Clients fulfilling the ACR&#xD;
      criteria for knee OA or RA will be eligible for this trial if the meet the following&#xD;
      criteria: 1) age 18 or older, 2) able to ambulate at least household distances (50ft), and 3)&#xD;
      able to speak and understand English, 4) no plans for total joint replacement in the&#xD;
      following 12 months, 5) no contraindication to physical activity due to a comorbid&#xD;
      conditions, and 6) no plans to relocate away from the Chicago land area for at least 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods for recruiting, enrolling, and sustaining participation. The Rehabilitation Institute&#xD;
      of Chicago Arthritis Center (RIC-AC) and the Rheumatology and General Internal Medicine&#xD;
      Divisions of the Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation (NMFF-Rheum and NMFF-GIM), the&#xD;
      practice of fulltime Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine faculty members,&#xD;
      will be the sites where clients will be recruited for this trial. While on the same campus,&#xD;
      these RIC and NMFF are physically separated from one another and have separate administrative&#xD;
      structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both have more than adequate numbers of eligible clients to enroll in this study. Based on&#xD;
      administrative data, more than 500 individual clients with RA and 700 individual clients with&#xD;
      knee OA were seen at the RIC-AC in the past twelve months. This is an average of more than 40&#xD;
      RA and nearly 60 knee OA clients a month, a number which is likely to grow as the practice&#xD;
      has been experiencing an approximate 15% growth in clients per year. More than triple these&#xD;
      numbers of RA clients are seen at the NMFF-Rheum practice annually. Com-parable numbers of&#xD;
      knee OA clients are seen at RIC-AC and NMFF-Rheum. To assure ready access to knee OA&#xD;
      subjects, NMFF-GIM will also be a site for those subjects. Over 700 unique clients with&#xD;
      explicit ICD-9 CM visit codes for knee osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis were identified&#xD;
      for NMFF-Rheum from EPICcare electronic medical records just for the months May-July 2004;&#xD;
      approximately 200 additional clients with osteoarthritis and 25 with rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      were seen at the NMFF-GIM over the same period. Several hundred clients with RA and knee OA&#xD;
      are currently enrolled in an IRB-approved research registry which should facilitate&#xD;
      recruitment into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment and sustained participation in the proposed study will be enhanced because of the&#xD;
      proven willingness of clients in these academic practices to participate in ongoing&#xD;
      observational studies. Dr. Leena Sharma has been following a cohort of 300 subjects with knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis for the past 5 years. Drs. Pamela Semanik and George Liang (an NMFF&#xD;
      rheumatology colleague) have been able to recruit 185 and 311 RA clients respectively for&#xD;
      their studies within one year. Based on this and other similar experiences, we expect&#xD;
      attrition or lost to follow-up rates of less than 10% per one year and less than 20% over two&#xD;
      years. Practice newsletters and the presence of familiar and friendly research assistants&#xD;
      will enhance and sustain interest in ongoing research initiatives at both sites. Study&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted at the convenience of the subject, either face to face or on the&#xD;
      telephone using computerized telephone interview software. Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      approval has already been obtained for collecting medical record and health status data on RA&#xD;
      clients at the NMFF-Rheum site and physical activity and health status data on both knee OA&#xD;
      and RA clients at the RIC-AC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the consent process. Eligible clients will be informed of this study by the&#xD;
      participating physicians of the RIC-AC and the NMFF-Rheum and NMFF-GIM practices by mail and&#xD;
      at the time of a scheduled clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mailings of study announcements to participants listed in the IRB-approved RA and knee&#xD;
           OA client registries at RIC-AC, NMFF-Rheum, and NMFF-GIM. At the inception of the study,&#xD;
           participating physicians will request retrospective ICD-9 coded visit data from RIC-AC,&#xD;
           NMFF-Rheum, and NMFF-GIM for all clients coded with RA or adult knee OA (diagnosis codes&#xD;
           714.0 or 715.96, excluding clients with v codes for aftercare of a previous joint&#xD;
           replacement) seen at the 3 sites during the previous 12 months (Month 1). These visit&#xD;
           data contain client names, addresses and phone numbers. By the end of project month 2,&#xD;
           all clients who were identified from the registry as having relevant prior visit codes&#xD;
           will be mailed a study solicitation letter, with a cover letter signed by their&#xD;
           attending clinic physician, with a consent form and stamped return envelope for signed&#xD;
           consent or refusal to participate. This mailing will provide study investigator phone&#xD;
           numbers for participants to obtain further information. For those willing to&#xD;
           participate, study coordinators will be able to screen for eligibility, including&#xD;
           information on prior or immanently scheduled knee replacement surgery, as well as the&#xD;
           date of clients' next regularly scheduled clinic appointment (if known). Consent&#xD;
           materials will describe the need for six no-cost study visits with transportation and&#xD;
           meal reimbursement policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Within two weeks of the initial mailing, study personnel will initiate telephone contact&#xD;
           with IRB-approved registry clients who have not responded to the mailing to further&#xD;
           explain the study and determine interest in study participation. If interested, a second&#xD;
           mailing will be made to these clients as needed. Medical records for all registry&#xD;
           clients who return signed informed consent will then be reviewed to determine&#xD;
           eligibility. Subsequent clinic schedules will be examined for consented, eligible&#xD;
           clients and patient reported MD appointment times on a continuous basis to determine&#xD;
           each client's next upcoming scheduled physician visit. Consented clients will be&#xD;
           contacted again by phone within about six weeks of a regularly scheduled clinic visit.&#xD;
           Based on the date of this forthcoming physician appointment, clients will be scheduled&#xD;
           for a baseline study visit (with maximum flexibility to arrange weekday or weekend study&#xD;
           visits at the patient's convenience) approximately three weeks before the &quot;index&quot; or&#xD;
           baseline physician appointment. This entire process will be repeated, at study months 8&#xD;
           and 16, to assist in meeting enrollment targets&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In-Person Enrollment. Clients not reachable by phone or mail, who prefer being enrolled&#xD;
           in person, or who are not in the registry but are identified by their physicians as&#xD;
           potential subjects at the time of an initial clinic visit, will be directly approached&#xD;
           for participation by study coordinators at the time of a clinic visit. Written&#xD;
           information from these physicians will be given to eligible clients to read in the&#xD;
           waiting room upon arrival at the clinic and a short video about the study will be&#xD;
           available for viewing before or after the visit. During the clinical visit the physician&#xD;
           will discuss the opportunity for the client to participate in this study of physical&#xD;
           activity and health status and factors that are associated with good and poor health&#xD;
           status and will answer any questions that arise. If the client agrees to participate, a&#xD;
           research assistant will further explain the study in detail, obtain written informed&#xD;
           consent, and schedule an in person and telephone interview to collect study data. If a&#xD;
           client consents, and is deemed eligible after a subsequent medical record review, the&#xD;
           date of their next regularly scheduled follow-up physician visit will be used to&#xD;
           determine the timing of their initial baseline study assessment visit. Non-eligible&#xD;
           clients will be thanked for their time and interest, and added to the registry for&#xD;
           future study notification, if desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pre-Randomization (Baseline) Study Assessment Visit (See Figure 2) At the baseline study&#xD;
      assessment visit, a study coordinator will fit all participating clients with the Actigraph&#xD;
      accelerometer, provide instructions and packaging for mailed return, perform the observed&#xD;
      physical function test battery, and schedule the first telephone interview one week later&#xD;
      (about two weeks prior to the index clinic visit) at clients' convenience. This will enable&#xD;
      telephone interview data (including the HRQOL and physical activity data) to refer the same&#xD;
      week that the Actigraph data are being recorded. Clients will also be advised of prospective&#xD;
      dates for five subsequent study assessment visits, the first two at three month intervals,&#xD;
      the final three at six month intervals, which will be entirely unrelated to any subsequent MD&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and the Index Physician Visit (See Figure 2) Randomization will be stratified&#xD;
      by diagnosis (RA vs. knee OA), by site (RIC-AC vs. NMFF-Rheum for subjects with RA, RA-AC vs.&#xD;
      NMFF-Rheum vs. NMFF-GIM for subjects with knee OA), and by level of disease- specific&#xD;
      physical function (above or below specified cutpoints for the HAQ Disability Scale for RA&#xD;
      subjects and the WOMAC-Physical Function Scale for knee OA subjects; the cutpoints set as the&#xD;
      median values from RA and knee OA subjects who participated in previous clinical studies of&#xD;
      RA and knee OA at RIC and NMFF). Consecutive clients within each strata will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either PAM or control intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur to allow study personnel to notify each participant about their&#xD;
      group assignment well before the index physician visit at which all subjects will receive MD&#xD;
      physical activity counseling (full description is below). If selected into the PAM group,&#xD;
      clients will be requested to allow additional time after their existing physician appointment&#xD;
      for an initial, no cost, expense-reimbursed visit with the physical activity manager. The&#xD;
      description of the PAM program is below. If spending additional time after the index&#xD;
      physician visit concludes is inconvenient for the client, a separate PAM study visit for&#xD;
      experimental group clients will be scheduled as soon as possible thereafter. Other than&#xD;
      potential interaction with physicians about referrals or other experimental group activities,&#xD;
      the PAM study assessment visits will remain completely independent of study clients' medical&#xD;
      care, which will proceed in a usual and customary manner. This is analogous to chronic&#xD;
      disease management in other settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician physical activity promotion to be given to all study subjects The physician&#xD;
      physical activity promotion intervention, which is to be given at the index physician visit&#xD;
      (Figure 2) is designed to be accomplished in less than 5 minutes, and includes a) determining&#xD;
      whether the client is meeting the CDC physical activity recommendations, b) encouraging the&#xD;
      client to work toward or maintain this level of physical activity, and 3) eliciting and&#xD;
      discussing the client's questions and/or concerns about physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two reasons for giving this intervention to both groups. First, it is standard&#xD;
      practice in some, but not all, practices participating in this trial and second, it is&#xD;
      postulated that PAM will only be successful if MD's support its goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Physical Activity Management (PAM) Program (See also Appendix)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical activity management program draws on principles of Cox's model described&#xD;
      earlier. Because the potential for positive patient health outcomes increases as the provider&#xD;
      intervention/interaction is better fitted to the uniqueness of the patient (background,&#xD;
      cognitive, affective, and motivational manifestations), the Physical Activity Management&#xD;
      program will be conducted using a standard intervention protocol guided by the results from&#xD;
      the ACTA assessment. The ACTA interview and self-score form provide opportunities for the&#xD;
      client to reflect upon his/her physical activity and to identify the supports and barriers to&#xD;
      participation. The client works with the physical activity manager to identify and select&#xD;
      goals that s/he personally finds motivating. Together, the client and physical activity&#xD;
      manager negotiate the strategies that will be needed to help the client achieve their&#xD;
      self-identified goals. This may involve the physical activity manager:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  providing information about physical activity, community resources that are available to&#xD;
           the client&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  making referrals as necessary to other care providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  helping the client to identify day-to-day activities or ways the client can incorporate&#xD;
           more activity in their life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  allowing the client the ultimate decisional control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention was revised following patient feedback and clinician experience with the&#xD;
      pilot programs. The physical activity management program now consists of 6 components, in&#xD;
      part based on work by Cimprich110: a verbal explanation of the purpose of the physical&#xD;
      activity management program; identification of barriers and supports to physical activity and&#xD;
      physical activity goals using the ACTA; guidance in developing an action plan, selecting ways&#xD;
      to be more active and a plan for what to do if the client has difficulty increasing their&#xD;
      activity; establishing an agreement in writing to increase their physical activity each week;&#xD;
      a strategy of re-cording progress; and a verbal explanation of the plan for future meetings&#xD;
      with the physical activity manager. The IMCHB recognizes the role of choice and&#xD;
      self-determination in health behavior, the ability of the clinician's interaction style and&#xD;
      intervention approach to support or discourage health behavior, and the dynamic impact of the&#xD;
      patient's singularity profile on health outcomes 111. To optimize this feature, the client&#xD;
      will negotiate with the physical activity manager a contract that outlines goals, commitment&#xD;
      to increase activity, what to do if things go wrong, use of a pedometer, three monthly&#xD;
      calendars on which to record daily steps and which includes a list of activities the client&#xD;
      can try to increase physical activity, and a copy of an activity pyramid with lifestyle&#xD;
      physical activity suggestions. The client is seen or contacted for physical activity&#xD;
      management at base-line, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months at which time the ACTA will be repeated.&#xD;
      The client's physician(s) will receive a physical activity management summary report at these&#xD;
      times. The client and physical activity manager will negotiate other contacts as may be&#xD;
      indicated by the client's needs. 112, 113 An autonomy-supportive provider and health care&#xD;
      environment are key intervention strategies to assist in initiating and maintaining behavior&#xD;
      change. A detailed description of the protocol can be found in the Appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-determination theory distinguishes between autonomous and controlled behavior&#xD;
      regulation. Autonomous behaviors are initiated and sustained to the extent that people&#xD;
      experience a true sense of volition and choice, and act because of the personal importance of&#xD;
      the behavior. Controlled behaviors are performed because the individual feels pressured,&#xD;
      either by external or intrapsychic forces 114.The autonomy supportive physical activity&#xD;
      manager encourages the client to maintain decisional control of the process, choosing&#xD;
      activities at which they feel they are most likely to succeed but also in assisting in&#xD;
      development of a plan for what the client can do if they have difficulty increasing or&#xD;
      maintaining their physical activity. By continuing to maintain contact with the client over a&#xD;
      2 year period, to revise plans and goal achievement as necessary, this intervention&#xD;
      recognizes the need to begin with primarily volitional activities i.e., consciously chosen&#xD;
      and implemented activities until they are integrated into an habitual routine in the clients&#xD;
      everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This autonomy-supportive intervention also is informed by the chronic disease management&#xD;
      model of Wagner and colleagues by utilizing protocols, placing more clinical responsibility&#xD;
      on an allied health professional, emphasizing patient education and increased access to&#xD;
      clinical and community expertise, and by giving the physician greater availability of&#xD;
      clinical information relevant to the client's physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Study Assessment Visits (Figure 2) All study clients will be scheduled for five&#xD;
      subsequent study visits at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the baseline assessment, at&#xD;
      which Actigraph fittings, observed physical function tests, and subsequent telephone&#xD;
      interview follow-up within a week will be provided for both experimental and control&#xD;
      subjects. Clients who do not continue to be seen at the study clinics for clinical care will&#xD;
      be encouraged to remain in the study. Reimbursement for parking and meals will be made at&#xD;
      each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur to allow study personnel to notify each participant about their&#xD;
      group assignment well before the index physician visit at which all subjects will receive MD&#xD;
      physical activity counseling (full description is below). If selected into the PAM group,&#xD;
      clients will be requested to allow additional time after their existing physician appointment&#xD;
      for an initial, no cost, expense-reimbursed visit with the physical activity manager. The&#xD;
      description of the PAM program is below. If spending additional time after the index&#xD;
      physician visit concludes is inconvenient for the client, a separate PAM study visit for&#xD;
      experimental group clients will be scheduled as soon as possible thereafter. Other than&#xD;
      potential interaction with physicians about referrals or other experimental group activities,&#xD;
      the PAM study assessment visits will remain completely independent of study clients' medical&#xD;
      care, which will proceed in a usual and customary manner. This is analogous to chronic&#xD;
      disease management in other settings.&#xD;

      Physician physical activity promotion to be given to all study subjects The physician&#xD;
      physical activity promotion intervention, which is to be given at the index physician visit&#xD;
      (Figure 2) is designed to be accomplished in less than 5 minutes, and includes a) determining&#xD;
      whether the client is meeting the CDC physical activity recommendations, b) encouraging the&#xD;
      client to work toward or maintain this level of physical activity, and 3) eliciting and&#xD;
      discussing the client's questions and/or concerns about physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two reasons for giving this intervention to both groups. First, it is standard&#xD;
      practice in some, but not all, practices participating in this trial and second, it is&#xD;
      postulated that PAM will only be successful if MD's support its goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Physical Activity Management (PAM) Program (See also Appendix)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical activity management program draws on principles of Cox's model described&#xD;
      earlier. Because the potential for positive patient health outcomes increases as the provider&#xD;
      intervention/interaction is better fitted to the uniqueness of the patient (background,&#xD;
      cognitive, affective, and motivational manifestations), the Physical Activity Management&#xD;
      program will be conducted using a standard intervention protocol guided by the results from&#xD;
      the ACTA assessment. The ACTA interview and self-score form provide opportunities for the&#xD;
      client to reflect upon his/her physical activity and to identify the supports and barriers to&#xD;
      participation. The client works with the physical activity manager to identify and select&#xD;
      goals that s/he personally finds motivating. Together, the client and physical activity&#xD;
      manager negotiate the strategies that will be needed to help the client achieve their&#xD;
      self-identified goals. This may involve the physical activity manager:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  providing information about physical activity, community resources that are available to&#xD;
           the client&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  making referrals as necessary to other care providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  helping the client to identify day-to-day activities or ways the client can incorporate&#xD;
           more activity in their life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  allowing the client the ultimate decisional control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention was revised following patient feedback and clinician experience with the&#xD;
      pilot programs. The physical activity management program now consists of 6 components, in&#xD;
      part based on work by Cimprich110: a verbal explanation of the purpose of the physical&#xD;
      activity management program; identification of barriers and supports to physical activity and&#xD;
      physical activity goals using the ACTA; guidance in developing an action plan, selecting ways&#xD;
      to be more active and a plan for what to do if the client has difficulty increasing their&#xD;
      activity; establishing an agreement in writing to increase their physical activity each week;&#xD;
      a strategy of re-cording progress; and a verbal explanation of the plan for future meetings&#xD;
      with the physical activity manager. The IMCHB recognizes the role of choice and&#xD;
      self-determination in health behavior, the ability of the clinician's interaction style and&#xD;
      intervention approach to support or discourage health behavior, and the dynamic impact of the&#xD;
      patient's singularity profile on health outcomes 111. To optimize this feature, the client&#xD;
      will negotiate with the physical activity manager a contract that outlines goals, commitment&#xD;
      to increase activity, what to do if things go wrong, use of a pedometer, three monthly&#xD;
      calendars on which to record daily steps and which includes a list of activities the client&#xD;
      can try to increase physical activity, and a copy of an activity pyramid with lifestyle&#xD;
      physical activity suggestions. The client is seen or contacted for physical activity&#xD;
      management at base-line, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months at which time the ACTA will be repeated.&#xD;
      The client's physician(s) will receive a physical activity management summary report at these&#xD;
      times. The client and physical activity manager will negotiate other contacts as may be&#xD;
      indicated by the client's needs. 112, 113 An autonomy-supportive provider and health care&#xD;
      environment are key intervention strategies to assist in initiating and maintaining behavior&#xD;
      change. A detailed description of the protocol can be found in the Appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-determination theory distinguishes between autonomous and controlled behavior&#xD;
      regulation. Autonomous behaviors are initiated and sustained to the extent that people&#xD;
      experience a true sense of volition and choice, and act because of the personal importance of&#xD;
      the behavior. Controlled behaviors are performed because the individual feels pressured,&#xD;
      either by external or intrapsychic forces 114.The autonomy supportive physical activity&#xD;
      manager encourages the client to maintain decisional control of the process, choosing&#xD;
      activities at which they feel they are most likely to succeed but also in assisting in&#xD;
      development of a plan for what the client can do if they have difficulty increasing or&#xD;
      maintaining their physical activity. By continuing to maintain contact with the client over a&#xD;
      2 year period, to revise plans and goal achievement as necessary, this intervention&#xD;
      recognizes the need to begin with primarily volitional activities i.e., consciously chosen&#xD;
      and implemented activities until they are integrated into an habitual routine in the clients&#xD;
      everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This autonomy-supportive intervention also is informed by the chronic disease management&#xD;
      model of Wagner and colleagues by utilizing protocols, placing more clinical responsibility&#xD;
      on an allied health professional, emphasizing patient education and increased access to&#xD;
      clinical and community expertise, and by giving the physician greater availability of&#xD;
      clinical information relevant to the client's physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Study Assessment Visits (Figure 2) All study clients will be scheduled for five&#xD;
      subsequent study visits at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the baseline assessment, at&#xD;
      which Actigraph fittings, observed physical function tests, and subsequent telephone&#xD;
      interview follow-up within a week will be provided for both experimental and control&#xD;
      subjects. Clients who do not continue to be seen at the study clinics for clinical care will&#xD;
      be encouraged to remain in the study. Reimbursement for parking and meals will be made at&#xD;
      each visit.&#xD;
