      To investigate a potential relationship between four different classes of non-cardiovascular&#xD;
      drugs and the risk of sudden cardiac death.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are more than 400,000 sudden cardiac deaths annually in the U.S, of which 85% or more&#xD;
      are caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Medications are an important modifiable risk&#xD;
      factor because many have effects that can provoke lethal arrhythmias. There is increasing&#xD;
      suspicion that several drugs in four widely used classes of non-cardiovascular&#xD;
      medications-fluoroquinolone and macrolide antibiotics, antipsychotics, and antidepressants-&#xD;
      are pro-arrhythmic and thus increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. Published&#xD;
      epidemiologic studies have quantified the risk conferred by older antipsychotics and&#xD;
      antidepressants as well as oral erythromycin. The current project will extend these studies&#xD;
      to newer medications that are used by an estimated 20% of adults in the U.S. Studies of&#xD;
      surrogate markers suggest that the pro-arrhythmic effects of these drugs vary markedly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective cohort study has three specific aims in testing the relationship between&#xD;
      certain non-cardiovascular medications-fluoroquinolone and macrolide antibiotics,&#xD;
      antipsychotics, and antidepressants- and sudden cardiac death.. Specific aim 1 tests the&#xD;
      hypothesis that there is corresponding variation in risk of sudden cardiac death. In vivo&#xD;
      data suggest that concurrent use of study drugs with other common medications that inhibit&#xD;
      their metabolism could markedly increase drug concentrations, and thus risk of arrhythmias.&#xD;
      Specific aim 2 tests the hypothesis that these pharmacokinetic interactions, defined a&#xD;
      priori, increase risk of sudden cardiac death. The hypokalemia caused by the commonly used&#xD;
      potassium-wasting diuretics may amplify the pro-arrhythmic effects of medications. Specific&#xD;
      aim 3 tests the hypothesis that concurrent use of study drugs and these diuretics increases&#xD;
      risk of sudden cardiac death. The investigators will conduct a retrospective cohort study in&#xD;
      TennCare, Tennessee's expanded Medicaid program. Computerized TennCare files, linked with&#xD;
      death certificates, provide the information necessary to define the cohort, classify followup&#xD;
      according to medication exposure and potential confounders, and identify cases of sudden&#xD;
      cardiac death using a validated computer case definition we have developed. The cohort will&#xD;
      include an estimated 800,000 persons with 15,000 sudden cardiac deaths during 5,000,000&#xD;
      person years of followup and thus will have excellent power for risk estimates. The study&#xD;
      will provide data that clinicians need to prescribe these widely used medications in a way&#xD;
      that minimizes the risk of sudden cardiac death.&#xD;

        : We will conduct a retrospective cohort study of Tennessee Medicaid enrollees 30 years of&#xD;
        age or older who meet the study inclusion-exclusion criteria. From the Medicaid pharmacy&#xD;
        files, we will identify users of study drugs and controls. During followup, we will&#xD;
        identify out-of-hospital deaths, most likely to be sudden deaths, based in part on linkage&#xD;
        with Tennessee death certificate files. From these deaths, we will identify those meeting&#xD;
        the criteria for sudden cardiac death, based upon a previously validated computer&#xD;
        algorithm. Important potential confounders will be identified from past medical care&#xD;
        encounters, as identified from Medicaid inpatient (augmented with the Tennessee Hospital&#xD;
        Discharge dataset), outpatient, and nursing home files. Adjusted estimates of the relative&#xD;
        risk will be calculated from multivariate regression analyses.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Study selection criteria are not based on gender, ethnicity or race. Nevertheless, we&#xD;
        estimated that 61% of subjects would be females, 73% would be white, and 99% would be&#xD;
        non-hispanic/latino.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion/exclusion criteria are designed to assure the availability of data necessary&#xD;
             for the study and to identify a cohort of patients who, absent adverse medication&#xD;
             effects, are at low risk for sudden death. Thus, inclusion criteria require enrollment&#xD;
             in TennCare, including access to medications. To assure complete identification of all&#xD;
             healthcare encounters and medication use, the study will be restricted to TennCare&#xD;
             enrollees with active enrollment and full pharmacy benefits. We require age 30 years&#xD;
             or older at the beginning of the study. This is the population for which&#xD;
             arrhythmia-related deaths are of greatest concern. Finally, cohort members must have&#xD;
             use of study or control medications, as defined by filling at least one prescription&#xD;
             recorded in the Medicaid pharmacy files.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with life-threatening illnesses will be excluded because for such persons it&#xD;
             is not possible to distinguish from deaths related to arrhythmias versus those that&#xD;
             are a consequence of the underlying serious illness.&#xD;
