  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a third dose of vaccines containing&#xD;
      A/Vietnam/1203/04 provides more immunity than two doses. Subjects who participate in this&#xD;
      study will have participated in DMID protocol 04-063 involving the A/Vietnam/1203/04. In this&#xD;
      study, each subject will be asked to receive a third dose of the H5 vaccine at the same level&#xD;
      administered in protocol 04-063. Subjects will be asked to record oral temperature and any&#xD;
      experienced side effects for 7 days following the vaccine. Study procedures will include up&#xD;
      to 3 blood sample collections. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for&#xD;
      up to 6 months.&#xD;

      This study is linked to DMID protocols 04-063, 07-0022 and 08-0059. DMID Study 05-0090 is an&#xD;
      extension study to DMID Study 04-063. Between March and May 2005, DMID Study 04-063 enrolled&#xD;
      approximately 450 subjects at three study sites. Subjects were stratified by age and history&#xD;
      of prior influenza vaccination for the 2004-2005 season, and randomly assigned to receive 2&#xD;
      doses of saline placebo (N=50) or 7.5, 15, 45, or 90 mcg of the influenza A/H5N1 virus&#xD;
      vaccine (N=100/dose group) by IM injection. Approximately 6 months after receiving their&#xD;
      second vaccination, subjects enrolled in DMID Study 04-063 will return to the clinic for&#xD;
      their final study visit (Visit 6). After completing this visit, which includes collection of&#xD;
      safety data and a 30-mL blood draw, the unblinded vaccine administrator will determine if the&#xD;
      study subject received placebo or the influenza A/H5N1 vaccine. In the proposed extension&#xD;
      study (DMID Study 05-0090), subjects who received the influenza A/H5N1 vaccine will be&#xD;
      provided with information about DMID Study 05-0090 and asked if they are willing to receive a&#xD;
      third dose of vaccine at the same dose level originally administered (i.e., those subjects&#xD;
      originally receiving two doses of 7.5 mcg will receive a single booster dose of 7.5 mcg,&#xD;
      those receiving two doses of 15 mcg will receive a single booster of 15 mcg, etc.). Subjects&#xD;
      that provide informed consent and are eligible for DMID Study 05-0090 will be given a third&#xD;
      dose of the vaccine at the same dose level they previously received by the unblinded vaccine&#xD;
      administrator. Symptoms and signs will be assessed in the clinic for 15 to 30 minutes after&#xD;
      inoculation, and the subjects will maintain a memory aid to record oral temperature and&#xD;
      systemic and local adverse events (AEs) for 7 days after each immunization. Subjects will be&#xD;
      encouraged to take their temperature around the same time each day. All subjects will receive&#xD;
      a safety follow-up telephone call at 1 to 3 days to elicit any AE information and between 13&#xD;
      to 19 days after the vaccination to elicit any AE information and review the memory aid.&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the clinic 28 (+/- 3) days after vaccination for assessment of AEs&#xD;
      and concomitant medications, targeted physical examination (if indicated) and blood sample&#xD;
      collection. During this follow-up visit, subjects who have been identified as &quot;high&#xD;
      responders&quot; to the vaccine in the DMID 04-063 study will also be solicited to participate in&#xD;
      a blood specimen collection substudy. Subjects will be provided with information about the&#xD;
      substudy and asked if they would consent to have an additional 100 mL of blood drawn after&#xD;
      the blood sample is collected for serum antibody assays. Refusal to consent for this substudy&#xD;
      does not preclude subjects from continuing in the booster vaccine trial. At approximately Day&#xD;
      180 (6 months after booster vaccination), subjects will return to the clinic for a final&#xD;
      immunogenicity blood sample collection and for follow-up, which may include a targeted&#xD;
      physical examination (if indicated). The duration of the study treatment for each subject in&#xD;
      this study will be about 6 months.&#xD;
