      The purpose of this study is to establish an intervention to keep American Indian/Alaskan&#xD;
      Native (AI/AN) children from becoming overweight.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AI/AN children have overweight rates that are 18 to 30 percent higher than the general&#xD;
      American population of children. Adult obesity has early antecedents, and data show that&#xD;
      eating and physical activity behaviors are formed and set as early as 3 years of age, through&#xD;
      primary socialization within families. Yet there are few, if any, obesity prevention programs&#xD;
      that target children younger than 3 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a community-partnered randomized study to prevent early childhood overweight in AI/AN&#xD;
      children. A birth cohort of about 780 children from six Indian communities born over a period&#xD;
      18 months will be randomized by community to either a control (3 communities) or intervention&#xD;
      condition (3 communities). The intervention comprises a community-wide intervention coupled&#xD;
      with individualized family counseling to improve nutrition and physical activity in infants&#xD;
      and toddlers. Nutrition goals are to increase breastfeeding initiation and sustainability,&#xD;
      limit sugared beverages for infants and toddlers, and make healthful choices during weaning&#xD;
      and solid food introduction. Physical activity goals include promoting motor development,&#xD;
      limiting video/TV viewing, and creating play opportunities for infants and toddlers.&#xD;
      Intervention approaches and methods used in the pilot study on which this project is based&#xD;
      will be combined with new formative data collected at the beginning of the project to enhance&#xD;
      the intervention's feeding and physical activity components. Each component in the&#xD;
      community-wide interventions will be collaboratively designed with the tribes, and tailored&#xD;
      to each community's needs. Trained peer counselors will deliver the family interventions,&#xD;
      during a series of 12 cluster visits, each covering a different developmental stage of the&#xD;
      infant/toddler.&#xD;
