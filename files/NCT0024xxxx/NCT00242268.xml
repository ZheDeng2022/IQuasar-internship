      The purpose of this study is to determine if using Avonex in combination with Zocor is a safe&#xD;
      and effective therapy for subjects with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the Central Nervous&#xD;
      System (CNS). There are many forms of MS; althoughthe majority are Relapsing Remitting (RRMS)&#xD;
      representing approximately 80% of the cases. The disease appears to be more inflammatory in&#xD;
      RRMS as manisfested by an increase inGadolinium enhancement on MRI and an increase in&#xD;
      inflammatory bioassay markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zocor is in a class of drugs (statins) that are used to lower cholesterol. Statins also have&#xD;
      an anti-inflammatory effect on the CNS. Zocor has been shown in a small clinical trial to&#xD;
      reduce the number of new MRI-detected brain lesions over a six month treatment period in&#xD;
      patients with RRMS. This study is to evaluate the safety of combining Avonex with Zocor for a&#xD;
      a period of fourteen months in patients with RRMS and to evaluate the effect of treatment on&#xD;
      new or enlarging lesions as measured by MRI.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or non-pregnant females age 18-55 who have clinically and laboratory definite&#xD;
             relapsing-remitting MS using the MacDonald criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be taking some form of interferon therapy (Rebif, Avonex or Betaseron)&#xD;
             for a duration of 12 months with documented breakthrough disease as defined:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  or = 1 documented clinical relapse in past 12 months while on interferon therapy.&#xD;
                  For eligibility, a pre-study relapse is defined as neurologic symptoms and signs&#xD;
                  documented by review of the history with the subject or in the medical record, of&#xD;
                  sufficient severity and duration to be determined by the investigator as&#xD;
                  consistent with an acute MS relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The relapse does not need to have been treated to qualify. the timing of the relapse&#xD;
             is defined based on the onset of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             &gt; or = 1 documented Gd-enhancing lesion on cranial or spinal MRI. The presence of a&#xD;
             Gd-enhancing lesion must be documented either by a report in the medical record or&#xD;
             review of the films by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The Kurtzke EDSS score must be between 0- 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All subjects must give written consent prior to evaluation and testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with primary or secondary progressive MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Female patients may not be pregnant, attempting pregnancy or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female subjects must use an acceptable form of contraception during the study as&#xD;
             defined by the investigators. The rhythm method is not to be used as the sole method&#xD;
             of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects unwilling or unable to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects that are NAB+ (titers &gt; or = 20).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Abnormal baseline blood test exceeding any of the limits defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ALT or AST &gt; 2x upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. CPK &gt; 2x upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Total WBC &lt; 3,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No chronic infections (including HIV and Hepatitis B/C) may be present.&#xD;
