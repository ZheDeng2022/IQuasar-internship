      The primary purpose of the study is to determine if the central feature of the Therapeutic&#xD;
      Workplace, the abstinence reinforcement contingency, is critical to initiate cocaine&#xD;
      abstinence in injection drug using methadone patients who use cocaine consistently during&#xD;
      methadone treatment. All subjects initially will be invited to attend the Therapeutic&#xD;
      Workplace for an initial period, but abstinence will not be required to work during that&#xD;
      time. During this initial period, vouchers will be contingent only on workplace attendance&#xD;
      and performance on the training programs. Subjects (n=70) who attend the workplace&#xD;
      consistently during the first 4 weeks of treatment, but who continue to use cocaine will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to a Work Only or an Abstinence Plus Work group. Subjects in the Work Only&#xD;
      group will continue to be able to work independent of their urinalysis results. However,&#xD;
      subjects in the Abstinence Plus Work group will be required to provide urine samples that&#xD;
      show evidence of recent cocaine abstinence. Subjects in both groups will be invited to stay&#xD;
      in the workplace for 6 months. We expect the subjects in the Abstinence and Work group will&#xD;
      achieve higher rates of abstinence than the subjects in the Work Only group. This result&#xD;
      would show that the abstinence reinforcement contingency (i.e., the requirement to provide&#xD;
      cocaine-free urine samples to work and earn vouchers) is important in the initiation of&#xD;
      abstinence in the study population.&#xD;

      Methods Setting and Materials This study was conducted at the Center for Learning and Health,&#xD;
      a treatment-research unit at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Baltimore, MD. The&#xD;
      therapeutic workplace included a workplace sign-in station and urinalysis laboratory, and&#xD;
      three workrooms (and associated staff space) where training occurred. When participants&#xD;
      arrived at the workplace each day, they reported to the workplace sign-in station located at&#xD;
      the entrance to the urinalysis laboratory. Staff sat on the laboratory side of the entrance&#xD;
      at the workplace sign-in station desk, which was equipped with a Dell personal computer and&#xD;
      electronic barcode reader (Unitech速 Barcode Slot Reader model # MS140I-2, St Louis, MO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine and breath samples were collected and tested in the urinalysis laboratory. Breath&#xD;
      samples were tested for alcohol with the AlcoSensor III (Intoximeter, St. Louis, MO). Females&#xD;
      provided urine samples directly into Commode Specimen Containers (Catalog #00077, Sage&#xD;
      Products, Inc., Crystal Lake, IL) that were placed directly on the toilet. The urine samples&#xD;
      were then temperature tested and transferred to storage cups. Males provided samples directly&#xD;
      into paper cups, which were then temperature tested and transferred to storage cups. All&#xD;
      urine samples were temperature tested using an F-1500 Electronic Thermometer (Sherwood&#xD;
      Medical, St. Louis, MO). The urinalysis laboratory contained an Abbott AxSYM速 immunoassay&#xD;
      system for urine testing. The AxSYM速 employs fluorescent polarization immunoassay (FPIA)&#xD;
      technology (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants received the therapeutic workplace training programs in three workrooms (a total&#xD;
      of 161 m2) that contained a total of 47 individual three-sided workstations (155 cm tall x 64&#xD;
      cm deep x 126 cm wide). Each workstation was equipped with a desktop (60 cm deep x 121 cm&#xD;
      wide); a height adjustable chair with arms; a Dell personal computer, keyboard and mouse.&#xD;
      Keyboards were covered with removable plastic covers (Protect Keyboard Cover, West Bountiful,&#xD;
      UT) that were painted black that so that the letters on the keys could not be read while&#xD;
      typing. Each participant was given a water bottle, headphones for listening to music CDs&#xD;
      during training on the personal computer, a cooler for storing lunch, and picture frames to&#xD;
      personalize the workstation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three workrooms opened into a central area (31 m2) where the workroom assistants sat to&#xD;
      monitor the activities of participants in the workrooms. Participants had to pass through the&#xD;
      central staff area to enter and leave the workrooms. The central area was equipped with three&#xD;
      desks, each with a personal computer. Each desk also was equipped with a Unitech速 electronic&#xD;
      barcode slot reader.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the participant and staff computers were interconnected through a high-speed (T1) line&#xD;
      to central Dell PowerEdge servers. All of the typing, keypad and data entry training&#xD;
      programs; monitoring of the work time and earnings; and the voucher system were controlled by&#xD;
      a custom web-based therapeutic workplace software application program that resided on one of&#xD;
      the PowerEdge servers (Silverman et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Participant Selection The Western Institutional Review Board approved this&#xD;
      study. Participants were enrolled in this study from April 2003 to November 2003. To recruit&#xD;
      participants, flyers and letters were distributed to 11 Baltimore City methadone programs&#xD;
      inviting unemployed adults in methadone treatment to apply to enroll in a study that provided&#xD;
      job skills training and monetary vouchers. Research staff also visited the methadone&#xD;
      treatment programs to describe the study to methadone treatment staff (e.g., counselors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested individuals who approached or called research staff first completed an anonymous&#xD;
      brief screening interview in which they were asked 8 questions designed to determine quickly&#xD;
      if they might be eligible for the study. Some of the questions were added to conceal the&#xD;
      eligibility requirements. The interview asked the individuals' age, marital status,&#xD;
      employment status, drugs and routes of administration used in the past 30 days, what type of&#xD;
      drug abuse treatment they currently receive, whether they receive welfare benefits, how much&#xD;
      they earned through employment in the past 30 days, and whether they have any of several&#xD;
      medical conditions (e.g., asthma, HIV). Brief screening interviews were conducted over the&#xD;
      phone, in person at the methadone treatment programs, or in person at the Center for Learning&#xD;
      and Health. Applicants were invited to participate in a full screening interview if they&#xD;
      reported that they were 18 years or older, were unemployed, injected heroin or cocaine, used&#xD;
      cocaine or crack in the past 30 days, and if they were currently enrolled in methadone&#xD;
      maintenance treatment in Baltimore City.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full screening interview. At the beginning of the full screening interview, participants were&#xD;
      invited to sign the initial screening consent form. Participants were required to pass a&#xD;
      written quiz about the details of the consent form to participate. Participants were also&#xD;
      required to read a paragraph of the consent form aloud and to read at least 80% of the words&#xD;
      correctly to continue in the full screening interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline period. Eligible participants were invited to attend the workplace for 4 hours every&#xD;
      weekday for 8 weeks. Mandatory urine samples were collected prior to work every Monday,&#xD;
      Wednesday and Friday. All samples were tested for cocaine and opiates. During the first 4&#xD;
      weeks, participants could attend the workplace independent of their urinalysis results and&#xD;
      earn a base pay of $8.00 per hour plus pay for performance on training programs. To encourage&#xD;
      brief breaks, participants could earn 5 minutes of paid break for every 55 minutes worked.&#xD;
      Pay was earned in vouchers exchangeable for goods and services. At the end of baseline,&#xD;
      participants who attended the workplace at least 50% of the workdays, provided at least two&#xD;
      cocaine-positive urine samples, and were still enrolled in methadone treatment were invited&#xD;
      to participate in the main randomized controlled portion of the study. Other participants&#xD;
      could continue to work for 4 additional weeks, but were required to provide urine samples&#xD;
      that indicated recent abstinence from opiates and cocaine to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Groups Stratification and random assignment. Participants enrolled in&#xD;
      the main study (N = 56) were randomly assigned to the Work Only (n = 28) or Abstinence &amp; Work&#xD;
      (n = 28) group. Immediately prior to actual assignment, a study coordinator, who did not have&#xD;
      direct contact with participants, randomized participants using a computer program and a&#xD;
      stratification procedure (similar to Silverman et al., 2004) based on a) whether 75% or more&#xD;
      of the participant's baseline urine samples tested positive for cocaine (Y/N), and b) whether&#xD;
      100% of the participant's baseline urine samples tested positive for cocaine (Y/N).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups. Both groups were invited to attend the workplace throughout a 26-week&#xD;
      intervention period. Participants in both groups continued to provide mandatory urine samples&#xD;
      and could earn base and performance pay. Both groups also received the same feedback as to&#xD;
      the results of the urinalysis testing. The two groups differed only in that participants in&#xD;
      the Abstinence &amp; Work group were required to provide urine samples that indicated recent&#xD;
      cocaine abstinence (i.e., decreased urinary benzoylecgonine concentration of 20% per day from&#xD;
      the last sample provided or benzoylecgonine concentration at or below 300 ng/mL; adapted from&#xD;
      procedures developed by Preston, Schuster, Silverman &amp; Cone, 1997) to gain access to the&#xD;
      workplace and to maintain the maximum base pay of $8.00 per hour. If the participant ever&#xD;
      provided a urine sample that did not meet the criteria for recent cocaine abstinence or if&#xD;
      the participant failed to provide a scheduled sample, the participant was not allowed to work&#xD;
      that day and the participant's base pay was decreased to $1.00 per hour. In addition, the&#xD;
      participant was required to provide a urine sample every workday until the participant&#xD;
      provided a sample that met the abstinence requirement. After a participant's base pay was&#xD;
      reset, it increased by $1.00 per hour to a maximum of $8.00 per hour for every day that the&#xD;
      participant met the cocaine abstinence requirement and worked at least 5 minutes. The voucher&#xD;
      system and the schedule of escalating reinforcement for sustained abstinence and workplace&#xD;
      attendance was adapted from a system developed by Higgins et al., 1991.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Workplace Procedures Urine collection, testing and feedback. After signing into the&#xD;
      workplace on mandatory urine days (typically Monday, Wednesday and Friday of each week),&#xD;
      participants were required to provide a urine and breath sample under observation by a&#xD;
      same-gender research staff member. Urine collection was performed using well-developed and&#xD;
      elaborate urine-collection procedures designed to ensure the collection of valid urine&#xD;
      samples. Urine samples were tested for cocaine and opiates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants who had to provide evidence of recent cocaine abstinence to enter the&#xD;
      workroom, immediately after the participant provided the urine sample, the sample was tested&#xD;
      and the results (i.e., the quantitative value in ng/mL for benzoylecgonine and the&#xD;
      dichotomous result of negative or positive for opiates) were entered into the therapeutic&#xD;
      workplace software. The software automatically determined whether or not the sample met the&#xD;
      cocaine abstinence criterion for that day, displayed a message reporting the result of that&#xD;
      determination, and printed a feedback graph to be given to the participant. The feedback&#xD;
      graph showed on a log scale the benzoylecgonine concentrations of all samples provided by the&#xD;
      participant over consecutive calendar days, along with a line indicating the criterion for&#xD;
      cocaine abstinence for each of the days. In addition, a text box was printed to the side of&#xD;
      the graph that indicated the results for the current day including the benzoylecgonine&#xD;
      concentration, whether the sample tested negative or positive for opiates, and if the&#xD;
      participant was granted access to the workplace. If the sample met the cocaine abstinence&#xD;
      requirement, the sign-in station assistant gave the participant his or her bar-coded picture&#xD;
      ID card to bring to the workroom assistant to gain entrance to the participant's workroom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During conditions in which there were no contingencies on cocaine abstinence to gain access&#xD;
      to the workplace (i.e., during the baseline period and during the intervention period for the&#xD;
      Work Only participants), immediately after a participant provided a urine sample and before&#xD;
      the sample was tested, the sign-in station assistant handed the participant his or her&#xD;
      bar-coded picture ID card to bring to the workroom assistant to gain entrance to the&#xD;
      participant's workroom. Later that day, the participant's sample was tested, the results were&#xD;
      entered into the therapeutic workplace software, and a feedback graph (identical to the one&#xD;
      described above) was printed and delivered to the participant.&#xD;
