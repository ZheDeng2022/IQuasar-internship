  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an evaluation of the effect that an online live action, dramatic vignette about four&#xD;
      gay men, two HIV positive and two HIV negative, struggling with the responsibility for safer&#xD;
      sex has on the sexual behavior and HIV testing intentions of the gay/bisexual men who watch&#xD;
      the vignette and participate in the evaluation study. The primary hypothesis is that men will&#xD;
      be more likely to: 1)express the intent to have an HIV test and 2) to express the intent to&#xD;
      inform their sex partners of their HIV status after watching the vignette. The secondary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that men will be more likely to follow through on these intentions in the three&#xD;
      months following the intervention than they were in the three months before viewing the&#xD;
      vignette. This is a one group pre-posttest intervention in which each man serves as his own&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

      -  Men over 18 years of age will be recruited for the study through a banner posted on the&#xD;
           exit page of manhunt.net an internet gay hook-up site. Those clicking on the banner will&#xD;
           go to the evaluation website (www.hivbigdeal.org)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  asked to read the consent and click agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  asked to complete a relatively brief questionnaire about their sexual behavior, HIV&#xD;
           testing and HIV disclosure in the preceding three months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  watch the 8 minute dramatic vignette&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete a brief questionnaire that elicits their response to the video and their HIV&#xD;
           testing and disclosure intentions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if they agree to provide the study with their e-mail address, participants will be&#xD;
           re-contacted in three months and asked to complete a second behavioral survey online&#xD;
           that asks about sexual behavior, HIV testing and HIV disclosure in the three months&#xD;
           since watching the vignette.Behavior before and after watching the vignette will be&#xD;
           compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The entire study will be conducted online.&#xD;
