      This study will compare the effectiveness of Tai Chi (a sequence of slow, graceful body&#xD;
      movements) and a cardiovascular exercise fitness program in improving physical fitness and&#xD;
      endurance, reducing stress and improving well-being in adult survivors of cancer. Tai Chi,&#xD;
      described by some as a moving form of yoga and meditation combined, evolved from martial arts&#xD;
      and breathing exercises in China hundreds of years ago. This study uses the 24-posture&#xD;
      standardized Tai Chi. The movements are continuous, smooth, and natural, with the upper and&#xD;
      lower parts of the body following each other. The entire body is always in motion, with the&#xD;
      movements performed gently and at a uniform speed. The exercise training program uses an&#xD;
      exercise machine. The training regimen is adjusted to maintain the individual's average&#xD;
      training heart rate at 70 to 80 percent heart rate reserve; i.e., 220 minus the person's age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer survivors of solid tumor cancers who are between 18 and 65 years of age, whose&#xD;
      treatment included chemotherapy, biologic agents or vaccines, who have had no cancer&#xD;
      treatment for at least 24 months, and who have had no evaluable disease within 3 months of&#xD;
      screening for this study may be eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to one of three study groups: Tai Chi, exercise training,&#xD;
      or a waiting list. Individuals in the Tai Chi and exercise training groups participate in a&#xD;
      supervised program for 1 hour 3 times a week for 12 weeks in the NIH Clinical Center's&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Medicine department. Individuals assigned to the waiting list are followed for&#xD;
      12 weeks during the waiting period and are then assigned to either the Tai Chi or exercise&#xD;
      program for another 12 weeks as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At three time points during the study-before starting the program and after 6 weeks and 12&#xD;
      weeks of practicing the study intervention or being on the waiting list-participants undergo&#xD;
      the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete questionnaires regarding their quality of life and stress&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation medicine evaluation, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about managing their daily activities, whether their skills have changed over&#xD;
           time, what they may or may not have been able to do, or what they may have had to&#xD;
           overcome as a result of their previous illness and the study program they have been&#xD;
           practicing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of strength and mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of overall physical fitness and endurance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cell counts and cholesterol, lipid, hormone and mineral&#xD;
           levels&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diagnosis and treatment for cancer represent a major life-time stressor for any patient.&#xD;
      While the diagnosis of a life-threatening illness is stressful, undergoing treatment for&#xD;
      cancer including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy result in stress to the patient. In&#xD;
      addition, cancer treatment frequently is associated with fatigue, physical de-conditioning&#xD;
      and metabolic abnormalities characteristic of the metabolic syndrome, leading to speculations&#xD;
      that cancer therapy may render survivors more prone to developing metabolic syndrome and its&#xD;
      sequelae, cardiovascular disease. In a recently conducted study we detected a high incidence&#xD;
      of hyperlipidemia and increased body fat content, decreased aerobic performance and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal functioning and a high frequency of parameters of psychological distress in&#xD;
      long-term survivors of pediatric sarcoma. Based on these data and findings, it appears&#xD;
      desirable to devise a program that would help cancer survivors not only to improve&#xD;
      musculoskeletal functioning and aerobic performance, as a physical exercise program would&#xD;
      offer, but in addition relieve psychological stress and enhance the well-being of cancer&#xD;
      survivors after completion of treatment with multimodality therapy. Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) has&#xD;
      been used in Asian culture for centuries to improve wellness, reduce stress, and to promote&#xD;
      healing by improving the flow of Qi. While a number of studies have provided scientific&#xD;
      support for these claims in different populations, a beneficial role for TCC in the&#xD;
      management of cancer survivors has not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare in a randomized, wait-list controlled design, the efficacy of TCC&#xD;
      to an exercise program in improving aerobic exercise capacity and endurance, reducing stress&#xD;
      and improving Quality of Life in adult survivors of malignant solid tumors.&#xD;
