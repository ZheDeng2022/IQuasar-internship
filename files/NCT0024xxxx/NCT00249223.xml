      The primary purpose of the study is to show that treatment with an injectable formulation of&#xD;
      risperidone is not less effective than and has a similar safety profile to risperidone&#xD;
      tablets in patients with chronic schizophrenia.&#xD;

      Chronic schizophrenia is a longer-term condition that is characterized by a lack of drive,&#xD;
      underactivity and slowness, and social withdrawal. As with the acute form of schizophrenia,&#xD;
      delusions and hallucinations are common. Based on the severity and long-term nature of this&#xD;
      disease, it is important that patients take their antipsychotic medication regularly.&#xD;
      Long-acting injectable forms of antipsychotic drugs may eliminate the need for daily oral&#xD;
      medication and increase a patient's compliance in taking their medication as prescribed by&#xD;
      their physician. This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study comparing the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of an injectable formulation of risperidone (coated microspheres) to&#xD;
      risperidone tablets in patients with chronic, stable schizophrenia. The study is composed of&#xD;
      a screening visit, followed by two study phases: an 8-week run-in period and a 12-week&#xD;
      double-blind period. In the run-in phase, patients discontinue from other antipsychotic&#xD;
      drugs, begin receiving oral risperidone, and stay on the optimal oral risperidone dose that&#xD;
      is determined for each patient for 4 weeks before starting the double-blind period. Patients&#xD;
      are then randomized to either risperidone tablets or the injectable risperidone formulation&#xD;
      at the dose level established during the last 4 weeks of run-in. For the next 12 weeks&#xD;
      patients receive an injection of risperidone every 2 weeks plus daily oral doses of placebo&#xD;
      or receive a placebo injection every 2 weeks plus daily oral doses of resperidone tablets.&#xD;
      The primary measure of effectiveness is the change from baseline in the total score for the&#xD;
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS), a rating scale that measures&#xD;
      the symptoms of schizophrenia. Additional efficacy testing includes the Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impressions (CGI), a rating system used to evaluate the severity of clinical change in a&#xD;
      patient with various diseases affecting the brain. Safety evaluations include the incidence&#xD;
      of adverse events, results of clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry,&#xD;
      urinalysis), measurements of vital signs and body weight, physical examination and&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, clinical examination of the injection area (buttocks), and&#xD;
      the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS), a scale used to measure effects of&#xD;
      antipsychotic medications on motor functions of the patient. The study hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      injectable formulation of risperidone will not be less effective than oral risperidone&#xD;
      tablets. The injectable formulation of risperidone will be considered less effective than&#xD;
      oral risperidone if the improvement in total PANSS with injectable risperidone is more than 6&#xD;
      points worse than the improvement with oral risperidone. Risperidone injections (25, 50 or&#xD;
      75milligrams [mg]) starting Day 1 of the double-blind phase, then every 2 weeks (total of 12&#xD;
      weeks) or 2, 4, or 6mg/day risperidone tablets, starting Day 1 of the run-in period and&#xD;
      continuing for the rest of the study.&#xD;
