  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the addition of CONCERTA®&#xD;
      (methylphenidate hydrochloride, a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant) or placebo in adult&#xD;
      outpatients with Major Depressive Disorder who are currently being treated with oral&#xD;
      antidepressant medication (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or selective norepinephine&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors). The general symptoms of depression will be evaluated, as measured by&#xD;
      the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Score (MADRS) on fatigue, energy, and overall&#xD;
      severity of illness. The safety and tolerability of the CONCERTA® and antidepressant&#xD;
      combination therapy will also be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient response to antidepressant therapy is low and 10-30% of depressed patients fail to&#xD;
      respond to antidepressant therapy and of those patients who do respond, 50-75% exhibit a&#xD;
      partial response. Augmentation and combination therapy strategies have been used in depressed&#xD;
      subjects to enhance antidepressant response in treatment-resistant patients, to achieve&#xD;
      remission in partial responders and to accelerate response. Augmentation of an antidepressant&#xD;
      with CONCERTA® is an area open to new exploration in the adult population. This is a&#xD;
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicentre trial. Qualified&#xD;
      subjects will have a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, currently treated with an&#xD;
      antidepressant, and will have demonstrated an insufficient treatment response to at least one&#xD;
      but not more than three antidepressants. Subjects will continue their current treatment with&#xD;
      oral antidepressant medication (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or selective&#xD;
      norepinephine reuptake inhibitors) and be randomised to either CONCERTA® 18 mg or placebo.&#xD;
      During the titration phase, subjects will take one tablet for the first 5 days and then be&#xD;
      titrated up to the next dose level every week (2 tablets, then 3 tablets). At Week 4 and Week&#xD;
      5, subjects should be at their optimal, stable dose of the study drug. The maximum dose level&#xD;
      is CONCERTA® 54 mg or placebo (3 tablets). Following titration, there are 5 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. The primary efficacy outcome is the change in total Montgomery Asberg Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale (MADRS) score between the two groups from baseline to the final visit. MADRS is&#xD;
      a clinician-rated scale consisting of 10 items designed to assess a range of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. Safety and tolerability of study drug will be based on adverse events and clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests, ECG, vital signs and physical examination. The study hypothesis is that&#xD;
      when CONCERTA® is added to antidepressant therapy, there will be a rapid, tolerable and&#xD;
      overall improvement in symptoms of depression, as measured by the total Montgomery Asberg&#xD;
      Depression Rating Score (MADRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to a once-daily starting dose of 18mg CONCERTA® or 1 tablet of&#xD;
      placebo to be taken orally. Provided patients are tolerating the study medication, they will&#xD;
      be titrated weekly. There are 3 weeks of titration and one dose reduction allowed. The&#xD;
      maximum dose level is 54 mg per day (3 tablets). By week 4 and week 5, subjects should be at&#xD;
      their optimal dose. Following titration, there are 5 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
