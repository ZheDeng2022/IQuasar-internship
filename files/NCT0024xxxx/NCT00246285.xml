      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of risperidone (an&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication) in adolescents with schizophrenia over 6 months of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the safety and effectiveness of antipsychotic medications is well-established in&#xD;
      adults with schizophrenia, these drugs have not been examined rigorously in adolescents with&#xD;
      this disorder. Preliminary experience suggests that risperidone may hold promise for the&#xD;
      treatment of these younger subjects. This is an open-label, multicenter trial of risperidone,&#xD;
      formulated as an oral solution and tablets, in the treatment of adolescents with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. It is an open-label, 6-month extension of two previous double-blind studies&#xD;
      that assessed the safety and effectiveness of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia&#xD;
      in an adolescent population. Patients may also enroll directly in this open-label trial.&#xD;
      During the first week of the study, patients will receive increasing doses of risperidone to&#xD;
      reach an optimal daily dose (2 to 6 mg/day), which will be maintained throughout the 6 months&#xD;
      of the study. Assessments of effectiveness include the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale&#xD;
      for Schizophrenia (PANSS), a scale measuring the symptoms of schizophrenia, the Clinical&#xD;
      Global Impression-Severity of Illness subscale (CGI-Severity), a scale measuring the severity&#xD;
      of illness, the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement subscale (CGI-Improvement), a scale&#xD;
      measuring clinical improvement, and the Children's Global Assessment Scale. Safety&#xD;
      evaluations include the incidence of adverse events throughout the study, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, and&#xD;
      temperature), weight, and electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings at specified intervals. The&#xD;
      study hypothesis is that risperidone with be effective in the treatment of adolescents with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, and well tolerated. Risperidone, oral solution (1 mg/ml) once daily; dose&#xD;
      increasing from 0.01 mg/kg body weight (Day 1) to a range from 2 to 6 mg/day for 6 months.&#xD;
      Oral tablets (0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mg) once daily; dose increasing from 0.5 mg (Day 1) to a&#xD;
      range of 2 to 6 mg/day for 6 months.&#xD;
