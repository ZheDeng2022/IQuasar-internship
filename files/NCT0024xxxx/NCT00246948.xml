      This Study si designed as a Prospective clinical controlled randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reviews have demonstrated no or little efficacy for passive conservative treatment modalities&#xD;
      for patients suffering from sciatica. The results of surgery are conflicting. Cohort studies&#xD;
      have shown a high efficacy for active treatment modalities in patients with sciatica. The&#xD;
      current trend in treatment of low back pain without sciatica is focusing on active&#xD;
      conservative treatment like information and advice to stay active and exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of two active conservative treatment programs for patients with&#xD;
      severe sciatica.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In a prospective clinical controlled randomized trial, 181 consecutive patients with&#xD;
      radicular pain below the knee were examined at baseline, 8 weeks later at post treatment&#xD;
      follow-up, and at one year follow-up and MR-scanned at baseline and one year follow-up. The&#xD;
      treatment consisted of four elements: 1-3 were identical in both groups. 1. Thorough&#xD;
      information concerning anatomy, pathogenesis, how discs heal without surgery, and&#xD;
      encouragement to stay as active as possible but to reduce activity if an increase in leg pain&#xD;
      occurs. 2.&quot; Tender love and care&quot;. 3. Medication; this was optional and only weak analgesic&#xD;
      and NSAIDs were recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Element 4 consisted of two different exercise programs. Symptom guided exercises consisted of&#xD;
      a variety of back related exercises and optional manual treatment. The exercises were given&#xD;
      after an algorithm, where different symptoms or a response to exercises determined the&#xD;
      exercises given. The other group, Sham exercises had voluntary not back related exercises.&#xD;
      The exercises were aimed at increasing the general blood circulation and maintaining strength&#xD;
      in the extremities. Outcome measures were functional status, pain, MRI findings, clinical&#xD;
      findings, and history&#xD;

      Summary of Background Data. Sciatica as a result of a herniated disk is a fairly common&#xD;
      problem; studies have shown a life time prevalence of 4-5 % in the Scandinavian population.&#xD;
      Though a herniated disk is a benign disease with a relatively good prognosis, the pain and&#xD;
      functional loss, are in most patients rather considerable over a period of some months&#xD;
      Reviews have demonstrated no or little efficacy for passive conservative treatment&#xD;
      modalities. Results for surgery are conflicting. Cohort studies have shown a high efficacy&#xD;
      for active treatment modalities in patients with sciatica.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current trend in back treatment is information and advice to stay active including active&#xD;
      treatment modalities in which patients are given responsibility during the treatment process&#xD;
      and the treatment assumes the role of a &quot;coach&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. To evaluate the efficacy of two active conservative treatment programs for&#xD;
      patients with severe sciatica.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A prospective clinical controlled randomized trial including 181 consecutive patients&#xD;
      with radicular pain below the knee. The patients were examined at baseline, 8 weeks later at&#xD;
      post treatment follow-up, and, and MR-scanned at baseline and at the one year follow-up The&#xD;
      treatment consisted of four elements; 1-3 were identical in both groups. 1. Thorough&#xD;
      information concerning anatomy, pathogenesis, how discs heal without surgery, and&#xD;
      encouragement to stay as active as possible but to reduce activity if an increase in leg pain&#xD;
      occurs. 2. Tender love and care. 3. Medication, this was optional and only weak analgesic and&#xD;
      NSAID'S were recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Element 4 was divided into a &quot;Hands on&quot; and &quot;Hands off&quot;, utilizing two different exercise&#xD;
      programs. &quot;Hands on&quot; consisted of a variety of back related exercises and optional manual&#xD;
      treatment. The exercises were given after a strict algorithm, where different symptoms or a&#xD;
      response to exercises determined the exercises given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Hands off&quot; exercises were optional and generally not back related. They were geared towards&#xD;
      increasing general blood circulation and maintaining strength in the extremities.&#xD;
