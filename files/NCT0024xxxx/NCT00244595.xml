  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to describe candesartan cilexetil antihypertensive effects&#xD;
      in terms of achieved blood pressure and hypertension control rates and the relationship&#xD;
      between subject characteristics and antihypertensive efficacy, and between antihypertensive&#xD;
      therapy (candesartan cilexetil dose and add-on treatments) and efficacy over a 1 year&#xD;
      treatment period in hypertensive children ages 6 to &lt; 17 years; to describe growth in terms&#xD;
      of height and weight in the study population; to describe change in neurocognition as&#xD;
      assessed by the Full Scaled IQ score in a subset of study subjects; to determine the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive paediatric subjects ages 6 to &lt; 17 years; and&#xD;
      to describe safety including adverse events and adverse events necessitating study drug&#xD;
      discontinuation including dose level and dose duration relationships and growth over a 1 year&#xD;
      period in hypertensive children age 6 to &lt; 17 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subjects must have fulfilled the eligibility criteria for and have participated in&#xD;
             Study 261A or did not participate in Study 261A but meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed and untreated hypertension, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed and treated, but off antihypertensive treatment for at least 2 days with a&#xD;
             mean sitting systolic blood pressure and/or sitting diastolic blood pressure ≥ 95th&#xD;
             percentile and ≤ 20 mm Hg (systolic) and/or 10 (diastolic) mm Hg above the 95th&#xD;
             percentile based on height-adjusted charts for age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential (post-menarche), must have a negative urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test and adhere to a pregnancy prevention method (abstinence, a barrier&#xD;

             the investigator or sponsor, may interfere with the subject's participation in the&#xD;
             study or would pose a significant risk to the subject or interfere with the assessment&#xD;
             of safety and efficacy endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypertension secondary to coarctation of the aorta, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism,&#xD;
