    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)is effective in&#xD;
      treating patients with PKU.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria(PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the enzyme&#xD;
      phenylalanine hydroxylase(PAH). this incidence of PKU in the US is about 1:15,000 births. The&#xD;
      disease is pan ethnic with more prevalence among individuals of European ancestry. Recently,&#xD;
      a number of patients with PKU showed a marked decrease in their blood Phe levels when the&#xD;
      cofactor for PAH, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) was given orally. All these patients had&#xD;
      mutations in PAH while the metabolism of BH4 was normal. These observations were confirmed by&#xD;
      several centers including a pilot study conducted in our institutions. In the study in our&#xD;
      centers, we have identified 21 of 36 patients tested who responded favorably to BH4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognizing the difficulties with phenylalanine restricted diet, an NIH Consensus Conference&#xD;
      on PKU held in 1999, encouraged exploring different modalities for treating PKU, and BH4 is&#xD;
      among these modalities. This proposal is a three year, double blind placebo control,&#xD;
      multi-center study. An oral load of 10 mg/kg BH4 wil be given to patients with PKU to&#xD;
      identify those that respond with lowering of blood Phe greater or equal to 30%. Blood Phe,&#xD;
      tyrosine and dietary intake will be determined at zero time and 24 hours post load. From this&#xD;
      group of BH4 responsive individuals, thirty-six will be enrolled in the double blind study.&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to the treatment of placebo group. Those who enter the trial will&#xD;
      have zero time assessments including blood Phe and tyrosine, dietary intake, physical exam,&#xD;
      kidney function, liver function and complete blood count (CBC). Phe and tyrosine and diet&#xD;
      intakes, two prior to the study and the zero time, will be averaged and used as the baseline&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be assigned randomly to take either 10mg/kg of BH4 orally or a placebo&#xD;
      without BH4. Blood Phe, tyrosine and dietary intake will be obtained every other week&#xD;
      throughout the 12 week study period. Liver function and kidney function and CBC's will be&#xD;
      obtained monthly. Side effects will be evaluated and noted. Subjects will be instructed to&#xD;
      record two day diet diaries prior to blood Phe sampling throughout the study. The NIH&#xD;
      Consensus Report suggests maintaining blood Phe&lt; 36 umol/l when less than 12 years of age or&#xD;
      up to 900 umol/l after 12 years of age. These levels will be used to determine the efficacy&#xD;
      end points of the study. At the end of three months, blood Phe and tyrosine, dietary intake,&#xD;
      physical exam, kidney function, liver function and CBC will be performed. At this time&#xD;
      efficacy of BH4 will be determined and all subjects will continue in an open label 12 weeks&#xD;
      BH4 treatment, (10mg/kg/day), with assessments collected as in the first phase of the study.&#xD;
      After the subject has had both phases they will be followed for an additional 3 months. The&#xD;
      additional 3 month trial on BH4 will provide long term safety data from 18 subjects who took&#xD;
      BH4 in both the first and second phase in a continuous fashion.&#xD;
