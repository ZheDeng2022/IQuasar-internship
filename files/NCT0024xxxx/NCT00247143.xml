  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of higher&#xD;
      doses of lopinavir/ritonavir, in combination with other anti-HIV medications when&#xD;
      administered as either the capsule or liquid formulations, among patients who have not had&#xD;
      full viral suppression despite treatment with 3 classes of HIV medications, and at least 2&#xD;
      prior courses of treatment with HIV protease inhibitors. In addition, pharmacokinetics of the&#xD;
      active agents, lopinavir and ritonavir will be measured following administration of both the&#xD;
      liquid and capsule formulations and compared.&#xD;

      This study is a safety, efficacy, and tolerability study of high dose kaletra in patients who&#xD;
      have failed multiple antiretroviral regimens, including prior treatment with 3 classes of&#xD;
      antiretroviral drugs (nucleoside/nucleotide analogues, non-nucleoside analogues, and at least&#xD;
      one protease inhibitor based ARV regimen), in conjunction with optimized background therapy.&#xD;
      Patients will initially be treated with high dose kaletra capsules and optimized background&#xD;
      therapy for 4 weeks and then switched to equivalent doses of high dose kaletra liquid&#xD;
      formulation for a total duration of therapy of 24 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study&#xD;
      will be the average HIV RNA change from baseline through 24 weeks (HIV RNA AACUMB). Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will include the proportion achieving HIV RNA &lt; 50 and HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL at&#xD;
      24 weeks. Changes in CD4 from baseline, change in LPV fold change in phenotypic resistance&#xD;
      testing, changes in fasting metabolic parameters, assessment of safety at week 24 based upon&#xD;
      hematology, chemistry, liver function, lipid levels, proportion of patients reporting adverse&#xD;
      events and proportion of patients with SAEs, and demonstration of bioequivalence by 12 hour&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic measurements.&#xD;

          6. Screening Virologic Phenotype demonstrating lopinavir phenotypic fold resistance&#xD;
             between 10 and 80 (if patients have had Virologic Phenotype within 8 weeks of study&#xD;
             screening this may be used as the qualifying lopinavir phenotypic fold resistance).&#xD;

          7. HIV-1 viral load 1000 copies/mL at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Acceptable screening laboratory values that indicate adequate baseline organ function.&#xD;
