  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use an experimental method of delivering the enzyme glucocerebrosidase&#xD;
      directly into the brain of a patient with Gaucher disease to treat disease symptoms. Patients&#xD;
      with Gaucher disease have insufficient levels of glucocerebrosidase. As a result, substances&#xD;
      normally broken down by this enzyme accumulate in the body, causing damage to the brain and&#xD;
      other organs. Symptoms of Gaucher disease outside the brain can be treated by infusing the&#xD;
      missing enzyme intravenously (IV, through a vein). However, IV infusions do not help the&#xD;
      neurologic symptoms of the disease, because the enzyme cannot get into the brain. This study&#xD;
      will use a new technique called convection-enhanced delivery to try to introduce&#xD;
      glucocerebrosidase directly into the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-patient study includes an 8-month-old male with Type 2 Gaucher disease with&#xD;
      progressive neurological decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for the enzyme infusion, the patient will have a complete physical&#xD;
      examination, including a detailed neurological examination, and blood and urine tests. On the&#xD;
      day of surgery, the child will be placed under general anesthesia for magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) of the brain. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of&#xD;
      body tissues and organs. For this procedure, the child lies on a table that is moved into the&#xD;
      scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to protect his hearing from the loud knocking&#xD;
      and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. He will then be brought to the&#xD;
      operating room for the infusion procedure, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An incision will be made in the scalp and a small hole drilled through the skull. Then, a&#xD;
      small tube (cannula) will be positioned through the hole into the target area in the brain.&#xD;
      Once the tip of the cannula is in place, it will be connected with tubing to a syringe filled&#xD;
      with glucocerebrosidase in saline (salt water). The child will then have a second MRI scan to&#xD;
      make sure the cannula is placed correctly and to monitor delivery of the glucocerebrosidase&#xD;
      to the brain. The child will be monitored closely with MRI scans every 30 to 60 minutes&#xD;
      during the infusion to look for fluid in the brain and determine the extent of the enzyme&#xD;
      perfusion. The infusion will last no longer than 6 hours and will be stopped when the full&#xD;
      dose of enzyme has been delivered. The cannula will be removed and the scalp incision closed.&#xD;
      The child will stay in the hospital for observation from 4 to 10 days, with at least 24 hours&#xD;
      in the intensive care unit and 3 to 7 days in the pediatric unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child will be seen in the clinic two weeks after discharge and then once a month for 3&#xD;
      months to evaluate any possible effects of the surgery. These follow-up visits include a&#xD;
      repeat MRI scan and neurological examination. After the first 3 months, visits may be less&#xD;
      frequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the child continues to have symptoms during the course of follow-up or his neurologic&#xD;
      status worsens, additional enzyme infusions will be offered, possibly including treatment of&#xD;
      the brainstem. If the child gains no benefit after three infusions have been performed, no&#xD;
      additional infusions will be offered. If there appears to be any neurological benefit,&#xD;
      additional infusions may be offered.&#xD;

      Objective. To overcome the previous delivery limitations and to provide enzyme to the&#xD;
      deficient sites in the central nervous system (CNS) of a Type 2 Gaucher disease patient, we&#xD;
      will investigate the use of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) to perfuse specific sites&#xD;
      within the CNS with glucocerebrosidase in an effort to ameliorate that patient's neurologic&#xD;
      symptomatology and prolong his life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population. This is a single patient study that includes a male infant (8 months of&#xD;
      age) with Type 2 Gaucher disease that has been diagnosed by clinical, laboratory and genetic&#xD;
      testing. The natural history of acute neuronopathic (Type 2) Gaucher disease is progressive&#xD;
      neurological decline that is rapidly fatal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. We propose using CED of glucocerebrosidase to the CNS to treat the neurologic signs&#xD;
      and symptoms in this Type 2 Gaucher patient. Regions of infusion within the CNS will be&#xD;
      targeted based on neurologic findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures. Detailed clinical and neurologic examinations will be performed pre- (3&#xD;
      days before infusion) and post-infusion (1, 14, 30, and 90 days after infusion then every 3&#xD;
      months until study completion) to determine stabilization or improvement in neurologic signs&#xD;
      and symptoms. Survival will also be used to determine the efficacy of this treatment.&#xD;
