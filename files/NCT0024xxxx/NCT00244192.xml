  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether infliximab is effective on fat-free mass in&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with moderate to severe COPD suffering from cachexia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a multicomponent disease characterized by abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs&#xD;
      to noxious particles that accompanied by systemic effects like weight loss, muscle wasting,&#xD;
      reduced functional capacity and health status. A persistent systemic inflammatory response&#xD;
      reflected by enhanced levels of acute phase proteins like C-reactive protein (CRP) or&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) - α, is present in COPD. There&#xD;
      are several studies that indicate that an increased systemic inflammator response is&#xD;
      associated with weight loss, cachexia (loss of fat-free muscle mass), physical functioning&#xD;
      and health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cachexia associated with systemivc inflammation can not always readily be overcome by&#xD;
      nutritional intervention alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that infliximab therapy (3 infusions with 5 mg/kg infliximab&#xD;
      or placebo 1:1 on week 0, 2 and 6) will increase fat-free mass relatively to placebo by&#xD;
      decreasing inflammation. Secondary endpoints are: lung function, muscle function, exercise&#xD;
      capacity and health status. On week 8, 12 and 26 follow-up measurements will be done.&#xD;
