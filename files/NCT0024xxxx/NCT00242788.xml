      The primary objective of the Phase I part of the study is to determine the recommended dose&#xD;
      of capecitabine to be administered in combination with ZD1839 250 mg orally once daily in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer by assessing DLTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the Phase II part of the study is to estimate the objective response&#xD;
      rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) at study closure for ZD1839&#xD;
      administered in combination with capecitabine in subjects with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST).&#xD;
