  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence, incidence, and severity of atherosclerotic disease all markedly increase with&#xD;
      age. Basic experimental and observational data demonstrate that aging magnifies the&#xD;
      pathologic and clinical consequences of established risk factors and is the most potent&#xD;
      individual risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis and for adverse outcomes following an&#xD;
      ischemic event. These findings suggest that normal aging alters the vascular substrate so as&#xD;
      to promote the development and progression of atherosclerosis. The age-associated changes in&#xD;
      vascular structure and function include an increase in central vascular stiffness, intimal&#xD;
      proliferation, and endothelial dysfunction. The major hypothesis is that the above&#xD;
      alterations in vascular substrate (i.e. vascular age) are an important determinant of the age&#xD;
      associated increased likelihood for the development and progression of coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerotic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This program will non-invasively characterize vascular age and atherosclerotic burden in BLSA&#xD;
      participants and individuals with successful aging, i.e. those with no or minimal evidence of&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerotic disease, and those with premature, clinically evident coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. It will repeat measures of vascular age and atherosclerotic burden three&#xD;
      years after the first assessment. By examining the impact of vascular age on the initial&#xD;
      extent and the progression of atherosclerotic burden over a two to three-year period, it will&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that vascular age is an important determinant of the ageassociated&#xD;
      increase in atherosclerotic disease....&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For all groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 30 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ability and willingness to participate in the protocol and undergo vascular studies&#xD;
             and chest MDCT examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the second group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1) Coronary artery calcium score of zero or less than 25th percentile of that expected&#xD;
        based on age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the third group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1) Coronary artery calcium score which is greater than the 50th percentile of that computed&#xD;
        based on age and gender, or known coronary disease on the basis of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i. prior documented myocardial infarction or&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. typical ischemic symptoms and catheterization documented stenosis of greater than or&#xD;
        equal to 70% in at least one major coronary artery&#xD;
&#xD;
        If male, diagnosis was made under 50 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        If female, diagnosis was made under 60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Atrial fibrillation (due to limitations with gating on MDCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For the first 2 groups: History of procedures used for treatment of CVD (CABG,&#xD;
             angioplasty, pacemaker or defibrillator implantation, any surgery on the heart or the&#xD;
             arteries)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active treatment for cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Serious medical condition which could hinder participation or make it unlikely that&#xD;
             they will live for three years (for f/u)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Weight&gt;300 lb (maximum weight allowed on CT tables)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Inability to provide an informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For females, current pregnancy because of the radiation associated with the helical CT&#xD;
             and the unknown risks to a fetus. This is only temporary, and women wishing to&#xD;
             participate may be enrolled six weeks after delivery.&#xD;
