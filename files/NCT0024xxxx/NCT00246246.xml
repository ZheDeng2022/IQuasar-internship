    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of a long-acting&#xD;
      injectable formulation of risperidone in stable bipolar patients randomly switched from their&#xD;
      current add-on oral antipsychotic (olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine) therapy to&#xD;
      long-acting injectable risperidone. The patients switched to long-acting injectable&#xD;
      risperidone will be compared to patients who continue on their oral antipsychotic treatment&#xD;
      regimen&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This an open-label, randomized study. Approximately 40 stable bipolar patients who are on an&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine) plus adjunct bipolar treatment&#xD;
      consisting of (a maximum or two of lithium, valproate or lamotrigine, and, if applicable, one&#xD;
      antidepressant) will be randomized to two arms. In one arm, 25 milligrams of long-acting&#xD;
      injectable risperidone will replace the oral atypical antipsychotic as adjunct therapy and in&#xD;
      the other arm, patients will continue with their current atypical antipsychotic therapy.&#xD;
      Trial duration is 6 months. In the long-acting injectable risperidone arm, the oral atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotic will be continued (as supplementation) for 3 weeks after the first injection of&#xD;
      long-acting risperidone and then discontinued. Investigators, based upon the patient's&#xD;
      response, may increase the dose of injectable risperidone to 37.5 mg after 6 weeks on the&#xD;
      25-mg dose and to 50 mg after at least 4 weeks on the 37.5-mg dose. Risperidone oral&#xD;
      supplementation is allowed. In the oral antipsychotic only arm, the oral atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotic dose can also be increased as required. The primary efficacy outcome will be&#xD;
      measured by changes in the Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness subscale (CGI-S),&#xD;
      from baseline to endpoint, and will be compared between the treatment groups. Safety will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study. The primary hypothesis is that patients switched to&#xD;
      long-acting injectable risperidone will be able to tolerate this formulation of risperidone&#xD;
      and maintain or even improve their reduction in bipolar symptomatology compared with&#xD;
      baseline, and compared with subjects who continue in the oral antipsychotic arm. The&#xD;
      secondary hypothesis is that patients switched to long-acting injectable risperidone will&#xD;
      have a longer time to intervention for a mood episode (either mania or depression) as&#xD;
      compared with subjects who continue in the oral antipsychotic arm. Risperidone, formulated&#xD;
      for intramuscular injection, 25 mg every 2 weeks. Patients treated with injectable&#xD;
      risperidone continue their original oral atypical antipsychotic (AAP) dose for 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Investigators, at their discretion, may increase the dose of injectable risperidone to 37.5&#xD;
      mg after 6 weeks on the 25-mg dose and to 50 mg after at least 4 weeks on the 37.5-mg dose.&#xD;
      Study duration is 6 months.&#xD;
