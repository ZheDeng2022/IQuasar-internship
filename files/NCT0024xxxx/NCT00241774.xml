      To examine the associations among depression, inflammation, and coronary heart disease using&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classic risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) do not yet predict the majority of new&#xD;
      cases. Of the novel risk factors recently explored, elevated depressive symptoms have been&#xD;
      found in a number of prospective studies to predict new CHD cases, as have inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, including high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and&#xD;
      intercellular adhesion molecule. Interestingly, depression and inflammatory markers have high&#xD;
      covariation, and intervention studies indicate that reducing depression may reduce peripheral&#xD;
      inflammation, while successfully treating inflammation may ameliorate depressive symptoms. It&#xD;
      becomes critical then to know if these candidate CHD risk factors are independent or&#xD;
      dependent of the other in the prediction of CHD incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will determine if depressive symptoms and inflammatory markers are independent or&#xD;
      dependent CHD risk factors, when controlling for the other known CAD risk factors. A&#xD;
      population-based prospective study (the Nova Scotia Health Survey; NSHS95) was conducted&#xD;
      almost 10 years ago, in which participants were randomly selected from the socialized medical&#xD;
      registry, which includes all citizens. All classic CHD risk factors were obtained at baseline&#xD;
      (age, sex, race, fasting lipids, diabetic status, family CHD history, resting blood pressure,&#xD;
      exercise levels, body mass index, smoking status, and socioeconomic status). Depressive&#xD;
      symptoms as assessed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale were also&#xD;
      obtained at baseline. Plasma blood samples were obtained and maintained in a -80 degree&#xD;
      (Celsius) freezer. Participants gave permission for medical registry records to be linked to&#xD;
      their survey data, so that objectively documented previous and future CAD events could be&#xD;
      detected. The study will assay plasma samples for CRP, IL-6 and ICAM-1 and then statistically&#xD;
      model the associations among depression, inflammation and CHD incidence.&#xD;

    <description>In 1995, our study participants enrolled in the Nova Scotia Health Study (NSHS95). At the time of enrollment, epidemiologic data as well as blood samples were obtained. The participants have since been followed prospectively for a variety of health outcomes. We plan to assay stored blood samples collected in 1995 for markers of inflammation and link these results to existing epidemiologic and outcomes data, specifically the 7- year incidence of CAD events.</description>
