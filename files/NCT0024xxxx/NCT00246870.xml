  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use brain imaging to map brain cell receptors for a chemical called GABA, a&#xD;
      chemical that inhibits the activities of nerve cells. The study includes patients with&#xD;
      succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, or SSADH (a disorder in which an enzyme&#xD;
      deficiency disrupts GABA metabolism), their parents, and healthy volunteers. SSADH deficiency&#xD;
      causes various neurological and neuromuscular problems, including mild to severe mental&#xD;
      retardation, delays in the acquisition of skills requiring the coordination of mental and&#xD;
      physical activities (psychomotor retardation), delays in language and speech development, and&#xD;
      other symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers 18-55 years of age, patients with SSADH between 5 and 24 years of age, and&#xD;
      parents of patients 18-55 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      scanning as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. For&#xD;
      this procedure, the subject lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow metal&#xD;
      cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field) wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and&#xD;
      thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes&#xD;
      to 3 hours, with most scans lasting between 45 and 90 minutes. Participants may be asked to&#xD;
      lie still for up to 90 minutes at a time. In addition to standard MRI, participants may also&#xD;
      have new types of MRI that may detect brain abnormalities when regular MRI is normal, such as&#xD;
      diffusion tensor MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. There are no noticeable differences&#xD;
      from ordinary MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography&#xD;
&#xD;
      A catheter (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the subject's wrist. The subject lies on a&#xD;
      table with his or her head placed in the scanner. A mask, used to help keep the head still in&#xD;
      the scanner, is placed over the head. The mask is not uncomfortable and has holes for the&#xD;
      subject to see through. A radioactive compound called flumazenil is injected into a vein. The&#xD;
      scan takes about 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some children need to be sedated for PET or MRI scans. In these cases, chloral hydrate, a&#xD;
      standard drug for pediatric diagnostic procedures, is used.&#xD;

      Objective: To measure CNS GABA receptors and GABA levels in patients with succinic&#xD;
      semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency, a severe pediatric neurotransmitter disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The study will include children and young adult patients with the disorder,&#xD;
      as well as parents of patients (obligate heterozygotes), and adult normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: this is a natural history study using neuroimaging techniques. We will perform&#xD;
      11C-flumazenil PET scans, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). We will perform&#xD;
      neurological examinations to obtain data on clinical manifestations of the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The outcome measures will be the distribution of CNS binding of&#xD;
      11C-flumazenil, and brain GABA levels measured by MRS, and their relation to clinical&#xD;
      manifestations such as motor, speech, and language impairment, hypotonia, hyporreflexia, and&#xD;
      seizures. We expect to show that patients with SSADH deficiency will have multifocal&#xD;
      reductions in FMZ binding and increased brain GABA levels in a similar pattern.&#xD;
