  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pathological gamblers often are also dependent on alcohol and clinically depressed.&#xD;
      Sertraline (Zoloft) is currently used to treat depression, panic disorder, and&#xD;
      obsessive-compulsive disorder. The purpose of this trial is to determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      sertraline used in combination with relapse prevention therapy in decreasing gambling&#xD;
      behavior and alcohol consumption in individuals with a diagnosis of pathological gambling and&#xD;
      alcohol abuse or dependence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol abuse and depression commonly occur in conjunction with pathological gambling.&#xD;
      Sertraline (Zoloft) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) currently used to&#xD;
      treat depression, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The purpose of this&#xD;
      trial is to determine the effectiveness of sertraline combined with relapse prevention&#xD;
      therapy in decreasing gambling behavior and alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this 10-week trial will be randomly assigned to receive either relapse&#xD;
      prevention (RP) therapy and sertraline or RP therapy and a placebo. Participants will begin&#xD;
      taking 25 mg of either sertraline or placebo in a single morning dose for one week. If, after&#xD;
      one week, participants do not show improvement, the dose will increase to 50 mg per day&#xD;
      during Week 2, and will increase by 50 mg per day every week thereafter to a maximal dose of&#xD;
      200 mg per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly hour-long study visits will include a medication evaluation, RP therapy, and&#xD;
      questionnaires. In addition, evaluations at baseline, Week 5, and Week 10 will include&#xD;
      pathological gambling and depression ratings, urine drug screens, and biochemical measures of&#xD;
      alcohol consumption and liver function. All other weekly study visits will include evaluation&#xD;
      of side effects, an interview on alcohol use, measures related to obsessive-compulsive&#xD;
      drinking, and assessments of vital signs and concomitant medications.&#xD;
