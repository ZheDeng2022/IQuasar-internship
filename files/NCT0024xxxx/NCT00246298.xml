    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if PROCRITÂ® (a glycoprotein that stimulates red&#xD;
      blood cell production) initiated at once every 2 weeks dosing is as effective as PROCRITÂ®&#xD;
      initiated at once a week dosing, in increasing hemoglobin levels in anemic HIV-infected&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART) era, anemia is one of the most common&#xD;
      abnormalities in HIV-infected subjects. Epoetin alfa is proven to increase hemoglobin levels&#xD;
      and improve quality of life in HIV-infected subjects. Although there are data to show that&#xD;
      epoetin alfa dosed weekly significantly increases hemoglobin to a target level of 13 g/dL and&#xD;
      every other week dosing can maintain target hemoglobin, there is no data to show that&#xD;
      initiation of epoetin alfa every 2 weeks will increase hemoglobin levels significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, two-arm, open-label study will evaluate if initiating PROCRIT® every other&#xD;
      week dosing is as effective as initiating PROCRIT® weekly dosing, in increasing hemoglobin in&#xD;
      anemic HIV-infected subjects. The Screening phase will start 2 weeks prior to the first dose&#xD;
      of PROCRIT®. HIV-infected subjects who have a hemoglobin level of &lt;12.0 g/dL and are on a&#xD;
      stable antiretroviral regimen will be screened for study eligibility. In the treatment phase,&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 40,000 IU PROCRIT® subcutaneous&#xD;
      injections either weekly (QW) or every other week (Q2W). The primary endpoint is the change&#xD;
      in hemoglobin from baseline to the end of study at Week 12. The safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      PROCRIT® in this subject population will be assessed by evaluating adverse events, laboratory&#xD;
      results and vital signs. The total duration of this study is 14 weeks, including a 2-week&#xD;
      screening phase and a 12-week treatment phase. The primary hypothesis is that the mean&#xD;
      increase in hemoglobin for subjects receiving PROCRIT® every 2 weeks is not lower than those&#xD;
      receiving weekly PROCRIT® dosing by more than 1 g/dL. Subjects will initially receive 40,000&#xD;
      IU PROCRIT® subcutaneous injections either weekly (QW) or every other week (Q2W), with&#xD;
      subsequent dose adjustments, if appropriate. The maximum length of PROCRIT® treatment for&#xD;
      this study is 12 weeks.&#xD;
