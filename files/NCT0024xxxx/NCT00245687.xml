  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to compare the success rates of two types of feeding tubes,&#xD;
      specifically the standard gastric feeding tube to a small bowel feeding tube.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enteral nutrition has many advantages for critically ill patients including lower incidence&#xD;
      of infections and a reduced hospital stay, however it is controversial whether enteral&#xD;
      feeding via small bowel feeding tubes offers an advantage over gastric feeding tubes in terms&#xD;
      of reducing aspiration risk, improving feeding tolerance or ensuring quicker attainment of&#xD;
      nutritional goals. The advantages of a small bowel feeding tube over a gastric feeding tube&#xD;
      is thought to be related to its post pyloric position, however the insertion of small bowel&#xD;
      feeding tubes is technically challenging (most studies report a success rate of 15-30%), can&#xD;
      take time and has complications not unlike those of the gastric feeding tube. Our hypothesis&#xD;
      is that the small bowel feeding tube offers an advantage to the gastric feeding tube due to&#xD;
      its ability to achieve post pyloric placement. Specifically we chose to compare the standard&#xD;
      gastric feeding tube (Dubhoff) to a small bowel feeding tube which offers the advantage of&#xD;
      having alternating flaps which allows the gut to drag this tube into the small bowel.&#xD;
