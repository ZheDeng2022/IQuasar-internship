      1. We hypothesize that children in the experimental group will show a significant improvement&#xD;
      over the control group as all food allergens groups and some other relevant allergenic&#xD;
      substances are desensitized in a systematic way using the NAET® methodology within the&#xD;
      specified period of study.&#xD;

      An autism Pilot Study Using NAET (Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Techniques)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim/Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle goal of this proposed study (pilot study) is to test the efficacy of NAET®&#xD;
      (Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Technique) protocols for the treatment of Autism Spectrum&#xD;
      Disorder in children between the ages of 3-10 years old, especially in the areas of improving&#xD;
      language and communication skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To elaborate further, the NAET® protocols uses chiropractic/acupuncture manipulation of&#xD;
      spinal nerve roots to alert the nervous system about the presence of the allergen in the hand&#xD;
      and thus to wake up the dormant sensory nerve fibers (the sympathetic and parasympathetic&#xD;
      nerve fibers) that carry messages from the periphery to the association cortex of the brain,&#xD;
      through spinal nerves of the body, as well as from the brain to the periphery and target&#xD;
      organs (also known as afferent and efferent nerves). This is followed by acupressure massage&#xD;
      on specific acupuncture points to balance the energy of the entire nervous system. Avoidance&#xD;
      of the treated allergen/substance for 24 hours after treatment completes the NAET® treatment&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When we enroll them into NAET program, most of them are nonverbal and non-communicable. But&#xD;
      by the time they complete 10 to 15 NAET basic treatments for an allergy to essential&#xD;
      nutrients, most of them start verbal and nonverbal communications, social interactions,&#xD;
      playing with other children, improve sleep, reduce restlessness, reduce irritability, reduce&#xD;
      abnormal body movements like flapping hands, pulling hair, etc., and start behaving like&#xD;
      normal children. When they finish the complete NAET program most of them become normal again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complete NAET program usually takes about 75-100 office visits over a span of couple of&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NAET® method has been highlighted in literature (Nambudripad DS: Say Goodbye to Illness,&#xD;
      Third Edition, Delta Pub 1999, 136-137; Nambudripad DS: Say Good-bye to Allergy-related&#xD;
      Autism. Delta Pub 2001; The Journal of NAET Energetics and complementary medicine 1 (1)&#xD;
      76-79, 2005, The Journal of NAET Energetics and complementary medicine 1 (1) 85-86, 2005,&#xD;
      Tsering: Natural Health 29 (6) 80-85, 1999, and and Teuber and Porch-Curren: Curr Opin&#xD;
      Allergy Clin Immunol 3:217-221, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NARF IRB Approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the design and conceptualization of this clinical project, a summary of the project was&#xD;
      submitted to the Nambudripad's Allergy Research Foundation Institutional Review Board. The&#xD;
      NARF IRB will study the project and would meet to discuss the pros and cons of this project.&#xD;
      There will be external physicians whose specialization would include pediatrics and child&#xD;
      welfare to evaluate the project and the ethical treatment to children. (The board after&#xD;
      asking several questions approved this study unanimously in October 2004. The Board also&#xD;
      requested for periodic (every six months) updates on the progress of this project).&#xD;
