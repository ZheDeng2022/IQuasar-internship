      DiaTech is a private company performing patient specific cancer chemosensitivity testing for&#xD;
      patients and physicians. DiaTech Oncology is doing this clinical study to see if an&#xD;
      experimental new technology called the microculture kinetic (MiCK) assay will predict&#xD;
      treatment outcome and can help to direct the chemotherapy of cancer subjects. This study is&#xD;
      focused on subjects diagnosed with breast, ovarian, lung, and colon malignancies and&#xD;
      low-grade lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ability of the MiCK assay to predict the outcome of chemotherapy of&#xD;
           cancer patients.&#xD;

      Application of the Microculture Kinetic (MiCK) Assay for Apoptosis to Testing Drug&#xD;
      Sensitivity of Solid Tumors DiaTech Oncology, LLC&#xD;
&#xD;
      ----------------------------------------------------------- 1.0 Background and Rationale:&#xD;
      Despite the use of aggressive treatment protocols, less than 10% of cancer patients with an&#xD;
      advanced disease respond to the therapy. There is a variety of different cancer drug&#xD;
      regimens, all of which have approximately the same probability of clinical effectiveness.&#xD;
      Identification of those patients who will or will not respond to a specific chemotherapy is&#xD;
      important for making decisions regarding chemotherapy regimens as well as alternative&#xD;
      management approaches. A laboratory test that could help to determine the sensitivity of an&#xD;
      individual patient's tumor cells to specific chemotherapeutic agents would be valuable in&#xD;
      choosing the optimal chemotherapy regimen for that patient with an expectation of increasing&#xD;
      the response rate to the therapy. Several types of in vitro assays that measure tumor cell&#xD;
      survival following exposure to cytotoxic agents have been evaluated for their ability to&#xD;
      predict chemotherapy outcomes. As a group, these assays are referred to as drug resistance&#xD;
      assays. In a resistance assay, the surviving tumor cells can be detected directly by their&#xD;
      exclusion or metabolism of specific dyes. Alternatively, since some of tumor cells are&#xD;
      proliferating, their survival can be detected by measurement of DNA synthesis by radiolabeled&#xD;
      precursor incorporation or demonstration of clonogenic potential by growth into colonies in&#xD;
      semi-solid culture medium. In several clinical studies, these assays were useful in detecting&#xD;
      drug resistance and in predicting a poor prognosis for cancer patients. However, these&#xD;
      resistance assays cannot detect sensitivity of an individual patient's tumor cells to a&#xD;
      specific drug. Therefore, new methods determining drug-sensitivity of the tumor cells of an&#xD;
      individual patient and, thus, capable of both predicting a positive treatment outcome and&#xD;
      guiding chemotherapy, would be of significant value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Dr. Kravtsov has developed an automated microculture kinetic (MiCK) assay for&#xD;
      measuring drug induced apoptosis in tumor cells1-4. Apoptosis is a distinct mode of cell&#xD;
      death which occurs under physiological conditions and yet can be induced in malignant cells&#xD;
      by chemical and physical factors including antitumor drugs5-7. During the last decade, it has&#xD;
      been recognized that chemotherapeutic agents exert their antitumor activity by triggering&#xD;
      apoptosis in susceptible tumor cells8-17. This implies that the MiCK assay for apoptosis&#xD;
      provides a mechanism-based approach to studying effects of cytotoxic agents on tumor cells.&#xD;
      Unlike &quot;resistance&quot; assays that measure a fraction of cells surviving drug exposure, the MiCK&#xD;
      assay measures a fraction of tumor cells killed by a chemotherapeutic agent via mechanism of&#xD;
      apoptosis. Therefore the MiCK assay determines drug sensitivity, rather than resistance.&#xD;
      Recently the MiCK assay has been shown to predict complete remission rate and survival in&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia patients better than clinical criteria did18-20. In a limited study,&#xD;
      the MiCK assay has been used to direct chemotherapy of the leukemia patients 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MiCK assay has also been used to study drug-induced apoptosis in solid tumors, including&#xD;
      neuroblastoma and colon adenocarcinoma cell lines22-23. More recent data accumulated by&#xD;
      DiaTech has demonstrated that the MiCK assay can detect drug induced apoptosis in primary&#xD;
      cultures of tumor cells isolated from patients with ovarian carcinoma, gastric carcinoma,&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer and high grade soft tissue sarcoma. Based on these data, we suggest&#xD;
      that the MiCK assay may be used to detect drug sensitivity profiles of individual patients&#xD;
      with various types of solid tumors. This, in turn, may provide a way to tailor chemotherapy&#xD;
      to an individual patient's drug sensitivity profile, and, thus, improve treatment outcomes,&#xD;
      decrease adverse effects of the chemotherapy, increase the quality of patient's life, and&#xD;
      reduce the treatment cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Study Objectives: 2.1 To evaluate the ability of the MiCK assay to predict the outcome of&#xD;
      chemotherapy of cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 To evaluate the ability of the MiCK assay to guide chemotherapy of cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Patient Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Inclusion criteria: 3.1.1 Patients with pathological diagnoses of breast, lung, and&#xD;
      ovarian adenocarcinomas and soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.2 Patients with de novo malignancies and no previous chemotherapy 3.1.3 Patients with&#xD;
      advanced refractory malignancies who received no more than 2 standard chemotherapy treatment&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.4 Patients of any age group. 3.1.5 Patients must have tumor which is accessible and agree&#xD;
      to undergo biopsies, or drainage of effusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.6 Patients for whom chemotherapy is a treatment option. 3.2 Explanations: We anticipate&#xD;
      that newly diagnosed patients will be mostly used to evaluate the ability of the MiCK assay&#xD;
      to predict the outcome of the chemotherapy (Objective #2.1) and to establish criteria&#xD;
      correlating numerical response in the MiCK assay with probability of the clinically&#xD;
      established complete remission. The patients with refractory malignancies will be mostly used&#xD;
      to evaluate the ability of the MiCK assay to guide cancer chemotherapy (Objective #2.2).&#xD;
      Patients will be seen and managed as outpatients or inpatients, depending on a clinical&#xD;
      standard of the institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Exclusion criteria: 3.3.1 Patients with symptomatic/uncontrolled parenchymal brain&#xD;
      metastasis and not accessible tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3.2 Patients with meningeal metastasis. 3.3.3 Patients for whom chemotherapy clinically is&#xD;
      not indicated. 3.3.4 Pregnancy. During the course of the study, all patients of childbearing&#xD;
      potential should be instructed to contact the treating physician if they suspect they might&#xD;
      have conceived a child; for females, a missing or late menstrual period should be reported to&#xD;
      the treating physician. If pregnancy is confirmed by a pregnancy test, the patient must not&#xD;
      receive study medication and must not be enrolled into the study or, if already enrolled,&#xD;
      must be withdrawn from the study. If a male patient is suspected of having fathered a child&#xD;
      while on the study drugs, the pregnant female partner must be notified and counseled&#xD;
      regarding the risk to the fetus. Pregnancy during the course of this study will be reported&#xD;
      to the Principal Investigator as a serious adverse event. Women of child bearing potential&#xD;
      are defined to include any female who has experienced menarche and has not undergone&#xD;
      successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral&#xD;
      oophorectomy) or is not post-menopausal (defined as amenorrhea for more than 12 consecutive&#xD;
      months); these includes also females using oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive&#xD;
      hormones, mechanical devices, or barrier methods to prevent pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 Treatment Plan: 4.1 For the patients involved under the Study Objective (2.1), treatment&#xD;
      protocol for an individual will not be influenced by the results of the MiCK assay for that&#xD;
      patient. Oncologists will be blinded of the results of the MiCK assay and the patients will&#xD;
      be treated according to a standard treatment protocol. When available, actual clinical&#xD;
      response to the treatment will be compared with that predicted by the MiCK assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 For the patients involved under the Study Objective (2.2), treatment protocol for an&#xD;
      individual patient will be designed based on the results of the MiCK assay for that patient.&#xD;
      The drug with the best activity in the assay will be used to treat the individual patients.&#xD;
      If more than one drug is equally active, the patient will receive the active drug in a class&#xD;
      he/she has not received before. If no drug is found to have activity (insensitivity in the&#xD;
      assay), the patients will be treated on an empiric basis with a class of drug he/she never&#xD;
      received in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 Definition of Clinical Response 5.1 All patients will be evaluated for clinical response&#xD;
      to chemotherapy as per standard protocol established for a specific malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.1 Complete Remission is defined as total disappearance of clinically and radio logically&#xD;
      detectable disease for at least four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2 Partial Response is defined as at least 50% reduction of all measurable tumor lesions&#xD;
      as measured by the sum of products of the perpendicular diameters of the greatest dimensions&#xD;
      of measurable lesions, with no new lesions appearing for at least four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.3 Stable Disease is defined as a reduction by less than 50% or increase by less than 25%&#xD;
      in the size of the tumor lesions, with no new lesions appearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.4 Progressive Disease is defined as appearance of any new tumor lesions or increase of&#xD;
      25% or more in the sum of products of the perpendicular diameters of the greatest dimensions&#xD;
      of measurable existing lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 Definition of the drug response in the MiCK assay. 6.1 In the MiCK assay, the extent of&#xD;
      drug-induced apoptosis is measured in Kinetic Units (KU) on a scale from 0 to 16 (Blood,&#xD;
      1998). Apoptotic responses in KU will be calculated for each dose of a tested drug or drug&#xD;
      combination. The maximal numerical response induced by a drug will be considered the &quot;best&#xD;
      apoptotic response&quot; to the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.1 Under the Study Objective (2.1), the &quot;best apoptotic response&quot; to the drug will be&#xD;
      compared to the clinical response to the drug to establish a numerical value of the in vitro&#xD;
      response discriminating drug-sensitive and drug-insensitive tumors (establishing a numerical&#xD;
      cut-off of sensitivity). From our experience with establishing cut-off values of drug&#xD;
      sensitivity for acute leukemia, 25-30 patients should provide a sufficient statistical power&#xD;
      for getting a significant discriminator. These 25-30 patients will be fed from both patients&#xD;
      participating under Study Objective (2.1) and Study Objective (2.2). After the numerical&#xD;
      cut-off for sensitivity is established, it will be applied to a cohort of patients who&#xD;
      received treatment with the drug to compare responses predicted in the MiCK assay to the&#xD;
      actual clinical responses. This second part of the study will have two legs: (a)&#xD;
      &quot;prospective&quot; (using 30-35 patients entering the study after establishing the discriminator,&#xD;
      and (b) &quot;retrospective&quot; (using an available database of the patients who received treatment&#xD;
      in the past and who's clinical response to the chemotherapy is known).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.2 For the patients participating under the Study Objective (2.2), a drug inducing the&#xD;
      highest &quot;best apoptotic response&quot; will be considered the best active drug and will be&#xD;
      recommended for including in the treatment protocol. Only drugs with the numerical value of&#xD;
      the &quot;best apoptotic response&quot; exceeding a certain threshold should be expected to induce a&#xD;
      complete remission. In the beginning of the study, such a threshold will be judged based on&#xD;
      the results of the previous leukemia study19-22. As first 25-30 patients enter the study, the&#xD;
      thresholds will be established for solid tumor patients as described in (6.1.1) and used&#xD;
      thereafter. Considering that these 25-30 patients will be fed from both patients&#xD;
      participating under Study Objective (2.1) and Study Objective (2.2), we expect to have first&#xD;
      statistical correlations available no later than 3-4 months after the study begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.3 Drug selection for testing against tumor cells will be based on the previous&#xD;
      chemotherapy history of an individual patient with consideration of the future treatment&#xD;
      plans. The drugs will be selected from a compendium of agents recommended for the treatment&#xD;
      of the patient's malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.0 Statistics 7.1 We estimate that sufficient statistical power will be obtained with&#xD;
      approximately 50-60 patients with successful MiCK assays. A successful MiCK assay is defined&#xD;
      as an assay for which a sufficient number of viable tumor cells could be isolated from the&#xD;
      submitted pathologic material. For correlations between the patient's sensitivity profiling&#xD;
      in the MiCK assay and clinical responses, the patients will be evaluated as the whole group&#xD;
      as well as stratified based on the type of malignancy. The latter will depend on the number&#xD;
      of patients with specific tumor types available for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 In order to discriminate between the drug-sensitive and drug insensitive tumor cell&#xD;
      populations, the best responses to each agent will be compared in a receiver operator&#xD;
      characteristic (ROC) analysis as well as logistic regression analysis with attainment of CR&#xD;
      (CR vs No CR). Based on the best combination of statistical sensitivity, specificity, and p&#xD;
      value, thresholds demarcating drug sensitivity and insensitivity will be established. The&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test, chi-square test and analysis of variance method will be employed to test&#xD;
      the correlation between the clinical response results and other clinical variables. For&#xD;
      lifetime data analyses, Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival will be used. Other statistical&#xD;
      techniques may also be implied if found useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.0 Specimen collection, purification of tumor cells and sensitivity testing 8.1 Specimen&#xD;
      collection must be performed as per related DiaTech Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.1.1 Collection of a Solid Tumor Biopsy Specimen is performed under sterile conditions,&#xD;
      using excision biopsy technique, to obtain at least 2 cm3 of viable tumor tissue. The more&#xD;
      viable tumor tissue is submitted for the study, the more chemotherapeutic agents can be&#xD;
      tested against the tumor cells. Effusion specimen (peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid and&#xD;
      effusions from other anatomical sites) should be collected in a commercial sterile&#xD;
      container/bag with added Sodium Heparin (10 U/ml) to prevent clotting. The sample size should&#xD;
      not be less than 500 ml. The specimen should not be fixed, or frozen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.1.2 Transportation: seal the transport tube/container/bag tightly. Label specimen with&#xD;
      institution, patient name, date and time of collection, and anatomical site of collection.&#xD;
      Place the transport tube/container/bag on ice pack (blue ice). Ice pack must be frozen before&#xD;
      placing it to the container. Fill out the Study Requisition form and include with the&#xD;
      transportation container.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.1.3 Place the 50 mL tubes or a container inside the zip-lock bag and seal. Place specimen&#xD;
      and Cold Pak (blue ice) in a transport box. Place completed patient information forms and&#xD;
      specimen transport box into FedEx plastic &quot;Diagnostic Specimen Envelope&quot; and seal. Complete&#xD;
      and affix the FedEx Airbill to the outside of the Diagnostic Specimen Envelope. Be sure that&#xD;
      the airbill is marked &quot;FedEx Priority Overnight&quot; delivery. Put $5 value on the FedEx Airbill.&#xD;
      Indicate &quot;Human tissue for diagnostic studies&quot; in the appropriate section of the FedEx&#xD;
      Airbill. Call DiaTech Oncology at (514)-398-5174 (Steve Moisan, lab manager) or&#xD;
      (514)-398-5154 (general lab) with the Fed Ex Tracking Number. DiaTech must receive the&#xD;
      specimen within 24 hours of collection. Specimens sent on Friday must be marked for Saturday&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2 Tumor cell purification and their chemosensitivity testing will be performed as per&#xD;
      related DiaTech SOPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2.1 Tissue biopsy and effusion specimens will be treated to obtain a suspension containing&#xD;
      single tumor cells and/or small cell aggregates composed of 2-20 tumor cells. Using gradient&#xD;
      centrifugation, red blood cell lysing, cell strainers, magnetic beads and other appropriate&#xD;
      techniques, the tumor cell suspension will be enriched to at least 80% purity and no less&#xD;
      than 90% viability. Immunocytochemical stains or, when applicable, flow cytometry will be&#xD;
      used to confirm the presence of specific tumor markers on purified cells After purification,&#xD;
      selected chemotherapeutic agents will be tested against purified tumor cells in the MiCK&#xD;
      assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2.2 The purified tumor cells will be suspended in culture medium and plated in 96-well&#xD;
      microtiter plates. Multiple concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents will be achieved by&#xD;
      adding each respective agent to wells in 5 μL aliquots The ranges of final drug&#xD;
      concentrations will be based on reports of pharmacokinetic studies of the drugs and their&#xD;
      active metabolites in patients. Data processing and quantification of drug-induced apoptosis&#xD;
      will be performed by a proprietary ProApoTestTM software. The extent of apoptosis will be&#xD;
      determined and expressed as kinetic units (KU) of apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.0 Efficacy measurement 9.1 For patients participating under Study Objective (2.1), the goal&#xD;
      of the study is to establish a statistically significant discriminator of sensitivity which&#xD;
      would correlate with the rate of CR. Such discriminator should be applicable to patient's&#xD;
      populations participating under Study Objectives (2.1) and (2.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2 For patients participating under Study Objective (2.2), we would expect no greater than a&#xD;
      10% response rate in refractory solid tumor patients to any standard chemotherapy. A response&#xD;
      rate to the MiCK assay-guided therapy of less than 10% would be of no further interest. A&#xD;
      response rate of 10-30% will suggest the MICK assay needs further study. A response rate&#xD;
      greater than 30% would justify usefulness of the MiCK assay in guiding chemotherapy of&#xD;
      patients with refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.0 Specimen's left over 10.1 If a specimen contains more tumor cells than needed for&#xD;
      testing their sensitivity to the drugs specified by the patient's oncologist, an excess of&#xD;
      the tumor cells may be considered for use for other research studies conducted by DiaTech&#xD;
      Oncology. Patients will be asked for their permission to use specimen's left over for&#xD;
      research purposes by signing the following release included in the requisition form: &quot;You are&#xD;
      participating in the Research Program which may result in improvements of the treatment&#xD;
      outcome for cancer patients. There is no direct benefit for you at present time. Your&#xD;
      physician is submitting to DiaTech a specimen containing your tumor cells. At DiaTech, we&#xD;
      purify the tumor cells, count them, check their viability, and store them in the DiaTech&#xD;
      Tissue Bank. All these procedures are performed at no cost to you or your family. Your cells&#xD;
      may be used for the chemosensitivity testing for research purposes or in other studies.&#xD;
      Results of the research may be published, or used commercially in the area of new anti-cancer&#xD;
      drug or treatment protocol development. To assure your privacy, should the results of the&#xD;
      studies be published, you will be referred to only by number. Your signature below indicates&#xD;
      that you agree to these terms&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient refuses to sign the above release, the specimen's left over will be&#xD;
      decontaminated using 10% formaldehyde for 24h and discarded as per related SOP. If a patient&#xD;
      grants his/her permission for use on the specimen's left over in a future research, an excess&#xD;
      of the tumor cells will be frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen indefinitely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2 Specimen's left over may be used to study anti-tumor effects of chemotherapeutic drugs&#xD;
      or drug combinations, to study mechanisms of drug resistance, to correlate phenotypic&#xD;
      features of the tumor cells with their drug sensitivity profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.0 Plan of communication between Principal Investigator and co-Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To insure proper communication between Vladimir Kravtsov, MD, the Study Principal&#xD;
      Investigator, and participating co-Principal Investigator the following communication means&#xD;
      will be used: FedEx delivery of the printed materials, Phone &amp; Fax, E-mail,&#xD;
      Video-conferencing&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.1 At the time of submission of the patient's specimen for the study, relevant clinical&#xD;
      information will be submitted to DiaTech in the form of a study requisition form prepared by&#xD;
      the participating co-PI (or designated staff nurse) using FedEx courier service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.2 Upon receiving the specimen and requisition form and after purification of tumor cells&#xD;
      from the specimen, Dr. Kravtsov will place a telephone call to the referring oncologist&#xD;
      (co-PI) to discuss the case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.3 Upon completion of the patient's tumor drug sensitivity testing, results will be scored&#xD;
      and introduced to the study data base. Dr. Kravtsov will issue a study report and it will be&#xD;
      faxed to the referring oncologist no later than 96h after receiving the specimen. After&#xD;
      faxing the report, Dr. Kravtsov will call the referring oncologist to discuss the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.4 After each 2 cycles of therapy, the patient's treatment response will be evaluated by&#xD;
      the referring oncologists (co-PI). A study Response Evaluation Form (see attached) will be&#xD;
      filled out and faxed to DiaTech to be included in the study data base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.5 After data from first ten consecutive patients are collected, a telephone or video&#xD;
      conference will be scheduled between Dr. Kravtsov and the co-PI to summarize to discuss the&#xD;
      preliminary results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.6 After data from first 30 consecutive patients are collected, an interim statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed and Dr. Kravtsov will visit the participating hospital to present&#xD;
      and discuss the results with the co-Principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.7 At the end of the first year, statistical analysis of the accumulated data will be&#xD;
      performed and all participating co-PIs will be invited to a conference (place to be&#xD;
      determined) to discuss the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.8 DiaTech Study coordinator (Mr. Garry Latimer) will contact each site co-PI or a&#xD;
      designated nurse monthly to assure proper supply of transportation containers and to address&#xD;
      administrative issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.9 All communication between the study coordinator and the participating oncology practice&#xD;
      will be documented, reported to the Principal Investigator, and discussed with the&#xD;
      co-Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPENDIX A&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PLAN ALGORITHM FOR STUDY OBJECTIVE 2.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective 2.1: To evaluate the ability of the MiCK assay to predict the outcome of&#xD;
      chemotherapy of patients with solid tumors for first- and second-line treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapeutic agent(s) to be included in the treatment protocol are selected by a medical&#xD;
      oncologist based on published standards and treatment guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy of the patient is initiated as per clinical treatment protocol and the&#xD;
      oncologist discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Name(s) of the drug(s) selected for the treatment is provided to the DiaTech lab along with&#xD;
      the tumor material obtained from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor cells purified from the patient's specimen are tested for their sensitivity to the&#xD;
      drugs selected for the patient's treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the drug sensitivity testing are scored and introduced to the study database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each cycle of therapy, the patient is evaluated for the response to the treatment as&#xD;
      per established criteria (clinical exam, CT, tumor markers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actual treatment response to the drug is compared with the drug scoring in the in vitro drug&#xD;
      sensitivity test.&#xD;

      APPENDIX B&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PLAN ALGORITHM FOR STUDY OBJECTIVE 2.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective 2.2: To evaluate the ability of the MiCK assay to guide chemotherapy of&#xD;
      cancer patients in a third line, refractory treatment setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapeutic agents available for the treatment are identified by a medical oncologist&#xD;
      based on published standards and treatment guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Names of the drugs are provided to the DiaTech lab along with the tumor material obtained&#xD;
      from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor cells purified from the patient's specimen are tested for their sensitivity to the&#xD;
      drugs selected by the patient's oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the drug sensitivity testing are scored, introduced to the study database, and&#xD;
      reported to the medical oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug with the best anti-tumor activity in the assay is used to treat the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each cycle of therapy, the patient is evaluated for the response to the treatment as&#xD;
      per established criteria (clinical exam, CT, tumor markers).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pathological diagnoses of breast, lung, and ovarian adenocarcinomas and&#xD;
             soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with de novo malignancies and no previous chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with advanced refractory malignancies who received no more than 2 standard&#xD;
             chemotherapy treatment protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of any age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have tumor which is accessible and agree to undergo biopsies, or&#xD;
             drainage of effusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients for whom chemotherapy is a treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic/uncontrolled parenchymal brain metastasis and non-accessible&#xD;
             tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with meningeal metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients for whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy. During the course of the study, all patients of childbearing potential&#xD;
             should be instructed to contact the treating physician if they suspect they might have&#xD;
             conceived a child; for females, a missing or late menstrual period should be reported&#xD;
             to the treating physician. If pregnancy is confirmed by a pregnancy test, the patient&#xD;
             must not receive study medication and must not be enrolled into the study or, if&#xD;
             already enrolled, must be withdrawn from the study. If a male patient is suspected of&#xD;
             having fathered a child while on the study drugs, the pregnant female partner must be&#xD;
             notified and counseled regarding the risk to the fetus. Pregnancy during the course of&#xD;
             this study will be reported to the Principal Investigator as a serious adverse event.&#xD;
             Women of childbearing potential are defined to include any female who has experienced&#xD;
             menarche and has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy,&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not post-menopausal&#xD;
             (defined as amenorrhea for more than 12 consecutive months); this also includes&#xD;
             females using oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive hormones, mechanical&#xD;
             devices, or barrier methods to prevent pregnancy.&#xD;
