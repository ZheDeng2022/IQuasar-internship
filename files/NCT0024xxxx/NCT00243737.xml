  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa is increasingly difficult. Resistance to&#xD;
      cheap efficient antimalarial drugs poses an increasing threat. The rapid emergence of&#xD;
      resistance to sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine, already seen in East Africa is growing and is&#xD;
      likely to have an striking impact on mortality in many other African regions where no obvious&#xD;
      alternatives are available. WHO recommends the use of drug combinations containing&#xD;
      artemisinin compounds, i.e., artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT). Previous clinical&#xD;
      trials have shown that the combination of artesunate with mefloquine is highly effective and&#xD;
      well tolerated in the treatment of multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria, retaining the&#xD;
      benefit of rapidity of action while augmenting cure rates, and apparently slowing the&#xD;
      development of mefloquine resistance. Compliance with sequential combination regimen of&#xD;
      antimalarial drugs is notoriously poor. Therefore, in order to limit the development of&#xD;
      resistance to both drugs and ameliorate patients' compliance to antimalarial treatments, an&#xD;
      optimal simultaneous combination regimen of artesunate and mefloquine in a practical single&#xD;
      blister pack has been developed by Mepha Ltd. and successfully tested. The currently&#xD;
      available&#xD;

      Artequin dosages could only be tested in children able to swallow tablets and with a body&#xD;
      weight of more than 20 kg. However, there is a great need for an Artequin formulation for&#xD;
      smaller children unable to swallow tablets. The new Artequin Paediatric oral formulation is a&#xD;
      flavoured, taste-masked preparation of granules of 50 mg artesunate and 125 mg mefloquine as&#xD;
      a fixed-dose combination (once daily in one single Stickpack, i.e. 3 Stickpacks for a 3-day&#xD;
      treatment). It is suitable for children with up to 20 kg body weight (with a range of 10-20&#xD;
      kg).&#xD;
