  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an already FDA approved drug is safe and&#xD;
      tolerable in Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Current treatments for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) only partially reduce the relapse rate or&#xD;
           improve symptoms, have to be injected, and have side effects. In animal models of MS,&#xD;
           the FDA-approved oral anti-diabetic drug ACTOS prevented and reduced symptoms. ACTOS has&#xD;
           a good safety profile in diabetics and healthy volunteers, but it's effects in MS are&#xD;
           not known. This trial will test the safety of taking daily ACTOS in Relapsing Remitting&#xD;
           MS (RRMS) patients, the most common form of MS. Subjects will take ACTOS or a non active&#xD;
           pill (placebo) every day, and during the trial the safety of the drug will be tested by&#xD;
           doing blood tests for certain enzymes related to liver function, for glucose levels, by&#xD;
           having the blood pressure measured, and having other routine laboratory blood tests&#xD;
           carried out. The safety of ACTOS on MS disease will be tested by doing neurological&#xD;
           examinations, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI, a method which gives an image of the&#xD;
           damage MS causes in brain), and other blood tests to make sure that the MS symptoms are&#xD;
           not made worse by ACTOS. Findings that ACTOS is safe and tolerated in RRMS patients will&#xD;
           help provide the basis for designing Phase II trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects will be selected who have been diagnosed with RR-MS and who are taking the drug&#xD;
           Avonex or Rebif to treat their MS symptoms. Subjects will be randomized to receive&#xD;
           either ACTOS (30 mg) or a non-active tablet (placebo). Both the subjects and the&#xD;
           investigator will be blinded meaning no-one will know which pill they are given. The&#xD;
           subjects will take one pill daily by mouth for up to 18 months, the length of the trial.&#xD;
           During the trial, subjects will be examined 8 times. At each visit about 3 tablespoons&#xD;
           (30cc) of blood will be taken for tests. Subjects will have a total of 3 MRI scans done&#xD;
           during the trial (at months 0, 5, and 12) to test if ACTOS effects the number or size of&#xD;
           plaques in brain. At each visit the subjects will also have vital signs checked, and a&#xD;
           urine pregnancy test performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ACTOS can cause fluid retention which may cause or increase the risk of heart damage.&#xD;
           ACTOS can cause mild weight gain or anemia (low hemoglobin levels). ACTOS can cause mild&#xD;
           hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels). ACTOS can increase ovulation and increase risk of&#xD;
           pregnancy. Since ACTOS is structurally related to Troglitazone, which was associated&#xD;
           with liver damage and rare cases of liver failure, patients treated with ACTOS are&#xD;
           carefully monitored for changes in liver enzyme levels. In other studies with ACTOS, the&#xD;
           most common side effects were upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, muscle&#xD;
           pain, tooth disorder, sore throat, headache and gas. ACTOS may have other side effects,&#xD;
           such as heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, abdominal fullness, nausea, and&#xD;
           loose stools.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MRI is a FDA approved safe procedure. Possible risks include feelings of anxiety or&#xD;
           claustrophobia, or disturbance by noise made during the procedure. A safe contrast agent&#xD;
           (gadolinium) will be used for MRI. Injection and insertion of the needle may cause minor&#xD;
           pain, bruising, and/or infection at the injection site. Gadolinium may cause brief&#xD;
           discomfort, tingling, or warmth in the lips, or metallic taste in the mouth, tingling in&#xD;
           the arm, nausea, or headache. Very rarely, there may be an allergic reaction. A standard&#xD;
           questionnaire will be used to determine the safety for each patient before an MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood sample collection has risks of edema, swelling, or infection at the site of&#xD;
           withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will discuss all of the above in the consent form as outlined in the form with the&#xD;
           candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. There are no known benefits from participating in this trial; however the knowledge&#xD;
           gained may benefit others in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. This trial will recruit 30 RR MS patients. Approximately 10 male and 20 female patients&#xD;
           will be recruited, with about equal numbers coming from the UIC and Rush. Patients can&#xD;
           be between the ages of 18-64 yrs, and will be obtained from outpatient clinics. Consent&#xD;
           process will follow standardized forms.&#xD;
