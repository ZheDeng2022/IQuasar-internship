  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the current standard skin disinfectant solution for&#xD;
      labour epidurals used at BC Women's Hospital to another common skin disinfectant and to the&#xD;
      skin disinfectant solution recommended by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) prior to&#xD;
      placing special intravenous lines. There is very little information available to guide&#xD;
      doctors in deciding which is the best skin disinfectant for epidural analgesia. The study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the disinfectant solution recommended by the PHAC will be the most&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bacterial colonization of epidural catheters is known to occur and it has been suggested that&#xD;
      catheter contamination occurs more frequently in the obstetric setting. Epidural catheters&#xD;
      are usually colonized by the flora present at the skin insertion site and the rate of&#xD;
      colonization varies from 5 to 30%. At present, there is a lack of scientific information&#xD;
      available in order to make an evidence-based decision about skin disinfection prior to&#xD;
      epidural analgesia. The labouring woman appears to have higher risk for infectious&#xD;
      complications of epidural analgesia than other surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parturients considering a labour epidural who are admitted to Labour and Delivery at BC&#xD;
      Women's Hospital during daytime weekday hours will be given an information sheet on the study&#xD;
      by the Assessment room nurse. The Labour and Delivery Room nurses (which includes the&#xD;
      Assessment room) are generally the first healthcare providers with whom women discuss labour&#xD;
      epidural analgesia once admitted to hospital. All women interested in labour epidural&#xD;
      analgesia who are admitted to Labour and Delivery, either via the Assessment room, or from&#xD;
      one of the inpatient wards will be provided with the study information. After adequate time&#xD;
      has been given for consideration of the study information, one of the researchers who is not&#xD;
      directly involved in the patient's care will approach the patient for consent to participate&#xD;
      in the study. This will happen prior to the actual request for labour epidural analgesia,&#xD;
      therefore avoiding the point of pain at which the woman requires a labour epidural. Written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained at that time. Upon request for a labour epidural, the woman will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of 3 groups via a computer-generated randomization table (ZRandom). Group&#xD;
      C will be ChloraprepTM, Group D: DuraprepTM, and Group S: chlorhexidine 0.5% in 70% alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include: temperature &gt; 38oC orally at time of epidural request, local skin&#xD;
      or generalized infection, systemic antibiotics administered prior to epidural request,&#xD;
      presence of ruptured membranes &gt; 24 hours, combined spinal-epidural analgesia planned, unable&#xD;
      to speak/understand English, allergy to chlorhexidine or iodine, and patient refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attending anesthesiologist will wear a clean mask, clean his/her hands with either a wet&#xD;
      scrub or alcohol-based antiseptic, and don sterile procedure gloves. Patients will be placed&#xD;
      in either the left lateral, or sitting position according to anesthesiologist's preference.&#xD;
      The skin overlying the lumbar interspaces will then be cleansed with the antiseptic solution,&#xD;
      according to the recommended protocol for each solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific instructions for skin disinfection will be provided in an envelope to the attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist, according to the randomization group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects in the S group will have three applications of chlorhexidine 0.5% in 70%&#xD;
           alcohol applied according to standard protocol. The chlorhexidine will be poured from a&#xD;
           multi-use bottle into the sterile tray provided in the epidural kit. Sterile prep sponge&#xD;
           sticks are part of the tray. Each sponge stick will be saturated with chlorhexidine and&#xD;
           a 15 cm square area will be prepared over the L1-L5 interspaces using the centre-out&#xD;
           method, allowing time for the solution to air-dry prior to proceeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects in the D group will have their skin prepared with a single-use 6mL-unit&#xD;
           applicator that contains a sterile, crushable ampoule of iodine 0.7% with 74% isopropyl&#xD;
           alcohol. The solution is allowed to flow into the sponge tip via gravity and pumping&#xD;
           action on the handle following activation of the applicator lever. A 15 cm square area&#xD;
           over the L1-L5 interspaces will be covered using the centre-out method with a single&#xD;
           application, and the solution will be allowed to air dry prior to proceeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects in the C group will have their skin prepared with a single-use 10.5 mL-unit&#xD;
           applicator that contains a sterile crushable ampoule of chlorhexidine gluconate 2% with&#xD;
           isopropyl alcohol 70%. Following crushing the ampule with the outer wings of the sponge&#xD;
           applicator, the solution will be pumped into the sponge tip until wet. A 15 cm square&#xD;
           area over the L1-5 interspaces will be covered using the centre-out method with a single&#xD;
           application. The solution will be allowed to air-dry prior to proceeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidurals will be placed between the L3 and L5 interspaces using a 17 gauge Tuohy needle, by&#xD;
      loss of resistance to air or saline depending on operator choice. A 19 gauge Arrow flex tip&#xD;
      endhole epidural catheter will be advanced to a depth of 4 to 6 cm within the epidural space.&#xD;
      The catheter will be fixed in place by a sterile semi-permeable dressing (Tegaderm TM) and&#xD;
      the proximal part of the catheter will be connected to a 0.2 micrometre filter. Standardized&#xD;
      solutions of bupivacaine (0.08 or 0.125%) with fentanyl 2 micrograms/mL, prepared aseptically&#xD;
      by the hospital pharmacy, will be used via the PCEA technique. Any initiation bolus, manual&#xD;
      top-up, or top-up for surgical anesthesia will be prepared aseptically by the attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist as needed and injected into the epidural catheter through the filter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no identifiable risks beyond potential reaction to the skin disinfectant. All of&#xD;
      the skin preparation solutions are approved for skin disinfection prior to invasive/surgical&#xD;
      procedures. There is no published data on the incidence of reaction to any of these products,&#xD;
      and nothing that indicates one solution may have more inherent risk than the others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cultures and Microbiology&#xD;
&#xD;
      All skin culture samples will be taken by one of the researchers. All skin cultures will be&#xD;
      obtained using sterile culture swabs (Copan Venturi Transport system) pre-moistened in&#xD;
      sterile normal saline, taken from a 5 cm square area of skin. A baseline culture of skin&#xD;
      flora at the proposed epidural insertion site will be taken prior to epidural insertion. The&#xD;
      second culture will be taken immediately following skin antisepsis but before epidural&#xD;
      insertion, to determine the initial efficacy of the antiseptic solution. The third culture&#xD;
      will be taken following removal of the sterile occlusive dressing, immediately prior to&#xD;
      epidural catheter removal. Prior to obtaining the epidural catheter tip for culture, the area&#xD;
      of skin around the epidural catheter is disinfected with isopropyl alcohol. This is done to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of skin contamination of the epidural catheter tip. Ten seconds later, the&#xD;
      epidural catheter is removed by a researcher wearing a mask and sterile gloves, using sterile&#xD;
      forceps, and the distal 3-4 cm is transacted with a sterile scissors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The swabs will be coded, placed into 1.0 ml thioglycolate broth (BBL; Becton-Dickinson) and&#xD;
      hand-delivered to the Microbiology lab at BC Children's and Women's Hospital. The tubes will&#xD;
      then be spun for 1 minute to suspend organisms. Each swab and 0.1 ml aliquot of the&#xD;
      suspension will then be inoculated onto blood agar plates. The epidural catheter tips will be&#xD;
      placed in plain C+S containers and hand-delivered to the Microbiology lab where they will be&#xD;
      rolled over blood agar plates. Standard culture techniques for the skin swabs and epidural&#xD;
      catheter tips will be employed, to semi-quantitatively determine the bacterial count&#xD;
      (colony-forming units or CFU's) and identify the micro-organisms. The CDC and PHAC definition&#xD;
      for bacterial colonization of intravascular devices is a growth of 15 or more colony forming&#xD;
      units/ml. We plan to use this as our definition for colonization of epidural catheters.&#xD;
