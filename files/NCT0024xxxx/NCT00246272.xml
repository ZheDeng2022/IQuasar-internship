  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the maintenance of clinical effect of a&#xD;
      rapidly-dissolving tablet form of risperidone (an antipsychotic medication) in adult&#xD;
      schizophrenia patients switched from their previous equivalent dose of RISPERDAL® tablets&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial is a non-randomized, open-label, single arm, multicentre study aimed at evaluating&#xD;
      the maintenance of clinical effect of the rapidly-dissolving tablet dosage form of&#xD;
      risperidone, in patients switched from their previous equivalent dose of conventional&#xD;
      risperidone tablets (doses of 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg or 4 mg/day). Approximately 100 adult&#xD;
      schizophrenia patients (ages &gt;= 18 years) who are symptomatically stable will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to take an equivalent dose of the rapidly-dissolving tablet form of&#xD;
      risperidone for 4 weeks of treatment. Other psychotropic medications taken at study entry may&#xD;
      be continued throughout the study, providing the dose was stable prior to entry for a minimum&#xD;
      of 4 weeks and will remain stable throughout the course of the study. Dose&#xD;
      escalation/reduction of rapidly-dissolving risperidone tablets is not permitted. Study visits&#xD;
      will take place twice over the 4 week period, once at study entry and again at the final&#xD;
      visit. The primary efficacy parameter will be the CGI-Severity (CGI-S) score for maintenance&#xD;
      of clinical effect. Secondarily, two 5-point Likert scales will be completed, one measuring&#xD;
      clinician's assessment of anxiety symptoms and the other measuring clinician's assessment of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms. Patients with existing symptoms of psychosis will be clinician rated on&#xD;
      a 5-point Likert scale. Other secondary assessments include: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for&#xD;
      risperidone acceptability, completed by the patient or the caregiver (if applicable). For&#xD;
      each subject, the VAS score will be calculated on a 10 cm line ranging from a score of &quot;0&quot;&#xD;
      (not acceptable) to &quot;10&quot; (very acceptable). Safety evaluations during the study will include&#xD;
      vital signs and physical examination, body weight, adverse event surveillance, and urine&#xD;
      pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential. The study hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      clinical effect will be maintained when schizophrenia patients previously stabilized on&#xD;
      risperidone conventional tablets are treated with rapidly-dissolving risperidone tablets, and&#xD;
      that risperidone rapidly dissolving tablets will be well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are stable on conventional risperidone tablets (0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/day) for at&#xD;
      least 2 weeks will be switched to an equivalent dose of rapidly-dissolving risperidone&#xD;
      tablets (0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/day). The study medication will be taken orally for 4 weeks,&#xD;
      using the same frequency of dosing (once-daily, twice-daily, etc.) as with their previous&#xD;
      conventional tablet regimen.&#xD;
