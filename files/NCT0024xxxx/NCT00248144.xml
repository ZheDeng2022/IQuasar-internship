        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients aged 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history typical for recurrent herpes labialis. The subject must have experienced&#xD;
             three or more episodes of cold sores in the last 12 months, and have a history of&#xD;
             prodromal symptoms, as defined by the patient, preceding at least 50% of these cold&#xD;
             sores, and must also have a history of vesicular lesions in at least 50% of the&#xD;
             recurrent episodes of cold sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  General good health, without other serious medical conditions and specifically with&#xD;
             normal renal and hepatic function, as determined by the patient's account of his/her&#xD;
             medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child bearing potential had to use an accepted method of birth control&#xD;
             (surgical sterilization; intra-uterine contraceptive device; oral contraceptives;&#xD;
             hormone delivery systems such as NorplantÂ® or Depo-Provera injections; a diaphragm in&#xD;
             combination with contraceptive cream, jelly, or foam; or a condom in combination with&#xD;
             contraceptive cream, jelly or foam). Patients unable or unwilling to use one of the&#xD;
             methods of birth control listed above for the duration of the study could not enter&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of child-bearing potential, a negative pregnancy test (urine) at screening&#xD;
             was required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signature on the informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous herpes vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients using topical immunosuppressive agents (including steroids, tacrolimus and&#xD;
             pimecrolimus) on or near the face or systemic immunosuppressive agents (including&#xD;
             steroids, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) within 30 days of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients known to be immunosuppressed due to underlying disease (e.g. HIV infection)&#xD;
             or concomitant treatment (e.g. cancer chemotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent history of alcohol or drug abuse, which in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             could interfere with that study patient's compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant skin disease such as atopic dermatitis or eczema that would interfere with&#xD;
             the assessment of lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy or hypersensitivity to formulations containing acyclovir, penciclovir,&#xD;
             famciclovir, and/or other nucleoside analogues&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who were lactating or breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had already been randomized once into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had received an investigational drug in the past four weeks&#xD;
