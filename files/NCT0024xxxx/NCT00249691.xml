    <textblock>
      Although a great amount of research has been conducted to resolve cocaine dependence, an&#xD;
      effective treatment has yet to be discovered. Topiramate is a drug that was found to be&#xD;
      useful in treating alcohol dependence. The purpose of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of topiramate in treating cocaine dependent individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite considerable scientific effort in the last two decades to develop treatment for&#xD;
      cocaine dependent individuals, no medication has proven to be effective for treating cocaine&#xD;
      dependence. Cocaine's rewarding effects are primarily a result of altering nerve pathways&#xD;
      involving dopamine, a naturally-occurring chemical in the brain. Past research has focused on&#xD;
      developing medications that either block dopamine or inhibit its release. However, these&#xD;
      medications have not proven effective in treating cocaine dependence. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate a new strategy of treating cocaine dependence by altering dopamine's functional&#xD;
      expression. Dopamine-associated expression may be mediated through inhibition of&#xD;
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), another brain chemical. Topiramate is a GABA inhibitor that&#xD;
      has proven effective in treating alcohol dependent individuals. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to determine the efficacy of topiramate in treating cocaine dependent individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 300 mg per day of topiramate or&#xD;
      placebo. In addition, participants will receive weekly cognitive behavioral therapy for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Follow-up visits will occur at 2 weeks and 1, 2, and 3 months following completion of&#xD;
      treatment, and will include evaluations of cocaine use and psychosocial functioning.&#xD;
