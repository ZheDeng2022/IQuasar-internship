    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if darbepoetin alfa is an effective treatment for anemia&#xD;
      in prostate cancer patients and, if so, what dose is most effective. Sometimes prostate&#xD;
      cancer patients have low red blood cell counts (low hemoglobin) from various treatments they&#xD;
      are receiving, such as chemotherapy. The red blood cells deliver oxygen to the tissue. This&#xD;
      then helps give the patient more energy.&#xD;

      This study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Darbepoetin alfa, (also referred to as Aranesp&#xD;
      or NESP), to assess what dose of NESP is required to treat anemia in prostate cancer&#xD;
      patients, what the side effects of NESP are, and whether NESP will affect the patients'&#xD;
      quality of life. NESP is approved by the FDA for the treatment of anemia in patients with&#xD;
      chronic kidney failure and for the treatment of anemia in cancer patients who are receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy. It is considered experimental for the treatment of anemia in prostate cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
