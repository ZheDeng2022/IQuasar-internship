  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), it was hypothesized that its&#xD;
      consistent use could lead to a cure for HIV infection in as little as three years [Perelson,&#xD;
      1997]. Subsequent research has shown this model to be incorrect [Finzi, 1999]. In addition,&#xD;
      long term use of HAART has now been associated with significant metabolic abnormalities,&#xD;
      which could lead to unintended morbidity, possibly worse than what one could expect from the&#xD;
      progression of untreated HIV-associated immune disease over the same period of time [Carr,&#xD;
      2000]. Accordingly, current recommendations for antiretroviral therapy have become more&#xD;
      conservative. It is now suggested that a person with a CD4 count &gt; 350 cells/mmÂ³ may safely&#xD;
      delay initiation of HAART [Yeni, 2002].However, for those who still require HAART, the risks&#xD;
      of short-term and long-term toxicities remain, even if full virologic suppression is&#xD;
      achieved. In this setting, a number of switching strategies have been evaluated (Negredo et&#xD;
      al, 2002 &amp; Martinez et al, 2003), mostly involving single drug substitutions of a protease&#xD;
      inhibitor (PI) for a non-nucleoside agent (NNRTI) or abacavir (ABC). In general terms, these&#xD;
      hae shown that virologic suppression is usually maintained, with improvement in drug-related&#xD;
      side effects, including metabolic toxicities. A number of patients who are currently taking&#xD;
      effective HAART are experiencing side effects to one or more of the agents in their regimen&#xD;
      that is not severe enough to mandate an immediate change in their regimen, but that is having&#xD;
      a measurable effect on their qualify of life. Over time, these effects may have an impact on&#xD;
      adherence to therapy and its long-term efficacy. Given the recent availability of ATV&#xD;
      (+/-RTV), its once daily administration, low pill count and favourable side effect profile,&#xD;
      it is being used in clinical practice as part of single drug substitution strategies in&#xD;
      patients exhibiting a maximal response to HAART. There is a clear need to examine this&#xD;
      practice in a systematic manner to document its occurrence, efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that, in patients with maximal virologic suppression on a double class regimen&#xD;
      (including two NRTIs and an NNRTI or a PI, boosted with RTV or not), and in whom a decision&#xD;
      has been made to implement a single drug substitution of the NNRTI or PI for ATV (+/-), this&#xD;
      will lead to an improvement in objectively measured quality of life without any negative&#xD;
      impact on the virologic efficacy of the regimen.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This will be a single arm observational study to include 100 subjects. After a clinical&#xD;
      decision is made to implement a single drug substitution to ATV +/- RTV, there will be an&#xD;
      initial screening visit, at which time the study will be presented to the patient and&#xD;
      informed consent for participation will be obtained. A number of evaluations (including blood&#xD;
      tests) will be completed to definitively assess a subject's eligibility to participate in&#xD;
      this protocol. The patients will continue on their current therapy and will return within the&#xD;
      next 14 days for an enrollment visit to review the blood test results and definitively&#xD;
      confirm study eligibility. In particular, we will ascertain the continued presence of the&#xD;
      side effect/toxicity motivating consideration of a change in therapy. This being down, the&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires (MOS-HIV and ASDM) will be administered for the first time.&#xD;
      Once again, the patient will continue on their current HAART and return within the next 14&#xD;
      days for a baseline visit at which time the quality of life questionnaires (MOS-HIV and ASDM)&#xD;
      will be administered once again, the results being averaged with those obtained at the time&#xD;
      of the enrollment visit, this serving as a more rigorous evaluation of the patient's current&#xD;
      status. The patient could be withdrawn from the study if the side effect/toxicity motivating&#xD;
      consideration of a change in therapy is no longer present. At this baseline visit, all&#xD;
      patients will switch the PI or NNRTI component of their regimen to ATV (+/- RTV). The&#xD;
      decision to use boosted or unboosted ATV in this protocol will be left to the discretion of&#xD;
      the treating physician. All patients will be receiving ATV (+/- RTV) with food. The dose of&#xD;
      the unboosted ATV will be 300 mg (2 capsules, 150mg each) plus RTV (1 capsule, 100 mg). The&#xD;
      patients will then be seen in follow up at weeks 4, 12, 24, 32, and 48 after the baseline&#xD;
      visit. They will continue on their new therapy (including ATV +/- RTV) for this entire period&#xD;
      of observation. Changes in the NRTI backbone will be permitted without constituting a study&#xD;
      endpoint, while changes in the ATV +/- RTV that may be required for reasons of efficacy or&#xD;
      toxicity will constitute such an endpoint, leading to a patient's withdrawal from the study.&#xD;
      At each study visit, the quality of life questionnaires (MOS-HIV and ASDM) will be&#xD;
      administered. The results will be compared to the mean results obtained at the enrollment and&#xD;
      baseline visits, with each individual participant serving as his/her own control. Measures of&#xD;
      adherence to HAART, CD4 cell counts and HIV plasma viral load will also be obtained at each&#xD;
      study visit, and will constitute secondary study endpoints.&#xD;
