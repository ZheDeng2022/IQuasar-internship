      The overall objective of this research project is to examine the clinical efficacy of lower&#xD;
      extremity cycling with functional electrical stimulation to improve the health and fitness of&#xD;
      children with spinal cord injuries (SCI). To achieve this goal, a controlled, randomized&#xD;
      study will be conducted with thirty children who have sustained a spinal cord injury. The&#xD;
      children in the study will be assigned to one of three groups: those receiving functional&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (FES) leg cycling exercise, those receiving passive leg cycling, and a&#xD;
      non-cycling control group receiving electrical stimulation therapy to generate muscle&#xD;
      contractions in the lower extremity. All three groups will be balanced as to the amount of&#xD;
      time they receive the specific therapy. All therapies, after initial assessment, will be&#xD;
      conducted at home in order to foster changes in lifestyle that may prove to be essential for&#xD;
      improved quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this proposal are delineated below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To assess, by means of a randomized controlled study design, the ability of FES&#xD;
      cycling to improve the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems of ten children with a&#xD;
      spinal cord injury, as compared to ten children undergoing passive leg cycling exercise and&#xD;
      ten children receiving electrical stimulation therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine, by means of a randomized controlled study design, the feasibility of&#xD;
      using FES leg cycling exercise to provide long-term health benefits and improve the&#xD;
      neurologic status of ten children with a spinal cord injury, as compared to ten children&#xD;
      undergoing passive leg cycling exercise and ten children receiving electrical stimulation&#xD;
      therapy alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a controlled, randomized pretest/posttest study design in which three conditions will&#xD;
      be compared: FES leg cycling exercise, passive leg cycling exercise, and a control group&#xD;
      receiving electrical stimulation therapy. Randomization of the subjects into the three groups&#xD;
      will be coordinated across the two sites. All other variables will be controlled to the&#xD;
      extent possible. All children in this study will continue to receive standard therapy at the&#xD;
      level established by the therapist working with the child. This includes passive stretching&#xD;
      of the lower extremities and the use of standing frames. Medications will also remain&#xD;
      unaltered throughout the study, unless changes in body mass or other physical conditions&#xD;
      unrelated to the study (i.e. growth) warrant modification. All exercise sessions, after the&#xD;
      initial one or two-week assessment, will be conducted at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical activation of the muscles in this study will be achieved through the use of&#xD;
      surface mounted electrodes. The muscle groups that will be electrically activated in this&#xD;
      study are the quadriceps, the hamstrings, and the gluteal muscles bilaterally. This is based&#xD;
      upon the previous FES cycling studies conducted in the adult population. The appropriate&#xD;
      stimulation levels for each muscle will be determined for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in the three study groups, in addition to participation in this study, will&#xD;
      receive standard therapy at home. For all of the children, this will include passive range of&#xD;
      motion stretching three times each week. Ideally, stretching will be done before cycling or&#xD;
      electrical stimulation therapy to act as a &quot;warm-up&quot; period before the more involved&#xD;
      therapies are performed. For the children with sustained tetraplegia participating in this&#xD;
      study, standard therapy will also involve standing three times each week, either with braces&#xD;
      or the use of a standing frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FES Cycling Group The FES cycling group will be asked to participate in additional therapy&#xD;
      involving cycling for thirty minutes, three times a week. All cycling movements will be&#xD;
      accomplished with electrical activation of the leg muscles. The first one to two weeks will&#xD;
      be conducted on-site to monitor the subjects' reaction to exercise, after which therapy&#xD;
      sessions will continue at home. The goal will be achieving thirty minutes of continuous&#xD;
      cycling at 50 rev•min-1 with zero power output. Until subjects reach this point, the cycling&#xD;
      session will be divided into five to ten minute-long sets, separated by five-minute rest&#xD;
      breaks. Each subject, however, will complete a total of thirty minutes of cycling at the set&#xD;
      speed. Once subjects reach this point, the power output requirements will be increased. From&#xD;
      the zero point, the power requirement for the first session will be increased by one watt&#xD;
      (W). If the subject can cycle continuously for 30 minutes, the next session the power output&#xD;
      requirement will be increased by one watt. If the subject cannot pedal for a full 30 minutes,&#xD;
      the power requirement will be maintained at this higher level until 30 minutes of continuous&#xD;
      cycling can be achieved. The power requirement will then be increased by one watt on the next&#xD;
      session. Increases will continue in this manner until the end of the protocol, or until the&#xD;
      maximum power output of 50 watts, has been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive Cycling Group The passive cycling group will be asked to participate in additional&#xD;
      therapy that will also involve cycling for thirty minutes, three times a week. However, the&#xD;
      motor in the bicycle will provide all cycling movements. The first one to two weeks will be&#xD;
      conducted on-site under the observation of the investigators, after which time therapy&#xD;
      sessions will continue at home. The initial sessions will be used to determine whether the&#xD;
      subject can tolerate the exercise, and to build fatigue resistance. The goal will be to&#xD;
      achieve thirty minutes of continuous cycling at 50 rev•min-1 with zero power output. Once&#xD;
      subjects can cycle for thirty minutes continuously, the subjects will continue at this level&#xD;
      until the completion of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical Stimulation Therapy Group Subjects in the control group will maintain their&#xD;
      standard therapy, in addition to receiving additional electrical stimulation therapy of the&#xD;
      quadriceps and hamstring muscles for a period of 30 minutes, three times per week. The&#xD;
      children in this group will act as a control group for the comparison of additional therapy&#xD;
      time involving cycling, as compared to additional therapy time only. Electrical stimulation&#xD;
      was selected as the additional therapy of choice since specific health and physiologic&#xD;
      benefits have already been reported by this group of investigators and could thus be seen as&#xD;
      comparable to cycling. Stimulation of the muscles will be accomplished using a portable,&#xD;
      2-channel surface stimulation unit (Empi, St. Paul Minnesota) instead of the ExoStim Unit.&#xD;
      The hamstrings and quadriceps will be activated bilaterally for 15 minutes each at a level&#xD;
      that produces a strong muscle contraction. This will be accomplished while the subjects are&#xD;
      resting in the supine position, working against zero resistance. Attempts will also be made&#xD;
      to incorporate the gluteal muscles into the electrical stimulation protocol, but the sessions&#xD;
      will not exceed the thirty-minute time period.&#xD;
