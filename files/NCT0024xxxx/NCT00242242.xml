      This study will gain information on methods of control of a prosthetic arm in stroke patients&#xD;
      or traumatic brain inury patients through a technique called &quot;brain-computer interface&quot;&#xD;
      (BCI). BCI allows for direct communication between man and machine. Brain cells communicate&#xD;
      by producing electrical impulses that help to create such things as thoughts, memory,&#xD;
      consciousness and emotions. In BCI, brain waves are recorded by an electroencephalogram (EEG)&#xD;
      through electrodes (small wires) attached to the scalp. The electrodes measure the electrical&#xD;
      signals of the brain. These signals are sent to the computer, which translates them into&#xD;
      device control commands as messages that reflect a person's intention. This type of brain&#xD;
      activity comes from the sensorimotor areas of the brain and can be controlled through&#xD;
      voluntarily training to control the hand prosthesis through the BCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and people who have had a stroke or traumatic brain injury more&#xD;
      than 12 months ago and have paralysis in the right or left arm, hand or leg and who are&#xD;
      between 18 and 80 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a&#xD;
      clinical and neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. MRI&#xD;
      uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of the brain. The scanner is a metal&#xD;
      cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During the procedure, the subject lies in the&#xD;
      scanner for about 45 minutes, wearing ear plugs to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur&#xD;
      with the scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sessions 1-2: Participants are connected to an EEG machine and familiarized with the&#xD;
           hand orthosis (training device used in the study) and the tasks required for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sessions 3-4: Participants receive baseline transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and&#xD;
           fMRI. For TMS, a wire coil is held on the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed&#xD;
           through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject may&#xD;
           feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil and there may be twitching in&#xD;
           muscles of the face, arm or leg. The subject may be asked to tense certain muscles&#xD;
           slightly or perform other simple actions. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected&#xD;
           with small metal disk electrodes taped to the skin of the arms. fMRI is like a standard&#xD;
           MRI (see above), except it is done while the patient performs tasks to learn about brain&#xD;
           activity involved in those tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sessions 5-8: Participants are asked to repetitively move their hand (patients'&#xD;
           paralyzed hand; healthy volunteers' normal hand), tongue and leg in response to three&#xD;
           sound tones. After ten trials, they are asked to imagine the same movements 50 to 100&#xD;
           times while the EEG machine is recording brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sessions 9-14: Participants are trained in controlling the hand orthosis. The subject's&#xD;
           hand is attached to the orthosis and asked to imagine that they are performing finger or&#xD;
           hand movements. This continues until there is an 80-90 percent success rate in achieving&#xD;
           hand movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sessions 15-16: Participants repeat TMS and fMRI for comparison before and after&#xD;
           training with the hand orthosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sessions 17-28: Participants receive additional training with the hand orthosis device&#xD;
           (as in sessions 5-8), focusing only on the hand and not other parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sessions 29-30: Participants undergo repeat TMS and fMRI to compare with the effect&#xD;
           following additional training with the hand orthosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sessions 31-32: Optional makeup sessions if needed because of scheduling problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are evaluated in the clinic after 3 months to see if they have benefited from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

      Objective: Individuals who have suffered a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI) may benefit&#xD;
      from the development of new rehabilitative interventions that can improve motor recovery&#xD;
      after injury. The purpose of this protocol is to test the hypothesis that oscillatory brain&#xD;
      activity that originates in the affected hemisphere in the form of desynchronization of&#xD;
      Mu-rhythm of patients with chronic stroke or TBI can be used to drive movements of an&#xD;
      orthosis attached to a paralyzed hand through a Brain Computer Interface (BCI). Mu-rhythm is&#xD;
      a type of brain wave activity that originates in the sensorimotor areas of the brain that can&#xD;
      be controlled voluntarily; it is present in the affected hemisphere of stroke patients and&#xD;
      can be used to control the hand prostheses through the BCI interface. Control of Mu-rhythm&#xD;
      amplitudes by volition requires training since it does not happen spontaneously. A&#xD;
      proof-of-principle sub-experiment will test the hypothesis that in stroke survivors&#xD;
      non-invasive cortical stimulation of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1) will&#xD;
      facilitate learning to control a hand orthosis through a BCI device. This is the purpose of&#xD;
      the training: to teach the subject to control Mu-rhythms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study population will consist of individuals with chronic stroke or TBI&#xD;
      that have virtually no movement of their paretic hand and age- and gender- matched healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Healthy volunteers, which may include the age- and gender- matched volunteers,&#xD;
      will be recruited to refine instructions given to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is primarily an intraindividual comparison study, designed to determine if this&#xD;
      brain-computer interface (BCI) approach contributes to drive grasping motions through a BCI&#xD;
      interface and hand-orthosis. To test the effect of non-invasive cortical stimulation 21&#xD;
      stroke patients will be randomly assigned to three groups (group A, anodal stimulation; group&#xD;
      B, cathodal stimulation; group C, sham stimulation). Study of normal volunteers will&#xD;
      contribute to (a) set up of the experiment, (b) identifying differences in the training time&#xD;
      required to modulate Mu-rhythm in healthy volunteers and patients and (c) to isolate training&#xD;
      effects as measured by TMS and fMRI on the healthy brain from training effects on brains&#xD;
      affected with stroke or TBI. This information will be treated descriptively within the&#xD;
      framework of this protocol but it is also important for designing future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Behavioral endpoint measure: ability to drive the paralyzed hand orthosis&#xD;
      in flexion and extension motions using Mu-rhythm. Physiological endpoint measures: peak fMRI&#xD;
      activity in the hand knob representation, and corticomotor excitability as tested with TMS&#xD;
      and MEG in ipsilesional and contralesional hand knob representations. Normal volunteers will&#xD;
      undergo evaluation of the same physiological endpoint measures as patients.&#xD;
