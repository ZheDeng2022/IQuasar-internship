  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose and aim of this study is to test the use of a computer-based, automated&#xD;
      telecommunications system and its effectiveness in increasing the rates of regular screening&#xD;
      mammography among women ages 50-74. The system will not only help in scheduling appointments&#xD;
      but will help women in overcoming any barriers that may deter them from having the procedure&#xD;
      at all. The programs are designed to be user friendly and easy to implement in clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

      The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a&#xD;
      computer-based telecommunications system for increasing rates of regular screening&#xD;
      mammography among women ages 50-74. The Telephone-Linked-Communications for Mammography&#xD;
      Screening (TLC-M) is designed to educate, advise and motivate women to have regular screening&#xD;
      mammograms. There will be two versions of TLC-M: one for women who are coming due for their&#xD;
      annual screening mammography (&quot;pre-due&quot; women) and one for women who have missed their annual&#xD;
      mammogram (&quot;past-due&quot; women). TLC-M uses a real human voice to speak to the women on the&#xD;
      telephone; the subjects communicate by using the touch tone keypad on their telephones. The&#xD;
      intervention will consist of up to three automated telephone conversations. During the call&#xD;
      TLC-M assesses the woman's willingness to have a mammogram, helps interested women schedule a&#xD;
      mammogram, and identifies and addresses difficulties or barriers she might have in getting a&#xD;
      mammogram. This study will consist of two linked randomized controlled trials. We will&#xD;
      recruit 2,120 participants over 12 months from two radiology departments. Three to four&#xD;
      months prior to their due date for an annual screening mammogram, these women will receive a&#xD;
      reminder letter to schedule a mammogram. In addition, a random sample of them will use TLC-M.&#xD;
      All participants in this &quot;pre-due&quot; intervention study will be evaluated 3 months after their&#xD;
      due date to determine whether or not they obtained a mammogram. Of the women who received the&#xD;
      letter only in the first trial, those who did not obtain a mammogram during the observation&#xD;
      period will enter a &quot;past due&quot; intervention trial. These women will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive a &quot;past due&quot; reminder letter or to use the TLC-M. Four months later, participants&#xD;
      will be evaluated to determine whether they had a mammogram. For both trials mammography&#xD;
      rates of those women who used the TLC-M and those who did not will be statistically compared.&#xD;
