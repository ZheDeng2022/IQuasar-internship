  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international study of vicriviroc in 500 adult HIV-infected subjects who are&#xD;
      failing standard antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV must be of a certain type known as&#xD;
      R5/X4-mixed tropic. Subjects allowed into the trial will be randomly assigned to treatment&#xD;
      with vicriviroc 10 mg QD, vicriviroc 15 mg QD, or placebo in addition to other&#xD;
      antiretrovirals (selected by the investigator to be optimal for the specific subject)&#xD;
      containing at least 3 drugs, including a protease inhibitor (PI) boosted with at least 100 mg&#xD;
      ritonavir QD. Subjects will be continued for up to 48 weeks of dosing.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-site, parallel-group, double-blind study of&#xD;
      vicriviroc (SCH 417690) in 500 adult HIV-infected subjects with R5/X4 mixed viral tropism who&#xD;
      have at least 5000 copies/mL HIV RNA despite standard antiretroviral therapy (ART) that the&#xD;
      subject has been receiving continuously for at least 3 months. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to treatment with vicriviroc 10 mg QD, vicriviroc 15 mg QD, or placebo in addition&#xD;
      to an individually optimized PI-containing ART regimen containing at least 3 drugs, including&#xD;
      a PI, boosted by at least 100 mg ritonavir QD prescribed by the investigator. The vicriviroc&#xD;
      dose and placebo will be double-blind, and the optimized background therapy will be&#xD;
      open-label. Treatment visits after Day 1 are scheduled for Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24,&#xD;
      32, 40, and 48. A planned interim analysis will be conducted when 100 subjects have completed&#xD;
      12 weeks of dosing. After completion of the primary analysis (24-week virologic response of&#xD;
      all subjects), subjects will be given the optimal dose of vicriviroc and follow-up will be&#xD;
      continued to at least 48 weeks. Safety will be monitored by standard laboratory tests,&#xD;
      assessment of adverse events, and emergence of complicating medical conditions. Cardiac&#xD;
      safety will be monitored periodically by ECG, and plasma samples will be collected from all&#xD;
      subjects through the study for population pharmacokinetic analyses.&#xD;
