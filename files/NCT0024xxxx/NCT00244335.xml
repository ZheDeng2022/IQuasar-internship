  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious illness, in which individuals often&#xD;
      experience anxiety and stress. Some individuals with PTSD use drugs to alleviate emotional&#xD;
      distress. This study will examine the role that negative emotional states play in sedative&#xD;
      drug use among individuals with PTSD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a psychiatric illness that occurs following a traumatic event in which there was&#xD;
      threat of injury or death to an individual. Common symptoms of PTSD include anxiety, stress,&#xD;
      and tension. Some individuals with PTSD use benzodiazepines, a type of sedative medication,&#xD;
      or alcohol to alleviate the anxiety associated with the disorder. Past research has shown&#xD;
      that the negative feelings experienced by individuals with PTSD may increase the reinforcing&#xD;
      effects of antidepressant drugs. Feelings of anxiety act as a stimulus, which leads to drug&#xD;
      use; in turn, the anticipated or actual decrease in distress reinforces the drug-taking&#xD;
      behavior. Greater amounts of sedative drugs are then needed to decrease subsequent stress and&#xD;
      anxiety. The purpose of this study is to understand how negative emotional states affect the&#xD;
      reinforcing effects of sedative drugs in individuals with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll two types of individuals, both of whom have been exposed to an&#xD;
      emotional trauma and report using alcohol to reduce emotional distress but who differ in&#xD;
      their subsequent development of PTSD. Participants will take part in an initial screening&#xD;
      session which will include a physical examination, standardized psychological questionnaires,&#xD;
      and review of medical and drug histories. Once enrolled, each participant will take part in 8&#xD;
      experimental session days, with each day of testing separated by at least 48 hours. At the&#xD;
      beginning of each session, a breathalyzer and urine test will be used to screen for the&#xD;
      presence of alcohol and drugs. On Day 1, participants will take part in an orientation&#xD;
      session to familiarize themselves with the laboratory and study procedures. On Days 2 through&#xD;
      4, participants will receive varying doses of alcohol, a placebo drink, a placebo drug, and&#xD;
      alprazolam, a type of benzodiazepine medication. On Days 5 through 8, participants will take&#xD;
      part in experimental challenges designed to induce various emotional states, including&#xD;
      arousal, anxiety, aggression, and anger. They will also complete a monetary reward task to&#xD;
      measure the reinforcing effects of drugs. Participants will complete questionnaires several&#xD;
      times each day to assess anxiety, anger, drug effects, and drug cravings. Heart rate will be&#xD;
      monitored with an electrocardiogram, and electrodes placed on the skin will measure other&#xD;
      physiologic measures throughout each session. Participants will receive compensation for&#xD;
      completing each experimental session.&#xD;
