    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chromatin is is the structural building block of a chromosome. It is found inside the&#xD;
           nucleus of the cell and consists of a complex of DNA and protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancers of the lung, pleura (lung lining) and esophagus show profound changes in&#xD;
           chromatin structure that may affect the course of disease in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A better understanding of these diseases and the genetic changes associated with them&#xD;
           may be helpful in developing new treatments for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate people with cancer of the lung, pleura or esophagus for participation in NCI&#xD;
           clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain biopsies (small pieces of tissue) from tumor, normal tissue and blood samples&#xD;
           to learn more about the cellular changes in blood and tissue in tumors of the lung,&#xD;
           esophagus and pleura and surrounding structures in the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Patients 2 years of age and older with cancer of the lung, esophagus, pleura,&#xD;
      mediastinum or chest wall, or cancers of other origin that have invaded the lung. Note:&#xD;
      Patients &gt;= 2 years of age and under 18 years of age may only participate in research sample&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 1100 patients may be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients undergo standard tests for evaluating the stage of their disease and for&#xD;
           determining eligibility for an NCI investigational treatment study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients undergo bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (&quot;washing&quot; with salt water)&#xD;
           to assess their tumor and collect a sample of normal tissue. Patients whose tumor is&#xD;
           located on the outside portion of the lung may also undergo thoracoscopy to obtain a&#xD;
           tumor sample. For bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage a tube with a light is passed&#xD;
           through the nose or mouth into the lungs to examine the airways. Salt water is injected&#xD;
           through the tube and then withdrawn to obtain cells for laboratory studies. For the&#xD;
           thoracoscopy a small tube with a light is put through a small hole in the chest to&#xD;
           obtain the tumor sample. Both procedures are usually done under general anesthesia. The&#xD;
           tissue is examined to identify cell characteristics of people who respond to certain&#xD;
           therapies and to identify markers on the surface of the tissue that may be useful in&#xD;
           future research and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples are collected from patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are eligible for a treatment study at NCI are offered participation in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients for whom standard surgery, radiation or chemotherapy is more appropriate may&#xD;
           receive treatment at NCI or with their own physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who receive treatment at NCI return for follow-up examinations 4 weeks after&#xD;
           discharge and then every 2 to 4 months depending on the nature of their cancer.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung and esophageal cancers as well as malignant pleural mesotheliomas exhibit&#xD;
           epigenetic perturbations that may impact the clinical course of these neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To date, epigenetic alterations in primary thoracic malignancies and neoplasms&#xD;
           metastatic to the chest have not been evaluated in a systematic, longitudinal manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To permit evaluation of patients referred to the Thoracic Surgery Branch, NCI in order&#xD;
           to identify individuals who will be suitable candidates for clinical research protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain tumor and adjacent normal tissues as well as serum and urine samples from&#xD;
           patients with primary or metastatic malignancies involving the lung, esophagus, pleura,&#xD;
           and mediastinum to support preclinical research endeavors in the Thoracic Surgery&#xD;
           Branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform focused germline testing of genes modulating drug metabolism, possible future&#xD;
           whole genome sequencing studies, possible ex vivo generation of autologous tumor cell&#xD;
           lines and EBV-transformed B cell lines for research. Tumor tissue obtained during&#xD;
           previous protocol participation and cryopreserved may undergo this process if the&#xD;
           patient consents on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To permit standard treatment for patients who are not eligible for investigational&#xD;
           therapy on a current Thoracic Surgery protocol, but who present a novel and unique&#xD;
           clinical training opportunity, or who manifest a clinical condition that requires&#xD;
           immediate intervention to prevent compromise to the patient's well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To permit long term follow up of patients with thoracic malignancies including the&#xD;
           collection of tissue and fluids to support preclinical research particularly to&#xD;
           ascertain if gene expression and DNA methylation profiles coincide with response to&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with potentially malignant or suspicious lesions or with biopsy proven, lung or&#xD;
           esophageal cancers, malignant pleural mesotheliomas, mediastinal or chest wall&#xD;
           neoplasms, thymoma/thymic neoplasms, or pulmonary metastases from cancers of nonthoracic&#xD;
           origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have an ECOG performance score of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 2 years and older. Note: Patients greater than or equal to&#xD;
           2 years of age and under 18 years of age may only participate in research sample&#xD;
           collection if the tissue acquisition is performed during a clinically indicated surgical&#xD;
           procedure, and the sampling of tissue, blood or urine does not add risk to the&#xD;
           clinically indicated procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol is designed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Facilitate screening of patients for investigational protocols in the Thoracic Surgery&#xD;
           Branch, NCI, and to obtain tissue samples to enable evaluation of epigenetic events in&#xD;
           primary and metastatic thoracic malignancies, as an extension of ongoing laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
      research in the Thoracic Epigenetics Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allow for the establishment of tumor cell lines and EBV-transformed B cell lines to&#xD;
           support immunologic evaluation of the patient s response to other clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be screened to determine appropriate diagnostic and treatment&#xD;
           interventions. Where appropriate, patients will receive standard staging, surgical&#xD;
           intervention, and follow up care. Tissue, blood, and/or peritoneal/pleural effusion&#xD;
           samples obtained during surgery/biopsy or clinic visits will be processed and either&#xD;
           stored for analysis or cultured for generation of tumor cell lines and EBV-transformed B&#xD;
           cell lines for research. After recovery from biopsy or surgery patients will continue to&#xD;
           be followed, blood and urine samples may be collected as well as tissue when&#xD;
           appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No investigational treatment will be administered on this protocol. In circumstances&#xD;
           approved by the Section Chief, a patient may be deemed ineligible for investigational&#xD;
           therapy, yet may undergo standard of care treatment at the NIH Clinical Center on this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is anticipated that the protocol will enroll a maximum of 1100 patients.&#xD;
