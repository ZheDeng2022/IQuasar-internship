    <textblock>
      Weekly carboplatin and taxotere will be tolerable and effective as second line treatment of&#xD;
      platinum-sensitive ( &gt;6 month treatment free interval) relapsed ovarian cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy parameter will be response rate (CR and PR) according to RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be duration of response, progression free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival. Toxicity will also be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common malignancy in women, with estimated 2500 cases&#xD;
      diagnosed in 2001, and 1500 deaths. Despite maximal cytoreductive therapy, followed normally&#xD;
      by a taxane and carboplatin (or cisplatin) chemotherapy, most patients will relapse, and&#xD;
      require chemotherapy in a palliative setting. The goal of this second line therapy is to&#xD;
      prolong survival and to improve quality of life. This disease has been characterized as&#xD;
      chronic, as many patients may eventually go on to respond to additional lines of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to second line therapy has been correlated to length of time since the end of the&#xD;
      first line treatment (treatment free interval, TFI). Patients relapsing or progressing while&#xD;
      on therapy are defined as platinum-refractory. In North America the norm is to label patients&#xD;
      with a TFI of 6 months or less as platinum-resistant. A TFI of greater than 6 months would&#xD;
      make a patient platinum-sensitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These platinum-sensitive patients are generally treated with single agent carboplatin or&#xD;
      carboplatin and taxol by 3-weekly administration. The ICON-4 trial published in June 2003&#xD;
      compared single agent platinum to combination of platinum-taxol. Patients could have received&#xD;
      one or both of these agents in the adjuvant setting. At a median follow-up of 42 months the&#xD;
      absolute difference in 2-year survival was 7% [P=0.0004} in favor of the combination arm.&#xD;
      Thus combination platinum-taxol is the present standard of care in platinum-sensitive&#xD;
      relapsed ovarian cancer. Use of taxol is limited by persistent neuropathy in 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently there is growing evidence in support of giving chemotherapy at shorter intervals at&#xD;
      low-doses. Hypothetically, this allows less advancement of cancer cells through the cell&#xD;
      cycle. Moreover weekly taxanes are associated with an anti-angiogenic effect- more so with&#xD;
      taxotere than taxol in cell-lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several randomized trials in breast cancer have shown the improved efficacy of weekly taxol&#xD;
      over 3-weekly taxol. The neoadjuvant study showed an increase in pCR [complete response on&#xD;
      pathologic evaluation] of 10%with weekly taxol. The adjuvant study with 2-weekly chemotherapy&#xD;
      showed a 7% improvement in time-to-progression over 3-weekly chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ovarian cancer- a Phase II study of weekly carboplatin (AUC-2) with taxol (80mg/m2/week)&#xD;
      given on day 1,8,15 of 28 day cycles has shown a response rate of 100% [80% CR, 20% PR] in 21&#xD;
      platinum-sensitive patients- with either measurable or evaluable disease. Median duration of&#xD;
      response was 11.7 months (95% CI- 8.0-18.5 months). 46% reported Grade I neuropathy, 1&#xD;
      patient had febrile neutropenia, and 32% had Grade 3 neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly administration of taxotere with carboplatin has been studied in a Phase I study.&#xD;
      Maximum tolerated dose was Taxotere 35mg/m2 with carboplatin AUC-2. At this dose no Grade 3&#xD;
      or 4 cytopenias were seen. Nor were there significant neuropathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study plans to evaluate Taxotere 35mg/m2 with Carboplatin at AUC-2 given weekly. 3 weekly&#xD;
      treatments will constitute one cycle. We expect to see equivalent response rates and&#xD;
      equivalent or higher duration of responses with better toxicity profile.&#xD;
