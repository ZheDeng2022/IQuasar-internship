  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if checking smoking status as a routine vital sign&#xD;
      increases the delivery rate of cessation counseling to adult smokers in primary care&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two national clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have advised primary care physicians to&#xD;
      implement an office-wide system for screening and recording tobacco-use status for every&#xD;
      patient at every office visit. These guidelines specifically recommended checking smoking&#xD;
      status as a vital sign. This tracking system is elegantly simple: As a prompt for the&#xD;
      physician, the nursing staff records the patient's response to a brief inquiry of their&#xD;
      smoking status (current, former, never) with the other vital sign data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific evidence that this measure increases physician counseling or smoking cessation is&#xD;
      limited. The proposed study evaluates the effectiveness of the vital sign intervention&#xD;
      through a practice-level randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18 practices will be recruited for the 9 month study. Eligible practices will include primary&#xD;
      care practices (family practice or internal medicine) with an average of two or more&#xD;
      full-time equivalent providers (including physician assistants and nurse practitioners), not&#xD;
      already using (or planning to institute during the study period) a practice-wide tobacco&#xD;
      identification and reminder system, and willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will occur in two phases; baseline and post intervention. The purpose of&#xD;
      baseline data collection is to provide a baseline counseling rate for each office prior to&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of both data collection periods, research assistants (RAs) will visit&#xD;
      individual practices on a rotating basis (about 16 visits per site on average). On average,&#xD;
      practices will be visited once a week during the baseline month and twice a month during the&#xD;
      intervention phase. The frequency of visits will be adjusted in an ongoing fashion by the PI,&#xD;
      as practices with a smaller number of providers, a lower prevalence of smokers, or a lower&#xD;
      survey participation rate will necessitate proportionally more visits to keep data collection&#xD;
      balanced at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RA will recruit patients following their interaction with the provider to participate in&#xD;
      a one page in-office survey. Upon returning the in-office survey, self-identified adult&#xD;
      current smokers who visited a physician that day will be recruited to participate in a 4 page&#xD;
      mail-back survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both surveys are anonymous. A matching key code will be recorded on the returned in-office&#xD;
      survey for those patients given a mail-back survey to allow linked analysis, while&#xD;
      maintaining complete patient anonymity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the baseline data collection, practices will be matched in clusters (by baseline&#xD;
      cessation counseling rate) and randomized within each cluster to intervention and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention practices, the research coordinator will work with the office manager to&#xD;
      implement the most appropriate method of recording the vital sign for that practice. To&#xD;
      facilitate timely implementation, the research coordinator will begin these discussions with&#xD;
      all the practices early in the study so that it can be implemented smoothly once the&#xD;
      randomization is determined. Depending on how the practice currently records routine vital&#xD;
      signs and documents visits in the chart, smoking as vital sign could be implemented with a&#xD;
      stamp on the visit note, modification to forms and/or progress note paper, or modification to&#xD;
      a vital sign flow sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately prior to implementation of the smoking vital sign in the 9 intervention&#xD;
      practices, the research coordinator will conduct an in-service training session with the&#xD;
      practices' nursing staff. For the six months intervention period in the intervention&#xD;
      practices, the nursing staff will record the patient's response to a brief inquiry of their&#xD;
      smoking status (current, former, never) with the other vital sign data. This information is&#xD;
      to be assessed routinely at each adult patient visit to the practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the exception of nursing staff assessing and recording the smoking vital sign, all other&#xD;
      work of data collection will be done by VCU research staff. No intervention with providers&#xD;
      will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the six months intervention period and only in the intervention sites, the office or&#xD;
      nursing manager will be provided with periodic reports on how often patients' report having&#xD;
      been asked whether they smoke (a measure of implementation of the intervention) and asked to&#xD;
      share this with the nursing staff through the practice's usual QA/QI mechanisms to reinforce&#xD;
      continued performance of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account the clustered design, statistical significance for the primary and&#xD;
      secondary hypotheses will be tested by hierarchical logistic regression using the SAS and&#xD;
      Sudaan statistical software. The mean rates for intervention practices will be compared to&#xD;
      the mean rates for control practices. Temporal trends for patient report of intervention&#xD;
      performance (having been asked their smoking status) and of the rates of cessation counseling&#xD;
      for intervention and control practices will be portrayed in time-series graphs. A&#xD;
      repeated-measures design will be incorporated into the categorical models to test the&#xD;
      statistical significance of temporal trends. Secondary data analysis will examine possible&#xD;
      influences of visit and smoking-related factors, provider, patient demographics, and health&#xD;
      status by adding these covariables to the categorical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resolving scientific uncertainty about the vital sign's effectiveness is important. Tobacco&#xD;
      remains the leading cause of death and disability in this country. Few practices have adopted&#xD;
      the vital sign or any other type of tobacco tracking or reminder system. Evidence that this&#xD;
      intervention increases physician counseling with smokers would therefore argue for a change&#xD;
      in current practice patterns. If the vital sign intervention is not effective, then&#xD;
      expectations that practices adopt it (as recommended in the CPG) may be misguided.&#xD;
      Increasingly, primary care physicians are being encouraged to modify their practices to&#xD;
      incorporate quality-of-care interventions that lack scientific evidence of effectiveness.&#xD;
      Using randomized controlled trials to test the effectiveness of guidelines, including those&#xD;
      that are evidence-based, is necessary to insure that they are relevant and useful when&#xD;
      applied in typical primary care practices.&#xD;
