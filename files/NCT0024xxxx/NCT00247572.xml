  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to evaluate if NRP 104 is a safe drug. The other purpose is to&#xD;
      learn if NRP104, when injected into a vein, produces a high and any other effects like&#xD;
      amphetamine and other stimulant drugs that are abused. This information will give some&#xD;
      indication if NRP104 can be abused. Healthy people, between the ages of 18 and 55 with&#xD;
      histories of substance abuse that include stimulant drugs, may join. Amphetamines are drugs&#xD;
      that are used most often to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in&#xD;
      children, to treat narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness) and for weight loss.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for a non-scheduled stimulant medication that can provide symptom control for&#xD;
      children with ADHD as the conventional stimulant products do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the top line amphetamine product Adderall XR (R) for the treatment of children&#xD;
      with ADHD involves a once-a-day morning dosing of up to 30 mg per day per Adderall XR (R)&#xD;
      Package Insert. New River Pharmaceuticals has developed three NRP104 dose strengths of 30 mg,&#xD;
      50 mg, and 70 mg to provide amphetamine base equivalent to Adderall XR (R) 10 mg, 20 mg, and&#xD;
      30 mg, respectively. Adderall XR (R) and other amphetamine and methylphenidate containing&#xD;
      preparations are liable to intravenous abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the development of NRP104 for treatment of children with ADHD, it is important to&#xD;
      evaluate the abuse potential of NRP104 given intravenously in comparison to immediate release&#xD;
      d-amphetamine. This study will conduct relevant information to address appropriately the&#xD;
      objectives of determining abuse potential of intravenously administered NRP104.&#xD;
