      To assess equivalence in the rates of functional graft survival at 12 months after&#xD;
      transplantation in patients receiving induction therapy with cyclosporin (CsA, Neoral) and&#xD;
      Rapamune® followed by CsA dose reduction and concentration-controlled Rapamune® versus&#xD;
      induction with CsA and Rapamune® followed by discontinuation of CsA and&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: = to ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  End-stage renal disease, with patients scheduled to receive a primary or secondary&#xD;
             renal allograft from a cadaveric donor, from a living-unrelated donor, or from a&#xD;
             living-related donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with second and subsequent transplants must have maintained their primary&#xD;
             graft for at least 6 months after transplantation (with the exception of graft failure&#xD;
             due to technical reasons).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active systemic or localised major infection prior to initial Rapamune®&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of infiltrate, cavitation, or consolidation on chest x-ray obtained during&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational drug or treatment up to 4 weeks prior to enrolling in the&#xD;
             study and during the 12-month treatment phase. Exception: the use of erythropoiesis&#xD;
             stimulating products. In these cases, erythrocyte-stimulating products must be&#xD;
             discontinued prior to administration of Rapamune®.&#xD;
