  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability of a new recombinant porcine coagulation factor VIII, B-domain deleted (called&#xD;
      &quot;OBI-1&quot;), to control the non-life- or limb-threatening bleeding episodes patients with&#xD;
      hemophilia A commonly develop is being evaluated. Patients with congenital hemophilia A and a&#xD;
      low-titer (&lt;20 Bethesda units [Bu]) inhibitory antibody to OBI-1, who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, will receive OBI-1 to treat their soft tissue or joint bleeding&#xD;
      episode. At least the first two treatment episodes will be performed in the controlled&#xD;
      setting of the hemophilia center/clinic/office, where any side effects can be observed. If&#xD;
      the patient continues to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, has had no serious or severe&#xD;
      adverse reactions to OBI-1, and has been in a home care program, the investigator may permit&#xD;
      the patient to self-administer OBI-1 at home to treat subsequent bleeding episodes. The study&#xD;
      will continue at least until 12 or more patients have received at least 24 treatment episodes&#xD;
      in the aggregate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the hemostatic activity of OBI-1 to control&#xD;
      a bleeding episode in hemophilia A patients with inhibitors who are experiencing a non-life&#xD;
      and/or non-limb threatening bleeding episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study will be to assess the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  safety of OBI-1,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serial anti-OBI-1 and anti-human factor VIII (fVIII) inhibitor antibody responses&#xD;
           following therapeutic administration of OBI-1, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pharmacokinetics of OBI-1 administered to control a bleeding episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After qualifying for the study at a Screening visit, patients will come to the investigator&#xD;
      for treatment of a qualifying bleeding episode. After baseline blood samples are taken for&#xD;
      inhibitor titer, a Loading Dose of OBI-1, calculated to inactivate the inhibitor, will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously. After a blood sample is drawn to measure inhibitor titer and&#xD;
      fVIII level, a Treatment Dose of 50 U/kg is administered. Serial blood samples will be drawn&#xD;
      for fVIII levels for pharmacokinetics. At 6-hour intervals, additional Treatment doses, at&#xD;
      increasing dose levels up to 150 U/kg, may be given if needed. Follow-up safety evaluations,&#xD;
      beginning at Day 14, are scheduled; inhibitor titers against human fVIII and OBI-1 will be&#xD;
      measured to assess continuing eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second qualifying bleeding episode will be treated as the first, but without&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic samples. If the patient's inhibitor titer against OBI-1 rises to &gt; 20 Bu,&#xD;
      further treatments with OBI-1 will be suspended until the titer decreases to 20 Bu or lower.&#xD;
      Third and subsequent treatment episodes may be self-administered by the patient, under strict&#xD;
      supervision of the investigator, in home care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will continue until at least 12 patients have received at least 24 treatments,&#xD;
      unless the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) recommends a change in dosing calculations&#xD;
      sooner.&#xD;
