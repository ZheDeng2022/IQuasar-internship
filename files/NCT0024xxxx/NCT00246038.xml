      A prospective, actively controlled, consecutively enrolling, non-randomized multi center&#xD;
      clinical evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the Boston Scientific ENOVUS AAA Endograft&#xD;
      when used in the treatment of patients with AAA (Treatment Group) as compared to patients&#xD;
      treated with conventional open surgery (Control Group).&#xD;

      The primary objectives of this study are to determine whether the Boston Scientific ENOVUS&#xD;
      AAA Endograft is a safe and effective method of treating AAA's in those patients considered&#xD;
      to be suitable candidates for open surgical repair. The safety of the Boston Scientific&#xD;
      ENOVUS AAA Endograft will be determined by comparing the rate of major morbidity in the&#xD;
      Treatment Group against the rate of major morbidity in the Control Group within 30 days of&#xD;
      the initial procedure. The efficacy of the Boston Scientific ENOVUS AAA Endograft will be&#xD;
      determined by evaluating the proportion of patients in the Treatment Group that are free from&#xD;
      AAA rupture and conversion to open surgical repair within 1 year of the initial procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary safety endpoints will be compared between the Treatment and Control&#xD;
      Groups:Mortality rates at 30 days and 1 year, AAA related mortality at 30 days and 1 year.&#xD;
      The secondary efficacy endpoints will be evaluated in the Treatment Group only and include:&#xD;
      Technical success, enlargement of AAA, migration, significant endoleak, and loss of device&#xD;
      integrity. Secondary Clinical Utility endpoints will be compared between the Treatment and&#xD;
      Control groups and will include: blood loss, duration of procedure, ICU stay, length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, and duration of anesthesia.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for&#xD;

               1. Patient is &gt; 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Females of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test at the time of&#xD;
                  treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patient has signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent&#xD;
                  Form&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patient is considered by the treating physician to be a candidate (i.e.,&#xD;
                  categories I, II, or III) for elective open surgical repair of the AAA per&#xD;
                  American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) refer to Appendix II. ASA grade IV&#xD;
                  patients may be enrolled provided their life expectancy is greater than 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Patient has an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that meets at least one of&#xD;
                  the following:â€¢Abdominal aortic aneurysm &gt;4.5 cm in diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Aneurysm has increased in size by 0.5 cm in last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Maximum diameter of aneurysm exceeds one and one-half times the transverse&#xD;
                       dimension of an adjacent normal aortic segment&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Patient must be willing to comply with all required follow-up exams (open&#xD;
                  surgical control patients are followed through one year, Treatment Group patients&#xD;
                  are followed through five years in the study with lifelong follow up by physician&#xD;
                  thereafter).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
