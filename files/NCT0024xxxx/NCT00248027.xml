      Main Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Who are the patients referred for treatment at the Psychotic Disorders Clinic?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the outcomes from treatment for first episode psychosis in multiple outcome&#xD;
           domains?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What hospital resources are used over the early course of the illness?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How satisfied are patients and family with the treatment and services they received?&#xD;
           This is an important study that will help us evaluate the service and treatment offered&#xD;
           by the Psychotic Disorders Clinic's specialized early intervention program,which helps&#xD;
           young people experiencing early stages of psychotic illness.A growing body of evidence&#xD;
           suggests that intervening earlier in the course of the illness with specialized and&#xD;
           complimentary pharmacological and psychosocial treatment may be associated with improved&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;

      The project is primarily a descriptive study of individuals experiencing their first episode&#xD;
      of psychosis presenting at the Psychotic Disorders Clinic/Early Intervention Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Track multi-dimensional outcomes within the program&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Track service use&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare outcomes for this early intervention program with outcomes noted in published&#xD;
           follow up studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate effectiveness of the Psychotic Disorders Clinic in improving outcomes for&#xD;
           persons experiencing their first episode of psychosis&#xD;
