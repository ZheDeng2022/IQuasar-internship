      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of three doses of&#xD;
      prolonged-release methylphenidate (a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant) in adult&#xD;
      patients with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stimulant therapy is the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment for attention&#xD;
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. Methylphenidate is the&#xD;
      most commonly prescribed and most frequently studied stimulant medication for children and&#xD;
      adolescents with this disorder. It is widely acknowledged in the scientific literature that&#xD;
      ADHD often will persist into adulthood. Few large-scale, rigorous studies have been conducted&#xD;
      to investigate the effectiveness and safety of stimulant therapy in treating ADHD in adults.&#xD;
      This is a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group,&#xD;
      dose-response study comparing three doses of prolonged-release methylphenidate (18, 36, and&#xD;
      72 mg once-daily) versus placebo in adult patients with ADHD. The primary efficacy outcome&#xD;
      will be the change from baseline to the end of the double-blind phase in the sum of the&#xD;
      inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale scores of the investigator-rated Conners'&#xD;
      Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS). Additional measures of effectiveness will include the&#xD;
      following scales: CAARS-self report, to rate items pertaining to the patient's&#xD;
      behavior/problems; Clinical Global Impression (CGI), to rate the severity of a patient's&#xD;
      illness; Sheehan's Disability Scale (SDS), to measure the extent to which a patient's work,&#xD;
      social life or leisure activities and home life or family responsibilities are impaired by&#xD;
      his/her symptoms; Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q); and the&#xD;
      Global Assessment of Effectiveness. Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the&#xD;
      study. The study hypothesis is that prolonged-release methylphenidate taken once-daily will&#xD;
      produce clinically significant improvements compared with placebo on measures of inattention&#xD;
      and hyperactivity/impulsivity of the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale in patients with adult&#xD;
      ADHD. Prolonged-release methylphenidate 18, 36 or 72 mg oral capsules, or placebo, taken&#xD;
      once-daily for 5 weeks. Eligible patients may continue prolonged-release methylphenidate in&#xD;
      an open-label extension study for an additional 7 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults with a diagnosis of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) according&#xD;
             to DSM-IV criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ADHD symptoms from childhood to adulthood, with some symptoms present before age 7&#xD;
             years which continue to meet DSM-IV criteria at the time of assessment. (ADHD is not&#xD;
             diagnosed if the symptoms are better accounted for by another psychiatric disorder.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients known to be a non-responder to methylphenidate or known to have a child who&#xD;
             is a non-responder to methylphenidate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  treated with any methylphenidate-containing medication within 1 month of starting the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have any clinically unstable psychiatric condition including, but not limited to the&#xD;
             following: acute mood disorder, bipolar disorder, acute obsessive-compulsive disorder,&#xD;
             anti-social personality disorder, borderline personality disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  family history of schizophrenia or affective psychosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with motor tics or a history of Tourette's syndrome, or with a substance&#xD;
             abuse or dependence disorder, an eating disorder, or mental retardation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  using any medications which may affect the evaluation of study results&#xD;
