      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CONCERTA®&#xD;
      (methylphenidate hydrochloride, a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant) versus placebo for&#xD;
      the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adolescents..&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CONCERTA®&#xD;
      (methylphenidate hydrochloride) in the treatment of adolescents with Attention Deficit&#xD;
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study with adolescents ages 13-18 diagnosed with ADHD. The study consists&#xD;
      of four phases. The Screening Phase establishes the diagnosis of ADHD and provides a one-week&#xD;
      washout period without any ADHD medication. The Open-Label Titration Phase initiates the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with one CONCERTA® 18 mg daily. Thereafter, the dose is increased&#xD;
      approximately every 7 days in 18 mg increments (to a maximum of 72 mg daily), until an&#xD;
      individualized dose is identified, based on the clinical judgment of the investigator. During&#xD;
      the Double-Blind Phase, subjects are randomized to receive either their individualized&#xD;
      CONCERTA® dose or a placebo, for a period of 2 weeks. Subjects who successfully complete the&#xD;
      Double-Blind Phase are eligible to receive CONCERTA® for an 8-week, Open-Label, Follow-up&#xD;
      Phase. The primary efficacy measurement is the total score of the ADHD Rating Scale,&#xD;
      evaluated by the investigator at the end of the Double-Blind Phase. Safety assessments&#xD;
      include monitoring adverse events, electrocardiograms (ECG), blood pressure, pulse, height&#xD;
      and weight throughout the course of the study. The study hypothesis is that CONCERTA® is more&#xD;
      effective than placebo in the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in&#xD;
      adolescents, and is well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Titration Phase: CONCERTA® 18 mg taken orally, once daily, and increased approximately every&#xD;
      7 days in 18 mg increments up to a maximum daily dose of 72 mg. Double-Blind Phase:&#xD;
      Individualized dose of CONCERTA® or placebo for 2 weeks. Open-Label Phase: Individualized&#xD;
      dose of CONCERTA® for 8 weeks.&#xD;
