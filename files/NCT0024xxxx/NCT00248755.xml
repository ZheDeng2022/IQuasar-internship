  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of airway surface liquid (ASL) volume&#xD;
      on mucociliary clearance in cystic fibrosis (CF). A two-isotope nuclear medicine technique&#xD;
      will be utilized. This pilot trial will include the imaging of n=7 CF subjects and n=7&#xD;
      healthy subjects. The trial will include one study visit per subject that will take&#xD;
      approximately 3 hours. Hypothesis: The simultaneous imaging of both a &quot;floating&quot; and a&#xD;
      &quot;penetrating&quot; radioisotope tag will allow the relative effect of airway surface liquid volume&#xD;
      on mucociliary clearance to be determined when evaluated in CF and normal subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Improper function of the mucociliary clearance system in the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) lung is a&#xD;
      major factor contributing to the chronic respiratory manifestations of the disease. Normally&#xD;
      this host defense mechanism removes inhaled pathogens and toxins from the inner surfaces of&#xD;
      the lung. In CF, mutations in the CF gene result in dysfunction of the Cystic Fibrosis&#xD;
      Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) ion channel on the cells that line the airway&#xD;
      epithelium, causing improper fluxes of ions such as sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate. The so&#xD;
      called &quot;low volume&quot; hypothesis of CF pathogenesis contends that the liquid lining the airways&#xD;
      becomes very thin and viscous due to abnormal absorption of sodium from the airways, which&#xD;
      draws water out of the airways, partially or totally defeating mucociliary clearance. The&#xD;
      rate at which the mucociliary system clears materials from the lungs can be quantified using&#xD;
      a nuclear medicine test called a mucociliary clearance scan. This study pilots a new&#xD;
      variation of the mucociliary clearance scan that uses both &quot;floating&quot; and &quot;penetrating&quot;&#xD;
      radioisotope tags. The difference in clearance between these tags will provide information on&#xD;
      how airway surface liquid volume affects mucociliary clearance. This pilot trial will include&#xD;
      the imaging of n=5 CF subjects and n=5 healthy subjects.&#xD;
