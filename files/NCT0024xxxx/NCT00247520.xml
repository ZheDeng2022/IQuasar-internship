    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether rEV131 when given as a nasal spray in a single&#xD;
      dose to each nostril is safe and can reduce the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay&#xD;
      fever) caused by an allergen challenge. All patients enrolled will be known to be allergic to&#xD;
      ragweed pollen and will be given ragweed pollen extract in both nostrils 30 minutes after&#xD;
      either rEV131 or innactive vehicle (placebo). The signs and symptoms (sneezing, itching,&#xD;
      stuffiness and runny nose) will each be given a score from 0 to 3 by the patient and these&#xD;
      will be added together and the combined scores from patients treated with rEV131 will be&#xD;
      compared with those who received placebo.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: rEV131, a histamine binding protein (derived from tick saliva) with an affinity&#xD;
      for histamine 10 - 100 fold that of natural histamine receptors, might attenuate Nasal&#xD;
      Allergen Challenge (NAC) induced allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients with known ragweed allergy will be screened to determine the minimal&#xD;
      threshold concentration (PD30) of pollen extract that consistently induces the four key&#xD;
      symptoms of allergic rhinitis: itch, sneezing, congestion and mucus production. A&#xD;
      standardised system of TNSS scoring will be used. A total of 112 eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomised in double blind fashion to receive one of four concentrations of rEV131 (0.63,&#xD;
      1.25, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml) by nasal spray 30 minutes prior to NAC or placebo. Symptoms will be&#xD;
      scored at 15, 30 and 45 minutes post NAC. Mean sum of symptom scores of all active medication&#xD;
      treated patients will be compared with those of placebo treated patients. The primary&#xD;
      analysis will be the sum of scores at 15 minutes post challenge for the optimum concentration&#xD;
      of rEV131. Secondary outcome variables will include comparison of individual symptom and&#xD;
      percentage of patients having a clinically significant response.&#xD;
