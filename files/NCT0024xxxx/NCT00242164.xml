  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being performed to better understand dialysis techniques which keep heart&#xD;
      functions stable during dialysis. People on dialysis have a high risk for heart disease and&#xD;
      strokes. More information about dialysis techniques that keep hearts stable may help prevent&#xD;
      the high risk of cardiovascular disease and death and help to reduce discomfort during&#xD;
      dialysis. This study will look at the way that the magnesium in dialysate affects heart&#xD;
      function during dialysis. High or low levels of magnesium may change the way hearts beat. The&#xD;
      question asked is if lowering the amount of magnesium in dialysate will affect the amount of&#xD;
      magnesium in blood or change the heart beat.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart disease is a major cause of illness and death among patients on dialysis. Changes in&#xD;
      the heart's rhythm and sudden cardiac death are also important problems in this group.&#xD;
      Abnormal rhythm can occur during hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During dialysis, the blood comes in contact with a solution called dialysate. This solution&#xD;
      contains minerals like calcium, potassium and magnesium. Some studies have indirectly&#xD;
      suggested that lower magnesium in dialysis patients protects them from having rhythm&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors that increase the chance for the development of abnormal rhythms can be indirectly&#xD;
      assessed by evaluating the electrocardiogram (EKG). This is done by measuring the distance&#xD;
      between the wave forms on the EKG. One of these is called the QT interval. QT dispersion is a&#xD;
      value derived from the QT interval. A long QT interval is thought to make an individual more&#xD;
      prone to having abnormal heart rhythms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is planned to study the effect of low levels of magnesium in the dialysate on QT&#xD;
      interval and dispersion and the tendency for rhythm change. QT interval changes will be&#xD;
      compared during dialysis with low magnesium with QT interval changes during dialysis with&#xD;
      normal magnesium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a cross over trial including 24 adult male and female patients on chronic&#xD;
      hemodialysis. Subjects will be studied during two of their regular dialysis sessions, the&#xD;
      only difference being the amount of magnesium in the dialysate. QT interval and QT dispersion&#xD;
      will be calculated from the EKG recordings before and after each dialysis session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will lead to a better understanding of cardiovascular risks in&#xD;
      patients undergoing chronic dialysis and may offer a potentially novel strategy to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of abnormal heart rhythms risk during dialysis.&#xD;
