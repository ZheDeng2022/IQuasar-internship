  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial involves a radiation treatment called stereotactic radiotherapy in&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer patients who have been determined to be ineligible for surgery.&#xD;
      This treatment differs from conventional radiotherapy in the number of treatments, the&#xD;
      radiation dose given per treatment, and the way the radiation beams are directed toward the&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common treatment for early stage lung cancers is to remove the cancer with surgery.&#xD;
      Patients with serious underlying health problems like emphysema, diabetes, or heart disease&#xD;
      who develop an early stage lung cancer may not be eligible for the standard surgical&#xD;
      treatment. The most common alternative to surgery is conventional radiation treatment called&#xD;
      fractionated radiotherapy. &quot;Fractionated radiotherapy&quot; means several weeks of treatment with&#xD;
      daily radiation sessions. While this treatment is sometimes successful at killing the cancer,&#xD;
      it is not as effective as surgery and may significantly damage the surrounding lung tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newer treatments using radiotherapy have been developed and used for patients with metastases&#xD;
      (spreading cancer) to the lungs. Stereotactic radiotherapy uses a frame to guide highly&#xD;
      focused beams of radiation at the cancer while avoiding the normal surrounding tissue.&#xD;
      Stereotactic radiotherapy also uses a higher daily dose of radiation. The higher daily dose&#xD;
      may be more effective than conventional radiotherapy at killing cancer cells and may also&#xD;
      decrease side effects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Consistent with most therapeutic oncology trials, patients are not actively &quot;recruited,&quot;&#xD;
        but are screened by their physician for appropriate clinical trial(s) at the time of their&#xD;
        routine clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients must be willing and capable to provide informed consent to participate in the&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible patients must have appropriate staging studies identifying them as AJCC stage I&#xD;
        (T1 or T2, N0, M0) primary lung carcinoma. The patient should not have direct evidence of&#xD;
        regional or distant metastases after appropriate staging studies. Histologic confirmation&#xD;
        will be required by either biopsy or cytology. The following primary cancer types are&#xD;
        eligible: Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma, Large cell carcinoma, bronchioloalveolar&#xD;
        cell carcinoma or non-small cell; not otherwise specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The primary tumor must be deemed technically resectable by an experienced thoracic cancer&#xD;
        clinician, with a reasonable possibility of obtaining a gross total resection with negative&#xD;
        margins (defined as a potentially curative resection, PCR); however, the patient should&#xD;
        have underlying physiological medical problems that would prohibit a PCR due to a low&#xD;
        probability of tolerating general anesthesia, the operation, the post-operative recovery&#xD;
        period, or the removal of adjacent functioning lung. Standard &quot;cut-off &quot; guidelines&#xD;
        regarding surgical resection of NSCLC include the following: Baseline FEV1 &lt;40%,&#xD;
        post-operative predicted FEV1 &lt;30%, severely reduced diffusion capacity, baseline hypoxemia&#xD;
        and/or hypercapnia and exercise oxygen consumption &lt;50% predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who refuse a PCR due to preference, ideology, emotional or psychological issues,&#xD;
        mental illness, or inability to give consent for the PCR and who have no specific accepted&#xD;
        medical contraindications for the PCR are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible patients should not have had previous lung or mediastinal radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There must be no plans for the patient to receive other concomitant antineoplastic therapy&#xD;
        while on this protocol. Patients who have received chemotherapy within 8 weeks of the start&#xD;
        date of study are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be able to fit inside the stereotactic body frame and able to undergo a CT or&#xD;
        MRI scan in the frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient's primary tumor must not be larger than 7.0 cm in greatest dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with active systemic, pulmonary, or pericardial infection are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant or lactating women are ineligible. Women/men of reproductive potential may not&#xD;
        participate unless they agreed to use an effective contraceptive method such as&#xD;
        condom/diaphragm and spermicidal foam, intrauterine device (IUD), or prescription birth&#xD;
        control pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be past their 18th birthday at time of registration. Karnofsky performance&#xD;
        status &gt; 60.&#xD;
