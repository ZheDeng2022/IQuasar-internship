    <textblock>
      Esophagectomy for benign or malignant disease of the esophagus can be performed using a&#xD;
      transhiatal technique or Ivor Lewis technique (combined laparotomy with thoracotomy). These&#xD;
      procedures can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality [1]. Advances in&#xD;
      minimally invasive technology and surgical techniques have allowed us to explore the&#xD;
      possibility of performing esophagectomy using minimally invasive surgical techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimally invasive esophagectomy represents a new alternative to conventional open&#xD;
      esophagectomy. It is a technically demanding operation requiring advanced laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgical skills, appropriate instrumentation, and thorough knowledge of open esophagectomy.&#xD;
      Multiple authors have reported the use of video-assisted thoracoscopy or laparoscopy to&#xD;
      facilitate esophagectomy [2-6]. Most of these reports have utilized a standard laparotomy in&#xD;
      combination with thoracoscopy to perform esophageal mobilization or laparoscopy with a&#xD;
      mini-laparotomy to perform esophagectomy. DePaula was the first to report a large series of&#xD;
      48 patients undergoing laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy for benign (n=24) and malignant&#xD;
      disease (n=24) [7]. In 2 patients, conversion to open surgery was required and 2 others&#xD;
      required thoracoscopic assistance. Postoperative complications were low in the benign group&#xD;
      but higher in the carcinoma group. The 30-day mortality rate was 16% in patients with&#xD;
      carcinoma undergoing laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy. DePaula concluded that the&#xD;
      patients who benefit most from this procedure are those with benign disease. Swanstrom&#xD;
      recently reported nine cases of laparoscopic total esophagectomy [8]. There were no&#xD;
      conversions to laparotomy. One patient required a right thoracoscopy with intrathoracic&#xD;
      anastomosis due to poor viability of the gastric tube. The mean operative time was 6.5 hours&#xD;
      with a mean hospital stay of 6.4 days. However, the advantages of minimally invasive&#xD;
      esophagectomy have not been observed. The aim of this prospective trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      physiologic outcome, clinical outcome, and quality of life after combined thoracoscopic and&#xD;
      laparoscopic esophagectomy vs. transhiatal esophagectomy.&#xD;

      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open esophagectomy can be associated with significant morbidity. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      laparoscopic esophagectomy is associated with reduced morbidity and a faster recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic esophagectomy can be performed safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic esophagectomy is associated with reduced&#xD;
           postoperative pain, decrease ICU and hospital stay, and reduced postoperative wound&#xD;
           morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic esophagectomy is associated with similar long&#xD;
           term survival as with the open approach for patients with esophageal malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare short-term outcome such as operative time, operative and in-patient costs,&#xD;
           operative complications, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications&#xD;
           between combined thoracoscopic/ laparoscopic esophagectomy and transhiatal&#xD;
           esophagectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate physiologic outcomes after minimally invasive esophagectomy vs. transhiatal&#xD;
           esophagectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the long-term outcome, disease-free survival, survival and quality of life&#xD;
           after minimally invasive esophagectomy compared to transhiatal esophagectomy&#xD;
