  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary observations suggest positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with an F-18&#xD;
      labeled thymidine analog (FLT) can selectively identify proliferating and non-proliferating&#xD;
      tissues, including tumors. FLT uptake in the tumor appears to reflect the level of cells&#xD;
      undergoing DNA synthesis. This is clinically important because cell proliferation markers&#xD;
      have significant prognostic value, both prior to initiating radiotherapy and as they change&#xD;
      during the course of therapy. In the proposed study, the researchers assess the&#xD;
      biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of FLT to obtain the necessary data to file an&#xD;
      Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The&#xD;
      information collected under Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC) approval will not be&#xD;
      used for diagnostic purposes, to assess the subject's response to therapy, or for clinical&#xD;
      management of the subject.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 40,000 new cases of head and neck cancer each year in the United&#xD;
      States. Worldwide more than 500,000 individuals will develop head and neck cancer each year,&#xD;
      ranking as the sixth most common cancer. These cancers are predominately squamous cell&#xD;
      cancers. Approximately two thirds of subjects will present with locally advanced disease with&#xD;
      either large disease at the primary site and/or spread to regional lymph node levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite aggressive treatment, 5-year survival remains poor (overall, approximately 50%). The&#xD;
      major site of treatment failure is within the head and neck region, with distant metastases&#xD;
      occurring in approximately 25% of subjects and usually after local and/or regional (nodal)&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment options for locally advanced head and neck cancer include combinations of&#xD;
      surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. It is currently difficult to predict which&#xD;
      combination will be best suited for any particular individual. Rapid methods of assessing the&#xD;
      response of subjects to chemo-radiotherapy would be a useful tool, as it would permit the&#xD;
      oncologist to change therapies, either in type or degree, in cases when the subject does not&#xD;
      respond to the initial therapy regimen. Current best methods of evaluating tumor response are&#xD;
      either serial CT examinations, so that changes in tumor size can be estimated or a&#xD;
      fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) study in which changes in the&#xD;
      metabolic status of the tumor are evaluated. Unfortunately, the anatomic information afforded&#xD;
      by CT examinations often require months after treatment to allow the full effects of therapy&#xD;
      to take place. Even after this time, the metabolic activity of any remaining tissue is nearly&#xD;
      impossible to assess by CT scan, making it difficult to distinguish between fibrosis and&#xD;
      viable tissue. Generally the FDG studies require 3-4 weeks after the end of the therapeutic&#xD;
      regime before the relevant information is available, with more reliable information obtained&#xD;
      at 3-4 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is predictable that the most immediate signal of an anti-tumor therapeutic regime that has&#xD;
      been successful is that the tumor cells will stop dividing (proliferating) after the therapy&#xD;
      is initiated. Therefore, a tracer which is taken up into and retained in cells as a function&#xD;
      of their proliferative activity should provide rapid information as to the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the treatment. It is the objective of this study to determine the biodistribution and&#xD;
      radiation dosimetry of tracer F-18 3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine. This distribution data is&#xD;
      essential before an Investigational New Drug (IND) application can be filed with the FDA that&#xD;
      would allow the use of this tracer in clinical trials.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must have histologically confirmed stage III, or IV squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
             the head and neck whose primary origin was from the oral cavity, oropharynx,&#xD;
             hypopharynx, or larynx. Carcinoma must be staged using the American Joint Committee on&#xD;
             Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria version 6. Adequate tumor must be amenable to biopsy&#xD;
             via outpatient methods, therefore the majority of subjects will be those with&#xD;
             oropharyngeal lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must be scheduled to receive combined chemo-radiotherapy treatment for their&#xD;
             standard cancer care. Treatment decisions will be made by the treating&#xD;
             otolaryngologist, radiation, and medical oncologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Males or females greater than or equal to 21 years of age. Squamous cell cancer of the&#xD;
             head and neck is exceedingly rare in children and not generally applicable to the&#xD;
             pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Karnofsky score greater than or equal to 60% at time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/microL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/microL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/microL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 X institutional upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  BUN within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PT and PTT &lt; 2.0 X upper normal limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The effects of FLT on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal&#xD;
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. A screening urine hCG will be administered to women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential before each FLT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject with a Karnofsky score below 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. FLT PET has the potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             effects. Because there are potentially unknown risks for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with FLT, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is imaged with FLT and may not resume for 48 hours after&#xD;
             the FLT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject with an inadequate marrow reserve as determined by history and/or the above&#xD;
             tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject with a bleeding or clotting dysfunction as determined by medical history and&#xD;
             above tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects taking nucleoside analog medications such as those used as antiretroviral&#xD;
             agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Inadequate tumor volume to allow for 2 biopsies.&#xD;
