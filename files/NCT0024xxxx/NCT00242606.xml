      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerance of the drugs&#xD;
      Lamotrigine and Levetiracetam in the initial monotherapy of patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      epilepsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is the second most frequent neurologic disease (prevalence 0.5 % - 1 % [Brodie et&#xD;
      al. 1997]). About 30 % of epilepsy patients (including many children) suffer from intractable&#xD;
      seizures [Kwan &amp; Brodie 2000]. Therefore new drugs and an expansion of permission for drugs&#xD;
      with limited approval, respectively, are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levetiracetam is a new potent antiepileptic drug with nearly ideal pharmacokinetic properties&#xD;
      and few side effects [Patsalos 2000], but it is approved in Germany only for add-on therapy&#xD;
      for patients &gt; 15 years of age with focal epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to its few cognitive side effects and its efficacy, Lamotrigine is becoming standard&#xD;
      therapy for focal and generalized epilepsy for patients from &gt;11 years of age. Its&#xD;
      disadvantage is the possibility of severe allergic reactions which limits the speed of dose&#xD;
      increment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons: Patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy are treated with either Lamotrigine or&#xD;
      Levetiracetam. Rate of seizure-free patients in the first 6 weeks of the trial (main outcome&#xD;
      criterion) as well as rate of seizure-free patients during the last 16 weeks and the total 26&#xD;
      weeks of the observation period, time until the first seizure appears, time patients take the&#xD;
      study medication, safety and quality of life during treatment are compared.&#xD;
