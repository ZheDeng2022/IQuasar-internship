  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of these two studies is to test the hypothesis that the daily ingestion&#xD;
      of a dietary supplement, Selected Vegetables and Herbs Mix (SV), which consists of non-toxic&#xD;
      botanicals containing known anti-cancer and/or immune enhancing components, may prolong the&#xD;
      survival time of stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Either SV or&#xD;
      placebo will be added to their daily diet in a double-blind randomized fashion, so that there&#xD;
      will be 2 chances out of 3 of receiving SV and 1 chance out of 3 of receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 1: For newly diagnosed patients who will be receiving or have received less than 4&#xD;
           weeks of, a standard chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 2: For those who have stopped or refuse standard chemotherapy but will receive&#xD;
           best supportive care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carcinoma of the lung is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in North America.&#xD;
      Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) causes the death of more than 400,000 patients annually in&#xD;
      the US and Western Europe. The benefit of conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy, for unresectable stage IIIB and IV NSCLC patients is small; the generally&#xD;
      accepted median survival time of late stage patients has remained 4-6 months in the&#xD;
      &quot;Supportive Care&quot; group and 6-9 months in the chemotherapy treatment group; the one-year&#xD;
      survival is about 20%. Ideal Treatment for NSCLC: The toxicity of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      side-effects of radiotherapy to the quality of life of the patients have been a major issue&#xD;
      in cancer treatments. It has been significant enough that many patients choose to forgo&#xD;
      standard treatments. Furthermore, the current chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC is quite&#xD;
      expensive, about $50,000 to $100,000 per year. Therefore, an ideal treatment for advanced&#xD;
      NSCLC patients should meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prolong patient survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Minimal toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improvement in the patient's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Relatively inexpensive. A phytomix consisting of selected vegetables and herbs appears&#xD;
           to meet all these criteria. The phytomix consists of 19 vegetable and herbs in a highly&#xD;
           concentrated form. These vegetables and herbs were selected based on their anti-cancer&#xD;
           and immune-enhancing activities. Each batch of raw materials has gone through a very&#xD;
           strict quality control (QC) scheme to make sure the product meets our QC standards and&#xD;
           devoid of deleterious contaminations, such as heavy metals, pesticides, aflatoxin, and&#xD;
           microorganisms. The manufacturing process is tightly controlled to ensure batch-to-batch&#xD;
           consistency. The final product, a 20 gram freeze-dried powder, is sealed in a pouch. In&#xD;
           our previous studies, patients who ingested phytomix daily for 17-60 months showed no&#xD;
           clinical sign of adverse effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Objectives of the proposed studies are to evaluate the benefits and adverse reactions of&#xD;
      adding SV to the daily diet of cancer patients who are willing to undergo the chemotherapy&#xD;
      (Study 1) or those who refuse chemotherapy (Study 2).&#xD;
