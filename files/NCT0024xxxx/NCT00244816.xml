      This is a Phase II open-label study of weekly Taxoprexin® Injection in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic choroidal melanoma who may be previously untreated or have received one prior&#xD;
      systemic cytotoxic regimen for advanced disease. Patients may not have been treated&#xD;
      previously with taxanes. Patients may have been previously treated with immunological agents&#xD;
      including IL-2 and vaccines. Patients will receive Taxoprexin® Injection at a dose of&#xD;
      500mg/m2 intravenously by 1-hour infusion weekly for the first five weeks of a six week&#xD;
      cycle. Treatment will continue until progression of disease, intolerable toxicity, refusal of&#xD;
      continued treatment by patient or Investigator decision.&#xD;
