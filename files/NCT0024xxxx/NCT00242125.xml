  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic liver disease primarily affecting middle age&#xD;
      women. It is characterized by immune-mediated damage to cells lining the tiny bile ducts&#xD;
      within the liver. Although the underlying cause of PBC is likely to be multifactorial, the&#xD;
      epidemiologic/population data indicate a very important role for genetic predisposition,&#xD;
      meaning that the disease seems to run in families. Susceptibility genes for PBC have not been&#xD;
      identified possibly due to limitations such as small sample size in prior studies. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to identify these genes. This study involves obtaining&#xD;
      clinical and demographic data as well as collecting DNA samples from patients and their&#xD;
      parents, and siblings to screen for a select set of candidate genes as well as the full&#xD;
      genome for variants associated with PBC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposal is predicated on cumulative data revealing a major role for genetic factors in&#xD;
      PBC and the recent positional cloning of genes for Crohn's disease, type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      rheumatoid as well as psoriatic arthritis data provide the &quot;proof-of-principle&quot; that&#xD;
      susceptibility genes for multigenic diseases can be identified by linkage and association&#xD;
      strategies. Our group has access to &gt;600 patients with PBC and these individuals plus family&#xD;
      members provide an excellent resource for PBC gene discovery. Moreover, an International PBC&#xD;
      Consortium we have initiated will serve not only to validate our findings but also to serve&#xD;
      as a source for additional patient accrual should we be searching for genes with very small&#xD;
      effects. Thanks to the remarkable advances in genotyping technology and sequence data&#xD;
      emanating from the Human Genome Project, patient populations such as ours can now be fully&#xD;
      mined so as to identify susceptibility genes for common multigenic diseases. By combining the&#xD;
      patient resources of our group and that of other Canadian centers with available knowledge of&#xD;
      the full genome sequence and the extensive information on SNPs within this sequence, as well&#xD;
      as our expertise in high throughput genotyping and rapid computational approaches of genetic&#xD;
      data, we are very well positioned to begin delineating the susceptibility alleles for PBC. As&#xD;
      such alleles are identified, the information will then be used to define the molecular&#xD;
      pathophysiology of this disease, to determine whether genetic markers can be used to predict&#xD;
      risk and/or stratify patients in relation to prognosis and drug responsiveness, and&#xD;
      ultimately, to identify novel targets for improved therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of this study only patients with a definite diagnosis of PBC will be&#xD;
      recruited ie:- those that had an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level and positive AMA&#xD;
      by ELISA or immunofluorescence (&gt;1/40 titer) at the time of their initial diagnosis and who&#xD;
      have had a liver biopsy which confirmed the diagnosis of PBC. After signing the consent form&#xD;
      the patients will complete a questionnaire. With the patient's permission the coordinator&#xD;
      will contact the patient's parents and siblings that are either affected or unaffected by PBC&#xD;
      to ask them to participate in the study. A total of five tubes of blood will be taken from&#xD;
      each participant in the study. The blood samples will be used to study the liver&#xD;
      biochemistries and to study the inherited genetic material (DNA) in order to find out what&#xD;
      causes PBC. In addition we are going to review the medical records for all the patients with&#xD;
      PBC from TWH recruited to this study using the records held in Misys to examine and verify&#xD;
      their medical and surgical history, past physical exams, laboratory tests and treatments.&#xD;
      Each patient will also be asked to recruit unrelated (usually spouses) household members or&#xD;
      friends who live locally to act as controls. They will then be treated similarly with regard&#xD;
      to the consent form, questionnaire and blood work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan is to have approximately 600 patients with PBC along with approximately 1800 of&#xD;
      their relatives and other unrelated healthy volunteers to take part in this study - this is a&#xD;
      multicentre study - sites being Toronto, London and Halifax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses/Power Calculations: The use of association analysis to identify&#xD;
      susceptibility alleles is highly dependent on linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the SNP&#xD;
      markers and the disease loci. To demonstrate the extent to which LD can be used to delineate&#xD;
      PBC loci, our collaborator Dr. C. Amos has carried out calculations of the power to detect&#xD;
      significant effects (at the p â‰¤ 0.05 level) in a case-control analysis assuming different&#xD;
      amount of LD. Dr. Amos directs a statistical genetics group at MD Anderson Cancer Centre and&#xD;
      is a longstanding collaborator of K. Siminovitch. He and his group members are also the&#xD;
      statistical advisors to several disease-mapping consortia, such as NARAC, a US-based&#xD;
      consortium for discovery of rheumatoid arthritis genes. To estimate the power of an&#xD;
      association study to identify PBC susceptibility alleles, Dr. Amos used data from Talwalkar&#xD;
      and Lindor, estimating PBC prevalence at 0.05% among adult females and a 15 fold increased&#xD;
      risk for PBC among first-degree relatives of affected individuals. Assuming that mutation&#xD;
      frequency for disease causation is 0.1% and also that PBC is caused by a single gene, then&#xD;
      this level of risk among affected first-degree relatives implies the penetrance among&#xD;
      carriers of PBC susceptibility alleles to be 6% and among non-carriers to be 0.4%. A single&#xD;
      gene model for PBC, however, is simplistic and not consistent with available epidemiologic&#xD;
      data. If instead, an assumption of 4 disease causative loci is made and risk is thus assigned&#xD;
      to each one of these loci, then the genotype-specific risk would be 2.6%, the locus-specific&#xD;
      relative risk would be a more modest 3.75, and the disease allelic frequency in carriers&#xD;
      would be 10%. In the studies proposed here, we will begin by studying 300 cases and 300&#xD;
      controls for PBC association with specific candidate genes discussed above. The power to&#xD;
      detect association in any case-control study is highly dependent upon the LD between the&#xD;
      disease mutation and the SNPs at closely linked loci as well as the number of genes studied&#xD;
      (about 40). If we assume a high level of disequilibrium, the disequilibrium coefficient (D')&#xD;
      being 0.9 and, to be conservative, apply Bonferroni's correction for the simultaneous&#xD;
      evaluation of 40 loci, then achieving 5% power in this study will require obtaining a single&#xD;
      SNP test p-value of 0.00125. Based on a disease allele frequency of 10% (as calculated&#xD;
      above), and the analysis of 300 cases and 300 controls, the power to detect a SNP&#xD;
      marker-disease association would then be 84%. The study can be further powered by increasing&#xD;
      numbers of cases and/or controls. Thus, to conserve resources, genotyping will be initially&#xD;
      carried out using 300 cases and 300 controls, but an additional 300 controls will be further&#xD;
      genotyped for any markers showing significant results at the p=0.01 level. Genome-wide&#xD;
      association analyses will also be carried out initially on the 300 cases and controls.&#xD;
      However, because a genome-wide screen is likely to yield many false positive loci-disease&#xD;
      associations, any loci showing association at the 5% level will be confirmed using a&#xD;
      replicate set of 300 cases and controls and/or trio families, once 200 such families are&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
