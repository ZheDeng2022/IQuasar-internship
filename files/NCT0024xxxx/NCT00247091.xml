  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We conducted a longitudinal study to assess the immunogenicity of standard-titer measles&#xD;
      vaccine in HIV-infected and uninfected Zambian children. The study hypothesis was that&#xD;
      HIV-infected children would have higher rates of primary and secondary measles vaccine&#xD;
      failure compared to uninfected children, contributing to decreased levels of population&#xD;
      immunity to measles and facilitating measles virus transmission in regions of high HIV&#xD;
      prevalence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite great progress in measles control in sub-Saharan Africa, measles remains a&#xD;
      significant cause of morbidity and mortality in young children. In regions of high HIV&#xD;
      prevalence, measles virus transmission may be sustained despite high immunization coverage&#xD;
      rates if HIV-infected children are important transmitters of measles virus. Factors&#xD;
      potentially contributing to enhanced measles virus transmission by HIV-infected children&#xD;
      include an early decline in protective maternal antibody titers resulting in susceptibility&#xD;
      to measles at a younger age, and high rates of primary and secondary measles vaccine failure.&#xD;
      To evaluate the potential impact of the HIV-1 epidemic on immunity following measles&#xD;
      vaccination, we conducted a longitudinal study to compare the primary vaccine failure rate&#xD;
      and rate of antibody decline following administration of standard-titer measles vaccine at&#xD;
      nine months of age to HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected Zambian children. Our results show that&#xD;
      children born to HIV-infected women have lower levels of passively-acquired maternal&#xD;
      antibodies to measles virus prior to the age of routine vaccination at 9 months, and&#xD;
      HIV-infected children are particularly susceptible to measles in infancy. This finding&#xD;
      supports the WHO recommendation to provide the first dose of measles vaccine to HIV-infected&#xD;
      children at 6 months. Furthermore, HIV-infected children develop adequate primary antibody&#xD;
      responses to measles vaccine in the months following vaccination but lose protective antibody&#xD;
      titers by two to three years of age. Mitigating the potential impact of this decreased&#xD;
      immunogenicity on the level of population immunity to measles virus was the high mortality&#xD;
      rate observed among HIV-infected children. Improved access to antiretroviral therapy will&#xD;
      likely improve the survival of HIV-infected children without enhancing protective immunity to&#xD;
      measles virus, although this has yet to be investigated. We are working to incorporate our&#xD;
      findings into a mathematical model to better understand the impact of the HIV-1 epidemic on&#xD;
      measles control strategies and to investigate the immunologic mechanisms for impaired memory&#xD;
      B cell responses in HIV-infected children.&#xD;
