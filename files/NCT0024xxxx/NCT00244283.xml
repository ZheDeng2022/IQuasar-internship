  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare two different methods of protecting heart muscle from damage caused by a decreased&#xD;
      blood supply. Exposure to the anaesthetic agent sevoflurane can allow the heart muscle to&#xD;
      resist longer periods of low blood or oxygen supply without sustaining the amount of damage&#xD;
      that it would otherwise expect to. The use of thoracic epidural analgesia improves the blood&#xD;
      flow to the heart muscle and has also been shown to reduce the amount of damage the heart&#xD;
      muscle may otherwise sustain. The aim of this study is to compare these two methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a common procedure performed to improve blood flow&#xD;
      to the heart in patients with severe ischaemic heart disease. Commonly, the heart has to be&#xD;
      stopped to allow this procedure to be performed and this is often achieved with cooling the&#xD;
      heart and perfusing it with a solution that stops the activity of the heart muscle. These&#xD;
      techniques stop the heart from beating which allows the surgery to be performed and also&#xD;
      reduce the oxygen requirements of the heart. This in turn reduces the damage the heart&#xD;
      suffers from the reduced blood flow to it which occurs while the arteries are being operated&#xD;
      on. Unfortunately, however, these techniques do not completely eliminate the risk of heart&#xD;
      muscle damage and so new methods of further reducing damage to the heart are continually&#xD;
      being investigated. Two methods relating to the anaesthetic techniques used have recently&#xD;
      been identified as potentially of benefit in this regard - the use of volatile anaesthetic&#xD;
      agents and the use of high thoracic epidural analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volatile anaesthetic agents have been extensively investigated in the past few years with&#xD;
      regard to their apparent ability to mimic ischaemic preconditioning. Ischaemic&#xD;
      preconditioning refers to the phenomenon that if heart tissue is exposed to frequent, short&#xD;
      episodes of reduced blood or oxygen supply, followed by a longer spell, the heart is likely&#xD;
      to suffer a smaller area of damage than if it had never been exposed to the brief ischaemic&#xD;
      spells. This can be related clinically to the observation that patients with angina, who&#xD;
      subsequently suffer a heart attack, have a better prognosis than those patients who suffer a&#xD;
      heart attack without ever experiencing angina prior to the event. There have been numerous&#xD;
      studies demonstrating that the volatile anaesthetic agents (isoflurane, sevoflurane,&#xD;
      desflurane) appear to mimic this phenomenon, both in animal and human models. Numerous&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated favourable postoperative blood concentrations of cardiac troponin I&#xD;
      (a sensitive marker of heart damage), CK-MB (another marker of heart damage), atrial and&#xD;
      brain natriueretic peptides (markers of heart function) compared to those who did not receive&#xD;
      preconditioning. It has therefore been suggested that this may improve outcome following&#xD;
      cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High thoracic epidural analgesia (HTEA) has also been shown to be beneficial following&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. This involves placing a small catheter near the nerves as they leave the&#xD;
      spinal cord. Local anaesthetic ccan be administered down this catheter to numb the areas of&#xD;
      the body supplied by these nerves. This provides very good pain relief and is widely used in&#xD;
      our hospital for this operation. It has been shown to be associated with a shorter time of&#xD;
      required artificial ventilation compared to standard pain relief with drugs such as morphine.&#xD;
      It has also been suggested that it may influence outcome with improved heart function&#xD;
      following the operation compared to those without HTEA. It appears to do this by improving&#xD;
      the blood flow to the heart. It has also been associated with a lower postoperative&#xD;
      concentration of cardiac troponin , CK-MB, atrial and brain natriuretic peptides. There has&#xD;
      not been any direct comparison of the two techniques, however, to assess if one is superior&#xD;
      to the other, or if the benefits of the two techniques are additive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess if one technique confers more benefit than the other and if the&#xD;
      benefits are additive. This is important as many centres do not use thoracic epidural&#xD;
      analgesia for cardiac surgery and not all clinicians currently use volatile anaesthetics for&#xD;
      cardiac surgery.&#xD;
