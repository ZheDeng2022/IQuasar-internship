  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to investigate residual effects of heavy drinking, with or without hangover&#xD;
      symptoms. The primary aim is to test several hypotheses about residual effects of heavy&#xD;
      drinking. Hypotheses about how heavy drinking affects next-day performance include direct&#xD;
      physiological effects of alcohol, alcohol withdrawal effects, and non-ethanol effects, such&#xD;
      as congeners, or family history of alcohol problems. The investigators will test the&#xD;
      following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. relative to placebo, heavy drinking will degrade next-day performance, and this&#xD;
           relationship will be mediated in full or in part by quality of sleep;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a high congener alcoholic beverage will affect performance to a greater degree than a&#xD;
           low congener beverage and this relationship will be mediated by severity of hangover&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;

      The primary aim of the proposed study is to test several hypotheses about residual effects of&#xD;
      heavy drinking. Hypotheses about how heavy drinking affects next-day performance include&#xD;
      direct physiological effects of alcohol (e.g., electrolyte imbalance, low blood sugar, sleep&#xD;
      disturbance), alcohol withdrawal effects, acetaldehyde toxicity, and non-ethanol effects,&#xD;
      such as congeners or family history of alcohol (Swift and Davidson, 1998). Using a&#xD;
      placebo-controlled randomized trial, we will dose participants with placebo or with a high or&#xD;
      low congener alcoholic beverage (to a level of 0.10 g% BAC) the night before they perform&#xD;
      exercises on a neurobehavioral evaluation system. We will monitor participants' sleep to&#xD;
      assess sleep disturbance. We will collect information on hangover symptoms the morning after&#xD;
      dosing. We will also collect data on participants' family history of drinking problems. We&#xD;
      will test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. relative to placebo, heavy drinking will degrade next-day cognitive performance, and&#xD;
           this relationship will be mediated in full or in part by quality of sleep; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a high congener alcoholic beverage will affect performance to a greater degree than a&#xD;
           low congener beverage and this relationship will be mediated by severity of hangover&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will explore whether the residual effects of heavy drinking on next-day cognitive&#xD;
      performance are attenuated among participants positive for a family history of alcohol&#xD;
      problems, relative to family-history-negative participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim is to test the effectiveness of the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT), a&#xD;
      validated measure of fatigue, as a fitness-for-duty test. We will test whether the PVT can&#xD;
      distinguish dosing status (alcohol or placebo) of participants at the time performance is&#xD;
      measured the next day and the extent to which PVT measures correlate with performance scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be young adults ages 21-30 who are currently enrolled in an undergraduate&#xD;
      college or university or have graduated from a college or university. Alcoholic beverages&#xD;
      will be bourbon (high-congener) in soda or vodka (low-congener) in soda. Placebo will be&#xD;
      tonic alone. We will use a mixed within- and between-subjects design, balancing the order of&#xD;
      placebo and alcohol administration. Performance will be measured using a computer-based&#xD;
      neurobehavioral evaluation system.&#xD;
