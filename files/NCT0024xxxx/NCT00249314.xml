      The purpose of this study is to directly compare the body composition, body fat distribution,&#xD;
      and morphological and functional features of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle between South&#xD;
      Asians and European Caucasians.&#xD;

      Excess body fat, the hallmark of obesity is a major risk factor for the development of&#xD;
      insulin resistance (decreased insulin sensitivity), type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Previous studies have shown that South Asians (people who originate from the Indian&#xD;
      subcontinent) appear particularly prone to develop diabetes and heart disease compared to&#xD;
      white Caucasians of European origin. In Canada, in the Study of Health Assessment and Risk in&#xD;
      Ethnic groups (SHARE), it was observed that in a random selection of South Asian and European&#xD;
      individuals, South Asians had twice as much type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      were significantly more insulin resistant than Europeans despite a similar body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) and waist circumference. It is possible that the increased propensity of South Asians&#xD;
      to develop insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease is related to&#xD;
      greater total body fat and/or increased visceral fat in addition to the possible biological&#xD;
      differences in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle tissues. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is therefore to determine differences among age, sex, and BMI-matched people of South&#xD;
      Asian and European Caucasian descent in body composition (specifically total body fat, lean&#xD;
      body mass) and fat distribution (where the fat is stored in the body). This study will&#xD;
      therefore test the hypothesis that for a similar BMI, South Asians have more total body fat&#xD;
      and less lean body mass than age and sex-matched European Caucasians. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to look at the differences in the two ethnic groups at a&#xD;
      biological level, including: differences in visceral fat, adipose tissue morphology,&#xD;
      imflammation and adipokine production, skeletal muscle fat content, fatty acid oxidation and&#xD;
      mitochondrial activity.&#xD;
