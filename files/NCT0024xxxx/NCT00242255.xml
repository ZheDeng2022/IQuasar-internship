  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the role of epigenetics (heritable changes in gene function that&#xD;
      occur without a change in DNA sequence) in the aging process. DNA is the primary genetic&#xD;
      material, responsible for transmitting information from one cell to the next or from one&#xD;
      generation to the next. A second layer of heredity is described by the term &quot;epigenetics.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetic information is reset from one generation to the next. It works in two ways: 1) by&#xD;
      modification of the DNA, like balloons stuck at irregular intervals onto the sides of the DNA&#xD;
      helix that encodes genes, and 2) through specialized protein shells that wrap around some&#xD;
      regions of DNA. As in DNA, these shells can copy themselves and can transmit instructions.&#xD;
      Because they are used to turn genes on and off, errors in their settings cause critical&#xD;
      misinformation to be transmitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aging involves many changes, such as muscle weakening, graying hair, skin wrinkling, and so&#xD;
      forth. There are several current theories of aging, including damage to genes by oxidation,&#xD;
      shortening of tiny structures at the ends of chromosomes called telomeres, and the ability to&#xD;
      stretch lifespan with caloric restrictions. This study will investigate the possible role of&#xD;
      epigenetics in aging by examining and comparing the shell-like epigenetic settings in skin&#xD;
      cells in young adults and older individuals. Preliminary results from earlier studies show&#xD;
      differences in these settings in younger and older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women between the ages of 21 and 30 years and 65 and 90 years who are undergoing breast&#xD;
      reduction or mastectomy at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, may participate in this&#xD;
      study. Tissue removed during surgery for pathological examination will also be used by&#xD;
      researchers in this study to validate the preliminary findings noted above and to continue&#xD;
      studies into the new area of epigenetics and aging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Normal human lifespan is marked by a complex series of developmental events, relative&#xD;
      stability during adulthood, and ultimately a gradual decline in viability. Biological clocks&#xD;
      presumably underlie the developmental events that occur through childhood and adolescence,&#xD;
      but the nature of those clocks has remained obscure. Progress in this area would be of&#xD;
      considerable importance, not only for our understanding of child development, but also&#xD;
      because instability in putative clock-like mechanisms may occur as part of the aging process.&#xD;
      Such instability could well compromise tissue function and contribute to many of the common&#xD;
      degenerative diseases of later life. We propose to investigate whether developmental clocks&#xD;
      and related aspects of the aging process are attributable in part to age-related epigenome&#xD;
      remodeling. Experiments done to date with cultured human fibroblasts derived from tissue&#xD;
      banks provide tentative support for this hypothesis. To exclude tissue culture-related&#xD;
      artifacts and to continue the work, it is essential to have access to fresh tissue material&#xD;
      in the form of surgically obtained skin specimens that would otherwise be discarded. Elective&#xD;
      breast reduction mammoplasty is a frequently performed surgery at Suburban Hospital,&#xD;
      Bethesda, Maryland. Small skin specimens will be obtained from this procedure, as well as&#xD;
      from normal skin derived from mastectomies. Patients who are to undergo these procedures will&#xD;
      be asked to sign a consent form allowing the specimens, normally discarded, to be used&#xD;
      instead for research on the mechanism of aging. They will be informed that clinical&#xD;
      information will accompany the specimens, including age and known disease conditions. Twenty&#xD;
      patients in each of two age ranges, 21-30 yr and 65-90 yr, will be enrolled in the study. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be confirmation of age-related epigenome change in the chromosome 4q35.2&#xD;
      region, previously documented using tissue bank-derived cultured skin fibroblasts. Mapping&#xD;
      and sampling chromatin from this region revealed higher histone H4 acetylation in young&#xD;
      (24-30 yr) than old (80-85 yr) individuals. Confirmation of this change in primary&#xD;
      fibroblasts will be followed by more detailed mapping of chromatin structure and extension&#xD;
      beyond the currently defined limits. Secondary outcomes will include examination of two areas&#xD;
      of epigenome remodeling that appear to occur between birth and adulthood, as well as searches&#xD;
      for additional regions of age-related chromatin change.&#xD;
