      Introduction Worldwide uncorrected significant refractive errors (RE) are among the commonest&#xD;
      causes of visual impairment. This combined with the effectiveness and simplicity of&#xD;
      correcting RE by providing spectacles has made the correction of RE one of the priorities of&#xD;
      Vision 2020. However, little information is available on effective strategies for identifying&#xD;
      and delivering optical services to affected individuals in developing countries&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two interventions, namely&#xD;
      providing free spectacles or only a prescription to students with insufficiently corrected or&#xD;
      uncorrected significant refractive errors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate the prevalence and type of significant refractive errors in secondary school&#xD;
           children in Tanzania, and to determine the unmet need for spectacles&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the effectiveness of providing free spectacles vs. offering only a&#xD;
           prescription. This was judged as the proportion of students needing spectacles who were&#xD;
           wearing spectacles at 3 and at 6 months after prescription&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore attitudes to spectacles and reasons for non-compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study took place in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania between January and September 2004.&#xD;
      52 schools were randomly selected into 2 intervention groups (Group A and B) using random&#xD;
      selection stratified by school status (government vs. private). Students were screened for&#xD;
      significant refractive errors. A socio-economic questionnaire was administered to all the&#xD;
      students. Students who needed spectacles in Group A schools received free spectacles&#xD;
      (intervention A), while students in group B schools received only a prescription for&#xD;
      spectacles (intervention B). Students were followed up 3 and 6 months after spectacles&#xD;
      provision/prescription to check their compliance and to explore reasons for non-compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main analyses of data were the prevalence of visual impairment and its causes, risk factors&#xD;
      for myopia, and compliance with spectacles at 3 and at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prevalence of impaired visual acuity and causes 6,904 students were screened by the eye&#xD;
           team. 2.9% of students had uncorrected poor VA, 2.3% had poor presenting VA and 0.6%&#xD;
           still had poor VA with best correction. The main cause of visual impairment was&#xD;
           significant refractive error (84%).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The prevalence of uncorrected significant RE in secondary school students in Dar es&#xD;
           Salaam was low at 1.8%. Even assuming that all students with unconfirmed poor presenting&#xD;
           screening eyesight (0.8%) had uncorrected significant RE which is unlikely the maximum&#xD;
           prevalence would be estimated at 2.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compliance with spectacles&#xD;
&#xD;
           Students who had actually purchased their spectacles were up to twice as likely to wear&#xD;
           them at 3 and at 6 months as students who had received free spectacles, but only a small&#xD;
           proportion had purchased them (3 months: 30%; 6 months: 45%). Only 46% of students who&#xD;
           had received free spectacles wore them or had them at school at 3 months and 53% at 6&#xD;
           months. Significant independent predictors of students wearing or having their&#xD;
           spectacles at school 3 to 6 months after prescription or provision of free spectacles&#xD;
           were:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Having to purchase spectacles (less likely, OR=0.07 to 0.42)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bilateral good presenting vision, such as mild refractive errors and undercorrected&#xD;
                significant errors (less likely than unilateral visual impairment) and unilateral&#xD;
                visual impairment (less likely than bilateral visual impairment; OR=0.47 for each&#xD;
                step)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Myopia compared to astigmatism and hyperopia, both severe enough to impair distance&#xD;
                vision (more likely, OR= 68 -infinity) The majority of students who were going to&#xD;
                purchase spectacles seemed to purchase them soon after prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Risk factors for myopia Female sex, non-African ethnicity and a professional mother were&#xD;
           independent significant risk factors for myopia in this population. These findings are&#xD;
           similar to risk factors for myopia found in other populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions/ Recommendation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Significant refractive errors were the most common cause of avoidable visual impairment&#xD;
           in Tanzanian secondary school students in Dar es Salaam. However, the prevalence of&#xD;
           uncorrected bilateral and unilateral significant refractive errors in Form 1 students&#xD;
           was low (less than 3%) which makes the value of screening for RE in this population&#xD;
           questionable. Screening seems even less justified if one considers that only about 46%&#xD;
           of students who had been provided with free spectacles wore spectacles or had them at&#xD;
           school three months later. If students were asked to purchase spectacles, this&#xD;
           proportion was even lower at 26%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Similar studies in different cultural settings are needed to explore the compliance with&#xD;
           and reasons of non-compliance with spectacles in children, as poor compliance makes the&#xD;
           value of any screening programme questionable.&#xD;
