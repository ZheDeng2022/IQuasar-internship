  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The IMAGE Study is a cluster randomised trial of a structural intervention for the prevention&#xD;
      of HIV and gender based violence being conducted in South Africa.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background : While there is a high level of knowledge on HIV/AIDS in rural South Africa,&#xD;
      structural factors, including poverty and gender inequalities, have critically impeded&#xD;
      prevention efforts based on modifying individual risk. Attempts to rigorously evaluate&#xD;
      structural interventions for the prevention of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa remain&#xD;
      under-developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microfinance is a well-established development tool with nearly 100 million clients world&#xD;
      wide. Loans to poor households, particularly to women, facilitate business development&#xD;
      opportunities. Prior research has demonstrated significant economic and social benefits.&#xD;
      Health benefits have also been documented and include improvements in immunization coverage,&#xD;
      better nutrition, and contraceptive use. While poverty and HIV/AIDS frequently co-exist, the&#xD;
      impact of microfinance on vulnerability to HIV has not previously been explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Design : The IMAGE intervention combines two components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Microfinance: Implementation of a community-level, poverty-focused microfinance&#xD;
           programme exclusively targeting women&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gender and HIV training: A two phase participatory learning and action curriculum, has&#xD;
           been integrated into bi-weekly microfinance meetings. The first phase consists of 10&#xD;
           structured sessions facilitated by trainers, while the second phase facilitates&#xD;
           community mobilsation activities from within the microfinance centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IMAGE Study randomised four pairs of communities that were matched on size and&#xD;
      accessibility. The intervention communities received the IMAGE intervention from late 2001.&#xD;
      Comparison communities will receive the intervention strategy approximately three years&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study enrols individuals into three pairs of cohorts (intervention and comparison). Data&#xD;
      is collected on the major health-related endpoints as detailed below. Qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative data are also collected to document processes of change and potential pathways&#xD;
      of impact. Data analysis will be appropriate to the cluster-randomised study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort I : Women recruited to IMAGE intervention and Randomly selected women eligible to join&#xD;
      IMAGE from control villages. Sample size per arm - 450. Length of follow up - 2 years.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: 12 month experience of intimate partner violence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort II : Young people aged 14-35 living in the households of women in cohort I&#xD;
      (Intervention and Comparison). Project sample size per arm - 750. Duration of follow up - 2&#xD;
      years. Primary outcomes - Condom use with last non-spousal partner&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort III : Randomly selected young people aged 14-35 living in Intervention communities and&#xD;
      Comparison communities. Project sample size per arm - 1500. Duration of follow up - 3 years.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes - Condom use with last non-spousal partner, HIV incidence&#xD;
