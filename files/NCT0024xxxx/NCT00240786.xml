      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of 650 mg and 1300 mg&#xD;
      acetaminophen extended release given three times a day for the relief of signs and symptoms&#xD;
      of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee for a period of 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of 650 mg and 1300 mg acetaminophen extended release given three times a day as&#xD;
      compared with placebo, for the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the hip or&#xD;
      knee for a period of 12 weeks. Propoxyphene Hydrochloride capsules 65 mg are used as rescue&#xD;
      medication if subjects experience inadequate pain relief. The primary efficacy assessments&#xD;
      are the average change from baseline to the final on-therapy visit for the WOMAN pain&#xD;
      subscale score and the WOMAC physical function subscale scare, and the subject's average&#xD;
      global assessment of their response to therapy through the final on-therapy visit. Safety&#xD;
      assessments at study visits consist of monitoring adverse events, vital signs, study joint&#xD;
      assessments and clinical laboratory determinations. The hypothesis is that 1950 mg per day&#xD;
      and/or 3900 mg per day acetaminophen extended release are superior to placebo for the relief&#xD;
      of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee with respect to all three&#xD;
      primary efficacy endpoints. Treatment consisted of either one 650 mg acetaminophen extended&#xD;
      release caplet plus one placebo caplet (acetaminophen 1950 mg group); two 650 mg&#xD;
      acetaminophen extended release caplets (acetaminophen 3900 mg group); or two placebo caplets&#xD;
      administered orally every eight hours for 12 weeks.&#xD;
