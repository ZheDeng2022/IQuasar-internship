  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recently completed multi-site double-blind placebo-controlled study found that bupropion&#xD;
      (Wellbutrin XL) increased female orgasmic function in a group of pre-menopausal women with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of hypoactive sexual desire disorder. The purpose of this study is to ascertain&#xD;
      whether bupropion will improve orgasmic function in pre-menopausal women with a primary&#xD;
      complaint of idiopathic orgasmic disorder who do not have hypoactive sexual desire disorder.&#xD;
      This will be a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double blind study of women with a diagnosis&#xD;
      of female orgasm disorder. During a baseline visit, psychiatric, medical, alcohol and drug,&#xD;
      and sexual histories will be obtained. Patients who continue to meet screening&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria at their baseline visit will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      placebo or bupropion XL for 8 weeks. A flexible dosing paradigm will be used. Sexual desire&#xD;
      and activity will be assessed by patient diaries, investigator interview of sexual&#xD;
      functioning every two weeks, and by standardized questionnaire every four weeks. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be the increase in orgasm completion as measured by the Changes in Sexual&#xD;
      Functioning Questionnaire-F (CSFQ-F). Secondary endpoints will be changes in sexual arousal,&#xD;
      sexual desire, and sexual pleasure as assessed by the CSFQ-F.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female orgasmic disorder is characterized by a recurrent or persistent difficulty in&#xD;
      achieving orgasm during sexual activity. A study of sexual activity in a representative&#xD;
      sample of the US population ages 18-59 found that 24% of US females complained of significant&#xD;
      difficulty achieving orgasm in the preceding year (Laumann et al, 2000). Epidemiological&#xD;
      studies in Sweden and the United Kingdom have found similar rates of orgasm disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of drugs with actions of increasing genital vasodilation in response to sexual&#xD;
      stimulation (eg alprostadil, sildenafil, or phentolamine) have generally been found to be&#xD;
      unsuccessful or to have extremely limited efficacy in reversing female sexual dysfunction&#xD;
      (Basson, 2001; Segraves, 2002). High doses of androgen have been shown to increase various&#xD;
      parameters of sexual interest and activity in women after hysterectomy and bilateral&#xD;
      oophorectomy (Schifren et al, 2000) and there is some evidence that oral&#xD;
      dehydroepiandrosterone may increase responsiveness to sexual stimuli in postmenopausal women&#xD;
      (Hackbert &amp; Heiman, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been fewer studies of pharmacological treatment for hypoactive sexual desire&#xD;
      disorder in premenopausal women. Extensive literature indicates that bupropion has a very low&#xD;
      incidence of drug-induced sexual dysfunction (Clayton et al, 2002; Croft et al, 1999;&#xD;
      Segraves &amp; Balon, 2003) and that bupropion may reverse sexual dysfunction associated with&#xD;
      serotonergic antidepressants (Rosen et al, 1999; Kennedy et al, 2002). In addition one&#xD;
      controlled study (Crenshaw et al, 1987) and several clinical series indicate that bupropion&#xD;
      may have prosexual effects in non-depressed females (Modell et al, 2000). A single blind&#xD;
      study (Segraves et al, 2001) found that bupropion increased the frequency of episodes of&#xD;
      sexual arousal and desire for sexual activity in women diagnosed with hypoactive sexual&#xD;
      desire disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent multicenter, double-blind, fixed dose study of females with global, acquired&#xD;
      hypoactive sexual desire disorder found evidence that an exposure to 300 to 400 mg bupropion&#xD;
      XL increased orgasm and pleasure as measured by the CSFQ-F. In this pilot study, all women&#xD;
      had total serum testosterone levels within normal limits and were in stable, non-conflictual&#xD;
      relationships. All patients had no evidence of psychiatric disorder and no evident etiology&#xD;
      to their sexual complaint. All were pre-menopausal. The pilot study observed the effects of&#xD;
      drug treatment for four months. Significant change in measures of sexual orgasm occurred as&#xD;
      early as day 28. There are no currently approved pharmacological treatments for women with&#xD;
      orgasmic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to delineate the effects of bupropion XL in women with global&#xD;
      orgasmic disorder, using double blind conditions in an 8 week flexible dose multisite&#xD;
      comparison of bupropion XL and placebo. It is hypothesized that bupropion XL will increase&#xD;
      orgasm completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of bupropion XL on the ease and&#xD;
      frequency of achieving orgasm in sexual activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will be to investigate the effects of bupropion XL on changes in sexual&#xD;
      arousal and sexual pleasure.&#xD;
