  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first objective of this study is to determine if increased expression of one or more&#xD;
      members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family of receptors that are found on inflammatory&#xD;
      cells (present in the airway) precede development of chronic lung disease (CLD) of&#xD;
      prematurity. The study will also determine if there is a significant correlation between TLRs&#xD;
      and the severity of CLD. The second objective of this study is to determine the impact of&#xD;
      c-administration of inhaled nitric oxide (INO) on TLR expression in infants at risk of&#xD;
      developing CLD or with early CLD.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the role of two members in the family of transmembrane receptors,&#xD;
      TLRs, found on leukocytes and other cells that are upregulated in response to endotoxin and&#xD;
      other stimuli. These substances transfer the signals that propagate inflammation and&#xD;
      production of inflammatory cytokines. CLD of prematurity is characterized by early (first&#xD;
      week of life) evidence of lung airway inflammation. It is unknown if TLR family members&#xD;
      propagate this pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve saving weekly tracheal aspirate fluid samples obtained with routine&#xD;
      airway toilet in infants less than or equal to 1250 gm birth weight, who are admitted to a&#xD;
      Neonatal Intensive Care unit requiring assisted ventilation via an endotracheal tube. The&#xD;
      waste sample will be collected with the cellular contents separated by centrifugation and&#xD;
      placed on Trizol reagent after obtaining a cell count. Later extraction and batch analysis of&#xD;
      TLR, mRNA, and proteins as well as mRNA and protein for housekeeping genes will be performed.&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry will also be used to semi-quantitate the samples. Samples will be&#xD;
      obtained in the first one to two days, and again at the end of the first week of life. In&#xD;
      infants who were also participating in the related &quot;Low Dose INO in CLD of Prematurity&quot;&#xD;
      study, in which tracheal aspirate samples were collected, when the code is broken to&#xD;
      determine who received nitric oxide versus placebo, the second aim of the study will be&#xD;
      carried out: to determine the impact, if any, of INO.&#xD;
