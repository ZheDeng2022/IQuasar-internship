  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study primarily determined the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of vosaroxin&#xD;
      (SNS-595) in 2 dose schedules, and assessed the PK profile of vosaroxin and defined a&#xD;
      recommended dose regimen for Phase 2 studies. Secondarily the study assessed potential&#xD;
      biomarkers and antileukemic activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients assigned to 1 of 2 schedules (A and B) in cohorts of at least 3 patients received&#xD;
      vosaroxin (SNS-595) intravenously (IV) for up to 4 cycles: once weekly (Days 1, 8, 15 in&#xD;
      Schedule A) or twice weekly (Days 1, 4, 8, 11 in Schedule B). Dose escalation proceeded&#xD;
      independently for Schedule A (18 mg/m2 initially) and Schedule B (9 mg/m2 initially) in the&#xD;
      absence of Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) based on a modified Fibonacci sequence. The incidence&#xD;
      of DLT during Cycle 1 determined the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) allowing for treatment&#xD;
      delays of up to 14 days to resolve clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or&#xD;
      related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and one dose reduction of 25% in case of&#xD;
      above. Patients with stable disease, hematologic improvement, or partial remission with&#xD;
      stable blast counts or experiencing clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator were&#xD;
      eligible to receive vosaroxin for up to 4 additional cycles.&#xD;
