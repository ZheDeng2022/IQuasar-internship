    <textblock>
      Current treatment modalities for chronic leg ulcers are time consuming, expensive, and only&#xD;
      moderately successful. Recent data suggest that creating a sub-atmospheric pressure by Vacuum&#xD;
      Assisted Closure (V.A.C.®) therapy supports the wound healing process. Here, we studied the&#xD;
      efficacy of V.A.C.® in the treatment of chronic leg ulcers prospectively.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last 25 years we have entered an area where patients are living longer with more&#xD;
      complex systemic pathology. The number of patients with chronic non-healing wounds continues&#xD;
      to increase, despite many recent advances in the basic science of wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, the chronic leg ulcers approximately affect 1 % of the adult population of&#xD;
      developed countries and chronic wound care consumes 1-2% of the health care budgets of&#xD;
      European countries. It is still probably true to say that leg ulcer disease is not&#xD;
      sufficiently recognised as a problem either by the population at large or by the medical&#xD;
      community. Recent socio-economic and quality of life data showed the importance of this&#xD;
      long-neglected health care problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, many new wound care products were developed. We have learned that a moist&#xD;
      wound bed, without maceration of wound borders, gives faster wound healing. So, wound care&#xD;
      products need a high absorption capacity and at the same time, they need to create a moist&#xD;
      wound climate. However, many of these new wound care products resulted in divergent results.&#xD;
      Complications are described like enlargement of the wounds, maceration, infections, sepsis&#xD;
      and loss of grafts. These results in delayed hospitalisation and increased costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1989 Prof. Argenta and Dr. Morykwas developed a sub-atmospheric pressure technique: &quot;&#xD;
      Vacuum Assisted Closure&quot;. This technique was introduced to our hospital by the department of&#xD;
      surgery in the treatment of large complicated surgical wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are employing this new technique at our department of dermatology in treating lower leg&#xD;
      ulcers since 1997, by placing a foam dressing into the wound, seal it with tape and applying&#xD;
      a sub-atmospheric pressure to the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The meaning of Vacuum Assisted Closure is, first to clean the ulcer in a quick and&#xD;
      non-invasive way until a vital red wound is produced (first stage). When a wound is too big&#xD;
      to close primarily, secondary surgery is needed. By using the V.A.C.-technique in combination&#xD;
      with transplantation, the skin grafts will be supported in adhering to the wound surface&#xD;
      (second stage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the PVA (Polyvinylalcohol) or PU (Polyurethane ether) foam is placed into the wound,&#xD;
      the border has to be protected by hydrocolloïd foam, which will be trimmed to the appropriate&#xD;
      size and geometry for each individual wound. After that, The PVA or PU foam can be placed&#xD;
      into the wound defect. We employed especially a reticulated polyvinyl alcohol dressing with a&#xD;
      pore size of 400-600 h-meters depending of the appearance of the wound bed. The Polyurethane&#xD;
      ether foams were often used in the past. The PVA or PU foams are embedded with a&#xD;
      non-collapsible evacuation tube, having side ports that allow communication of the lumen to&#xD;
      the space of the reticulated foam. In large wounds, multiple foams may be placed in close&#xD;
      contact to one another. The surface of the foam dressing is covered by an adhesive drape,&#xD;
      extending 5 cm, beyond the hydrocolloid dressings. The proximal end of the evacuation tube&#xD;
      leads to a collection canister localised on the V.A.C. pump into which the wound fluid will&#xD;
      be drawn when a permanent sub-atmospheric pressure is applied. So an open wound is now&#xD;
      converted to a controlled closed wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First a permanent subatmospheric pressure was applied to the chronic ulcus cruris until a&#xD;
      vital red wound was produced (first stage). Subsequently, these ulcers were treated by a&#xD;
      combination of transplantation and vacuum sealing to support the skin grafts (the second&#xD;
      stage). The therapy was monitored weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The V.A.C. is the first active, non-invasive wound care product, used by a secure local&#xD;
      regulated sub-atmospheric pressure technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact mechanisms to explain this treatment are not known yet. Researches by Prof. Argenta&#xD;
      et al. postulated that interrelated factors are the basis for the success of the technique.&#xD;
      These factors can be devised in 3 subgroups: (1) Removing, (2) Improving, (2) Reducing&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tissues surrounding the chronic wounds are characterised by localised collection of&#xD;
           interstitial or third-space fluid. This collection of third-space fluid contains factors&#xD;
           which inhibits or suppresses mitosis, protein synthesis and fibroblasts collagen&#xD;
           synthesis. An active withdrawal of this fluid removes the excess of third space wound&#xD;
           fluid and its inhibitory factors. The active withdrawal also results in the removing of&#xD;
           wound debris.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The collection of third space fluid mechanically comprises the micro-vascularisation and&#xD;
           lymphatic system. By removing the third space fluid and its inhibitory factors, this&#xD;
           result in increased vascularisation, reduced venous afterload and an increased delivery&#xD;
           of oxygen and nutrients as well. These changes improve the rate of granulation formation&#xD;
           and the concentration of growth factors. An additional mechanism of the V.A.C. is the&#xD;
           mechanical stimulation of cells migration by tensile forces placed on the surrounding&#xD;
           tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Besides reducing of third space fluid, we know that successful wound healing correlates&#xD;
           with bacterial counts of less than 100 000 organism per gram of tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial counts of human wounds treated by V.A.C. have demonstrated a significant decrease&#xD;
      after 3-4 days usually until less than 1000 per gram of tissue. Last but not least, the&#xD;
      V.A.C. technique also reduces the infection chances, because the creation of a controlled&#xD;
      closed wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently socio-economic and quality of life evaluation showed the impact of this&#xD;
      long-neglected health care problem. Phillips et al shows a strong correlation between time&#xD;
      spent on ulcer care and feelings of anger and the quality of life. Besides that, there is no&#xD;
      doubt that ulcer care consumes a substantial proportion of the health care budgets. The&#xD;
      retrospective results of V.A.C. therapy compared to the conventional therapy showed a&#xD;
      reduction up tot 39% in hospitalisation time. These outcomes may be result in a better&#xD;
      quality of life and a reduction of the health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summarised V.A.C. treatment has a positive effect to wound cleaning and increases the&#xD;
      survival chance of transplanted skin, which will minimise hospitalisation time and costs,&#xD;
      compared to the conventional wound care techniques. It must be emphasised that the&#xD;
      Vacuum-assisted Closure technique was developed as an adjunct to wound care. It is not meant&#xD;
      to, and will never, replace surgical procedures. Despite the positive effects, this method&#xD;
      needs more and further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised, prospective, comparative cost/ effect balance and quality of life investigation&#xD;
      will be starting soon in co-operation with Prof. H.A.M. Neumann (University Hospital&#xD;
      Maastricht), comparing the V.A.C. treatment versus conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. AIMS OF THIS MULTI-CENTRE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate V.A.C. therapy is a more quick and cheap option in the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      arteriolosclerotic, chronic venous en combined venous /arterial leg ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. PATIENTS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Patients: The study is conducted in the departments of Dermatology at the University&#xD;
      Hospital Maastricht and the Atrium Medical Centre Heerlen. All patients in which extensive&#xD;
      ambulatory treatment in an out-patient-clinic according to the Scottish Intercollegiate&#xD;
      Guideline Network (SIGN) had failed and who are hospitalized due to chronic venous (venous&#xD;
      insufficiency of the deep or superficial system without an arterial incompetence), combined&#xD;
      venous/arterial (venous insufficiency of the deep or superficial system with an&#xD;
      ankle/brachial index of 0·60 - 0·85) or arteriolosclerotic (Martorell's ulcer) leg ulcers,&#xD;
      are evaluated for eligibility in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Methods: Patients are randomly assigned to the VAC® therapy group or to the control group&#xD;
      (conventional wound care) by a computer program using random permuted blocks of 8.&#xD;
      Randomisation was carried out within 3 strata, one for each ulcer type: venous, combined&#xD;
      venous/arterial, and arteriolosclerotic ulcers, respectively. Treatment allocation occurred&#xD;
      through telephone calls to the coordinating centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both study groups and both study centres an initial necrotectomy was performed by sharp&#xD;
      debridement of slough and nonviable tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I.Vacuum Assisted Closure-techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the PVA (Polyvinylalcohol) or PU (Polyurethane ether) foam is placed into the wound,&#xD;
      the border has to be protected by a hydrocolloïd foam, which will be trimmed to the&#xD;
      appropriate size and geometry for each individual wound. After that, The PVA or PU foam can&#xD;
      be placed into the wound defect. We employed especially a reticulated polyvinyl alcohol&#xD;
      dressing with a pore size of 400-600 h-meters depending of the appearance of the wound bed.&#xD;
      The Polyurethane ether foams were often used in the past. The PVA or PU foams are embedded&#xD;
      with a non-collapsible evacuation tube, having side ports that allow communication of the&#xD;
      lumen to the space of the reticulated foam. In large wounds, multiple foams may be placed in&#xD;
      close contact to one another. The surface of the foam dressing is covered by an adhesive&#xD;
      drape, extending 5 cm, beyond the hydrocolloid dressings. The proximal end of the evacuation&#xD;
      tube leads to a collection canister localised on the V.A.C. pump into which the wound fluid&#xD;
      will be drawn when a permanent sub-atmospheric pressure is applied. So an open wound is now&#xD;
      converted to a controlled closed wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The meaning of Vacuum Assisted Closure is, first to clean the ulcer in a quick and&#xD;
      non-invasive way until a vital red wound is produced (first stage). When a wound is too big&#xD;
      to close primarily, secondary surgery is needed. By using the V.A.C.-technique in combination&#xD;
      with transplantation, the skin grafts (punch grafts) will be supported in adhering to the&#xD;
      wound surface (second stage). Once all skin grafts are well adhered, the V.A.C. therapy can&#xD;
      be stopped. Until 100% wound-closing patients will be hospitalised by compression and local&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter ambulant therapy (compression and local therapy) will be continued until complete&#xD;
      wound healing. Also therapy will be controlled once a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.The conventional wound care techniques (control group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to standard wound care receive daily local wound care according to the SIGN&#xD;
      guideline and a multiple-layer compression bandage (Smith and Nephew, Hoofddorp, the&#xD;
      Netherlands) until complete healing. Four basic types of commercially available wound&#xD;
      dressings will be used in this study including hydrogels (Johnson&amp;Johnson, Amersfoort, the&#xD;
      Netherlands), alginates (Hartmann, Nijmegen, the Netherlands), hydrocolloids (Smith and&#xD;
      Nephew, Hoofddorp, the Netherlands), and films (Hartmann, Nijmegen, the Netherlands). The&#xD;
      choice of dressing most depended on the ulcer type, the amount of exsudate and the&#xD;
      physician's preference. Once 100% granulation was achieved, these patients also received&#xD;
      punch skin-graft transplantation in combination with topical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both treatment groups, only toilet and basic hygiene mobility was permitted during the&#xD;
      wound bed preparation and transplantation stage. After complete wound healing,&#xD;
      community-grade elastic support stockings class 2 (Medi, Breda or Varodem, Horn; the&#xD;
      Netherlands) or 3 (Varodem, Horn; the Netherlands) were prescribed depending on the&#xD;
      underlying pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Punch transplantation procedure The transplants will be taken of the upper-leg by placing&#xD;
      first a 'field-block' local anaesthetic (lidocaine 2% in NaCl). Epidermal grafts will be&#xD;
      created using a biopsy corer of 4 mm). The size of the field-block depends of the ulcer size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Evaluation criteria Because masking the interventions is not possible, patients will be&#xD;
      reviewed clinically by the same independent research physician and consultant dermatologist&#xD;
      twice a week until the ulcer is healed: description of the wound defect, surrounding tissue,&#xD;
      tracing the ulcer and taking a picture (Enclosure III), time investment forms (nurse and MD)&#xD;
      (Enclosure IV), evaluation of the used materials (Enclosure IV), evaluation of the V.A.C.&#xD;
      therapy and noting complications (Enclosure IV) and the quality of life evaluation of the&#xD;
      patient (Enclosure II). Using codes will anonymise all the patient information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Selection criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient groups (V.A.C.; n=30 / Conventional techniques; n=30):&#xD;
&#xD;
           I.chronic venous leg ulcer II. chronic combined venous /arterial leg ulcer III. chronic&#xD;
           arteriolosclerotic leg ulcer&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sex : either sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a)patient with a chronic leg ulcer (&gt; 6 months) without healing signs and satisfies to&#xD;
           one or more criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Venous (venous insufficiency of the deep or superficial system without an arterial&#xD;
                incompetence)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Combined venous/arterial (venous insufficiency of the deep or superficial system&#xD;
                with an ankle/brachial index of 0·60 - 0·85)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arteriolosclerotic (Martorell's ulcer) leg ulcers (diagnose made by anamnesis,&#xD;
                clinical signs, exclusions of differential diagnosis's, venous/ arterial duplex&#xD;
                shows no signs of obstruction or major venous insufficiency, histology)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) ulcer duration shorter than 6 months 2) age &gt; 85 years 3) use of immune suppressive&#xD;
      medication 4) known type IV allergies against ingredients of the wound care products 5)&#xD;
      insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type I 6) severe peripheral arterial disease&#xD;
      (ankle/brachial index &lt;0·60) 7) vasculitic ulcers 8) neoplastic ulcers. In patients&#xD;
      presenting with multiple ulcerations, the clinically most severe ulcer was included in the&#xD;
      study whereas the other ulcers were treated conventionally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6 Informed Consent :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients (volunteers). The investigator&#xD;
      will explain the nature of this study and its purpose, risks and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients (volunteers) will advised that they are free to participate in, or to withdraw from,&#xD;
      the study at any time without prejudice to the doctor-patient relationship. The medical care&#xD;
      provided will not be affected or refusal to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will be submitted to the appropriate institutional Ethical Committee and their&#xD;
      approval obtained in writing will be awaited before starting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7 Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All volunteers first will underwent a complete intake. When the volunteer satisfy the&#xD;
      inclusion- and exclusion criteria, this multi-centre trial the randomisation procedure will&#xD;
      be carried out by the clinician being in contact with a central registration office, by&#xD;
      telephone. An independent person will use a computer program, which determine the therapy&#xD;
      (V.A.C. or Conventional therapy) by serial numbers. This centralisation helps the correct&#xD;
      implementation of each step and ensures that someone has an overview of how the trial is&#xD;
      going. Before randomisation, stratification into the ulcer type (3 strata: venous, combined&#xD;
      venous/ arterial and arteriolosclerotic ulcers) is needed. Using codes will anonymise all&#xD;
      patient information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from a retrospective study showed that the mean duration of the preparation period was&#xD;
      24 days in conventional wound care (SD 11) versus 12 days in VAC® therapy (SD 5). In order to&#xD;
      detect a minimal difference of 10 days in preparation time with a power of 80% (α=5%) the&#xD;
      number of patients required in each treatment-group was 30, as derived from sample-size&#xD;
      calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.8 Masking: Because masking the interventions is not possible, patients were reviewed&#xD;
      clinically by the same independent research physician and consultant dermatologist twice a&#xD;
      week until the ulcer had healed. Thereafter, patients were prospectively followed up by one&#xD;
      and the same research physician at three months, six months and one year after discharge. All&#xD;
      participating clinicians completed standardised case record forms and checklists during their&#xD;
      control visits, treatments and follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decisions made during the treatment (V.A.C. and conventional therapy) are based on simple and&#xD;
      objective standards:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Yellow debris and a necrotic tissue is bad climate for skin grafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only a red, vital granulated wound bed causes a successful transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once all skin grafts are well adhered, the V.A.C. therapy can be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  100% epithelialisation (wound closure) This approach seems to be authorised, because&#xD;
           scientific investigations showed these kinds of judgements are apparent equally&#xD;
           objective compared to other judgement methods (thesis of Dr. Mekkes; Amsterdam). To have&#xD;
           an external control, every intervention will be photograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.9 outcome results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time-to-complete-healing: i.e. the period between initial preparation of the wound and 100%&#xD;
      epithelialisation with the primary endpoint being time-to-complete-healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. duration of the wound-bed preparation stage&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. percentage of leg ulcer recurrences within one year (i.e. an epithelial breakdown&#xD;
           anywhere along or within the index ulcer region)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. skin-graft survival, where applicable (i.e. percentage of successfully adhered skin&#xD;
           grafts after 4 days of complete bed rest and compression or VAC® treatment) Furthermore,&#xD;
           we compared between both experimental groups i) the quality of life, ii) pain scores,&#xD;
           iii) the total time needed for wound care until complete wound closure, and iv) the&#xD;
           costs per ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.10 Follow-up: Patients are followed up by one and the same research physician at three&#xD;
      months, six months and one year after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.11 Statistical analysis: All data will be analysed using the SPSS 11.0 software package and&#xD;
      the results are analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Time-to-complete-healing, duration&#xD;
      of wound-bed preparation, and recurrence rates are compared using the Kaplan-Meier survival&#xD;
      analysis. The log rank test is used to test for statistically significant differences between&#xD;
      both groups. Multivariate Cox's regression analysis is used to adjust for imbalances in the&#xD;
      baseline distribution of relevant prognostic factors. The regression coefficient, expresses&#xD;
      the independent contribution of potential determinants to duration of cleaning and&#xD;
      wound-healing. Hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are presented. A&#xD;
      p-value of less than 0·05 was considered to be statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percentages are compared by the chi-square test and continuous variables are compared using&#xD;
      the independent samples t-test (for normally distributed variables) and the two-independent&#xD;
      sample test (for non-normally distributed variables).&#xD;
