  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization has very recently recommended the routine use of a hypo-osmolar&#xD;
      ORS in the management of diarrhoeal diseases. This recommendation is based on the better&#xD;
      efficacy of the hypo-osmolar ORS over the standard WHO ORS demonstrated in controlled&#xD;
      clinical trials. The recommendation, however, also expressed the need for &quot;careful monitoring&#xD;
      to better assess risk, if any, of symptomatic hyponatraemia&quot;. There thus is a need for phase&#xD;
      IV trials before the new solution is introduced into routine clinical practice to assess the&#xD;
      risk in relatively large number of patient populations. The proposed study will be carried&#xD;
      out at two different settings- at the urban settings of the Dhaka Hospital (60000 patients)&#xD;
      and at the rural settings of the Matlab Hospital (15000 patients) of ICDDR,B. The&#xD;
      hypo-osmolar rice or glucose-based ORS will be introduced as standard management of patients&#xD;
      with diarrhoea . The hypo-osmolar ORS will contain 75 mmol /L of sodium instead of 90 mmol/L.&#xD;
      Surveillance will be carried out to detect adverse events focusing on the occurrence of&#xD;
      seizures or undue lethargy during hospitalization. Each episode of seizure or undue lethargy&#xD;
      would be evaluated to determine if they are associated with abnormal levels of serum sodium&#xD;
      or glucose, or fever. It has been estimated that about 3% (1,800) of patients initially&#xD;
      admitted to the Short Stay Ward of the Dhaka Hospital, and 340 patients at the Matlab&#xD;
      Hospital might require admission to the longer stay inpatient wards due to seizure or altered&#xD;
      consciousness. Such patients would be thoroughly assessed including determination of their&#xD;
      serum sodium and glucose, two common causes of seizures/altered consciousness, to determine&#xD;
      if and to what extent they could be attributed to hyponatraemia.The results from this study&#xD;
      would be used in planning and implementing the routine use of the new formulation of ORS at&#xD;
      all Government, NGO and private health care facilities that treat diarrhoeal patients, in&#xD;
      Bangladesh and in other countries.&#xD;

      Study site: The Dhaka and the Matlab Hospitals of ICDDR, B: Centre for Health and Population&#xD;
      Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: Total duration of 15 months that include data collection over a full year to&#xD;
      capture seasonal variations in the aetiology of diarrhoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Based on the yearly patient visits it is estimated that 60,000 patients would be&#xD;
      studied at the Dhaka Hospital and 15,000 patients at the Matlab Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients attending the Dhaka and Matlab hospitals who will be admitted to the Short Stay&#xD;
      Ward with uncomplicated watery diarrhoea would be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with complications, and those with severe illness that require special care or&#xD;
      multiple interventions would be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants 6 month of age or younger would receive the glucose-based (75 mmol/L) ORS ( Na: 75,&#xD;
      Cl: 65, K: 20, citrate:10, glucose: 75, and osmolarity: 245 mOsm/L), and those older than 6&#xD;
      months would receive the rice-based ORS (40 g/L of rice powder); both will contain 75 mmol/L&#xD;
      of sodium, 65 mmol/L of chloride, 20 mmol/L of potassium, and 10 mmol/L of citrate with an in&#xD;
      vitro osmolarity of 170 mOsm/L. This is in line with the Centre's policy of not adding starch&#xD;
      for management of infants 6 months of age or younger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance and case management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dhaka Hospital: From our experience about 3% patients (1,800 patients/year) initially&#xD;
      admitted to the Short Stay Ward are subsequently admitted to the Longer Stay Wards due to&#xD;
      development of symptoms like seizure, lethargy or altered consciousness. Patients admitted to&#xD;
      the Short Stay Ward who receive ORS solution for 8 hours or more, and subsequently admitted&#xD;
      to inpatient ward for the above symptoms will be evaluated to determine if they are due to&#xD;
      hyponatraemia. Similarly, 3% of the patients attending the Matlab Hospital (340&#xD;
      patients/year) might develop these symptoms and will be evaluated if their symptoms are due&#xD;
      to hyponatraemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical and laboratory data of these patients will be maintained during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment and management of patients Hospitals current protocol for assessment of the cause&#xD;
      of lethargy and seizures such as estimation of plasma glucose, serum electrolytes, fever, and&#xD;
      study of the cerebrospinal fluids where clinically indicated would be employed for diagnosing&#xD;
      the aetiology of the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol for management of seizure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although rare, the development of seizures during the rehydration therapy for acute watery&#xD;
      diarrhoea would be considered as a serious adverse event. Patients developing such symptoms&#xD;
      would be assed to determine if they could be attributed to hyponatraemia. The same protocol&#xD;
      for management of seizure would be used at both of the study sites, which would be as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients developing significant lethargy and seizure while on ORS would be&#xD;
           immediately admitted to the special care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An intravenous line will be opened for medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood glucose will be measured immediately from finger blood sample using bedside&#xD;
           glucose monitoring machine, and blood sample would be obtained for estimation of serum&#xD;
           electrolytes, calcium, and magnesium at the clinical laboratories of the Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypoglycaemic (&lt;2.2 mmol/L) patients would be immediately given intravenous glucose (25%&#xD;
           glucose; 2 ml/kg), which would be followed by oral (or through nasogastric tube of&#xD;
           patients who are unable to drink) administration of 10% glucose in a dose of xxxxx&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diazepam (0.3 mg/Kg) would be administered to patients who are not hypoglycaemia, and&#xD;
           also to patients who are hypoglycaemic but do not respond to initial glucose infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If seizure persists, the same dose of intravenous diazepam would be repeated for the&#xD;
           second time, and injectable phenobarbitone would also be administered (15-20 mg/kg&#xD;
           loading dose, followed by 2.5 mg/Kg every 12 hours as the maintenance dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After control of seizure, a lumber tap will be done to rule out meningitis if clinically&#xD;
           indicated (i.e. patients suspected to have meningitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sample of blood will also be sent for culture to exclude septicaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-Ray chest will be done to exclude pneumonia if clinically indicated (following WHO&#xD;
           guidelines)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a serum sodium of â‰¤120 mmol/L will be treated with 3% NaCl in a dose of 1&#xD;
           ml/Kg.hour for the next 4 hours (i.e. total of 12 ml/Kg over the 4-hour period), along&#xD;
           with restriction of plain water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypernatraemic patients (serum sodium &gt;150 mmol/L) would be treated with the same ORS&#xD;
           but with provision for water ad lib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients suspected for extra intestinal infection including sepsis will be treated with&#xD;
           Inj. Ampicillin and Inj. Gentamicin (infants aged 3 months or younger) or Inj.&#xD;
           Ceftriaxone and Gentamicin (patients aged more than 3 months) for 7 days.&#xD;
