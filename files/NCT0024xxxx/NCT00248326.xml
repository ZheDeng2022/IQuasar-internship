      The investigators' goal with this research is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish a clinical database and a DNA bank for 1000 individuals with AF and 1000&#xD;
           individuals without AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Directly test the hypothesis that known functional polymorphisms in the coding sequences&#xD;
           and the promoter regions of cardiac genes (ion channels and genes known to affect&#xD;
           survival in the setting of left ventricular dysfunction) predispose individuals to AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decade, advancing techniques and technologies for gene characterization have&#xD;
      yielded significant clues as to the molecular mechanism of certain human heart rhythm&#xD;
      disorders. The role of ion channel polymorphisms in subjects with AF is unknown. Similarly,&#xD;
      it is also not known whether polymorphisms in other genes have an impact on the risk of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to characterize genomic &quot;at-risk&quot; profiles would have many potential benefits for&#xD;
      patient care. Paramount among these is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increased oversight or intervention of at-risk subjects, which might prevent unnecessary&#xD;
           morbidity and mortality due to AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Further insight into the pathogenesis of AF, which may lead to preventative or curative&#xD;
           therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF), a heart rhythm disorder, is a major health problem. As many as 3&#xD;
      million US persons are afflicted; this number is expected to rise significantly in coming&#xD;
      decades because AF incidence is directly correlated with age. AF is significantly associated&#xD;
      with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal with this research is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish a clinical database and a DNA bank for 1000 individuals with AF and 1000&#xD;
           individuals without AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Directly test the hypothesis that known functional polymorphisms in the coding sequences&#xD;
           and the promoter regions of cardiac genes (ion channels and genes known to affect&#xD;
           survival in the setting of left ventricular dysfunction) predispose individuals to AF.&#xD;

      Subjects will be recruited from the patient pool of the Cardiovascular Institute (including&#xD;
      the Comprehensive Heart Center and the PUH Outpatient Cardiology Clinic). For each subject&#xD;
      enrolled, we will record demographic information; etiology and details of heart disease;&#xD;
      family history of heart disease; non-cardiac medical history; physical exam findings;&#xD;
      medicinal therapy; and results of prior cardiac testing (such as echocardiograms [Echo],&#xD;
      gated blood pool scans of heart function [MUGAs], exercise stress tests [ESTs] cardiac&#xD;
      catheterizations, and clinical electrophysiology studies [EP Studies]. Records will be&#xD;
      maintained with identifiers in a locked file cabinet in the office of the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample of ~10 ml will be drawn from each participating subject on the day of&#xD;
      enrollment. Blood samples will be drawn only once from each subject. There is no further&#xD;
      follow up required for the subject. Blood will be sent to the University of Pittsburgh School&#xD;
      of Medicine Cardiovascular Research Center where nucleated cells will be isolated from whole&#xD;
      blood by centrifugation. DNA will be isolated from nucleated cells and stored at the&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Research Center (on the 17th floor of the Biomedical Science Tower). All DNA&#xD;
      samples will be coded to ensure confidentiality, and maintained in a locked freezer for the&#xD;
      duration of the study (5 years). Samples will be destroyed if requested by the subject.&#xD;
      Samples (blood and DNA) will be under the control of the Principal Investigator. The DNA&#xD;
      samples will be used to identify polymorphisms in ion channel genes, as well as other genes&#xD;
      that may be associated with an increased risk of AF. Genotyping of polymorphisms will be&#xD;
      performed on the genomic DNA. The genomic DNA will be amplified by polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      method using gene-specific primers. For each polymorphism, genotype will be identified. We&#xD;
      will determine the frequency of that genotype in our study population, and attempt to define&#xD;
      significant associations with AF.&#xD;
