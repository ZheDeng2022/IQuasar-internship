      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy versus its&#xD;
      individual components in treating women with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and&#xD;
      depression brought on by sexual assault.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that can occur following exposure to a traumatic event in&#xD;
      which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. PTSD is marked by clear biological&#xD;
      changes as well as psychological symptoms. Many people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma&#xD;
      in the form of flashback episodes, memories, nightmares, or frightening thoughts. This study&#xD;
      will evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy versus its individual&#xD;
      components in treating women with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression brought on by&#xD;
      sexual assault.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this single-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive one of three&#xD;
      treatments: cognitive processing therapy (CPT); cognitive therapy (CT); or written exposure&#xD;
      (WE). Participants assigned to receive either CPT or CT will attend therapy sessions twice&#xD;
      weekly for 6 weeks. CPT will focus on helping each individual to process accurate memories of&#xD;
      the traumatic event and to work through any memories that cannot be completely ignored, nor&#xD;
      completely integrated back into their thinking. Also included in CPT will be a WE component,&#xD;
      in which participants will be encouraged to recall the traumatic event and experience any&#xD;
      emotions connected to it. CT will be similar to CPT, but will not include the WE component.&#xD;
      Participants assigned to receive only WE will attend one 2-hour session each week. Symptoms&#xD;
      of PTSD and depression will be measured at baseline, post-treatment, and at a 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;
