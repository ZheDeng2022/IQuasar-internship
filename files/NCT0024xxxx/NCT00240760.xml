    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess whether memantine is effective and safe in preventing age related&#xD;
      cognitive deterioration and dementia in people with Down's syndrome (DS) age 40 and over. The&#xD;
      study will last for a year and it will include 180 people with Down's syndrome with and&#xD;
      without dementia. Participants will be assessed on memory skills, attention and problem&#xD;
      solving abilities. Quality of life and abilities for everyday living skills will also be&#xD;
      regularly checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the clinical efficacy of memantine versus placebo in preventing cognitive&#xD;
           decline in people with DS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the safety and tolerability of memantine versus placebo in people with Down's&#xD;
           syndrome (DS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical and pathological:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the ability of memantine to alter markers of disease progression in DS&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether memantine has, as compared with placebo, a significant positive&#xD;
           impact on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  level of independent functioning as measured by the carer-rated adaptive&#xD;
                behavioural scale, (ABS) in adults with DS;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  quality of life in adults with DS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical and pathological:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate putative markers of memantine's mechanism of action in peripheral samples&#xD;
           from living patients with DS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the age of 40, all people with Down's Syndrome have substantial changes in the brain&#xD;
      similar to those of Alzheimer's disease and most are at very high risk of developing a&#xD;
      clinical dementia with progressive decline of function and cognitive abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are changes to all of the key chemical messenger systems in the brain as people develop&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. One of the most ubiquitous chemical messenger systems, present on the&#xD;
      majority of nerve cells in the brain, is called the glutamatergic system. In this system the&#xD;
      main receptors present on the nerve endings are referred to as glutamate receptors. Under&#xD;
      certain circumstances, usually when there is damage to particular parts of the brain, these&#xD;
      receptors can lead to &quot;overfiring&quot; of the nerve cells with disastrous consequences. This can&#xD;
      result in the generation of a number of toxic chemical molecules that lead to further damage&#xD;
      to the nerve cells (such as phopholipases, proteases, nitric oxide synthases, inflammatory&#xD;
      molecules and free radicals), usually referred to as excitotoxicity. Memantine blocks the&#xD;
      effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to dysfunction of&#xD;
      nerve cells and in this way is thought to block the main glutamate excitotoxicity site on&#xD;
      nerve cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized clinical trials in people with Alzheimer's disease indicate that memantine&#xD;
      significantly slows down the progression of functional and cognitive impairments. Memantine&#xD;
      has now been licensed for the treatment of moderate-severe Alzheimer's disease on the basis&#xD;
      of these trials. We would hypothesise that older people with Down's syndrome would&#xD;
      particularly benefit from treatment with Memantine, partly because of the large amount of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease changes present in the brain and partly because excessive glutamate&#xD;
      receptor activity has been demonstrated in adults with Down's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study we assessed 122 individuals with Down's Syndrome using newly developed&#xD;
      neuropsychometric battery of tests, (the the Down's syndrome Attention, Memory and Executive&#xD;
      function battery -DAME battery, Margallo-Lana 2002a,b). People with Down's Syndrome over the&#xD;
      age of 40 without dementia experienced a decline of 11% over one year, indicating that&#xD;
      progressive cognitive decline precedes dementia (hence offering an important opportunity for&#xD;
      prevention) and that these measurements are sensitive to cognitive change over time, hence a&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the prevention of dementia is feasible with current evaluation measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given Memantine or placebo (dummy tablet) for 52 weeks. To avoid bias,&#xD;
      participants will be allocated to the placebo or Memantine group at random (this is a&#xD;
      randomized trial) and none of the researchers or participants will know which treatment&#xD;
      people are getting (the study is double blind). However, in an emergency, the investigators&#xD;
      can contact the study pharmacist to find out whether a particular participant was receiving&#xD;
      Memantine or the dummy tablet. The placebo and Memantine groups will be compared at the end&#xD;
      of the study (the study is placebo control) to see if Memantine is any better than the dummy&#xD;
      pill. The efficacy of Memantine will be assessed by comparing the change in scores between&#xD;
      the initial assessments and assessments in the follow-up period at 12, 26 and 52 weeks. Thus&#xD;
      participant will be assessed on 4 occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to a clinical history and the collection of standardized information such as any&#xD;
      adverse events, the assessment will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of memory, attention and planning abilities:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Memory, attention and executive function (planning abilities) will be assessed by direct&#xD;
           testing with the participants using the DAME battery. The DAME battery has been&#xD;
           validated as a measure that is sensitive to change in older people with Down's syndrome.&#xD;
           The range of scores is 0-241 and can be completed in 45 minutes by most people with&#xD;
           mild-moderate learning disability. The test re-test and inter-rater reliability is XX&#xD;
           and YY respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Development of dementia:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To facilitate the diagnosis of dementia, we will use the Dementia Questionnaire for&#xD;
           mentally Retarded Persons (DMR). This is a standardised, validated and reliable tool&#xD;
           specifically developed to aid the assessment of dementia in people with mild and&#xD;
           moderate learning disabilities. It is an informant-based questionnaire and consists of&#xD;
           50 items to be completed by family or staff about the patient who is known to them.&#xD;
           Items are arranged in 8 subscales: short term memory; long-term memory; spatial and&#xD;
           temporal orientation; speech; practical skills; mood; activity and interest; behaviour&#xD;
           and disturbance. The range of scores is 0-104 and can be completed in 15-20 minutes. The&#xD;
           inter-rater reliability is 0.76.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diagnosis of dementia:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standardized criteria for diagnosis of dementia based on the International&#xD;
           Classification of Diseases, 10th Version (ICD 10) will be used by 2 experts (Dr&#xD;
           Margallo-Lana, Dr Prasher) to identify new cases. The assessment for dementia will be&#xD;
           done at baseline, week 26 and week 52 assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The diagnosis of dementia will be based on clinical information supplied by carers aided&#xD;
           by the use of the Dementia Questionnaire for Persons with Mental Retardation (DMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Independent functioning :&#xD;
&#xD;
           Independent functioning will be evaluated using the Adaptive Behavioural Scale (ABS,&#xD;
           Nihira,1974). This is an informant based instrument and is part of the assessment used&#xD;
           by the American Association on Mental Deficiency (Nihira, 1974) to assess daily living&#xD;
           skills in people with learning disabilities. The ABS measures ten groups of skills&#xD;
           related to self-care and socialization. The ten skills groups: independent functioning,&#xD;
           physical development, economic activity, language development, numbers and time,&#xD;
           domestic activity, vocational activity, self-direction, responsibility, and&#xD;
           socialization. The ABS has a test-retest reliability of .96, which is very good. Score&#xD;
           range is 0-280.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Quality of life:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quality of life will be evaluated with the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
           (Logsdon et al. 1998). This scale was specifically developed to measure quality of life&#xD;
           in people with dementia. It is composed of 13-items that measure physical condition,&#xD;
           mood, memory, functional abilities, interpersonal relationships, ability to participate&#xD;
           in meaningful activities, financial situation, and global assessments of self as a whole&#xD;
           and QOL as a whole. The response options are 4-point multiple choice options (1 = poor,&#xD;
           4 = excellent). Scale scores range from 13 to 52, with higher scores indicating greater&#xD;
           QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Global change:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Clinician's Global Impression of Change (CGI/C) has been one of the most commonly&#xD;
           used test to assess overall change in clinical trials (Guy, 1976). The validity of this&#xD;
           type of measure is based on the ability of an experienced clinician to detect clinically&#xD;
           relevant against trivial change in a patient's overall clinical state. These simple&#xD;
           scales have been shown to be remarkably sensitive to change in cholinesterase inhibitor&#xD;
           trials (Schneider, 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Standardized schedule to monitor any side effects/adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      180 people aged &gt; 40 with DS (with or without dementia) who have mild-moderate learning&#xD;
      disability, in a double blind, placebo controlled design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Related Biochemical Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (10ml) will be taken at baseline and the final follow-up assessment. Blood will&#xD;
      be processed to yield four different components: plasma, platelets, red and white blood&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma concentrations of the amino acid neurotransmitters aspartate and glutamate will be&#xD;
      measured together with the rate of uptake of glutamate into blood cells (platelets). The&#xD;
      ability of glutamate to bind to the platelets' receptors (particularly the NMDA receptor - a&#xD;
      sub-type of glutamate receptor) will also be also assessed. These investigations will&#xD;
      determine whether Memantine protects and modulates glutamatergic transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma concentrations amyloid (Abeta species 1-40/1-42), the protein that typically&#xD;
      accumulates in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, will also be measured together&#xD;
      with plasma concentrations of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Preliminary studies will&#xD;
      be also undertaken to see if glutamate receptors in platelets (NMDA receptors) regulate the&#xD;
      release of APP/Abeta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also investigate genetic factors that may affect the risk of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease in people with Down's Syndrome. Any identified genetic factors will be examined to&#xD;
      see if they can predict response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These investigations will help to determine if Memantine alters the accumulation of proteins&#xD;
      in the brain typical of Alzheimer's disease in people with Down's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumers panels of relatives of people with DS and carers have been involved in protocol&#xD;
      development and the writing of information sheets.&#xD;
