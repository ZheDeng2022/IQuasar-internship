      1. to investigate, whether one of the two alternative therapy strategies (antibiotic plus&#xD;
           immunostimulation versus antibiotic plus immunosuppression) in chronic reactive&#xD;
           arthritis is therapeutical superior to conventionel standardtherapy (DMARD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate, whether one or more of the different therapy strategies cause an altered&#xD;
           detection of bacterial DNA in the joint or colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to measure the antigen-specific and -unspecific immune response (predominantly t-cell&#xD;
           response) during therapy and correlate it with the clinical course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to gain knowledge from these analyses and the clinical course concerning the&#xD;
           pathogenesis and the point of attack for possible therapies in chronic reactive&#xD;
           arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to compare cytokine-profiles of CD4- and CD8-positive T-cells from patients treated with&#xD;
           infliximab to those treated with etanercept.&#xD;

      Studybackground Enteric reactive arthritis (ReA) is an extraintestinal manifestation of an&#xD;
      infection of colon mucosa caused by enterobacteria. At least in the chronic courses of ReA a&#xD;
      bacterial persistence can be assumed which is most likely to be located in colon mucosa or&#xD;
      colon associated lymph nodes. The persistence of bacteria might be in consequence of an&#xD;
      insufficient t-helper-immune-response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand the persistence of the pathogen itself could be harmless and the local&#xD;
      immune-pathology could be caused by a hypersensitivity immune response The project in hand&#xD;
      shall assess whether 1.) immune stimulation or immune suppression is the best therapy for&#xD;
      chronic reactive arthritis and 2.) enteric reactive arthritis is based on bacterial&#xD;
      persistence or a hypersensitivity immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By gaining these data we hope to be able to draw conclusions concerning the pathogenesis and&#xD;
      therapies of other infections that affect the mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ReA occurs after infection of the intestine (enteric ReA) or after urogenital infection&#xD;
      caused by chlamydia (urogenital ReA). Both forms of ReA are pathogenetically und&#xD;
      immunogenically closely related and are treated as one entity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are enrolled in the trial with enteric ReA (colon as possible location of&#xD;
      bacterial persistence), not those with urogenital ReA (location of bacterial persistence not&#xD;
      known) undergo colonoscopy before and after treatment-period to obtain colon biopsies for&#xD;
      further work up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with knee involvement (arthritis of knee) undergo arthroscopy before and after&#xD;
      treatment-period to obtain synovial biopsies for further work up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently collected data form our group concerning patients with ankylosing spondylitis under&#xD;
      therapy with infliximab or etanercept have shown that the potential of CD4- and CD8-positive&#xD;
      t-cells to produce interferon gamma (IFN Gamma) or tumornecrosisfactor alpha (TNF-Alpha)&#xD;
      after antigen-specific or -unspecific stimulation was distinct reduced under therapy with&#xD;
      infliximab, whereas this potential under therapy with etanercept increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In context with recently collected data concerning Crohn´s disease it can be assumed that by&#xD;
      binding not only soluble TNF-Alpha but as well membrane-associated TNF-Alpha infliximab&#xD;
      induces apoptosis of t-cells, whereas etanercept induces no apoptosis. These results could&#xD;
      explain, why infliximab but not etanercept is effective in treating Crohn´s disease&#xD;
      Furthermore the induction of apoptosis could explain why therapy with infliximab is&#xD;
      associated with a higher incidence of tuberculosis compared to etanercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By means of FACS (Fluorescence activated cell sorting) we want to examine, whether&#xD;
      TNF-blocking agents in patients with chronic ReA induce a t-cell-suppression and compare the&#xD;
      cytokine-pattern of CD4- and CD8-positive t-cells from patients treated with infliximab with&#xD;
      the cytokine-pattern of CD4- and CD8-positive t-cells from patients treated with etanercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison of both therapies - infliximab and etanercept - is of special interest,&#xD;
      because both TNF-blocking agents obviously have a different active profile as well as&#xD;
      different side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background for dosage Ciprofloxacin 2 x 500 mg p.o. daily is conventional therapy for&#xD;
      treating infections with enterobacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials with infliximab 5 mg/kg in patients suffering from ankylosing spondylitis&#xD;
      have been successfully performed. Dosages of infliximab 1 - 10 mg/kg have been used in&#xD;
      treating succesfully patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A dosage of 5 mg/kg was more&#xD;
      effective than 1 mg/kg, but 10 mg/kg was only slightly better. Infliximab has been approved&#xD;
      for the indication rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials with etanercept 25 mg s.c. 2 x per week in patients suffering from ankylosing&#xD;
      spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis have been performed successfully and effectively.&#xD;
      Etanercept has been approved for the indication ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      and psoriasic-arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To treat patients suffering from tuberculosis who do not respond to conventional&#xD;
      anti-tuberculosis-therapy IFN-g (interferon-gamma) 3 x 100 - 150 µg/week s.c. has been&#xD;
      succesfully administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a clinical trial to assess the efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis IFN-g 50 µg was&#xD;
      administered daily during the first three weeks and every other day in the last week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who receive standard-therapy (Sulphasalazine, Methotrexate, Leflunomide) are treated&#xD;
      with common dosages of these drugs that are deduced from the common treatment of rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background for selection of patients 80% of patients suffering from acute ReA heal up within&#xD;
      6 months. About 40% of patients have severe symptoms for more than 6 months and about 20%&#xD;
      develop a chronic course of arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients with chronic ReA are regrettably insufficiently treated with the available&#xD;
      drugs (NSAID, Methotrexate, Sulphasalazine, Leflunomide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are enrolled in this trial have to have a definite chronic ReA (disease duration&#xD;
      of at least 12 months), a joint pain of &gt; 4 (visual analogue scale, 0-10), a constant demand&#xD;
      of NSAID and an active arthritis affecting at least one joint.&#xD;
