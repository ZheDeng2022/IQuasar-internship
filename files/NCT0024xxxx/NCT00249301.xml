    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine (1) The side effects or toxicities of MLN8054;(2)&#xD;
      The highest dose where side effects or toxicities are not too severe; (3) How MLN8054 is&#xD;
      absorbed into the general blood circulation and eliminated from the body; and (4) The levels&#xD;
      of MLN8054 in the blood that are needed to inhibit Aurora A kinase.&#xD;

    <description>MLN8054 will be administered orally in multiple divided daily doses for 7 days to 21 consecutive days. A 14-day recovery period will follow each dosing period, regardless of its duration. MLN8054 will be supplied in capsules of 5 mg or 25 mg with dose strength expressed as the milligrams of active drug (free acid). MLN8054 will be given on an empty stomach. Patients will be instructed to take nothing by mouth except for water and prescribed medications for 2 hours before and 1 hour after each dose.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Recovered from the reversible effects of prior antineoplastic therapy with at least 4&#xD;
             weeks elapsed since the last exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy or to radiotherapy and&#xD;
             at least 6 weeks elapsed since exposure to nitrosoureas or mitomycin C. Patients&#xD;
             treated with fully human monoclonal antibodies must not have received treatment with&#xD;
             such antibodies for at least 6 weeks, and those treated with chimeric monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies must not have received treatment with such antibodies for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
             Patients treated with noncytotoxic small molecule drugs (eg, tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             inhibitors, such as Tarceva, and hormonal agents, such as Femara) must not have&#xD;
             received treatment with these drugs for at least 2 weeks before the first dose of&#xD;
             MLN8054 is given.&#xD;
