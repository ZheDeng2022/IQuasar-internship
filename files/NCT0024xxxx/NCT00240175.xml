  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Foot orthotics or shoe inserts are currently utilized as a common conservative treatment&#xD;
      option for a wide variety of foot disorders. This treatment is used for both the relatively&#xD;
      healthy active population and the more sedentary population with diabetes or peripheral&#xD;
      vascular disease (dysvascular). However, there is limited objective scientific data&#xD;
      documenting the actual benefits or effectiveness of either customized or over-the-counter&#xD;
      foot orthoses. It is the aim of this study to determine the effects of three popular foot&#xD;
      orthotics on plantar pressures in diabetic populations. If foot orthoses can be utilized as a&#xD;
      preventive treatment option to reduce the risk for foot ulceration by redistributing plantar&#xD;
      pressures, then orthoses would be a cost effective solution to a high cost (mental and&#xD;
      fiscal) medical impairment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that over 17 million people are affected with diabetes with more than 8&#xD;
      million remaining undiagnosed in the United States alone. Of the total diabetic population,&#xD;
      approximately 15% will develop foot ulcerations with 6% continuing onto some manner of foot&#xD;
      or lower limb amputation. While it has been widely recommended that therapeutic shoes and&#xD;
      foot orthotics be utilized in the ongoing care of diabetics with insensate feet, there is&#xD;
      limited scientific literature quantifying the actual effects. If the early use of orthotic&#xD;
      devices is able to decrease the risk or delay the onset of foot ulceration, this could be an&#xD;
      essential treatment strategy for individuals with diabetes or peripheral vascular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the orthotic devices a repeated measure within subject study design is purposed.&#xD;
      There will be forty two diabetic subjects rated at Category 1 by the UTHSCSA Podiatry Scale&#xD;
      (Peripheral neuropathy, no history of ulceration). Each subject will receive three sets of&#xD;
      foot orthotics and a pair of extra-depth athletic shoes. The subjects will receive and wear&#xD;
      the orthotics in a randomized order. The orthotics to be tested will vary in materials and&#xD;
      morphology. They will be a custom molded trilaminar insert, a prefabricated trilaminar insert&#xD;
      without any modifications, and an over-the-counter contoured shoe insert of Plastazote and&#xD;
      polyurethane. Plantar pressure measurements will be acquired at baseline and after four weeks&#xD;
      of accommodation to each set of foot orthoses. It is anticipated that a participant's&#xD;
      involvement with the study will require five months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help to determine the efficacy of the three different types of foot orthotics&#xD;
      and help to establish better guidelines for health care practitioners regarding optimal foot&#xD;
      care in diabetes and to assist in collecting data for future grants.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  normal gait pattern&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Category 1 diabetic rating by the UTHSCSA Podiatry scale - Category 1 diabetics have&#xD;
             documentable peripheral neuropathy but no history of foot ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  males or females between the ages of 18 and 66&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  neuromuscular deficits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  no foot abnormalities (hammer toes, pes cavus) that requires specialized footwear. The&#xD;
             participant must be tolerant of the study shoes to be supplied. To address this matter&#xD;
             a four week accommodation period to the study shoe will be required for inclusion to&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No pregnant females due to subsequent alterations in gait patterns&#xD;
