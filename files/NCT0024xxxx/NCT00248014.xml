      This investigation aims at distinguishing the subjects that react in a favorable way to the&#xD;
      treatment protocol we propose for the Class II treatment&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Class II Division 1 is a prevalent malocclusion. Many methods have been utilized to correct&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our prospective study is to clarify the specific cephalometric indicators of&#xD;
      biological responsiveness that lead to a successful Class II Div.1 treatment in growing&#xD;
      individuals. These indicators will hopefully assist in the differential diagnosis of a &quot;true&quot;&#xD;
      and a &quot;pseudo&quot; Class II, that is a masked Class I, that we presume will be relatively easy to&#xD;
      treat and stable a treatment result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      70 -100 subjects with a Class II/I malocclusion will be recruited and treated with the exact&#xD;
      mode of treatment. As Class II we consider the one that is a t least half molar cusp Class&#xD;
      II. Patients will already erupted lower first premolars will be included as we presume this&#xD;
      is the approximate time of the maximum growth spurt which we want to exploit using the&#xD;
      functional appliance. Crowding in both arches should not exceed 4 mm so as to exclude any&#xD;
      denoalveolar changes due to alignment. Any tooth agenesis, besides the third molars, will&#xD;
      exclude the subject from the study. The medical history of the patient should be&#xD;
      non-contributory regarding any hormonal abnormalities, arthritis and pain from the TMJ.&#xD;
      Syndromic patients and those exhibiting craniofacial abnormalities will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skeletal age of each patient will be assessed by observing the cervical column.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will have his records taken, the latter including a lateral ceph and a&#xD;
      panoramic x-ray. Standard intra- and extra oral pictures will be taken as well (T0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment protocol includes a first phase of 3-4 months of slow palatal expansions&#xD;
      utilizing a removable palatal plate with a 0.25 mm jackscrew in the middle (T1). The screw&#xD;
      will be turned once a week for two weeks and then twice a week until the upper posterior&#xD;
      teeth are over-expanded 2 mm per side. During phase II (T2)the patient will be asked to wear&#xD;
      the same appliance adjusted as such to incorporate a tongue crib that will force the mandible&#xD;
      into a Class I relationship acthing the way the know functional appliances work (eg&#xD;
      activator). The crib will incorporate 4 loops in the canine area and will be placed so as not&#xD;
      to impinge in the lower lingual gingival region but it will be long enough so as the patient&#xD;
      will not be able to shift the mandible back. If the initial overjet exceeds 5 mm the&#xD;
      mandibular advancement will be gradual. Further adjustments will be made so as to maintain&#xD;
      the Class I relationship. The patient will wear the appliance for 8-12 months (T3). New&#xD;
      records will be taken at that time. If braces are needed, the patient will continue with&#xD;
      fixed appliances.&#xD;
