      The purpose of this study is to test whether chronic administration of the drug acipimox will&#xD;
      improve hyperlipidemia and insulin sensitivity among HIV infected patients experiencing&#xD;
      highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) associated metabolic disturbances.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV infected patients treated with HAART are at increased risk for developing significant&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and abnormal patterns of fat distribution. While the exact&#xD;
      mechanism responsible for these changes is not known, there is increasing evidence that&#xD;
      patients with HIV infection and fat redistribution have increased basal rates of lipolysis&#xD;
      and elevated circulating free fatty acids (FFA). Patients with HIV associated lipodystrophy&#xD;
      have increased FFA levels that correlated directly with impaired glucose metabolism and&#xD;
      triglyceride concentrations. Furthermore, acute inhibition of lipolysis in patients with HIV&#xD;
      lipodystrophy and insulin resistance results in improvement in insulin sensitivity. However,&#xD;
      long-term administration of lipolytic blocking agents has not been evaluated in this patient&#xD;
      population. Acipimox, a nicotinic acid analogue and a potent inhibitor of lipolysis, is an&#xD;
      established therapy for dyslipidemia. In addition, through effects on lowering circulating&#xD;
      FFA, acute administration of acipimox has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in other&#xD;
      populations, including lean and obese individuals and patients with type II diabetes. This&#xD;
      study will test the hypothesis that chronic administration of acipimox will improve&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia and insulin sensitivity among HIV infected patients experiencing HAART&#xD;
      associated metabolic disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a 3-month double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 250 mg of acipimox three&#xD;
      times daily in 30 patients with HAART lipodystrophy. The primary clinical endpoint of this&#xD;
      study will be the change in fasting triglyceride concentration, comparing baseline values to&#xD;
      those obtained after 3 months of acipimox or placebo. Insulin sensitivity, an important&#xD;
      secondary endpoint, will be determined by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies. Rates of&#xD;
      lipolysis in the fasting state will be quantified by a 3-hour infusion of stable&#xD;
      isotope-labeled glycerol. Indirect calorimetry will be used to assess changes in resting&#xD;
      energy expenditure. Cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) imaging of the thigh and abdomen&#xD;
      will allow for measurement of visceral and subcutaneous fat areas. Dual energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DEXA) will be used to determine whole body fat mass.&#xD;
