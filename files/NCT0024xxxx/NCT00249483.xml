    <textblock>
      Preliminary research has shown that venlafaxine, a medication currently used for treating&#xD;
      depression, may also discourage cocaine use in depressed individuals. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of venlafaxine in reducing cocaine use and alleviating depression&#xD;
      in individuals addicted to cocaine.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals addicted to cocaine often experience feelings of restlessness, irritability, and&#xD;
      anxiety. They also often report feeling depressed when not using cocaine, and they tend to&#xD;
      resume cocaine use to alleviate symptoms of depression. Venlafaxine is a medication that is&#xD;
      currently used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. Preliminary research has shown that&#xD;
      venlafaxine reduces depression, improves mood, and simultaneously reduces cocaine use in&#xD;
      cocaine addicts. Further research is needed to confirm the benefits of venlafaxine for&#xD;
      cocaine addicts. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of venlafaxine in&#xD;
      reducing cocaine use, cocaine craving, and depression in individuals who are addicted to&#xD;
      cocaine and diagnosed with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will begin with a 1-week lead-in phase, during which all participants will receive&#xD;
      placebo medication. Participants whose depression levels decrease will not continue in the&#xD;
      treatment phase of the study, but will be eligible for cocaine relapse therapy and medication&#xD;
      if deemed necessary by the treating psychiatrist. Participants who remain depressed following&#xD;
      the lead-in phase will be randomly assigned to receive either venlafaxine or placebo for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Participants assigned to venlafaxine will initially receive a daily dose of 37.5 mg.&#xD;
      After 4 days, the dose will be increased to 75 mg; each week thereafter, the dose will be&#xD;
      increased by another 75 mg, up to a maximum of 300 mg per day, dependent on side effects and&#xD;
      positive responses. Study visits will take place twice a week. At each visit, medication side&#xD;
      effects and depression levels will be assessed, cocaine levels will be monitored with urine&#xD;
      tests, and self-reports will be completed. Blood will be drawn once per month for laboratory&#xD;
      tests. Participants will also attend a therapy session once a week, and they will meet with a&#xD;
      psychiatrist every other week for assessments. Participants who show a decrease in depression&#xD;
      during the 12 weeks of treatment will continue for an additional 12 weeks to further monitor&#xD;
      cocaine use and depression levels.&#xD;
