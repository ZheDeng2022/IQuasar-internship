  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of HCV-infected IDUs presents multiple challenges, such as adherence to&#xD;
      therapy, relapse of substance use, re-infection, and co-morbid psychiatric disease. Some&#xD;
      guidelines recommended that IDUs not be offered HCV treatment until they had stopped all such&#xD;
      use for &gt; 6 months, raising some questions about fairness and discrimination. Little&#xD;
      published data exist on HCV therapy in active IDUs. However, extensive evidence exists that,&#xD;
      when specific programs are developed, IDUs can be successfully engaged in care. In IDUs,&#xD;
      strategies shown to improve adherence include directly-observed therapy (DOT), cash&#xD;
      incentives, and comprehensive case management. Weekly interferon dosing now provides a means&#xD;
      of improving HCV treatment adherence, and makes a DOT approach more practical. Within an&#xD;
      observational, prospective clinical cohort, we will be able to identify a group of IDUs&#xD;
      infected with HCV genotype 2 or 3 who would most benefit from treatment for their infection.&#xD;
      We will design a systematic approach to the determination of their appropriateness for&#xD;
      treatment, refine the approach to their treatment within a directly observed therapy (DOT)&#xD;
      setting, and evaluate the success of the approach (defined as the achievement of Sustained&#xD;
      Virologic Response (SVR)). Taken together, this project will help define a systematic&#xD;
      approach to HCV infection in the inner city. The hypothesis is that the development of a&#xD;
      systematic approach for the diagnosis of HCV and the establishment of a directly observed&#xD;
      therapy (DOT) program for the treatment of HCV infection in IDUs will constitute an effective&#xD;
      means of controlling the epidemic of this infection within this population.&#xD;

      We will evaluate up to 200 IDUs receiving care in our clinics. For those found to carry&#xD;
      genotype 2 or 3 and be eligible for treatment on medical grounds, we will evaluate the&#xD;
      patients in a bi-weekly case conference. All physicians who are participating in this study&#xD;
      will also be included. Nursing and counselling staff will also be present. For those who&#xD;
      qualify to receive therapy for HCV, based on Provincial guidelines, a decision will be made&#xD;
      regarding their appropriateness to begin treatment based on physical, mental, social and&#xD;
      addiction-related factors. Once treatment is initiated, the primary objective of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate a relatively high intensity DOT program for the treatment of HCV-infected&#xD;
      IDUs. All patients will have access to: full-time primary care physician, half-time&#xD;
      specialist physician, immediate access to one of three full-time nurses and one of six&#xD;
      full-time counsellors. All weekly pegylated interferon injections and one of two daily doses&#xD;
      of oral medications will be administered/witnessed by clinic staff. The interferon will be&#xD;
      injected at the clinic by a staff nurse, while the one daily dose of ribavirin that will be&#xD;
      observed will be given simultaneously with methadone (if the patient is on maintenance&#xD;
      therapy with this agent) either at the clinic site or at a community pharmacy, as has been&#xD;
      decided in that individual's plan of care. This plan will be maintained at the time of&#xD;
      initiation of HCV therapy. This study will evaluate 50 individuals infected with HCV&#xD;
      genotypes 2/3 receiving up to 24 weeks of therapy. The primary outcome will be evaluation of&#xD;
      SVR (undetectable virus at 48 weeks, 24 weeks after cessation of therapy). Patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at PCHC, TPHU or CCHC, according to their usual site of medical care. They will be&#xD;
      assessed to determine if they wish to participate in the trial and meet its inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. They will then be asked to provide written, informed consent using the&#xD;
      document approved by the Research Ethics Board. Once consent is granted, a medical evaluation&#xD;
      and laboratory testing will be completed. Clinical data will consist of a medical history (to&#xD;
      include recreational drug use history) and physical examination (to include vital signs,&#xD;
      weight and height). Laboratory evaluations will include: confirmation of HCV antibody status,&#xD;
      viremia and genotype; Hematology (CBC); Blood Chemistry (ALT, creatinine, alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase, total bilirubin (direct and indirect), urea nitrogen, albumin, glucose, sodium,&#xD;
      potassium, chloride); ANA, TSH, HBsAg, iron studies, ceruloplasmin, AFP, PT/INR, HIV antibody&#xD;
      test (CD4 cell count and HIV plasma viral load, if known HIV-positive); Urinalysis and&#xD;
      Toxicology Screen; Serum pregnancy test in women of child-bearing potential. All blood work&#xD;
      to evaluate treatment efficacy and toxicity will be collected by study personnel. This will&#xD;
      be done at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 (more frequently if clinically indicated),&#xD;
      according to the standard of care. All medical follow-up will be according to standard of&#xD;
      care. This study will involve the prospective evaluation of HCV therapy in patients who would&#xD;
      receive treatment regardless of their participation in the study.&#xD;
