  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an immunogenicity study evaluating the development of the immune response of healthy&#xD;
      infants following primary vaccination with Attenuvax at 6 or 9 months of age compared with&#xD;
      responses in 12 month-old infants receiving MMR-II. Responses of infants receiving an early&#xD;
      two dose measles vaccine regimen with the first dose given at 6 or 9 months followed by a&#xD;
      second dose administered at 12 months will also be compared to infants given a single dose at&#xD;
      12 months of age (Table 2). The current approved regimen for measles vaccination is a first&#xD;
      vaccination at 12-15 months and a subsequent vaccination at school entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary endpoint of this study will be to assess the safety of measles vaccine&#xD;
      administered as Attenuvax at 6 or 9 months of age and in an early two dose measles vaccine&#xD;
      regimen with Attenuvax administered at 6 or 9 months followed by MMR-II at 12 months of age.&#xD;

      This is an open-label immunogenicity and safety study of live attenuated Measles Vaccine&#xD;
      (Attenuvax) and Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR-II) vaccine administered to healthy children at 6&#xD;
      (n=70), 9 (n=70), or 12 (n=70) months of age. Attenuvax (Measles Virus Vaccine Live, Merck &amp;&#xD;
      Co., Inc) and MMR-II (Measles-Mumps-Rubella Virus Vaccine Live, Merck &amp; Co., Inc) will be&#xD;
      delivered as 0.5 mL per dose, administered subcutaneously. Both vaccines are licensed for use&#xD;
      in infants in the United States. MMR-II is recommended as part of the childhood immunization&#xD;
      schedule by the AAP and ACIP, and Attenuvax is recommended for use as a single component&#xD;
      vaccine in infants 6-11 months particularly for foreign travel and in measles outbreaks79.&#xD;
      Infants vaccinated with Attenuvax at 6 or 9 months receive MMR-II at 12 months of age as&#xD;
      recommended for follow-up vaccination. Immunization against measles is given as a trivalent&#xD;
      formulation with mumps and rubella and is indicated as a primary dose at 12-15 months of age&#xD;
      with a second dose recommended routinely at time of school entry, 4-6 years of age, but can&#xD;
      be given at any earlier age provided that the interval between the first and second doses is&#xD;
      at least 4 weeks .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred and ten healthy children attending the Palo Alto Medical Clinic will be recruited&#xD;
      into one of three cohorts over a five year period. (Table 1). All children in cohort 1 and 2&#xD;
      (6 and 9 month old infants) will receive Attenuvax as part of their participation in this&#xD;
      study followed by MMR-II at 12 months of age as part of their routine WCC and not as a study&#xD;
      vaccine. Infants recruited into cohort 3, (twelve month old infants) will receive one dose of&#xD;
      MMR-II at 12 months. All infants in the study (cohort 1, 2 or 3) are receiving MMR-II at 12&#xD;
      months as part of their routine childhood vaccines. The vaccination schedules is summarized&#xD;
      in Table 1. Other immunizations as required for routine WCC will be administered&#xD;
      simultaneously. Participation will entail 2-4 visits, 2-3 blood samples, and 1-2&#xD;
      immunizations and will end after the 9-18 month visit, totaling 3 to 12 months time of&#xD;
      participation for a subject depending on cohort and if participants opt for a second&#xD;
      follow-up blood sample.&#xD;
