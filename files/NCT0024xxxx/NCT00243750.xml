    <textblock>
      Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory rheumatic disease mit main affection of the spine.&#xD;
      However peripheral joints, entheses and the eyes can also be affected. The rheumatic symptoms&#xD;
      of the patients typically show good response to nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis in ankylosing spondylitis there is no evidence that&#xD;
      therapy with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs is effective (DMARD). Next to studies with&#xD;
      the DMARD sulfasalazine, which seems to be effective mainly in peripheral joint involvement&#xD;
      and in which a possible effect in short disease duration also seems to exist for axial&#xD;
      involvement, in regards of other DMARDs there are only small studies or case reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of methotrexate only small studies with a dosage of 7,5mg - 10 mg - maximally 15mg&#xD;
      (perorally in single patients) have been published. In three open studies in 11- 34 patients&#xD;
      treated with methotrexate 7,5mg - maximally 15mg perorally over a time duration of 24 weeks&#xD;
      until maximally 3 years there a certain effectiveness partly in spinal symptoms, partly in&#xD;
      peripheral joint involvement (1, 2, 3). In both double blind controlled studies with 30 and&#xD;
      50 patients respectively with a dosage of 7,5 and 10mg methotrexate respectively no&#xD;
      significant effectiveness was shown (4,5). To summarize, in the different studies no&#xD;
      effectiveness could be shown clearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy with methotrexate in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases - especially in&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis- belongs to standard therapy. In Germany methotrexate is given in about&#xD;
      70% of cases because of its good effectiveness as therapy of first choice. In the treatment&#xD;
      of psoriatic arthritis representing a disease which is similar to ankylosing spondylitis in&#xD;
      regards to pathogenesis, methotrexate therapy could be established in a dosage of 20mg&#xD;
      parenterally and 25mg perorally respectively successfully. Bearing this in mind it is even&#xD;
      more surprising that there are no data about methotrexate in this dosages for the treatment&#xD;
      of ankylosing spondylitis. According to the German rheumatic register (so-called&#xD;
      &quot;rheumatologische Kerndokumentation&quot;, PD. Dr. A. Zink, DRFZ, Berlin) already about 20% of&#xD;
      patients with ankylosing spondylitis are treated with methotrexate by German rheumatologists.&#xD;
      For this reason it is makes sense to perform a study for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      active ankylosing spondylitis with methotrexate in a dosage of 20mg. In the therapy of&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis a combination of methotrexate and TNFalpha blocking agents leads to an&#xD;
      enhancement of effectiveness and reduction of side effects. For this reason the effectivenss&#xD;
      of methotrexate in ankylosing spondylitis is also very interesting in regards to a possible&#xD;
      combination with TNFalpha blocking agents which have shown to be very successful in the&#xD;
      treatment of ankylosing spondyltitis.&#xD;
