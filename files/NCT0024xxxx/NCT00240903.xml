      The purpose of this study is to determine whether having received an H5 vaccine in the past&#xD;
      primes the immune system to respond rapidly to another dose of H5 vaccine. One hundred&#xD;
      seventeen participants in a previous vaccine study (involving the A/Hong/Kong/97 virus)&#xD;
      during the fall of 1998 at the University of Rochester will be eligible to enroll in this&#xD;
      study. Participation in this study will up to 64 days and will involve donation of small&#xD;
      samples of blood 7, 28, and 56 days after vaccination.&#xD;

      This is an open label, phase I evaluation of a single dose of an investigational inactivated,&#xD;
      subunit influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) vaccine in subjects who were previously&#xD;
      vaccinated with a vaccine made from an antigenically distinct variant of H5N1. The study is&#xD;
      designed to determine whether immunization with an antigenic variant can prime for responses&#xD;
      to a single dose of vaccine representing the current pandemic threat. The primary objective&#xD;
      is to determine the ability of a priming dose of rec H5 HA 1997 vaccine administered 7 years&#xD;
      previously to result in booster responses to an inactivated subunit influenza&#xD;
      A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) vaccine. The secondary objectives are to 1) determine the safety&#xD;
      of a booster dose of intramuscular inactivated subunit influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1)&#xD;
      vaccine in healthy adults, previously vaccinated with rec H5 HA 1997 vaccine and 2) evaluate&#xD;
      the relationship between priming, levels of antigen-specific memory B and T cells , and the&#xD;
      response to reactivation. The study will be performed at a single site, and will enroll as&#xD;
      many previously vaccinated subjects as are available and eligible, up to a maximum of 117.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a single intramuscular dose of 90 mcg of the inactivated subunit&#xD;
      influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) vaccine. Blood for assessment of antibody responses will&#xD;
      be obtained before and at time points after vaccination. Subjects participating in the&#xD;
      optional sub study will also have blood obtained for enumeration of memory B and T cells.&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for solicited adverse events for 7 days by memory aids and for 56&#xD;
      days for unsolicited adverse events. This study is linked to DMID protocol 08-0059.&#xD;

             Norplant, oral contraceptives, contraceptive patches or other licensed, effective&#xD;
             methods) for the entire study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. In good health, as determined by medical history and a targeted physical examination,&#xD;
             if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able to provide informed consent and be available for all study visits.&#xD;
