      The purpose of the study is to look at the differences between people who have irregular&#xD;
      heart beats coming from the upper chamber of the heart (atrial fibrillation) compared to&#xD;
      those who do not have these irregular beats.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart beat that starts in the upper parts of the heart and&#xD;
      can cause stroke or death, if untreated. In general, treatments are not very effective with&#xD;
      frequent relapses of the abnormal heart beats. One explanation for the high relapse rate is&#xD;
      that the treatments might not address the underlying cause of atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we have found that atrial fibrillation is associated with increased oxidative&#xD;
      stress in a particular part of the top parts of the heart, the left atrial appendage (LAA).&#xD;
      Oxidative stress is a condition where abnormal oxygen forms are produced. These forms harm&#xD;
      the cells of the heart, causing them to beat abnormally. Also, the inside of the heart&#xD;
      becomes sticky and more likely to form blood clots. These clots, when they travel to the&#xD;
      head, are thought to be the main cause of strokes in this condition. We have found increased&#xD;
      oxidative stress and increased evidence of blood clotting in pig and mouse models of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation. We would like to see if these same findings are present in the human LAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will compare blood and tissue markers of oxidative stress between patients&#xD;
      with and without atrial fibrillation who are scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery. It is the&#xD;
      expectation that participants with atrial fibrillation will have more abnormal markers of&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation. This study requires participants to be seen during their routine&#xD;
      preoperative visit, undergo a history and physical examination, give blood only once, and&#xD;
      allow use of their discarded LAA. This tissue is routinely removed at surgery because its&#xD;
      removal is thought to reduce the risk of strokes in patients who develop atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      after the surgery. This happens in up to 50% of patients, thus providing the desire to remove&#xD;
      the LAA.&#xD;
