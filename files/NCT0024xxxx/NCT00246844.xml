  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether insulin-producing cells in the pancreas (beta cells) can&#xD;
      recover in patients with type 1 diabetes who have had a pancreas transplant. In type 1&#xD;
      diabetes, the body's immune system destroys the beta cells. Patients are treated with insulin&#xD;
      shots or a pancreas transplant to control their blood sugar. Some experiments suggest that&#xD;
      the pancreas may have the capacity to recover some of its insulin-producing capacity, but&#xD;
      that ability is negated by factors such as the continuing immune attack and erratic blood&#xD;
      sugar levels in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have had a pancreas transplant may be in a unique situation to allow their own&#xD;
      pancreas to regrow beta cells for two reasons: 1) the medicines they take to prevent&#xD;
      rejection of the transplanted pancreas weaken their immune system; and 2) they have&#xD;
      near-normal blood sugar levels because of their functioning transplanted pancreas. This study&#xD;
      will test this hypothesis by sampling blood from patients' hepatic vein, which drains the&#xD;
      liver and native pancreas and from their iliac vein, which drains the transplanted pancreas.&#xD;
      This will determine whether insulin is coming from the transplanted pancreas (iliac vein) or&#xD;
      the liver and native pancreas (hepatic vein).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who have had stable pancreatic transplant function for&#xD;
      more than 5 years may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical&#xD;
      history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are admitted to the hospital for 2 days for a full medical examination, blood&#xD;
      tests and procedures to determine insulin production. The procedures will include the&#xD;
      placement of catheters in the neck and groin for blood sampling. Participants will be closely&#xD;
      monitored after the procedures and discharged home if there are no complications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is thought to result from an autoimmune destruction of&#xD;
      insulin producing beta-cells found within the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. In addition to&#xD;
      the autoimmune process however, many studies have shown that hyperglycemia is also toxic to&#xD;
      islets. Interventional studies have shown, for instance, that either tight glycemia control&#xD;
      or immunosuppression can preserve C-peptide production. We hypothesize that patients who are&#xD;
      immunosuppressed and euglycemic will display evidence that their native pancreas has&#xD;
      recovered beta-cell function. We have asked whether pancreas transplant recipients, due to&#xD;
      the immunosuppression required to prevent allograft loss, and the improved glycemia control&#xD;
      resulting from the transplanted pancreas, might display some recovery of their native&#xD;
      pancreatic islet function. Our preliminary data suggest that patients without C-peptide&#xD;
      production prior to receiving an islet transplant appear to recover some endogenous&#xD;
      pancreatic insulin secretion after islet transplantation. We will study whole pancreas&#xD;
      transplant recipients, specifically those with grafts functioning for at least 5 years. We&#xD;
      will test for native pancreas insulin production by infusing arginine into a peripheral vein,&#xD;
      then selectively/simultaneously sampling blood for C-peptide levels from the hepatic veins&#xD;
      and the vein draining the pancreatic allograft . Unlike our previous study of islet&#xD;
      transplant recipients, a study that required portal vein cannulation, this study will require&#xD;
      only hepatic and iliac vein cannulations, both much easier to accomplish, and associated with&#xD;
      much less risk to the patient. Samples obtained from these sites will be tested for C-peptide&#xD;
      levels. In addition, if we find evidence of native pancreas insulin production, we will look&#xD;
      at a variety of clinical variables to see if any correlate with recovery of function.&#xD;
