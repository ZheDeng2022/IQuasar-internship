  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a type of depression that is characterized by a&#xD;
      combination of symptoms that can interfere with the ability to work, study, sleep, eat, and&#xD;
      enjoy activities that were once pleasurable. Studies have shown that individuals of Hispanic&#xD;
      descent underutilize specialized mental health care services (SMHS), despite their need for&#xD;
      it. In addition, Hispanic individuals have been associated with lower rates of retention in&#xD;
      specialized mental health treatment. In particular, dropout rates from medication therapy for&#xD;
      the treatment of MDD within SMHS are two to three times higher in Hispanics than in&#xD;
      non-Hispanic whites. This study will develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      culturally-based program that aims to facilitate entry, retention, and successful treatment&#xD;
      in specialized mental health services for Hispanics with MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label study will consist of four phases. Participants will be recommended for&#xD;
      inclusion in the study upon receiving a diagnosis of MDD based on a standard health&#xD;
      questionnaire completed in their primary care physician's office. Phase 1 of the study will&#xD;
      entail an initial evaluation of the culturally congruent program of care for Hispanics with&#xD;
      MDD (CCP-MDD). Participants will be placed in one of two focus groups, each composed of 8 to&#xD;
      10 people. One group will include individuals referred by their primary care physician. The&#xD;
      other group will include family members of Hispanics with MDD. Discussions will focus on&#xD;
      participants' understandings of depression-like illness, their treatment expectations for&#xD;
      these conditions, and their perceived barriers to SMHS utilization. Information gathered in&#xD;
      the focus groups will be used to develop a second version of CCP-MDD. Phase 2 of the study&#xD;
      will evaluate the revised version of CCP-MDD and will include additional treatments with&#xD;
      antidepressant medication, weekly interpersonal psychotherapy, or a combination of the two.&#xD;
      Following treatment, participants will take part in a focus group, which will involve&#xD;
      participant feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the information obtained in the focus groups and from clinical observations, a third&#xD;
      version of CCP-MDD will be developed. In Phase 3, two sets of primary care offices will&#xD;
      participate. One set will be assigned to the intervention arm, and receive the third version&#xD;
      of the CCP-MDD intervention. A second set will be assigned to the control arm and receive&#xD;
      usual referral to mental health services at the research site. All participants will be&#xD;
      offered the same choice of treatments: antidepressant medication, weekly interpersonal&#xD;
      psychotherapy, or a combination of the two. Treatment in both arms will be of the same&#xD;
      duration, 18 wks. Focus groups will be held following treatment in order to obtain&#xD;
      information about individuals' satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their care. Based on&#xD;
      these findings, as well as clinical observations, a fourth and final version of CCP-MDD will&#xD;
      be developed in Phase 4. All treatments will last a total of 18 weeks. A follow-up session&#xD;
      will be held at Week 30 to assess depressive symptoms.&#xD;
