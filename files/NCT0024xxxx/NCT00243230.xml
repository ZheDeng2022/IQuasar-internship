    <textblock>
      Vicriviroc (vye-kri-VYE-rock) is an investigational drug that belongs to a new class of&#xD;
      drugs, called C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) receptor blockers. This group of drugs&#xD;
      blocks one of the ways human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enters T-cells (the cells that&#xD;
      fight infection). The purpose of this 48-week study is to evaluate 2 dose levels of&#xD;
      vicriviroc in participants with HIV who have not responded adequately to standard HIV&#xD;
      treatments. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of doses of&#xD;
      vicriviroc, when taken in combination with other HIV drugs, in terms of ability to decrease&#xD;
      the level of HIV (viral load) in the blood. The primary objective of the study was to&#xD;
      evaluate antiviral efficacy of two doses of Vicriviroc maleate compared to placebo in&#xD;
      combination with a protease inhibitor (PI)-containing optimized antiretroviral therapy (ART)&#xD;
      regimen in CCR5-tropic HIV infected individuals failing a standard ART regimen.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study of&#xD;
      vicriviroc maleate in participants with HIV infected with CCR5-tropic virus only for whom&#xD;
      standard antiretroviral treatment (ART) has failed. The study will evaluate the antiviral&#xD;
      efficacy of two doses of vicriviroc (20 mg once daily (QD) and 30 mg QD) compared with&#xD;
      placebo when added to optimized ART therapy. The optimized background regimen will be chosen&#xD;
      by the investigator based on results of drug susceptibility tests, history of prior&#xD;
      antiretroviral drug use by the participant, and drug toxicity. The background regimen must&#xD;
      include at least 3 antiretroviral drugs (not including study drug), one of which must be a&#xD;
      ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (≥100 mg ritonavir). There will be two interim analyses:&#xD;
      when all participants have completed 12 weeks and 24 weeks of treatment, respectively. Based&#xD;
      on the balance of safety and efficacy determined in these analyses, a dosage or dosages will&#xD;
      be selected for further study in additional registrational trials. The primary efficacy&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted when all participants have completed 48 weeks of treatment. After&#xD;
      Week 48, participants who meet applicable criteria will be offered open label vicriviroc 30&#xD;
      mg QD, if appropriate, until the sponsor terminates the clinical development of vicriviroc.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants who discontinue early from the study prior to Week 48 will be&#xD;
      offered re-screening for the open label segment of the study.&#xD;

    <description>HIV RNA was measured by AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Standard assay. For participants who had HIV RNA below the lower quantification of the Standard assay (LOQ of 400 copies/mL), the AMPLICOR HIV-1.5 UltraSensitive assay was performed. If the HIV RNA measurement was below the lower quantification of the UltraSensitive assay (LOQ of 50 copies/mL), a value of 49 was imputed. If a continuing participant has a missing HIV RNA value at the time point of interest, the geometric mean of immediately preceding and following values was used. If the participants had no subsequent following value or discontinued study treatment before the time point of interest, then the change from baseline was set to zero. Analysis was performed with a variance (ANOVA) model that adjusted for the treatment and stratification factors (intended enfuvirtide (T20) use in current newly-optimized background regimen (OBT) (Y/N) and HIV RNA at Screening (&gt; or ≤100,000 copies/mL)).</description>

    <description>HIV RNA was measured by AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Standard assay (the lower quantification, [LOQ of 400 copies/mL]) and for HIV RNA below the LOQ, with the AMPLICOR HIV-1.5 UltraSensitive assay. HIV RNA &lt;400 copies/mL is a less stringent measure of viral suppression (participant responded to treatment). HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL is a very stringent measure of viral suppression (participant achieved full virologic suppression). If a continuing participant has a missing HIV RNA value at the time point of interest, the geometric mean of immediately preceding and following values was used. Missing value for any reason will be imputed as non-responder except if the immediately preceding and following viral counts are both &lt;50 copies/mL.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Log10 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) at Week 48 of the Double-blind Period</title>
        <description>HIV RNA was measured by AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Standard assay. For participants who had HIV RNA below the lower quantification of the Standard assay (LOQ of 400 copies/mL), the AMPLICOR HIV-1.5 UltraSensitive assay was performed. If the HIV RNA measurement was below the lower quantification of the UltraSensitive assay (LOQ of 50 copies/mL), a value of 49 was imputed. If a continuing participant has a missing HIV RNA value at the time point of interest, the geometric mean of immediately preceding and following values was used. If the participants had no subsequent following value or discontinued study treatment before the time point of interest, then the change from baseline was set to zero. Analysis was performed with a variance (ANOVA) model that adjusted for the treatment and stratification factors (intended enfuvirtide (T20) use in current newly-optimized background regimen (OBT) (Y/N) and HIV RNA at Screening (&gt; or ≤100,000 copies/mL)).</description>

          <description>HIV RNA was measured by AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Standard assay. For participants who had HIV RNA below the lower quantification of the Standard assay (LOQ of 400 copies/mL), the AMPLICOR HIV-1.5 UltraSensitive assay was performed. If a continuing participant has a missing HIV RNA value at the time point of interest, the geometric mean of immediately preceding and following values was used. If the participants had no subsequent following value or discontinued study treatment before the time point of interest, then the change from baseline was set to zero.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Log10 HIV RNA at Week 24 of the Double-blind Period</title>
          <description>HIV RNA was measured by AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Standard assay. For participants who had HIV RNA below the lower quantification of the Standard assay (LOQ of 400 c/mL), the AMPLICOR HIV-1.5 UltraSensitive assay was performed. If the HIV RNA measurement was below the lower quantification of the UltraSensitive assay (LOQ of 50 c/mL), a value of 49 was imputed. If a continuing participant has a missing HIV RNA value at the time point of interest, the geometric mean of immediately preceding and following values was used. Missing values of change from baseline were imputed by the average of immediately preceding and following non-missing values, and in any other cases, missing values were imputed by zero.</description>
          <population>The analysis population included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication during the Double-blind Period. Participants enrolled in the Open Label Period were not included in this analysis population.</population>

        <description>Blood was collected and CD4+ cell count assessment was done by flow cytometry. Mean change from baseline in CD4 cell counts was determined. Any missing value was replaced by carrying forward baseline except if the immediately preceding and following value are available, in which case the arithmetic average of the two was used. If more than 1 CD4 count was available during a visit window, the value that was the closest to the time point of interest was used. If more than 1 pre-treatment CD4 value was available at baseline, the arithmetic mean of the 2 CD4 counts was taken.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline CD4 Count at Week 48 of the Double-blind Period</title>
        <description>Blood was collected and CD4+ cell count assessment was done by flow cytometry. Mean change from baseline in CD4 cell counts was determined. Any missing value was replaced by carrying forward baseline except if the immediately preceding and following value are available, in which case the arithmetic average of the two was used. If more than 1 CD4 count was available during a visit window, the value that was the closest to the time point of interest was used. If more than 1 pre-treatment CD4 value was available at baseline, the arithmetic mean of the 2 CD4 counts was taken.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With &lt;50, 50 to &lt;400, and ≥400 Copies/mL HIV RNA of the Open Label Extension</title>
        <description>HIV RNA was measured by AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Standard assay (the lower quantification, [LOQ of 400 copies/mL]) and for HIV RNA below the LOQ, with the AMPLICOR HIV-1.5 UltraSensitive assay. HIV RNA &lt;400 copies/mL is a less stringent measure of viral suppression (participant responded to treatment). HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL is a very stringent measure of viral suppression (participant achieved full virologic suppression). If a continuing participant has a missing HIV RNA value at the time point of interest, the geometric mean of immediately preceding and following values was used. Missing value for any reason will be imputed as non-responder except if the immediately preceding and following viral counts are both &lt;50 copies/mL. Results are shown for Group 1. for participants with baseline HIV RNA &lt;50 copies/mL, Group 2. baseline HIV RNA 50 to &lt;400 copies/mL, and Group 3. baseline HIV RNA&gt;400 copies/mL.</description>

          <description>All potential AIDS-defining events (ADEs) identified by investigators and the sponsor were submitted with supporting clinical data to an independent and blinded Adjudication Committee of HIV experts. To be analyzed as an ADE, the event required concurrence on the diagnosis by at least 2 of the 3 Adjudication Committee members. Their review included available clinical and laboratory data, including relevant radiologic, endoscopic, and pathology assessments, when applicable as well as autopsy reports and/or hospital admission and discharge summaries.
