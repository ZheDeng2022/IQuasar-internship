      This is a Phase II open-label study of weekly Taxoprexin® Injection in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic malignant melanoma who have not received cytotoxic agents for advanced disease.&#xD;
      Patients may have been previously treated with immunological agents including IL-2 and&#xD;
      vaccines. Patients will receive Taxoprexin® Injection at a dose of 500mg/m2 intravenously by&#xD;
      1-hour infusion weekly for the first five weeks of a six week cycle. Treatment will continue&#xD;
      until progression of disease, intolerable toxicity, refusal of continued treatment by patient&#xD;
      or Investigator decision.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Patients must not have received prior systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease.&#xD;
             Prior treatment with immunotherapy or vaccine therapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. At least 6 weeks (42 days) since any prior immunotherapy, cytokine, biologic, vaccine&#xD;
