  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We performed a prophylactic peroperative linear 1-minute cryolesion connecting the tricuspid&#xD;
      annulus and right atriotomy to prevent IART on 15 consecutive adult patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery for congenital heart disease. Conduction time between electrodes placed on both sides&#xD;
      of the cryolesion was measured on the second postoperative day. Coronary angiography and&#xD;
      electrophysiology study using an electroanatomic mapping system to assess conduction across&#xD;
      the line were performed three month after the operation on 13 patients.&#xD;

      Patient selection Consecutive patients operated in the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery,&#xD;
      Aarhus University Hospital at Skejby were included. Inclusion criteria were: 1. Clinical&#xD;
      indication for corrective operation for congenital heart disease with the use of a right&#xD;
      lateral atriotomy, 2. Age &gt;18 years, 3. Ability to give an informed consent. The only&#xD;
      exclusion criterion was acute operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients prior to the inclusion in the&#xD;
      study. The ethical committee for Aarhus County approved the study September 18, 2003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operation and postoperative care The operation was performed in the usual fashion.&#xD;
      Additionally, a single linear endocardial 1-minute cryolesion connecting the right lateral&#xD;
      atriotomy with the tricuspid annulus anteriorly and with crista terminalis posteriorly was&#xD;
      performed before the right atriotomy has been sutured (Figure 1). SurgiFrost® cryosurgical&#xD;
      probe (Endocare Inc., Irvine, California) was used. Two pairs of epicardial electrodes were&#xD;
      placed on the atrium between the incision and the tricuspid annulus 1.5 cm cranially, and&#xD;
      caudally from the cryolesion at the end of the repair. They were brought out together to the&#xD;
      thorax on the patient's right side. Subsequently, the thorax was closed in the usual way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were monitored continuously using bedside monitors or telemetry for the first 16-24&#xD;
      hours after the operation. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained at any clinical&#xD;
      suspicion of arrhythmia. Atrial tachycardia was defined as a sustained regular monomorphic&#xD;
      atrial rhythm at a constant rate &gt;100/min originating outside the sinus node.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of conduction time On the second postoperative day, the conduction time was&#xD;
      measured with the help of pacing the electrode pair on the one side of the cryolesion between&#xD;
      the incision and the tricuspid annulus and sensing the unipolar signals on the other side&#xD;
      (Figure 2). Signals were recorded at 100 mm/s using a commercially available ECG machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrophysiology study and coronary angiography Electrophysiology study and coronary&#xD;
      angiography were carried out 3 months after the operation. Patients were free of&#xD;
      antiarrhythmic agents at the time of the study. Coronary angiography was performed with the&#xD;
      usual technique from the femoral approach. Afterwards, a 7-French quadripolar deflectable&#xD;
      ablation catheter with a 4-mm tip electrode (Navistar®, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar,&#xD;
      California) was advanced via the right femoral vein into the right atrium for mapping and&#xD;
      radiofrequency catheter ablation. An active fixation lead (Sweet Picotip®, Guidant, St. Paul,&#xD;
      Minnesota) was screwed in the lateral right atrium near the tricuspid annulus and the&#xD;
      performed cryolesion and was used for pacing. Simultaneous recordings of intracardiac&#xD;
      electrograms filtered at 50-500 Hz and 12-lead surface ECG were stored digitally (CardioLab®,&#xD;
      Prucka Engineering, Inc., Houston, Texas or Prucka CardioLab 2000®, GE Medical Systems,&#xD;
      Milwaukee, Wisconsin). An electroanatomic map (CARTO®, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar,&#xD;
      California) was constructed during pacing with special emphasis on the region of surgical&#xD;
      scar and cryolesion to be able to judge conduction across the cryolesion. Afterwards, the&#xD;
      active fixation lead was repositioned to the opposite side of the cryolesion near the&#xD;
      Navistar® catheter, which was placed with the help of the already constructed electroanatomic&#xD;
      map. Another electroanatomic map was created under pacing from this second site to judge the&#xD;
      completeness of the cryolesion in the other direction. Afterwards, attempts at induction of&#xD;
      atrial arrhythmias were made. These included rapid atrial pacing with 20 stimuli starting&#xD;
      from a cycle length of 400 ms with 20 ms decrements down to a cycle length of 200 ms, and&#xD;
      single and double extrastimuli at 400 ms cycle length down to atrial refractoriness.&#xD;
      Isoproterenol was not used during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessment of the intervention All adverse events were recorded. Likely relationship&#xD;
      of adverse events to the study intervention was determined based on the consensus of the&#xD;
      participating investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis All calculations were carried out using the statistical software&#xD;
      Intercooled Stata® Release 8 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas). Comparison of&#xD;
      continuous variables was performed using the Student's t-test, or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test,&#xD;
      as appropriate. Comparison of proportions was performed using the Fisher's exact test. Median&#xD;
      (interquartile range) or mean ± standard deviation are reported, as appropriate.&#xD;
