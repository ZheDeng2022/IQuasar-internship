      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not smoked marijuana improves spasticity&#xD;
      in patients with multiple sclerosis.&#xD;

      Studies of cannabinoids for spasticity in MS have had mixed results but clinical studies have&#xD;
      been small, generally not properly controlled, with results controversial, and difficult to&#xD;
      interpret. Recently, investigators in the UK and US tested the ability of cannabinoids to&#xD;
      control spasticity and tremor symptoms of the MS-like disease, experimental allergic&#xD;
      encephalomyelitis, in mice (Baker et al, 2000). The authors found that four different&#xD;
      cannabinoids quantitatively ameliorated both tremor and spasticity in diseased mice; thus&#xD;
      providing rationale for patients' reports of the therapeutic effects of cannabis in the&#xD;
      control of their MS symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design of 30 patients&#xD;
      who will be assessed before and after treatment for 3 consecutive days (Phase I), undergo&#xD;
      washout-out for a total of 11 days, and then cross over to either the placebo or active&#xD;
      treatment phase (Phase II), depending on what they received during Phase I. At each study&#xD;
      visit, patients will utilize a controlled puff procedure to help ensure stable intake (Levin&#xD;
      et al, 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons: A single dose of 4% THC marijuana cigarette each day for 3 days will be compared&#xD;
      to a placebo administered under the same dosing conditions for the relief of spasticity, drug&#xD;
      tolerability, and changes in global functioning and quality of life indices.&#xD;
