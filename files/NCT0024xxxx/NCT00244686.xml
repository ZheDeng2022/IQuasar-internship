  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      104317: The market authorisation application for mepolizumab for the indication of&#xD;
      hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) was filed in 2008, but later the file was withdrawn due to&#xD;
      outstanding questions from regulator's raised from the application. On the basis of sponsor's&#xD;
      evaluation, participants with life-threatening HES who have documented failure (lack of&#xD;
      efficacy or a contra-indication) to at least 3 standard HES therapies (compassionate use) and&#xD;
      participants who have participated in a previous GSK sponsored study in HES (long-term&#xD;
      access) can be consider for mepolizumab treatment where the country regulation permits. In&#xD;
      this study, participants will receive mepolizumab in an open-labelled manner, and limited&#xD;
      data will be collected to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of mepolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      201956: This is a Long-term Access Programme (LAP) which aims to support provision of&#xD;
      mepolizumab, until it is commercially available, to eligible subjects with severe asthma who&#xD;
      participated in a GSK-sponsored mepolizumab clinical study in severe asthma. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will initiate mepolizumab within a 6-month period following the individual subject's&#xD;
      last scheduled visit in their preceding clinical study. For each subject benefit versus risk&#xD;
      will be assessed throughout the study to support continued treatment with mepolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      112562: To provide a mechanism for expanded access to mepolizumab therapy for eligible&#xD;
      patients with HES. Whenever possible, use of an investigational medicinal product by a&#xD;
      patient as part of a clinical trial is preferable. However, when patient enrollment in a&#xD;
      clinical trial is not possible (such as when the patient is not eligible for ongoing clinical&#xD;
      trials or the patient is not able to attend investigational sites), appropriate patients may&#xD;
      receive mepolizumab through expanded access. This expanded access protocol was designed to&#xD;
      allow access to mepolizumab for HES patients with seriously debilitating or life-threatening&#xD;
      disease that are not able to enroll in clinical trials, including those patients that have&#xD;
      already participated in a mepolizumab clinical trial.&#xD;
