    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Pulmonary vein isolation&#xD;
      (PVI) in the left atrium using radiofrequency energy is a new and promising non-medical&#xD;
      treatment in patients with symptomatic AF with reported success rates of 65 % to 90 %&#xD;
      depending on AF classification and ablation procedure. However, the risk of recurrence has&#xD;
      led to suggestions of how to improve the clinical outcome by tailoring a more efficient&#xD;
      ablation procedure. A prospective, randomised study with 150 patients with symptomatic AF&#xD;
      referred for PVI has been initiated and patients are allocated to PVI alone (75 patients) or&#xD;
      PVI with additional ablation in the right atrium (75 patients). Patients undergo extensive&#xD;
      monitoring of the heart rhythm during follow-up to document symptomatic or asymptomatic AF or&#xD;
      atrial flutter. The presence of asymptomatic AF after PVI could potentially affect the&#xD;
      management of the anticoagulation therapy in these patients. The structural and functional&#xD;
      changes in the atria after PVI is characterized by new imaging techniques (Tissue Doppler&#xD;
      Imaging(TDI))of the atria and cardiac neurohormones. TDI may be an effective tool for&#xD;
      characterising changes in the left atrial function after PVI. Neurohormones may provide new&#xD;
      information regarding the changes in left atrial function and clinical outcome after PVI in&#xD;
      patients with AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Among patients with predominant atrial fibrillation, PVI with additional ablation in the&#xD;
           right atrium is associated with better outcome, i.e. freedom of symptomatic AF/atrial&#xD;
           flutter overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asymptomatic AF and atrial flutter occur frequently after PVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left atrial volume and systolic function correlates to AF recurrence after PVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurohormones levels correlates to AF recurrence after PVI.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Medical treatment is often&#xD;
      inefficient or associated with side effects. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in the left&#xD;
      atrium using radiofrequency energy is a new and promising non-medical treatment in patients&#xD;
      with symptomatic AF with reported success rates of 65 % to 90 % depending on AF&#xD;
      classification and ablation procedure (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circumferential PVI appears to be the superior ablation technique in patients with AF (2).&#xD;
      However, the risk of recurrence has led to suggestions of how to improve the clinical outcome&#xD;
      by tailoring a more efficient ablation procedure. Patients with AF often have coexisting&#xD;
      atrial flutter (3), but it is uncertain if patients referred for PVI can benefit from&#xD;
      additional cavotricuspid isthmusblock (CTI) which is the traditional ablation treatment of&#xD;
      atrial flutter. A recent study indicates that PVI reduces both AF and atrial flutter by&#xD;
      eliminating sharing triggers in the pulmonary veins (4). Other investigators showed that&#xD;
      patients with AF and atrial flutter prior or during PVI had high risk of recurrent atrial&#xD;
      flutter during follow-up, and that successful PVI did not reduce the risk of recurrent atrial&#xD;
      flutter (3). The current approach in our lab is to perform additional CTI in cases of&#xD;
      documented atrial flutter, but CTI may potentially improve the overall outcome (freedom of&#xD;
      symptomatic arrhythmia) in patients without documented atrial flutter, especially since most&#xD;
      symptomatic periods are undocumented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, randomised study with 150 patients with symptomatic AF referred for PVI has&#xD;
      been initiated and patients are allocated to PVI alone (75 patients) or PVI with additional&#xD;
      CTI (75 patients). Patients undergo extensive Holter monitoring during follow-up to document&#xD;
      symptomatic or asymptomatic AF or atrial flutter. Patients with AF have a high incidence of&#xD;
      asymptomatic AF which correlates to an increased risk of tromboembolic complications (5). The&#xD;
      presence of aymptomatic AF after PVI could potentially affect the management of the&#xD;
      anticoagulation therapy in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The structural and functional changes in the atria after PVI have been described in few&#xD;
      studies. To our knowledge, Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) and neurohormones (NT-pro-BNP and&#xD;
      ANP) have not previously been used in characterising the left atrial function after PVI. New&#xD;
      echocardiographic modalities such as TDI have been introduced in the characterisation of the&#xD;
      left ventricle systolic function in ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure. TDI&#xD;
      has been used for characterising the global and segmental atrial systolic function in healthy&#xD;
      individuals (6), and TDI may be an effective tool for characterising changes in the left&#xD;
      atrial function after PVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurohormones are produced in the left ventricle/atrium, and patients with AF have elevated&#xD;
      levels due to atrial stretch. Cardioversion from AF to sinus rhythm is associated with&#xD;
      normalisation of the BNP/ANP levels (7), and BNP is an independent risk factor of developing&#xD;
      AF in patients with mild congestive heart failure (8). Neurohormones may therefore provide&#xD;
      new information regarding the changes in left atrial function and clinical outcome after PVI&#xD;
      in patients with AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effect of additional cavotricuspid isthmusblock in patients with AF&#xD;
           referred for circumferential pulmonary vein isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the incidence of asymptomatic AF and atrial flutter after ablation by&#xD;
           extensive Holter monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterise left atrial volume and function before and after PVI by&#xD;
           echocardiographic assessment (TDI) and measurements of neurohormones (NT-pro-BNP and&#xD;
           ANP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Among patients with predominant AF, PVI with additional cavotricuspidal isthmusblock is&#xD;
           associated with better outcome, i.e. freedom of symptomatic AF/atrial flutter overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asymptomatic AF and atrial flutter occur frequently after PVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left atrial volume and systolic function correlates to AF recurrence after PVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ANP/NT-pro-BNP levels correlates to AF recurrence after PVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND MATERIALS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, randomised study with 150 patients referred to PVI due to symptomatic&#xD;
      paroxysmal or persistent AF. Patients are randomised to circumferential PVI with (75&#xD;
      patients) or without (75 patients) cavotricuspid isthmusblock in the right atrium. Follow up&#xD;
      period of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty of the included patients (40 with paroxysmal and 40 with persistent AF) undergo&#xD;
      TDI-echocardiography and neurohormonal measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History, physical examination, medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiographic characterisation of left atrial function and volume and left ventricle&#xD;
           systolic and diastolic function (TDI in 80 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NT-pro-BNP/ANP measurements (in 80 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire (SF-36).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circumferential PVI. Patients are randomised to PVI with or without cavotricuspid&#xD;
           isthmusblock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ablation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One quadripolar 5-F catheter (St. Jude Medical) is placed in the right ventricular apex and a&#xD;
      decapolar catheter (Biosense Webster) in the coronary sinus. Transseptal access to the left&#xD;
      atrium is achieved by the use of a SL1 sheath (St. Jude Medical). Three-dimensional maps of&#xD;
      the left atrium are constructed with a quadripolar D-curve mapping catheter (3.5-mm Navistar,&#xD;
      Biosense Webster) with the use of a non-fluoroscopic navigation system (CARTO,&#xD;
      Biosense-Webster). Patients are heparinized using an initial dose of 100 IE/kg with an&#xD;
      additional 1000 IE/hour. Radiofrequency energy is delivered via the 4-mm mapping catheter.&#xD;
      Ablation lines are deployed circumferentially around the pulmonary veins (PV) approximately&#xD;
      0.5 cm from the ostia. After ablation, remapping is performed during sinus rhythm or pacing&#xD;
      from the coronary sinus. In case of AF during ablation, patients are cardioverted to sinus&#xD;
      rhythm before remapping. The criteria of successful ablation is the elimination of potentials&#xD;
      &gt; 0.1 mV within the lesions determined by voltage maps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, the cavotricuspid ishtmusblock is performed with the ablation catheter. The&#xD;
      position of the catheter is established using fluoroscopy or CARTO-mapping. Ishtmusblock is&#xD;
      verified by double potentials during coronary sinus (CS) pacing, an activation detour by&#xD;
      pacing either side of the line, and differential pacing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 hours heart rhythm monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical control after 3,6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 week Holter monitoring after 3, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NT-pro-BNP/ANP measurements after 3 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiography after 3 and 12 months 2D Echocardiography M-mode of the left ventricle&#xD;

           apical 2 chamber view in the left atrium (posterior annular, superior and annular&#xD;
           anterior)&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is calculated on the basis of the following assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A type 1 error and type 2 error of 5 % and 20 %, respectively, are accepted. The statistical&#xD;
      power is 80%. Thirty-five percent of patients with AF had coexisting atrial flutter in a&#xD;
      population who were referred to PVI (3). Patients undergoing CTI due to atrial flutter have&#xD;
      10 % risk of recurrence. During follow-up, 90 % versus 70 % (without CTI) of the patients are&#xD;
      expected to be free of symptoms related to atrial flutter. Based on these parameters, the&#xD;
      sample size is 72 patients included in each group. Overall, 150 patients are included due to&#xD;
      expected loss of patients during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2003, ninety-five patients were treated with PVI in Skejby Hospital which has increased to&#xD;
      150 patients in 2004. The production is expected to increase further during the following&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PhD protocol has been approved by The Faculty of Health Science at the University of&#xD;
      Aarhus and the Local Committee of Ethics in Aarhus. The study was initiated in December 2004&#xD;
      and at he moment 8 patients have been included. The Institute of Clinical Experimental&#xD;
      Research at the University Hospital of Aarhus has donated 6 months salary to Dr. Jacob&#xD;
      Pontoppidan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion period is 12 months. Patients are followed 12 months. Finally, 12 months are&#xD;
      expected for dataprocessing and publications. At least 3 publications in international&#xD;
      peer-reviewed journals are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements of neurohormones are performed by the Department of Clinical Biochemistry&#xD;
      and the biochemical laboratory at the Department of Nephrology, Skejby Hospital. The&#xD;
      echocardiographic analyses including TDI are performed by Dr. Pontoppidan, who is experienced&#xD;
      in this technique. The electrophysiologists in the Department of Cardiology, Skejby&#xD;
      University Hospital of Aarhus, perform the ablation procedures as described above.&#xD;
