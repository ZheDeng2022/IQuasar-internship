    <textblock>
      Study 261A is a dose-ranging and safety study of candesartan cilexetil. It is a&#xD;
      multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group&#xD;
      study with a 4 week treatment period in hypertensive pediatric subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects undergo a screening evaluation, then a 1-week, single-blind, placebo run-in after&#xD;
      which eligible subjects are allocated to receive 1 of 3 dose levels of candesartan cilexetil&#xD;
      or placebo. The study includes 2 panels based on subject weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy analysis is based on the intent-to-treat population and tests for slope&#xD;
      = 0 in a linear regression model with change in sitting systolic blood pressure as the&#xD;
      dependent and non-zero dose pooled across weight panels as the independent variable. For&#xD;
      subjects without a Double-Blind Week 4 blood pressure determination, carrying the last value&#xD;
      forward assigns the value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional analyses will include data pooled from a similar dose ranging study conducted in&#xD;
      children 1 to &lt; 6 years of age.&#xD;
