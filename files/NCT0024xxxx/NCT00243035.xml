  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib when given&#xD;
      together with bortezomib and to see how well they work in treating patients with relapsed&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. Tipifarnib and bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving tipifarnib together with bortezomib may&#xD;
      kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: Primary I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of&#xD;
      tipifarnib when administered with bortezomib in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.&#xD;
      (Phase I) II. Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)&#xD;
      III. Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary I. Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
      (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary I. Determine whether this regimen overcomes CAM-DR in primary myeloma cells and&#xD;
      establish whether ex vivo efficacy predicts a clinical response in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine if activated Akt predicts clinical resistance and if levels of phosphorylated&#xD;
      Akt are reduced by tipifarnib and bortezomib in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine whether molecular profiles from primary isolates (suspension vs adhered)&#xD;
      correlate with clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of tipifarnib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and oral tipifarnib twice&#xD;
      daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6&#xD;
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 6 patients are treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Patients receive bortezomib as in phase I and tipifarnib as in phase I at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 52-64 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
