      This study will train primary care providers to counsel families on behavior change that is&#xD;
      aimed at reducing the rate of weight gain in at-risk children.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to family, school, and community, primary care is a promising setting for&#xD;
      childhood obesity prevention. However, most pediatric primary care providers are not trained&#xD;
      to deliver behavior modification interventions and, according to preliminary data, are less&#xD;
      likely to address obesity prevention when they perceive insufficient time during well-care&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a controlled study of obesity prevention, with group randomization of two&#xD;
      standardized 12-month intervention strategies at the practice level. The intervention&#xD;
      strategies are based on the behavioral economics theory and will be delivered by primary care&#xD;
      providers after training in behavior modification. The first strategy will target change in&#xD;
      multiple behaviors, while the second strategy will target only one behavior (beverage&#xD;
      consumption). These two interventions will be compared to an active control intervention that&#xD;
      is unrelated to weight (bullying prevention). Six to seven primary care practices will be&#xD;
      randomized to each arm with 21 patients per practice, for a total of 17 practices and 350&#xD;
      patients. The primary aim is to demonstrate that either obesity prevention intervention will&#xD;
      result in less body mass index (BMI) increase (adjusted using z-score) in children age 8 to&#xD;
      12 years who are at risk for overweight (BMI 50th-95th percentile), as compared to a control&#xD;
      intervention. The study also hypothesizes that the multiple-behavior intervention, the&#xD;
      single-behavior intervention, or both will result in less adjusted BMI increase than the&#xD;
      control intervention at 24 months post-randomization, with no a priori assumption in&#xD;
      differences between the two obesity prevention strategies. Blood pressure, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, dyslipidemia, and oral health status will be secondary outcomes. Intermediate&#xD;
      behavioral outcomes and process data will be collected.&#xD;
