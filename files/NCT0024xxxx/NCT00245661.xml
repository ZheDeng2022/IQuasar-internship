  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of temazepam during sleep and in daytime&#xD;
      on dyspnea, gas exchange and sleep quality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that temazepam does not produce any adverse respiratory effects&#xD;
      during sleep in patients with COPD. In contrast, it may result in an beneficiary effect&#xD;
      because it positively affects the sleep quality and sleep structure which may result in more&#xD;
      alertness and less daytime sleepiness and less dyspnea during the day.&#xD;

      Rationale: More than 50% of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have&#xD;
      sleep complaints characterised by longer latency to falling asleep, more frequent arousals&#xD;
      and awakenings, generalised insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep disturbance&#xD;
      seems to be more severe with advancing disease and substantially reduces patients' quality of&#xD;
      life. The sleep complaints are due to dyspnea, chronic cough, sputum production, hypoxaemia&#xD;
      and hypercapnia during the night. One of the available therapies for these patients is the&#xD;
      prescription of hypnotics (like benzodiazepines). However, it is thought that in patients&#xD;
      with COPD sleep medication may produce adverse respiratory effects due to suppression of the&#xD;
      cerebral respiratory drive. In our practice, we never encounter any adverse respiratory&#xD;
      effect of an hypnotic in patients with COPD. There have been several trials in COPD patients&#xD;
      studying these potentially adverse effects. The results of these studies are inconsistent,&#xD;
      relative older hypnotics are used and there are several methodological limitations.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in none of these studies transcutaneous PCO2 or PO2 was monitored. Temazepam is&#xD;
      nowadays the sedative of first choice in the medical treatment of sleep complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: primary: studying the effects of temazepam on the respiratory function during daytime&#xD;
      and at night in patients with severe COPD. Secondary: studying the effects of temazepam on&#xD;
      the sleep quality and sleep structure and on the objective and subjective sleepiness during&#xD;
      daytime and at night in patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: double blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over randomised clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: 10 mg temazepam or placebo during seven consecutive nights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Primary: difference in PtcCO2, PtcO2 and oxygen saturation during sleep after 1&#xD;
      week temazepam compared to placebo. Secondary: Respiratory Disturbance Index, Desaturation&#xD;
      Index and Hypercapnic Ventilatory Response, percentage REM/nREM-sleep and total effective&#xD;
      sleep time, Multiple Sleep Latency Test and the Epworth Sleeping Score.&#xD;
