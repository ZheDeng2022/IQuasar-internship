      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research has shown that several human genes have been associated with vulnerability to&#xD;
           substance abuse and dependence. However, little is known about how people with these&#xD;
           genetic tendencies react to drugs in controlled settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methylphenidate, also known as Ritalin, is commonly prescribed for a number of&#xD;
           conditions, including attention deficit disorder. Because methylphenidate is widely used&#xD;
           in studies of brain chemistry and behavior and has relatively low risks associated with&#xD;
           it use, researchers are interested in seeing how it affects the thinking processes of&#xD;
           people with apparent genetic vulnerability to drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate whether individuals with apparent genetic vulnerability to drug abuse react&#xD;
      differently to methylphenidate than people who do not have this vulnerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age or older who have participated in the NIDA protocol&#xD;
      Allelic Linkage in Substance Abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to avoid using a number of over-the-counter medications,&#xD;
           including antihistamines, cough medicines, and nasal decongestants, for 24 hours before&#xD;
           the study day. Participants will also be asked to avoid consuming caffeinated beverages,&#xD;
           nicotine or tobacco products, or alcohol on the morning of the day of the study, and&#xD;
           will provide a urine sample at the start of the study to be tested for chemicals that&#xD;
           may interfere with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because of the nature of the study drug, participants will not be allowed to drive to&#xD;
           the clinical center on the day of the study. (Return transportation will be arranged.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the start of the study, participants will take two tablets (each 1 hour apart), and&#xD;
           will not be told whether the tablets are the study drug or a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will give regular answers to questions about mood and thinking processes on&#xD;
           a computer for approximately 5 hours. Blood samples will be taken during this part of&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;

      Scientific Goals. We and others have now identified several human chromosomal regions that&#xD;
      contain genetic markers that have been associated with vulnerability to substance&#xD;
      abuse/dependence in several different human populations (Uhl et al, 2002). However, little is&#xD;
      known about the biological or behavioral mechanisms by which specific molecular genetic&#xD;
      characteristics enhance risks for drug disorders. This protocol will test hypotheses that&#xD;
      genetically-mediated individual differences in acute responses to abused substances&#xD;
      contribute to the mechanisms through which specific human allelic variants influence&#xD;
      individual differences in vulnerability to drug abuse/dependence. This protocol will&#xD;
      characterize individual differences in responses to oral methylphenidate (30 mg) (also known&#xD;
      as Ritalin). We have chosen this agent due to a) its wide clinical use, b) its moderate to&#xD;
      low risks which are largely well-understood as a result of this widespread use, and c) its&#xD;
      prior usefulness to us and others as a probe for reward system activities in, for example,&#xD;
      patients with dopaminergic brain lesions (Persico et al 1998). We have chosen this dose due&#xD;
      to: a) our prior success with this dose, even in a brain lesioned clinical population&#xD;
      (Persico et al 1998) b) our preliminary work with candidate gene studies in individuals&#xD;
      administered oral doses of up to 60-70 mg (GRU et al, in preparation) c) consultations with&#xD;
      other workers in the field who advise use of this dose and who have used doses of 0.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      intravenously in prior work with few reported adverse events (Volkow et al, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study individuals who are selected based on their genotypes. We will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that individuals who display combinations of the abuse-associated and/or&#xD;
      resistance-associated allelic variants at different genomic loci that we and others have&#xD;
      reproducibly associated with substance abuse (Uhl et al 2002) will differ in their acute&#xD;
      responses to methylphenidate administration. We will also perform exploratory analyses of&#xD;
      these data. We will study the genotypes of individuals who display high- or low-level&#xD;
      responses to oral methylphenidate administration. Both the hypothesis-testing and exploratory&#xD;
      aspects of this study will allow us to identify which addiction-associated human gene&#xD;
      variants can alter subjective and physiologic responses to administration of methylphenidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method. We will study previous participants in study #148 (90-DA-N448) who have already&#xD;
      consented to recontact from NIDA personnel. We will select individuals who are eligible for&#xD;
      study participation based on their genotypes at markers whose alleles differ between drug&#xD;
      abusers (those who report significant lifetime use and dependence on at least one illegal&#xD;
      substance) and controls (individuals free from significant lifetime use of any addictive&#xD;
      substances) as well as allelic variants in genes expressed in reward circuits. Patients will&#xD;
      receive psychiatric and medical screening. Eligible volunteering participants will have a&#xD;
      one-day study session in which they receive oral placebo and oral methylphenidate (30 mg) in&#xD;
      single-blinded fashion. This design was chosen to allow study participation by a larger&#xD;
      fraction of eligible participants than those likely to consent to inpatient stays and longer&#xD;
      designs. Subjective methylphenidate effects, plasma levels of methylphenidate and heart rate&#xD;
      will be assessed periodically before and for 4 hours after the drug is administered.&#xD;
      Methylphenidate was chosen as a probe because: (1) its mechanism of action directly involves&#xD;
      central monoaminergic reward pathways, including dopamine and norepinephrine transporter&#xD;
      inhibition, (2) there is such broad clinical experience with the drug that significant side&#xD;
      effects are well known to be of low frequency in broad populations (3) there are individual&#xD;
      differences in methylphenidate subjective responses documented in several sorts of studies,&#xD;
      including the studies of Parkinsonian patients and controls previously reported from our&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. We advance a two-tailed hypothesis that subjective liking VAS responses to&#xD;
      methylphenidate will be different in those individuals with multiple candidate genetic&#xD;
      characteristics that are related to enhanced vulnerability to substance abuse/dependence&#xD;
      compared to matched controls with few of these genomic characteristics. Confidence will be&#xD;
      greatest for those associations that are consistent among both Caucasian/European American&#xD;
      and African American participants, an internal replication built into this design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits. The results will have important implications for possible mechanisms by which&#xD;
      genetic vulnerability to substance abuse (particularly psychostimulants) is expressed in&#xD;
      humans. The findings will also bear on genetic predictors of the response to methylphenidate,&#xD;
      which may be important for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, narcolepsy and other&#xD;
      clinical disorders in which drugs of this class are used therapeutically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks. Methylphenidate is also known as Ritalin, and is commonly prescribed for a number of&#xD;
      clinical conditions including attention deficit/hyperactivity syndrome. The drug has been&#xD;
      used for many individuals with few serious complications. Individuals who use this drug for&#xD;
      long periods of time may show nervousness and sleep changes. Skin rashes, appetite&#xD;
      suppression, nausea, dizziness, heart palpitations, pulse and heart rhythm changes, headache,&#xD;
      abnormal movements, sleepiness, chest pain, abdominal pain, liver function changes, blood&#xD;
      cell changes and changes in thinking have also been rarely reported in individuals who use&#xD;
      this drug chronically. A review of patients taking a treatment dose of methylphenidate for&#xD;
      ADHD revealed serious cardiovascular adverse events in patients with underlying serious heart&#xD;
      problems or defects, and reports of stroke and heart attack in adults with certain risk&#xD;
      factors, (i.e. untreated high blood pressure and a history of coronary artery disease).&#xD;
      Another review of patients taking a treatment dose of methylphenidate for ADHD revealed a&#xD;
      slight increased risk (about 1 per 1,000) for drug-related psychiatric adverse events, such&#xD;
      as hearing voices, becoming suspicious for no reason, or becoming manic, even in patients who&#xD;
      did not have previous psychiatric problems. Additional modest to minimal risks to&#xD;
      participants include the risks of venous catheterization and blood withdrawal, including&#xD;
      pain, bruising and bleeding, and the risks of confidentiality. We will minimize each of these&#xD;
      more than minimal risks by appropriate exclusionary criteria, medical screening, use of&#xD;
      low/moderate drug doses, evaluation prior to discharge, availability of taxi for return home,&#xD;
      aseptic methods, small total amounts of blood drawn, standard minimal risk recording&#xD;
      procedures, coded, locked data and Confidentiality Certification of this work.&#xD;
