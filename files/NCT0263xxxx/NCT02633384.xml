      Parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis (PNAC) is a common complication of prolonged and&#xD;
      exclusive parenteral nutrition (PN). Infants subjected to major surgery are often unable to&#xD;

      In preterm infants, hepatic immaturity is a predisposing factor. Intravenous lipid emulsions&#xD;
      (ILE) used in PN may promote PNAC or protect against it depending on their composition.&#xD;
      Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) may have a hepatic protective effect. Long chain&#xD;
      triglycerides (LCT) of n-3 family may protect from PNAC. In several new-generation emulsions,&#xD;
      the α-tocopherol content is higher than the gamma-tocopherol content, acting as an&#xD;
      antioxidant, preventing lipid peroxidation.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND. Parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis (PNAC) is a common complication of&#xD;
      prolonged and exclusive parenteral nutrition (PN). PNAC in neonates and infants is&#xD;
      multifactorial, including the underlying pathology and the effect of certain PN nutrients. In&#xD;
      preterm infants, hepatic immaturity is itself, a predisposing factor. Infants subjected to&#xD;
      major surgery are often unable to receive enteral nutrition for a long period of time, during&#xD;
      which they require exclusive PN. After that, enteral nutrition is slowly introduced alongside&#xD;
      with the reduction of the PN. In major surgery for congenital malformations of the digestive&#xD;
      tract, additional risk factors for PNAC are the absence of enteral nutrition, intestinal&#xD;
      bacterial translocation and sepsis. Jejunal atresia and gastroschisis are independent risk&#xD;
      factors for PNAC. In short bowel syndrome, changes in the bile acids enterohepatic cycle may&#xD;
      also contribute to PNAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous lipid emulsions (ILE) used in PN may promote PNAC or protect against it depending&#xD;
      on their composition. Phytosterols contained in ILE have been implicated in PNAC in newborns&#xD;
      by disrupting bile-acid homeostasis. High intakes of soy-based fatty acids (FA) n-6 from ILE,&#xD;
      especially palmitate, may contribute to PNAC since these are precursors of arachidonic acid,&#xD;
      a pro-inflammatory mediator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) may have a hepatic protective effect. Hence, ILE containing&#xD;
      relatively high amounts of MCT, such as Lipofundin® (B. Braun) theoretically might be&#xD;
      advantageous in protecting against PNAC. Long chain triglycerides (LCT) of n-3 family may&#xD;
      protect from PNAC thorough its anti-inflammatory activity. The Omegaven® (Fresenius Kabi),&#xD;
      exclusively based on LCT n-3 has proved to prevent and reverse PNAC in neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several new-generation emulsions, including SMOFlipid® (Fresenius Kabi), the reported&#xD;
      α-tocopherol content is up to 4- to 5-fold higher than the alpha-tocopherol content of&#xD;
      soy-oil emulsions. The α-tocopherol isoform acts as an antioxidant, preventing lipid&#xD;
      peroxidation attributable to the high content of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid&#xD;
      (LC-PUFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ILE Lipofundin® (B Braun), is composed of 50% LCT (soybean oil) and 50% MCT (coconut&#xD;
      oil). The other new generation ILE SMOFlipid® (Fresenius Kabi) is composed of 30% LCT n-6&#xD;
      (soybean oil), 30% MCT (coconut oil), 25% monounsaturated fatty acids (olive oil), 15% LCT&#xD;
      n-3 (fish oil) and α-tocopherol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review found lower bilirubin levels in children with intestinal failure and&#xD;
      other conditions receiving parenteral n-3 ILE compared with n-6 ILE. However, it was&#xD;
      concluded that current data is insufficient to support the use of parenteral n-3 ILE in&#xD;
      children, suggesting further trials examining long-term clinical outcomes and harms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among several studies comparing the effect of different ILEs in PNAC in children, only the&#xD;
      retrospective study by Pischler et al. (2014) compared SMOFlipid® with Lipofundin®. This&#xD;
      study included 127 children aged 0-16 years, including 34 premature infants and 59 children&#xD;
      with surgical conditions, including necrotizing enterocolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until 2011 only Lipofundin® had been used for PN in the the medical-surgical neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit (NICU) of the Hospital Dona Estefânia. The further availability of&#xD;
      SMOFlipid® led the investigators to compare the effect of both ILE on the liver tests&#xD;
      associated with PNAC of neonates subjected to corrective surgery for major congenital&#xD;
      abnormalities, since to the best of our knowledge no prospective study has made this&#xD;
      comparison specifically in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE. To compare the incidence and severity of PNAC in term and near-term infants&#xD;
      subjected to corrective surgery for congenital abnormalities and needing prolonged PN using&#xD;
      the ILE SMOFlipid® or Lipofundin®. The investigators hypothesise that the use of SMOFlipid®&#xD;
      may be more protective from PNAC than Lipofundin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS. Design: single-center, randomized, controlled and double-blinded trial: prescribing&#xD;
      physicians were unaware of the type of ILE administered and the pharmacist who prepared and&#xD;
      randomized the individuals to the interventions was not aware of the liver status of the&#xD;
      participants. Simple randomization was performed by the same pharmacist (MLR) using a&#xD;
      computer generated random number table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Were considered eligible every consecutive neonate admitted in the NICU, with gestational age&#xD;
      of 34 weeks or over, requiring corrective surgery of congenital anomaly of the digestive&#xD;
      tract or indirectly affecting the digestive tract (eg, diaphragmatic hernia). Recruitment&#xD;
      occurred in the first 48 hours after birth, if PN with ILE was initiated within the first 48&#xD;
      hours after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main variables recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly measurement of serum: total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, GGT, alanine&#xD;
           -aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and&#xD;
           triglycerides.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily parenteral lipid intake (g/Kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reasons for reducing or stopping ILE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary variables recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gestational age, birth weight, prenatal diagnosis of congenital abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main and secondary diagnoses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major surgery (date/ day of life)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Events, especially infectious events (date/ day of life)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enteral feeding initiation (date/ day of life)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enteral feeding: type of feeding and mode of administration. The percent of enteral&#xD;
           intake in relation to daily fluid intake was recorded (date/ day of life): 0-50% and&#xD;
           full enteral feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily weight (g)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly length (cm) and head circumference (cm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly or every 2 weeks measurement of serum: total blood count, ionogram, calcium,&#xD;
           phosphorus and magnesium&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential confounders affecting the liver function:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sepsis according to described criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phenobarbital for treatment abstinence syndrome secondary to sedative and analgesic&#xD;
           drugs used during the postsurgical period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of ursodeoxycholic acid&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parenteral nutrition protocol based on the National Consensus for Neonatal PN . Whenever&#xD;
      possible PN with ILE is initiated within the first 24 hours after birth. As the Pharmacy&#xD;
      Service of the Hospital is not available for preparing individualized PN during weekends,&#xD;
      infants admitted during this period have initiated a standard solution containing only&#xD;
      glucose, calcium and aminoacids. Thereafter, all patients receive a similar aminoacid,&#xD;
      glucose, electrolyte and vitamins PN solution plus ILE (SMOFlipid® or Lipofundin®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ILE is reduced to 0.5-1.5g/kg/d if:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertriglyceridemia (&gt; 250 mg / dL) Hyperglycemia (&gt; 150 mg / dL) Unconjugated bilirubin &gt;&#xD;
      12 mg/dL Acute phase of sepsis Pulmonary hypertension If cholestasis appeared, ILE is&#xD;
      restricted to 2-2.5 g/kg/d, the amino acids restricted to 2-2.5 g/kg/d and glucose limited to&#xD;
      12 mg/kg/minute Enteral nutrition protocol is the same in both groups. Minimal enteral&#xD;
      feeding is initiated when bowel sounds are audible, and significant abdominal distention and&#xD;
      bilious or bloody gastric residuals are absent. Initially, feeds are administered&#xD;
      continuously, and changed to bolus feeding as soon as infants can tolerate it. Mother's milk&#xD;
      is preferred. However, depending on the patient's condition semi-elemental (Pepti-Junior®,&#xD;
      Danone) or elemental formula (Neocate®, Nutricia) may be preferred. Later on, these formulas&#xD;
      are replaced with mother's milk as soon as tolerated, or if mother's milk is insufficient or&#xD;
      unavailable, preterm formula (Miltina Prem®, Humana GmbH, Germany) may be used in preterms or&#xD;
      infant formula (Nan 1®, Nestlé) in full-term infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and storage: Excel® calculation table (Microsoft Office 2007®). Statistical&#xD;
      analysis with the support of the Research Unit of Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Central.&#xD;
      Categorical data were presented as frequencies (percentages), and continuous variables as&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and inter-quartile range (25th percentile-75th&#xD;
      percentile), as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed effects regression models were used to take into account the correlation structure&#xD;
      between measures in time. Crude and adjusted odds-ratios with corresponding 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of significance was α = 0.05. Data analysis was performed using the software SPSS&#xD;
      22.0 (SPSS for Windows, Rel. 22.0.1. 2013. SPSS Inc., Chicago, Il, EUA) and Stata (StataCorp.&#xD;
      2013. Stata Statistical Software: Release 13. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of outcome: Cholestasis and cholestasis severity incidence rates and associated 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals will be accessed for each intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholestasis and severe cholestasis incidence rates will be compared by calculating relative&#xD;
      risks and the Number Needed to Harm (NNH) in association with their 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative efficacy measures (hazard ratios) and possibly odds ratios will be used if group&#xD;
      homogeneity is found.&#xD;
