      The aim of this study is to evaluate cerebral asymmetry for face processing in a group of&#xD;
      profoundly deaf participants and a group of hearing controls by the mean of fMRI measure. To&#xD;
      this end, we present chimeric faces (faces split into different halves), entire faces, or&#xD;
      faces presented in divided visual field, and subjects perform a gender categorization task&#xD;
      while lying in a fMRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected to find a reduced cerebral asymmetry in the Fusiform Face Area in deaf in&#xD;
      comparison with hearing participants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A rightward asymmetry during face processing is well documented in hearing participants, in&#xD;
      particular in the Fusiform Face Area, a cortical area underlying face processing. This&#xD;
      rightward asymmetry seems to be very robust, present even with inverted faces or line&#xD;
      drawings, and is already present at five years of age. If the brain asymmetry for face&#xD;
      processing emerges during development, early deprivation or dramatic differences the infant's&#xD;
      experience with the world should affect it. For example, infants treated for bilateral&#xD;
      congenital cataracts after 7 weeks of age, who are deprived of patterned visual input for&#xD;
      this duration, fail to develop some of the aspects associated with typical adult levels of&#xD;
      face recognition. Non visual early deprivation can also affect the development of visual&#xD;
      abilities. Several studies showed that deaf participants could detect targets at larger&#xD;
      eccentricities, thus indicating larger visual field . Furthermore, better abilities have been&#xD;
      found in deaf participants for the detection of motion, in particular in the visual periphery&#xD;
      . Higher-level visual abilities have also been shown to be modified by early deafness, such&#xD;
      as visual imagery (image generation, or rotation) or the processing of faces . Using the&#xD;
      Benton Test of Facial Recognition, a previous study tested the recognition of individual&#xD;
      faces in deaf participants. They obtained better scores than hearing non signers, but only in&#xD;
      a difficult condition, in which faces were shadowed. This enhanced processing in deaf people&#xD;
      could thus concern very particular aspects of face processing; it was found that deaf and&#xD;
      normal hearing differed only by the detection of subtle facial features. Investigating&#xD;
      configural processing during face perception, it was found an increased dependency on this&#xD;
      mode of processing in deaf participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If visual processing is affected by early deafness, what about visual asymmetries? Several&#xD;
      experimental studies examining hemispheric asymmetry in congenitally deaf individuals found&#xD;
      that it differs from the one observed in hearing individuals . Concerning face processing,&#xD;
      few studies investigated hemispheric lateralization during the perception of faces in deaf&#xD;
      people. When presenting briefly unfamiliar faces in either the left or right visual field and&#xD;
      no differences between deaf and hearing participants were found. In a previous experiment,&#xD;
      using chimeric faces (faces vertically split into two different parts, ie half male, half&#xD;
      female) it was found a reduction of leftward asymmetry for face processing in deaf&#xD;
      participants during a gender categorization task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to broaden the knowledge about asymmetry for face processing&#xD;
      in deaf people, by evaluating if this reduction of asymmetry observed at the behavioral level&#xD;
      results from a reduction of cerebral asymmetry at the level of Fusiform Face Area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deaf participants and normal hearing controls will be presented face stimuli, composed of&#xD;
      either chimeric male/female and female/male faces, entire faces or entire face presented in&#xD;
      divided visual field, to investigate Fusiform Face Area asymmetry in these two groups.&#xD;
      Participants will lie in an fMRI scanner, and their cerebral activity will be recorded while&#xD;
      they perform a gender categorization task on our face stimuli.&#xD;
