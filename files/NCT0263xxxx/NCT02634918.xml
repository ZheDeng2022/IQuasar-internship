    <textblock>
      Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder (deficiency of a blood clotting factor/ protein) resulting&#xD;
      in bleeding in joints and muscles. As patients continue to bleed into their joints they&#xD;
      develop progressive joint damage leading to joint contractures, disability and days missed&#xD;
      from work and school resulting in chronic debilitating pain and compromised quality of life.&#xD;
      Current therapy is the administration of the missing protein or factor concentrate on a&#xD;
      scheduled basis to prevent bleeding into the joints referred to as prophylaxis. This factor&#xD;
      concentrate is expensive ~ $ 3,000 - 6,000 per infusion/ week in a child weighing 20 kg&#xD;
      translating into $ 77,000 /yr for life. This regimen has been shown to be effective to&#xD;
      prevent joint bleeds but the timing is unclear and not based on adequate evidence. Currently&#xD;
      joint damage is diagnosed using MRI which is expensive and requires sedation in children &lt; 6&#xD;
      yrs of age. Therefore there is a need for a user friendly tool such as a ultrasound to&#xD;
      monitor for the development of joint disease and tailor treatment based on an individual&#xD;
      child's needs. This would also enable differentiating a joint bleed from a soft tissue bleed&#xD;
      which present similarly and duration of treatment tends to be longer for a joint bleed.&#xD;
      Acharya et al have previously shown that ultrasound is comparable to MRI for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      hemophilic joint disease in hemophilia patients over the age of 6 years. However, the&#xD;
      diagnostic findings in children &lt; 18 years with hemophilia on ultrasound is not well&#xD;
      defined(1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hemophilic synovium after repeated joint bleeds reveals the development of new vessels&#xD;
      which are fragile and contribute to recurrent joint bleeds. Acharya et al have previously&#xD;
      shown that angiogenesis, a process of new vessel formation is active in hemophilic synovium&#xD;
      and angiogenic markers were significantly elevated in hemophilic patients with joint disease&#xD;
      when compared to those without (2). Since ultrasound can detect these new vessel changes in&#xD;
      the hemophilic synovium in hemophilia patients with joint disease and hemophilia patients&#xD;
      with joint disease demonstrate elevated markers of new vessel formation these investigators&#xD;
      would now like to determine whether radiological findings of hemophilic joint disease&#xD;
      correlate with serological angiogenic markers. This may enable the development of biomarkers&#xD;
      for hemophilic joint disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from this study will enable the development of ultrasound as a user friendly tool in&#xD;
      the hemophilia clinic in order to understand whether every pain and swelling in a joint is&#xD;
      actually a joint bleed or soft tissue bleed and to monitor for joint changes to institute or&#xD;
      augment scheduled factor infusions ( prophylaxis). This will also result in significant&#xD;
      improvement in quality of life with tailored prophylaxis .&#xD;

      Background: Hemophilic joint disease secondary to recurrent hemarthroses is one of the most&#xD;
      disabling and costly complications of hemophilia. Prior to widespread use of prophylactic&#xD;
      factor concentrates, children in the United States with severe hemophilia A and B (X-linked&#xD;
      recessive disorders with &lt;1% factor VIII/IX (FVIII/FIX) activity) experienced an average of&#xD;
      30-35 hemarthroses per year reported for FVIII deficiency (3,4 ). Clinical and sub clinical&#xD;
      hemarthroses during childhood results in synovitis (hypertrophied synovium characterized by&#xD;
      villous formation, markedly increased vascularity and chronic inflammatory cells (5)&#xD;
      eventually leading to pannus formation and destructive arthritis (6, 7). At this time,&#xD;
      synovial bleeding may be related not only to clotting factor deficiency but also to&#xD;
      pre-existing vascular damage and inflammation, which is difficult to control clinically. Use&#xD;
      of factor concentrate prophylaxis results in hemophilia patients experiencing fewer joint&#xD;
      bleeds, less rapid deterioration of joint function and fewer days lost from school or work.&#xD;
      However, it may be complicated by the unpredictable development of an inhibitor (a&#xD;
      high-affinity, polyclonal, function-neutralizing antibody directed against FVIII/FIX), with&#xD;
      an incidence of about 25% and 6% respectively (8) . These individuals have limited treatment&#xD;
      options or are treated with products that are less efficacious in treating the joint bleed&#xD;
      along with potential deleterious side effects such as thrombogenecity( 9) thus favoring joint&#xD;
      disease development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary prophylaxis (infusion of FVIII concentrates (25 - 40 u/kg thrice weekly or FIX&#xD;
      concentrates - 80-100u/kg twice a week starting at age 1-2 yrs) before the onset of joint&#xD;
      bleeds is used in Sweden since the 1960s to keep the trough level of factor VIII/FIX &gt; 1%,&#xD;
      converting a severe hemophilia patient (FVIII/FIX activity &lt;1%) into a milder form (FVIII/FIX&#xD;
      &gt;5%) (10 ) . This strategy is expensive (~ $77,760/year for a 20 kg child based on the use of&#xD;
      3000 to 6,000 u/kg/yr with recombinant factor VIII), and may require the use of venous access&#xD;
      devices in young children, which is complicated by severe infections, bleeding and thrombosis&#xD;
      (11) . Secondary prophylaxis on the other hand, which involves the use of FVIII/FIX&#xD;
      concentrates after &quot;target joints&quot; (at least four bleeds occurring into a single joint in the&#xD;
      previous six months) have been identified may limit bleeding and subsequent joint damage.&#xD;
      However, progression of existing joint disease continues and it is unclear whether secondary&#xD;
      prophylaxis can actually prevent joint deterioration (12) . Furthermore, studies comparing&#xD;
      primary and secondary prophylaxis in relation to cost-effectiveness and long-term joint&#xD;
      morbidity suggest that primary prophylaxis improved long-term joint outcome but was twice as&#xD;
      expensive (13 ) . For these reasons, the optimum age, subject population, and timing of&#xD;
      prophylaxis is highly debated. Finally, therapeutic options for individuals who fail or&#xD;
      cannot use prophylaxis (inhibitor patients) or refuse prophylaxis include isotopic (IS) and&#xD;
      surgical synovectomy. Isotopic synovectomy involves intraarticular injection of 32P- colloid&#xD;
      with the intent of scarring off the synovium leading to a subsequent reduction in&#xD;
      hemarthroses (14) , both procedures being recommended for patients with chronic synovitis and&#xD;
      ongoing hemarthroses. Again, the timing of these strategies in relation to the onset of&#xD;
      synovitis remain unclear. Hence, if prophylaxis is not started early (before the occurrence&#xD;
      of joint bleeds) and subject population is not optimized, a strategy to detect and monitor&#xD;
      synovitis and joint arthropathy is urgently needed so that prophylaxis and synovectomy can be&#xD;
      timed based on evidence to reap optimum benefits. Furthermore, in hemophilic children who&#xD;
      complain of joint pains, clinical examination sometimes, may not clearly define whether the&#xD;
      symptoms are related to a joint bleed, synovitis or surrounding soft tissue bleeds. Studies&#xD;
      in animals suggest that cartilage damage can occur concurrently with synovial damage (15)&#xD;
      contributing to joint arthropathy. Therefore, it seems that determination of both synovial&#xD;
      and cartilage changes would be imperative and may help to guide prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, hemophilic arthropathy has been diagnosed by clinical examination and plain&#xD;
      radiographs of joints, which together tend to underestimate the extent of joint destruction&#xD;
      (16) . Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can estimate the degree of bony damage associated&#xD;
      with hemophilic joint disease (14 , 17 -19). The investigators have previously shown the&#xD;
      utility of ultrasound-power Doppler sonography( USG-PDS) in detecting synovitis associated&#xD;
      with hemophilic joint disease when compared to MRI ( 1) . The need for sedation in children&#xD;
      and high costs ($ 2500 for MRI with sedation versus $ 600 for USG- PDS - no sedation at this&#xD;
      institution) override the utility of this tool when repeated studies may be required for&#xD;
      closer surveillance of joint disease progression. Visualization of cartilage is clinically&#xD;
      relevant because benefits of both prophylaxis and synovectomy are realized only if there is&#xD;
      minimal damage to cartilage. Furthermore, there is scattered evidence to suggest that&#xD;
      isotopic synovectomy in a joint affected by bony arthropathy can lead to progression of the&#xD;
      arthropathy leading to crippling arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of HJD is not well defined. Neoangiogenesis is a critical factor in&#xD;
      processes, such as tumor growth and inflammatory arthritis (20). Increased vascularity and&#xD;
      neoangiogenesis have been implicated in the progression of musculoskeletal disorders and&#xD;
      tumor growth. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the principal signaling molecule in&#xD;
      angiogenesis, can be induced by hypoxia and certain cytokines through interaction with its&#xD;
      receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 (21 -23). The synovitic pannus in other joint diseases that&#xD;
      share histologic similarities with hemophilic joint disease (HJD) have enhanced oxygen demand&#xD;
      and show evidence of de novo blood vessel formation, including endothelialization of the&#xD;
      synovium( 24) . Further, VEGF expression in the serum has been correlated with disease&#xD;
      activity in rheumatoid arthritis ( 25) . Endothelialization may occur as a result of mature&#xD;
      endothelial cell migration or through the recruitment of bone marrow (BM)-derived endothelial&#xD;
      progenitor cells (EPCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) from the peripheral&#xD;
      circulation (26) . Importantly, proliferating synovium can secrete chemocytokines, such as&#xD;
      VEGF, that might promote recruitment of endothelial cells (ECs) to sites of active&#xD;
      angiogenesis ( 25) . Co-localization of hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF-1 α) which is a&#xD;
      transcription factor involved in the induction of VEGF and produced in response to hypoxia&#xD;
      within the joint and VEGF emphasizes the role of hypoxia in the up-regulation of angiogenesis&#xD;
      in rheumatoid joint diseases ( 27).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously observed a 4-fold elevation in proangiogenic factors&#xD;
      (vascular endothelial growth factor-A [VEGF-A], stromal cell-derived factor-1, and matrix&#xD;
      metalloprotease-9) and proangiogenic macrophage/monocyte cells (VEGF+/CD68+ and VEGFR1+/CD11b&#xD;
      +) in the synovium and peripheral blood of hemophilic joint disease (HJD) subjects along with&#xD;
      significantly increased numbers of VEGFR2+/AC133 + endothelial progenitor cells and CD34+/&#xD;
      VEGFR1+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. Sera from HJD subjects induced an angiogenic response&#xD;
      in endothelial cells that was abrogated by blocking VEGF, whereas peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells from HJD subjects stimulated synovial cell proliferation, which was blocked&#xD;
      by a humanized anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizumab). Human synovial cells, when incubated with&#xD;
      HJD sera, could elicit up-regulation of HIF-1α mRNA with HIF-1α expression in the synovium of&#xD;
      HJD subjects, implicating hypoxia in the neoangiogenesis process. The investigators results&#xD;
      provided evidence of local and systemic angiogenic response in hemophilic subjects with&#xD;
      recurrent hemarthroses suggesting a potential to develop surrogate biologic markers to&#xD;
      identify the onset and progression of hemophilic synovitis( 2). Therefore, evidence of&#xD;
      increased synovial vascularity on USG-PDS and elevated angiogenic markers suggestive of&#xD;
      increased vascularity in hemophilic joint disease subjects provides a compelling opportunity&#xD;
      to develop surrogate biological markers for hemophilic joint disease. This would also further&#xD;
      aid in tailoring strategies such as prophylaxis and synovectomy in an individual patient.&#xD;
