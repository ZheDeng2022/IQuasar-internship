    <textblock>
      Two-part phase 1B clinical trial combining cextuximab and savolitinib for treating Ras&#xD;
      wild-type colorectal cancer (CRC). Part 1 will assess the safety and tolerability of this&#xD;
      drug combination and will include patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck&#xD;
      cancer, as well as patients with CRC. Part 2 of the study, the focus of this registration,&#xD;
      will obtain further safety data for the combination of cextuximab and savolitinib and will&#xD;
      look at the efficacy of cextuximab and savolitinib in Ras wild-type mCRC that was previously&#xD;
      treated and relapsed on cetuximab or panitumumab.Correlative studies will examine tumor and&#xD;
      blood specimens for mechanisms of anti-EGFR resistance and response to MET inhibition.&#xD;
