    <textblock>
      Direct laryngoscopy and intubation is an essential initial aspect of airway access during&#xD;
      general anesthesia. To perform the procedure effectively, it requires adequate mouth opening,&#xD;
      head and neck movement, and a normal temporo-mandibular joint mobility. Any issue with the&#xD;
      above three results in a compromised upper airway at the outset and the condition is known as&#xD;
      anticipated difficult airway, i.e. an airway that is difficult to access with conventional&#xD;
      laryngoscopy and intubation methods. To overcome the difficulty, either one has to resort to&#xD;
      newer advanced technique and equipment or the available conventional technique needs to be&#xD;
      refined and modified to suit the requirement. While the former requires extraordinary&#xD;
      expertise and finances, an option difficult to achieve in developing countries; the latter&#xD;
      warrants focused interest to develop alternative approach with the same set of equipments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since submucous fibrosis and the associated restricted mouth opening have taken the&#xD;
      proposition of an epidemic owing to widespread use of betel nut and tobacco; these patients,&#xD;
      when requiring surgery, are difficult candidates for GA and airway control. The fact that,&#xD;
      when they arrive as pre-surgical candidates, they have variable degree of mouth opening&#xD;
      restriction, which if approached with a strategy, may be amenable to conventional control of&#xD;
      airway. If investigators paint all the patients with mouth restriction as difficult airway,&#xD;
      it will result in uncalled surgical, economic, health system and psychological burden.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is prudent to undertake research relating to refinement of airway access&#xD;
      techniques with the easily available, cheap and user- friendly equipment (conventional&#xD;
      laryngoscope), such that a proportion of above stated burden can be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the above, investigators plan to undertake a study to enhance our working&#xD;
      knowledge with a conventional laryngoscope (Macintosh) to facilitate ways to control the&#xD;
      airway difficulty secondary to mouth opening restriction. Investigators believe that the&#xD;
      prospective knowledge thus generated would help us identify whether there is a feasibility of&#xD;
      conventional airway management or an alternative advanced access technique is needed in the&#xD;
      first place. This will prevent undue cancellations, delayed surgeries, and patient morbidity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper airway access is one of the essential components of general anaesthesia, and more often&#xD;
      than not, it is gained by direct laryngoscopy followed by tracheal intubation. While direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy depends on laryngoscope blade design and the anesthetists' skill set, the ease&#xD;
      of tracheal intubation is influenced by the line-of-view to the glottis gained by the&#xD;
      laryngoscopy maneuver. In patients with normal mouth opening (â‰¥4.0 cm), the act of&#xD;
      conventional airway access is not difficult given that the neck extension and the TMJ joint&#xD;
      mobility is within normal limits. Conversely, it becomes difficult in patients who have mouth&#xD;
      opening restriction, and hence they are adjudicated as 'anticipated difficult airway' (ADA).&#xD;
      The ADA, attracts several issues that, not uncommonly, converges on to time inefficiency,&#xD;
      heightened equipment cost, operator anxiety, and unfortunately, patient morbidity. There are&#xD;
      many causes of restricted mouth opening, defined technically as reduced inter-incisor&#xD;
      distance (IID) including trauma, TMJ movement limitation, intra/extra-oral pathology&#xD;
      resulting in pain, or the most common pathology in the Indian subcontinent, oral submucosal&#xD;
      fibrosis (SMF). While the pathology itself is a forerunner of oral mitosis, it is the&#xD;
      associated restricted mouth opening component that put conventional airway access efforts of&#xD;
      the anaesthesiologist in spot, and consequently, a whole, sometimes unnecessary rigmarole has&#xD;
      to be activated under the heading of 'advanced approach to ADA'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral submucous fibrosis (SMF) is a well-recognized, potentially malignant progressive&#xD;
      condition afflicting the oral cavity that is characterised by a reduced mouth opening. The&#xD;
      reduction in mouth opening occurs due a vertical reorientation of collagen fibrils that are&#xD;
      normally haphazardly arranged. Of the currently available multiple classifications to&#xD;
      identify disease stage/severity, the functional classification based on the inter-incisor&#xD;
      distance (IID) seems to be most relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IID forms an important component of airway examination and a value of less than 3-cm is&#xD;
      suggestive of difficulty in airway management. However, despite the above, SMF is largely&#xD;
      unrecognized as a cause of airway difficulty, and even when recognized, no set protocol is&#xD;
      available to ensure (as far as possible) a favourable outcome in terms of least morbidity to&#xD;
      the patient, and stress to the anaesthesiology team in question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need Assessment for the Study Generally, in a tertiary level centre, with all facilities at&#xD;
      hand, cases with a reduced IID are normally tackled using a fiberoptic bronchoscope guided&#xD;
      tracheal intubation. However, in India, the burden of this disease lies to a great extent in&#xD;
      rural/suburban settings where access to a fiberoptic bronchoscope is unlikely. As a result&#xD;
      these cases are referred to 'higher' centres for management. This imposes undue burden&#xD;
      (logistics/ financial) onto patients and their families. Hence, there is a great need for&#xD;
      anaesthesiologists working at the primary/secondary level healthcare set up to get oriented&#xD;
      to this problem and be able to manage it with conventional options (direct laryngoscopy &amp;&#xD;
      intubation) available to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Contention Direct laryngoscopy remains the foremost among the various techniques&#xD;
      available to access the upper airway and the Macintosh blade has been the most preferred&#xD;
      blade type. In order to improve direct laryngoscopy, many modifications of blade design have&#xD;
      been tested/ compared with the Macintosh blade, but apparently, the clarity as to which&#xD;
      laryngoscope blade is most suited for a given airway remains low. For the majority of&#xD;
      practicing anaesthesiologists, the availability of different laryngoscope designs has only&#xD;
      increased the hit-and-trial option for laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the time it was first introduced, the Macintosh blade (size 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) has&#xD;
      weathered many newer laryngoscope blade designs and stood by our side with consistent/optimal&#xD;
      performance. Per se, from a technical standpoint, although shaped the same, various sizes of&#xD;
      the Macintosh blade are not exactly similar, the discrepancy becomes obvious when comparing&#xD;
      sizes 1, 2 with 3 &amp; 4. Unfortunately, investigators are still unclear as to how design&#xD;
      characteristics and the various sizes of the Macintosh blade impact the process of direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy. Generally, the selection of laryngoscope blade (type and sizes) is largely a&#xD;
      function of individual experience and preferences. The absence of predefined parameters for&#xD;
      the selection of the most appropriate laryngoscope blade for a given airway remains&#xD;
      arbitrary. Apparently, an anaesthesiologist will be able to intubate an adult trachea with&#xD;
      any of the laryngoscope blade, however, blade type and size selection assumes significance in&#xD;
      the presence of a difficult airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three factors which influence successful direct laryngoscopy performance are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) The ability to place the laryngoscope blade tip in vallecular recess and engage the hyoid&#xD;
      bone. This requires an adequate length of the blade to be introduced orally to reach the&#xD;
      vallecula (transition space between base of the tongue and the epiglottis) position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) The ability to displace the tongue aside for clear view to the glottic-epiglottic region&#xD;
      iii) Achieving a clear line-of-sight to the glottis-opening. To ensure that the tip of the&#xD;
      laryngoscope blade engages the hyoid by placement in the vallecula, an adequate blade length&#xD;
      must be inserted into the oral cavity. Normally, this is easily achieved. However, when faced&#xD;
      with a situation involving reduced mouth opening/inter-incisor distance (e.g.as in case of&#xD;
      SMF), the length of blade that can be inserted into the oral cavity (functional length)&#xD;
      becomes a function of the width of the blade's flange at the incisor point. Thus the size of&#xD;
      the flange, corresponding to the width of the blade that must be accommodated in the oral&#xD;
      cavity assumes particular significance in patients with reduced inter-incisor gap. Typically,&#xD;
      for the Macintosh blade's curved design confers different length to its flange's glossal&#xD;
      (concave) and the palatal (convex) surface, the functional width of its flange increases from&#xD;
      the tip towards the heel [Figure]. Based on the degree of mouth opening restriction and the&#xD;
      available IID (in cm), during preoperative evaluation, one can predict and plan how long a&#xD;
      Macintosh blade length will be required and what size of the blade would suffice to be placed&#xD;
      orally through the available IID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Development Marks et al, utilized an x-ray based method to devise a method to&#xD;
      evaluate laryngoscope blade design during active laryngoscopy procedure. Technically, they&#xD;
      found that Macintosh sizes 3 and 4 have a more refined blade design that provides greater&#xD;
      degree of forward space enhancement (FSE, allows greater mandibular space for the tongue to&#xD;
      be moved into) than other conventional blades (Miller, Soper, etc.). This FSE-effect gets&#xD;
      further magnified with increase in functional length of the blade (the length of the blade&#xD;
      inside the oral cavity during active laryngoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their elaborate work addressed the performance of the laryngoscope blade (size, type)&#xD;
      selection in a theoretical setting. The information gleaned from their assessment offered&#xD;
      valuable suggestions on optimal blade position during direct laryngoscopy and included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Mandibular space 'encroachment/enhancement' with the use of different blade types/sizes,&#xD;
      and ii) 'Line-of-vision' (view to the glottis) versus 'mandibular space restriction' (space&#xD;
      for tongue displacement during laryngoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, still, the clinical feasibility of knowledge thus gained from performance assessment&#xD;
      facilitated by x-ray/fluoroscopy is difficult to translate into routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the investigator prepares to take the conventional direct laryngoscopy process into&#xD;
      difficult airway situations where the primary difficulty is due to reduced mouth opening,&#xD;
      there is a need to convert theoretical knowledge into clinical suggestions. Investigators&#xD;
      thus contend that unless they get accustomed with greater clarity on the use of routine&#xD;
      equipments, and analyse their practical feasibility in difficult situations, the element of&#xD;
      randomness and subjectivity will continue to be a setback.&#xD;
