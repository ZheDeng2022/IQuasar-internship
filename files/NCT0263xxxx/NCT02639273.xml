  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs like nalmefene interfere with opioid receptors. This might reduce drinking. The gene&#xD;
      OPRM1 determines opioid receptor functions. Researchers want to see if nalmefene affects&#xD;
      people s responses to alcohol cues. They also want to compare how nalmefene affects people&#xD;
      with different forms of OPRM1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test nalmefene s effects on alcohol self-infusion and responses to alcohol cues. To test&#xD;
      the role of different forms of OPRM1 on these effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy heavy drinkers ages 21 60:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women: over 15 drinks weekly&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men: over 20 drinks weekly&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart, blood, and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have three 10-hour visits and one 2-hour follow-up visit. They will take a&#xD;
      taxi. Visits are about 1 week apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before visits, participants cannot drink alcohol for 1 day or take medicine for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study visits:&#xD;

      Heart monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-hour alcohol session: A needle guides a thin plastic tube into a vein in each arm. One&#xD;
      tube receives alcohol. The other draws blood. Participants give themselves alcohol by&#xD;
      pressing a button on a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relaxing at the center until breath alcohol falls below 0.02 percent, or for 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2 and 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swallowing nalmefene or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-hour brain MRI: Participants lie on a table with a coil on their head. They press buttons&#xD;
      in response to computer cues.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that the opioid receptor modulator nalmefene can reduce heavy&#xD;
      drinking among alcoholics. Genetic variation at the micro-opioid receptor gene locus, OPRM1,&#xD;
      specifically the A118G polymorphism, is associated with differential subjective responses to&#xD;
      alcohol. Further, the A118G polymorphism has been shown to moderate the effect of opioid&#xD;
      receptor modulators on alcohol consumption. However, the role of A118G on nalmefene s&#xD;
      effectivenes, and the neural substrates underlying nalmefene s therapeutic effect remain to&#xD;
      be explored in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the effect of nalmefene on alcohol self-infusion and neural response&#xD;
      to alcohol cues in healthy male and female heavy drinkers, and to examine the role of the&#xD;
      OPRM1 A118G polymorphism on this effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Participants will be 21-60 year-old male and female heavy drinkers in good&#xD;
      health, as determined by medical history, physical exam, and ECG and lab tests. Participants&#xD;
      with current Axis-I mood, anxiety or substance use diagnoses, except alcohol dependence, will&#xD;
      be excluded. Participants will be divided into 2 genotypic groups: Group 1 (AA) will include&#xD;
      participants homozygous for the major 118A allele (118AA genotype), and group 2 (GX) will&#xD;
      include participants carrying 1 or 2 copies of the variant 118G allele (118AG or 118GG&#xD;
      genotype).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Participants will undergo 3 study sessions. In the first session, participants will&#xD;
      complete an intravenous alcohol self-administration (IV-ASA) where they will have an open bar&#xD;
      phase to determine their baseline level of alcohol consumption in the laboratory, as well as&#xD;
      to obtain data on tolerability and subjective measures of alcohol effects. In the second and&#xD;
      third sessions, participants will receive a single dose of either nalmefene or placebo, in&#xD;
      counter-balanced order, before completing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans&#xD;
      and IV-ASA procedures. The fMRI scans will include a task where participants will see cues&#xD;
      that indicate the possibility of earning alcohol rewards to examine the neural substrates&#xD;
      involved in processing alcohol cues, and a task designed to measure neural responses during&#xD;
      anticipation and processing of aversive events. The difference in alcohol self-infusions&#xD;
      between the two sessions will be compared between the two genotypic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measures are: (1) nalmefene-induced changes in IV&#xD;
      alcohol self-administration; (2) nalmefene-induced BOLD signal changes in neural regions&#xD;
      associated with alcohol reward processing, including ventral striatum, amygdala, and&#xD;
      insula.;Secondary outcome measures include: (1) Nalmefene-induced BOLD signal changes in&#xD;
      neural processing of aversive stimuli during fMRI; (2) Genotypic modulation (at the OPRM1 118&#xD;
      location) of nalmefene s effects on primary outcome measures (BOLD signal change during&#xD;
      alcohol reward processing and IV alcohol self-administration).&#xD;
