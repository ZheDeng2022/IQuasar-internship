      SUMMARY Rationale: Worldwide, cigarette smoking carries a high mortality. Since the available&#xD;
      cessation programs are not effective for all smokers, new strategies are necessary for&#xD;
      tobacco control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To investigate whether a 6-week varenicline preloading facilitates smoking&#xD;
      reduction and cessation compared with the standard varenicline treatment schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Parallel group, double-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial. Participants:&#xD;
      Smokers of both sexes from the general population. Methods: Participants will be randomized&#xD;
      into two groups of treatment. Subjects in Group A will receive varenicline for six weeks&#xD;
      while those in group B will receive placebo for 5 weeks and varenicline for 1 week. During&#xD;
      this phase, subjects in both groups will be asked to reduce cigarette smoking by 50 percent.&#xD;
      At week 6 all participants will be instructed to stop smoking before receiving 12 weeks of&#xD;
      varenicline treatment. Visits will be arranged at randomization, week 4, week 6 (Quit day&#xD;
      (QD)) and at week 1, 6, 12, and 24 after QD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: These will include vital signs, smoking history, spirometry, expired CO,&#xD;
      salivary cotinine, nicotine dependence, and withdrawal symptoms. Primary outcome is&#xD;
      continuous abstinence at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: For an estimated difference of quit rates of 15% at 24 weeks (30% for group A&#xD;
      vs. 15% for group B) 121 subjects per group are needed (Total = 242 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: T tests (rational variables) and x2 test or Fisher's exact test&#xD;
      (nominal variables) will be used as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits: This study might contribute to optimize the current use of varenicline.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a parallel group, double-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial. Allocation&#xD;
      to treatment will be made when the subject has been entered into the study that is when&#xD;
      he/she has fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria (see below). Visits will be arranged at&#xD;
      inclusion, at week 4 and 6 (Quit day (QD)) after inclusion, and at week 1, 6, 12, and 24&#xD;
      after QD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be eligible smokers from throughout Jerusalem, who want to reduce then stop&#xD;
      smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be computer-randomised either to an extended varenicline preload treatment or&#xD;
      to a regular varenicline schedule. Both groups will receive an identical treatment&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding is possible only during the varenicline&#xD;
      preload phase. During this phase, both the study team members and the participants will be&#xD;
      blinded to treatment allocation. After week 6 all participants will be receiving the same,&#xD;
      active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrolment the subjects will be randomized to receive either varenicline preloading for&#xD;
      6 weeks (1 mg/day at week 1; 2 mg/day from week 2-6) (Group A) or placebo for 5 weeks and&#xD;
      varenicline for 1 week (Group B). Then, subjects in both groups will receive regular&#xD;
      treatment with varenicline for 12 weeks according to a schedule depicted on Table 2. Only&#xD;
      minimal levels of advice and support will be given. However, all subjects will receive&#xD;
      individualized verbal instructions regarding the general conduct of the study and the proper&#xD;
      use of the study medication. All participants will be asked to reduce smoking by 50 percent&#xD;
      during 6 weeks after inclusion then stop smoking altogether.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline the following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic assessment (age, sex, height and weight). Subjects will be weighed during&#xD;
           all scheduled visits on the same scale throughout the study: prior to weighing, subjects&#xD;
           will remove shoes and excess clothes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Vital signs (pulse, blood-pressure) will be assessed in the standard manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Spirometry: This will be carried out at baseline and end-study using an electronic&#xD;
           spirometer and techniques currently performed at the Pulmonary Institute, Shaare Zedek&#xD;
           Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Smoking history and other smoking related information using the modified Cigarette&#xD;
           Evaluation Questionnaire (mCEQ) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Nicotine dependence evaluation using the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND)&#xD;
           .&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. CO in expired air. Expired carbon monoxide levels will be measured with a Bedfont&#xD;
           monitor and recorded at each scheduled study visit. The subjects will be instructed to&#xD;
           inhale deeply, do a 15 second breath hold, and produce a full, slow forced expiration&#xD;
           through the disposable mouthpiece of the inflow valve of the monitor. Readings will be&#xD;
           recorded in parts per million (ppm) of CO (non smokers = &lt; 8 ppm ; smokers = &gt; 10 to 75&#xD;
           ppm) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Withdrawal symptoms: Will be measured using the Mood Symptoms Physical Scale (MPPS) (See&#xD;
           Appendix) .&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Salive Cotinine determinations: This will be carried out at 3 visits namely baseline&#xD;
           visit, week 6 and end-trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Concomitant medication: Information about currently used medication will be collected&#xD;

    <measure>Continuous abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>from week 7 until week 24</time_frame>
    <description>defined as avoidance of tobacco (not a single puff) since the quit date. It will be assessed by self-reported complete abstinence and expired CO &lt; 10 ppm from week 7 until endpoint. The occurrence of occasional lapses after week 7 will be categorised as a failure in the main evaluation, but will not necessitate withdrawal if the subject is willing to continue and is considered by the investigators as competent to succeed.</description>

    <measure>smoking reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>from week 7 until week 24</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by daily self-reported cigarettes per day and expired CO measures (at every visit). An efficient reduction will be defined by a diminution of at least 50% of the number of cigarettes smoked, together with a reduction in CO levels compared to baseline</description>
