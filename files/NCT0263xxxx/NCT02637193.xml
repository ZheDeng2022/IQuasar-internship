    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Main Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy female subjects and/or male subjects who at the time of screening, are between&#xD;
             the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive. Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant&#xD;
             abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination,&#xD;
             including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead ECG or clinical&#xD;
             laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that&#xD;
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,&#xD;
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Based on CYP2D6 genotyping, the subject is required to be classified as a CYP2D6&#xD;
             extensive metabolizer (EM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Main Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or&#xD;
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,&#xD;
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A positive urine drug screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14&#xD;
             drinks/week for males (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of&#xD;
             beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local&#xD;
             requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of study medication (whichever&#xD;
             is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Screening supine blood pressure &gt; 140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt; 90 mm Hg (diastolic),&#xD;
             following at least 5 minutes of rest. If BP is &gt;140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;90 mm Hg&#xD;
             (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times and the average of the three BP&#xD;
             values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating QTcF &gt;450 msec or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec.&#xD;
             If QTcF exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more&#xD;
             times and the average of the three QTcF or QRS values should be used to determine the&#xD;
             subject's eligibility.&#xD;

             least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product or longer based upon the&#xD;
             compound's half-life characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or&#xD;
             5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of less than 1 g/day.&#xD;
             Limited use of non prescription medications that are not believed to affect subject&#xD;
             safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted on a case by case basis&#xD;
             following approval by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Herbal supplements and hormone replacement therapy must be discontinued at least 28&#xD;
             days prior to the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more&#xD;
             within 56 days prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of known QTc prolongation or ECG abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Individuals with known hypersensitivity reactions to venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine or&#xD;
             SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) or SNRI (Selective serotonin and&#xD;
             norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Individuals with a known hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin or quinolones.&#xD;
