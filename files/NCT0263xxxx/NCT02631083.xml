  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is carried out to find out the inclusion of high and low glycaemic index foods to&#xD;
      daily meals and how they impact 24 hour blood glucose fluctuations and energy regulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GI is a method of classifying foods based on the food's ability to raise the blood&#xD;
      glucose level. Low GI foods are recommended as they have a lower impact on blood glucose&#xD;
      concentrations. The research sets out to determine the effect of GI on 24 hour blood glucose&#xD;
      profiles and energy regulation in Asians. Healthy, normal-weight, Chinese males will be&#xD;
      recruited. There will be two sessions (consisting of four days for each session) where they&#xD;
      will consume either a high or low GI breakfast, lunch, snack (in the whole body calorimeter),&#xD;
      and a high or low glycaemic index dinner at home. They will take part in two test sessions&#xD;
      (each spanning over 3 days) with at least five days in between the two sessions. Their&#xD;
      glycaemic response will be measured using a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS)&#xD;
      throughout the period, while substrate oxidation will be measured over 10 hours in the&#xD;
      calorimeter (from breakfast, lunch and snack). This study specifically attempts to see how&#xD;
      having high and low GI meals impact on blood glucose levels and energy regulation in Asians.&#xD;
      The study is important in that it will be the first of its kind in the whole body calorimeter&#xD;
      and enable us to compute the rate of fat synthesis and how it is modulated when subjects are&#xD;
      fed a high GI diet (increased glucose excursions) and a low GI diet ( blunted glucose) over&#xD;
      24 hours in healthy Asians. Obesity and diabetes rates are increasing exponentially in Asian&#xD;
      populations and Singapore is no exception. Devising ways and means to staunch the escalation&#xD;
      is therefore a priority. The findings of the research will contribute towards the long-term&#xD;
      objectives of developing Asian specific dietary guidelines for weight and glycaemic control.&#xD;
      The study data will also be important for the provision of practical food-based advocacy for&#xD;
      better weight and glycaemic control in Singaporeans.&#xD;
