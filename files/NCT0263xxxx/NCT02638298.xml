  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study comparing two methods of dressing a post operative wound that are currently&#xD;
      in practice. One method is a traditional dry gauze dressing. The other method is using a&#xD;
      negative pressure dressing that provides gentle suction on the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will attempt to determine how well the use of post-operative negative&#xD;
      pressure dressing reduces wound healing problems in patients who have surgery after radiation&#xD;
      for a sarcoma in the thigh or leg.&#xD;

      Postoperative surgical site infections pose a significant challenge to the orthopaedic&#xD;
      oncologist, especially in wounds that have been previously irradiated with neo adjuvant&#xD;
      external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). There are many studies demonstrating the relatively&#xD;
      high risk of wound complications after lower extremity sarcoma resection. Published data&#xD;
      suggest that these preoperatively radiated wounds have a postoperative infection rate of&#xD;
      17%-44% with &quot;traditional&quot; dressings (e.g. dry gauze surgical dressings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective series of 190 patients and showed a wound complication risk of 35% in&#xD;
      preoperative irradiated wounds. The morbidity associated with wound complications can range&#xD;
      from moderate (prolonged dressing changes) to severe (life or limb threatening infection).&#xD;
      Patients who develop wound complications have been shown to longer hospitalizations and&#xD;
      higher costs [ref]. Anatomic location of the tumor has been shown to be a risk factor for the&#xD;
      development of wound complications with lower extremities being higher risk than upper&#xD;
      extremities. There are several published studies examining the effect of negative pressure&#xD;
      wound therapy (NPWT) on high risk surgical wounds. Abdominal wound complications can be&#xD;
      reduced with the use of incisional NPWT. In the orthopaedic literature the use of negative&#xD;
      pressure incisional dressings have been shown to lower the risk of wound complications in&#xD;
      total hip arthroplasty, acetabular fractures, and extremity fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there have not been any published studies on the utility of negative&#xD;
      pressure wound therapy in previously irradiated soft tissue sarcoma wounds. The investigators&#xD;
      feel that this high risk patient cohort could potentially benefit from reducing wound&#xD;
      complications through NPWT and is an ideal population to study its effect.&#xD;
