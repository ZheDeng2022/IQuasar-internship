      This study is a non-randomized prospective cohort study that will define the rate of index&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque development in adults with a prior coronary artery calcium (CAC) score&#xD;
      of 0 given prior CAC zero &gt; 5 years previous. Ancillary testing of serum, whole blood, and&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction will be performed to investigate any detectable systemic processes&#xD;
      that predict CAC development.&#xD;

      This study is a non-randomized prospective cohort study that will define the rate of index&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque development in adults with a prior CAC score of 0 given prior CAC zero&#xD;
      &gt; 5 years previous. Study personnel will abstract CAC and coronary computed tomography&#xD;
      angiography (CCTA) results on or prior to 31 December 2010 in a single, high-volume military&#xD;
      medical center. All patients with CAC scores of zero, irrespective of whether or not this&#xD;
      zero CAC was calculated in the presence of a CCTA with non-calcified plaque, will be offered&#xD;
      inclusion in the study cohort. Patients will be contacted via telephone and offered study&#xD;
      participation. Patients who sign written informed consent will be interviewed to abstract&#xD;
      current medical history, medications, exercise practices, and social history. Cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors of interest will be hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and family&#xD;
      history. Patients will then undergo blood draw (complete metabolic panel, complete blood&#xD;
      count, lipid panel, serum insulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin A1c,&#xD;
      and thyroid function testing) to screen for undergoing cardiovascular risk factors and to be&#xD;
      used as potential risk markers. Additionally, whole blood and serum will be obtained for&#xD;
      future investigation to determine new markers of coronary artery disease (CAD) progression&#xD;
      and genetic polymorphisms that may predict CAD progression. Patients will also undergo&#xD;
      EndoPat testing utilizing an EndoPAT 2000® (digital pulse amplitude tonometry) to assess for&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction. Finally, patients will undergo repeat coronary artery calcium&#xD;
      scoring based on standard laboratory protocols based on heart rate and body mass index.&#xD;

      The biological specimens collected in this study will be used for future testing and&#xD;
      evaluation of exploratory systemic biomarkers with respect to prediction of coronary artery&#xD;
      disease (CAD) progression and incident development of CAD. Specifically, samples are being&#xD;
      collected to investigate pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory makers and the effect on CAD&#xD;
      development and progression as measured by coronary artery calcification (CAC). DNA samples&#xD;
      will be tested for genetic factors and identify trends amongst patients with CAC development,&#xD;
      particularly focusing on those with aggressive, multivessel CAC development.&#xD;
