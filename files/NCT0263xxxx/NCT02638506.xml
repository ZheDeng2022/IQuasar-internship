    <textblock>
      Background : Headaches are a common presentation for children consulting to the Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED). However, only few studies have evaluated the rapid pain improvement provided&#xD;
      by medications in the acute management of headaches in the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective : To evaluate pain reduction provided by intranasal fentanyl (INF) compared to&#xD;
      placebo in addition to ibuprofen for children presenting to a pediatric ED with moderate to&#xD;
      severe headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods : A single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial will&#xD;
      be conducted in an urban, university-affiliated, tertiary care pediatric hospital ED. All&#xD;
      children eight to 18 years old who will present to the ED with headaches as a main chief&#xD;
      complaint and with pain of ≥ 36 mm out of 100 on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be recruited.&#xD;
      Study participants will be randomly allocated to receive INF 1.5 mcg/kg (maximum dose of 100&#xD;
      mcg) or similar volume of a placebo solution via an atomizer. Co-administration of oral&#xD;
      ibuprofen 10 mg/kg (maximum dose of 600 mg) will also be provided to the two groups if not&#xD;
      received in the previous 4 hours. The primary outcome will be the mean pain rating reduction&#xD;
      at 15 minutes. The secondary outcomes will be mean pain reduction at 30 and 60 minutes,&#xD;
      patient's and parental satisfaction levels, percent of being pain free, sedation score,&#xD;
      immediate and within 72 hours adverse events, additional ED analgesics and other medications,&#xD;
      length of ED stay, disposition outcomes, hospital admission rate and ED revisit rate within&#xD;
      72 hours. The primary analysis will use an intention-to-treat approach to compare mean pain&#xD;
      score reduction between the two groups using a Student's T-test. The sample size of 60&#xD;
      participants per arm was calculated to have a power of 80% to identify a difference of 10 mm&#xD;
      in the VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results : Our study might demonstrate that INF provides additional pain relief for&#xD;
      children presenting to an ED with headaches. Providing INF could relieve their symptoms more&#xD;
      quickly, potentially improve patient's and family's satisfaction, possibly reduce the length&#xD;
      of their ED stay and consequently, have a significant impact on patient quality of care and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the present study would be to determine the additive value on&#xD;
      analgesic effectiveness of INF in children aged eight to 18 years with acute moderate to&#xD;
      severe headaches. We would also aim to gather information on the safety and acceptability of&#xD;
      INF for headaches. We believe that providing INF for moderate to severe headaches will&#xD;
      decrease pain levels in children aged 8 to 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform a prospective, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study setting will be a single center, urban, university-based, tertiary care pediatric&#xD;
      university-affiliated hospital ED with an annual census of 75,000 patient visits. The study&#xD;
      should be conducted between 2015-2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population : Inclusion criteria will consist of children aged eight to 18 years who&#xD;
      present to the pediatric ED with a chief complaint of headaches, regardless of the type, with&#xD;
      a moderate or severe pain score. Pain was considered at least moderate if superior or equal&#xD;
      to 36 mm on the VAS as demonstrated by Hirschfeld et. Al. This level have been chosen because&#xD;
      it has been recognized that adequate sensitivity in analgesia trials for acute pain can only&#xD;
      be obtained if patients experience at least moderate pain before administration of any&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All patients will receive a 1.5 mcg⁄kg dose of fentanyl or an equivalent volume&#xD;
      of similar looking placebo. This will be administered intranasally via a mucosal atomiser&#xD;
      device (MAD) using 50 mcg/mL solution with a 2 mL syringe. Prior studies have shown that this&#xD;
      dose is as effective as IV or IM morphine and provides a bioavailability which is 71% of the&#xD;
      IV dose. The minimum dose prescribed will be 20 mcg, to ensure delivery of 15 mcg of fentanyl&#xD;
      to a 10 kg child, allowing for the MAD dead space of 0.1 mL (5 mcg of fentanyl). For&#xD;
      analgesic dose-volumes equal to and less than 0.5 mL, the entire dose will be administered in&#xD;
      one nostril; doses above 0.5 mL will be divided equally and administered to both nostrils.&#xD;
      Concentrated medications in a small volume (0.2-0.3 mL per nostril) are ideal, whereas&#xD;
      volumes in excess of 1 mL per nostril are not reliably absorbed as a result of mucosal&#xD;
      surface saturation and runoff from the nasal cavity. The maximum dose administered will be&#xD;
      100 mcg due to volume constraints. The placebo solution will consist of normal saline that&#xD;
      would be delivered via the proposed atomiser. The value administered will be adjusted to the&#xD;
      patients weight as for the active study medication. No additional dose of either study&#xD;
      medication would be provided. A MAD have been chosen because it is suggested to increase the&#xD;
      mucosal coverage and absorption of the medication by atomizing particles and decreasing the&#xD;
      amount of medication lost due to swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral ibuprofen (10 mg/kg) (maximum dose of 600 mg) will also be administered within the first&#xD;
      15 minutes of intranasal administration of the study medication unless it had been given in&#xD;
      the previous 4 hours. It has been chosen over acetaminophen because a direct comparison has&#xD;
      shown that complete pain relief after two hours is achieved twice as frequently with&#xD;
      ibuprofen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization process will occur at the local pharmacy and randomization allotment will&#xD;
      be known only by a pharmacist who is not involved in the study. Therefore, all providers&#xD;
      involved in the patient's care and patients will be blinded to group assignment until data&#xD;
      analysis completion. The participant will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups as&#xD;
      follows : 1) INF 1.5 mcg/kg and 2) placebo solution, given via an atomizer (MAD device: MAD&#xD;
      Nasal, U.S. Patent #6,112,743, Wolfe-Tory Medical, Inc., 79 West 4500 South, Salt Lake City,&#xD;
      Utah 84107).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study medications will be provided to the ED by the local pharmacy. For each randomized&#xD;
      patient, a consecutive study medication package will be opened in the ED. Each study package&#xD;
      will contain a study medication (either generic fentanyl bottle or saline bottle), a syringe&#xD;
      and an atomizer for delivery. An on-site nurse will withdraw the study medication from the&#xD;
      specific bottle provided in the package and will deliver the study medication to the patient.&#xD;
      The study research assistant will remain blinded. At the pharmacy, the patient's&#xD;
      identification will be coded so that only a user having the access code will be able to&#xD;
      identify participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure : Every patient will be weighed in triage. Enrollment will be limited to times when&#xD;
      a research assistant is available. A research assistant will recruit the patients after a&#xD;
      pediatric ED physician has assessed them and once the symptoms of headaches are clearly&#xD;
      established. The pain associated with headaches will be assessed by using the VAS, which has&#xD;
      been validated for the use in children aged eight years and older across a variety of&#xD;
      clinical settings and has an excellent interrater-reliability and validity in analgesia&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility and exclusion criteria will be confirmed, caregivers will be given written&#xD;
      and verbal study information. Written consent for enrolment will be gained from both the&#xD;
      accompanying parent and the child, when appropriate. The research assistant will use timers&#xD;
      to coordinate all the events. At baseline, before any intervention, the VAS score, baseline&#xD;
      vital signs and sedation score (UMSS) will be recorded by the research assistant. For the&#xD;
      assessment of the VAS score, the children will be asked to mark on a standardized data&#xD;
      collection booklet, the level of their pain on a 100-mm non hatched VAS scale with at one end&#xD;
      &quot;no pain&quot; and at the other &quot;worst pain ever&quot; with the following, verbatim: &quot;Show me on the&#xD;
      line the level of your pain: here is no pain; there is the worst possible pain.&quot; The patient&#xD;
      will then cross a line to indicate his or her level of pain. All measurements will be&#xD;
      recorded to the closest 1 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At time zero, the solution contained in a syringe will be administered by the on-site nurse&#xD;
      to the anterior aspect of the participant's nasal cavity over few seconds. The dose (or half&#xD;
      of it, if necessary) will be administered into one of the patient's nostrils with the MAD.&#xD;
      The second half of the dose, if needed, will be administered in the contralateral nostril&#xD;
      using the same MAD. Younger children will have the medication administered while sitting in&#xD;
      the lap of a parent, with their heads reclined and necks hyperextended. Older children will&#xD;
      receive the medication while lying in a semi recumbent position on the gurney. No additional&#xD;
      dose would be provided. The research assistant will remain blinded to which medication the&#xD;
      patient has received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the fifteenth, thirtieth and sixtieth minute post-intervention, the research assistant&#xD;
      will obtain a pain score via the VAS from the patient and ask for the change in their pain.&#xD;
      They will be asked to give a verbal rating of their pain as 'a lot less', 'a little less',&#xD;
      'the same', 'a little more' or 'a lot more' compared to the initial baseline, at time zero&#xD;
      and reassess level of pain on the VAS as used previously. Children will not be permitted to&#xD;
      refer to previous scales markings and will remain blinded to their prior scores. The sedation&#xD;
      score will also be recorded using the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) which&#xD;
      overall validity was demonstrated and declared as a simple, valid and reliable tool that&#xD;
      facilitates rapid and frequent assessment and documentation of depth of sedation in children.&#xD;
      The vital signs will also be taken at these intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed demographic and clinical data will also be collected after the study medication&#xD;
      administration. A standardized questionnaire of the patient's present and past headaches,&#xD;
      will be completed by the research assistant during their stay in the pediatric ED. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will include questions on duration, location, description of pain, associated&#xD;
      symptoms of the present headache and past medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No other meds, IV fluids, IV procedures or other painful procedures will be done during the&#xD;
      study period unless the patient's condition changes or deteriorates. If any of these&#xD;
      procedure is needed during the study period, the patient will be withdrawn from the study and&#xD;
      will be treated according of his state of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the sixtieth minute of the study, marking the end of the study, patients who had assented&#xD;
      to the study and parents will be asked to rate their satisfaction on the efficacy of the&#xD;
      study medication on a Likert scale ('strongly disagree' 'disagree', 'neither agree nor&#xD;
      disagree', 'agree', or 'strongly agree'). This satisfaction scale will be given to patients&#xD;
      and parents after the last pain score was obtained. The study would be then completed, and&#xD;
      further care will be at the discretion of the attending pediatric ED medical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up call by a research assistant will be done at 72 hours after discharge to assess&#xD;
      headache recurrence, late medication side effects, and a return to another medical facility.&#xD;
      All children hospitalized will also be reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A chart review will be done by a member of the research team to collect final pediatric ED&#xD;
      diagnosis as well as any additional investigations (e.g. CT scan, consultation with a&#xD;
      neurologist, blood tests, TSH, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected using pediatric ED medical records of recruited patients and the&#xD;
      sociodemographic questionnaire completed by a research assistant. The results of all other&#xD;
      variables: VAS, UMSS and satisfaction score will be collected in real time by the research&#xD;
      assistant during the pediatric ED stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data collection form will be used, and these forms will be later cross-referenced with the&#xD;
      patient's clinical records by a member of the research team to verify correct documentation&#xD;
      and eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistics :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study evaluating pain related to all types of headaches in children.&#xD;
      Accordingly, no previous study perfectly matches our design to infer sample size. However,&#xD;
      two previous studies evaluated an intervention provided to decrease acute pain secondary to&#xD;
      migraine in children using the VAS. These studies reported a standard deviation of 18.5 and&#xD;
      20 mm. Powell et al found the minimum clinically significant difference (MCSD) in VAS pain&#xD;
      score for children aged 8 to 15 years (on a 100-mm VAS scale) to be 10 mm (95% confidence&#xD;
      interval 7 to 12 mm). In studies of populations, differences of less than this amount, even&#xD;
      if statistically significant, are unlikely to be of clinical significance. Previous research&#xD;
      in adults has found the same MCSD in VAS pain scores and did not differ in adults with age,&#xD;
      sex, or cause of pain. Based on these data, using an alpha value of 0,05 and a power of 80%,&#xD;
      it was estimated that we need, 57 patients per group. Accounting to a maximal 5% drop-off&#xD;
      rate, we inflated this number to 60 participants per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be entered in an excel database (Microsoft Inc., Richmond, WA) and will be&#xD;
      analyzed with SPSS v21 (IBM Inc). The primary study analysis will be a Student's T-test to&#xD;
      compare the mean differences in scores between the intervention group and the placebo group.&#xD;
      An intention-to-treat approach will be used. Also, secondary analyses will be performed using&#xD;
      a Student's T-test for continuous variables and a Pearson Chi-square test for categorical&#xD;
      variables. The 95% confidence intervals will be measured for each result.&#xD;
