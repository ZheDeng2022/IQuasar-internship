  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a severe form of pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension characterized by obstruction of the pulmonary vasculature by residual organized&#xD;
      thrombi, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), progressive pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension, and right failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients deemed operable, pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is the gold standard treatment&#xD;
      and is the only potentially curative treatment. However, some patients are ineligible for&#xD;
      surgery owing to occlusion of distal vessels. The best treatment option for these&#xD;
      non-operable CTEPH patients is not yet established.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, riociguat is the only drug approved in Europe and US for the treatment of&#xD;
      non-operable CTEPH. However, medical therapy with riociguat does not address obstructive&#xD;
      lesions. In this sense, another treatment option, balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA), began&#xD;
      recently to gain widespread interest after development in several centers. This procedure&#xD;
      uses the standard balloon angioplasty technique to dilate selected pulmonary arteries. The&#xD;
      main aim is to reopen vessels occluded by webs and bands. Several teams, mainly from Japan,&#xD;
      have reported their experiences with BPA for the treatment of non-operable CTEPH and&#xD;
      demonstrated impressive decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and improvement in&#xD;
      functional status and exercise capacity with an acceptable procedure-related risk. Although&#xD;
      BPA has never been prospectively evaluated, most of the leading CTEPH centers worldwide have&#xD;
      currently added BPA to their therapeutic options. However, no randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing safety and efficacy of medical therapy with riociguat versus pulmonary balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty has been performed so far. Therefore, the respective places of medical treatment&#xD;
      and of BPA in the management of inoperable patients with CTEPH need to be further evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ancillary study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of employment of two sequentially&#xD;
      used treatments at 12 months. The studied population is that of the study RACE. The patient&#xD;
      follow-up period will be extended by 6 months, its duration of participation will be in total&#xD;
      of 13 months. The exams will be the same as those of the V3 of the RACE study.&#xD;
