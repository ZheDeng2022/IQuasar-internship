  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if trigger point dry needling (TDN) is as effective&#xD;
      as cortisone injection (CI) in reducing pain and improving function in patients with greater&#xD;
      trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the potential of TDN as an effective alternative to CI for&#xD;
      patients with GTPS by directly comparing pain and functional outcomes of patients receiving&#xD;
      TDN or CI for the treatment of GTPS over a 6 week period. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      patients treated with TDN will be equally improved in pain and function as those treated with&#xD;
      CI. If TDN is demonstrated to be equally or more effective than steroid injection in this&#xD;
      pilot study, then the investigators have the basis to launch larger studies. Ultimately, the&#xD;
      investigators want to determine if TDN is an effective treatment alternative for GTPS for&#xD;
      providers and patients who want to avoid the potential detrimental side-effects of steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: Prospective, randomized, partially-blinded design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To determine if administration of TDN is as effective as CI in reducing lateral hip pain&#xD;
      and improving function in patients diagnosed with greater trochanteric pain syndrome. The&#xD;
      investigators expect to demonstrate effectiveness of TDN in the treatment of GTPS to a degree&#xD;
      that is equal to CI. Doing so would prompt further outcomes research for TDN. Supportive&#xD;
      research and subsequent clinical acceptance of TDN as a primary treatment for this condition&#xD;
      would offer an alternative to patients who want or need to avoid steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the literature, this is the first study to investigate the effectiveness of TDN in&#xD;
      the treatment of GTPS and directly compare pain and functional outcomes of patients receiving&#xD;
      TDN versus CI for the treatment of GTPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Fifty patients with GTPS will be randomized into a CI or TDN group. Treatment will&#xD;
      be administered according to standard of care for up to 6 weeks. Numerical pain and&#xD;
      functional ratings for each patient will be collected at 0, 1, 3, and 6 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
      Data analysis will determine if TDN is as effective as cortisone.&#xD;
