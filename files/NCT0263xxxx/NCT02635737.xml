      Background and Rationale Breast Cancer Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, with great&#xD;
      diversity in the site, size and progression of tumours. Some are palpable and discovered by&#xD;
      the patient, though many are first detected during mammogram screening. For such cancers,&#xD;
      localisation is necessary prior to surgery, to guide surgeons to the target excision site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wire Guided Localisation Traditionally, localisation involves radiographic-guided insertion&#xD;
      of a wire into the breast, with positioning of the wire tip at the centre of the lesion.&#xD;
      However, this procedure carries several logistical limitations , stemming from the fact that&#xD;
      wire localisation must be performed on the day of surgery. This is to minimise risk of wire&#xD;
      migration or dislodgement , a significant possibility due to the external section of wire&#xD;
      left protruding from the breast. Same-day appointments demand excellent coordination between&#xD;
      radiological departments and operating theatres to ensure that disruption to procedure&#xD;
      scheduling is minimised. Delays may result from technically difficult procedures , leading to&#xD;
      over-running radiology appointments that have a knock on effect on operating lists.&#xD;
      Additionally, cancelled operations can result in preceding wire guidance procedures becoming&#xD;
      unnecessary, resulting in wasted staff hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another limitation of wire guidance occurs because the wire directs surgeons along a linear&#xD;
      route. Lesions are found at a point along the wire, though it can be difficult to determine&#xD;
      how far along they are found. For this reason, surgeons making initial incisions may be&#xD;
      dictated by the visual trajectory of the wire, rather than the location of the lesion. This&#xD;
      can lead to excessive dissection and sub optimal cosmetic results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radioactive Seed Localisation Radioactive seed localisation (RSL) is a localisation technique&#xD;
      that is less commonly used in the United Kingdom (UK). A radioactive seed can be inserted up&#xD;
      to 5 days before surgery, thus eliminating the requirement for radiology appointments on the&#xD;
      same day as the patient's operation. The seed is detected in theatre using a handheld gamma&#xD;
      probe. The gamma probe directs the surgeon to a single specific point via the shortest route,&#xD;
      whereas, wires often transect the breast, meaning that surgeons commonly end up dissecting&#xD;
      across normal tissue to locate the tip of the wire. In addition, with RSL, there is no&#xD;
      distraction from external projections of wire, so the surgeon is guided purely by the audible&#xD;
      response to the seed. It is hypothesised that the advantages of RSL will lead to improved&#xD;
      surgical techniques and reduce pressures on theatre scheduling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, up to now, there is little evidence demonstrating clear superiority in surgical&#xD;
      outcome of one localisation technique. Several studies have found lower positive margin rates&#xD;
      in patients undergoing RSL versus wire guidance , , . This means that edges of excised&#xD;
      tissues less commonly involves cancerous tissue, suggesting that RSL more accurately&#xD;
      localises cancerous lesions. Conversely, many more studies, including one of the largest&#xD;
      trials to date, conclude there is no variability in surgical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of stance on surgical outcome, all studies noted that RSL offers significant&#xD;
      improvements in scheduling of appointments and patient convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, radioactive techniques are not without limitations. Several studies have evaluated&#xD;
      the use of standard radioisotope and blue dye injections for sentinel node biopsy. Each study&#xD;
      commented on the complex legislation regulating use of radioisotopes, particularly with&#xD;
      regards to operator training and correct disposal and handling. In addition, radioisotope use&#xD;
      increases patient and healthcare worker radiation exposure which, though minimal, would be&#xD;
      preferable to avoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron Oxide Use in Breast Surgery Several studies have investigated the use of liquid&#xD;
      injections of iron oxide rather than traditional radioisotope and blue dye injections, in&#xD;
      sentinel node identification. Following iron oxide injections, a handheld magnetometer was&#xD;
      used to detect the location of iron oxide in the lymph nodes. All studies concluded that iron&#xD;
      oxide particles performed equally as well as standard radioisotope &amp; blue dye injections in&#xD;
      sentinel node identification, demonstrating potential for more widespread use of the&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, Ahmed et al tested localisation of cancerous lesions using a magnetic tracer&#xD;
      injection. The tracer successfully localised all tumours and resulted in appropriate&#xD;
      excisional margins, without excess tissue excision; thus demonstrating the feasibility of&#xD;
      magnetic tracer localisation of tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentimark Magnetic Localisation The localisation method with which this project is concerned&#xD;
      has similar principles to RSL. However, instead of radioactive seeds, a soft magnetic seed&#xD;
      called Sentimark, is placed into the breast. The seed is similar to a biopsy clip and can be&#xD;
      detected using a handheld magnetometer called Sentimag. The Sentimag probe emits an&#xD;
      alternating magnetic field that detects the magnetic response of the Sentimark seed. The&#xD;
      magnetometer produces an audible response when held close to the Sentimark seed and can be&#xD;
      used by surgeons to locate target excision sites. Sentimark is inserted about a week before&#xD;
      operation, ideally during a biopsy appointment, for patient convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first to investigate magnetic seed localisation of tumours. It is&#xD;
      hypothesised that using magnetic seeds rather than injections with a magnetic tracer will&#xD;
      allow more accurate detection and localisation using the Sentimag probe. This is because the&#xD;
      probe is detecting the magnetic field produced by a single discrete object, rather than a&#xD;
      collection of iron oxide-containing liquid which may disperse throughout the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of Localisation Techniques The coordination and scheduling difficulties encountered&#xD;
      in wire guided localisation, alongside the logistical and safety issues of radioisotope&#xD;
      usage, highlight a requirement for further innovation and acquisition of new technologies in&#xD;
      the field of localisation. It is hoped that magnetic seed localisation can act as a feasible&#xD;
      alternative to existing technologies. Use of magnetism in localisation techniques offers a&#xD;
      potential alternative to wire guidance and RSL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important consideration with the deployment of the new seed is whether the size and shape&#xD;
      of the seed are sufficiently similar to previous designs to show similar migration patterns,&#xD;
      as movement of the seed prior to surgery can cause incomplete lesion excision with en-suing&#xD;
      requirements for re-operation or an increased risk of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The migration performance of Sentimark in an implantation trial in goats, mean migration of&#xD;
      1.1mm with a range 0 to 3.6mm (N=10), was very similar to that observed by Alderliesten, et&#xD;
      al. who report a mean migration of 0.8mm, range 0 to 2.8mm (N=10) for RSL seeds which was&#xD;
      considered &quot;clinically negligible&quot; in RSL of human breast lesions. However, confirmation is&#xD;
      required that the magnetic marker performs as expected in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will test a soft magnetic seed (Sentimark) and its accompanying handheld magnetic&#xD;
      probe (Sentimag) with particular consideration for its safety and performance once placed&#xD;
      into human breast tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device The device to be studied is a small (5mm x 0.9mm) metal magnetic marker (seed) that&#xD;
      has soft magnetic properties. This means that when exposed to a magnetic field it becomes&#xD;
      magnetic. The magnetism can then be detected using a magnetometer and probe which gives an&#xD;
      audible and visual signal of the strength of response from the seed and as it is directional&#xD;
      this can accurately guide the user to the site of the magnetic seed. The magnetometer is a CE&#xD;
      (Conformite Europeene) approved device and is used worldwide for detecting iron oxide in&#xD;
      sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures, and is proven in clinical practice. The seed itself&#xD;
      will be deployed by a radiologist into the centre of the tumour site using a similar&#xD;
      technique to that used to currently place a wire into the breast. The seed itself is&#xD;
      cylindrical and in in vivo studies in goats have shown similar migration performance to that&#xD;
      seen with radioactive seeds in human breast tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The seed has also been tested in animal tissue models by (University Hospital of South&#xD;
      Manchester) UHSM radiologists and surgeons, and in these models it can be safely deployed by&#xD;
      the radiologists using existing techniques. The device was detected and surgical resection&#xD;
      was performed with 100% accuracy on all specimens. There is no radiation exposure from this&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Adult women with capacity to consent who have a proven breast cancer&#xD;
      requiring breast removing mastectomy surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks to Patients The device itself is a small piece of metal and in itself does&#xD;
      not offer a likely safety risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Migration of the seed - the seed is cylindrical and therefore once placed in the breast&#xD;
           it has the potential to migrate along the path of the needle that was used to deploy it.&#xD;
           When deployed into mammary soft tissue in animal models the device has not migrated.&#xD;
           This study will involve placing the device in women having mastectomy so even if the&#xD;
           device migrates it will not affect patients cancer care (as the whole breast will be&#xD;
           removed along with the device no matter where it is located in the breast);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure to detect the seed - the seed is small and the magnetic field generated is&#xD;
           proportional to the size of the seed. This study aims to assess whether the seed can be&#xD;
           detected in all sizes of breast as in some cases it may be possible that the seed lies&#xD;
           too deep in the breast to be detected using the magnetometer. To ensure safe resection&#xD;
           of the cancer, each patient in this study will be under-going a planned mastectomy, to&#xD;
           ensure that the device is fully removed even if detection should fail;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue acceptance - the seed is produced from a single material and has demonstrated&#xD;
           biocompatibility through ISO-10993 biocompatibility evaluation including demonstration&#xD;
           of tissue acceptance in mammary tissue of goats (28-day implantation period). Bone wax&#xD;
           is used as a terminal plug for Sentimark device. Bone wax is commonly used for the same&#xD;
           purpose in brachytherapy and RSL needles. Some reaction to bone wax may occur, such as&#xD;
           an allergic reaction or foreign body reactions (e.g. granulomas), as bone wax is a&#xD;
           minimally resorbable implantable substance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits The study will be carried out in patients requiring a mastectomy. In this&#xD;
      population, the full cycle of marker (seed) deployment and removal can be evaluated, but as&#xD;
      the breast is being removed as part of the planned cancer treatment, patient treatment will&#xD;
      be unaffected should the magnetic seed not perform as intended. However, there will be no&#xD;
      direct benefit for patients taking part in the study and the potential benefits of this study&#xD;
      are limited to the advancement of medical knowledge. If the study confirms that the magnetic&#xD;
      marker (seed) is safe and the method is feasible, the device has the potential to be used for&#xD;
      localisation of breast cancers for lumpectomy surgery.&#xD;
