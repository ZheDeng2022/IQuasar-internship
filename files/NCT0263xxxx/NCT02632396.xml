    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ixazomib citrate (ixazomib)&#xD;
      when given together with rituximab and to see how well they work after stem cell transplant&#xD;
      in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma that are no longer showing signs or symptoms&#xD;
      of cancer. Ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer cell by blocking enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may interfere with the ability of cancer&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread. Giving ixazomib together with rituximab after transplant may help&#xD;
      prevent the cancer from coming back.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose and assess the safety of ixazomib when&#xD;
      administered as post-transplant maintenance in mantle cell lymphoma and to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of rituximab in combination with the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of ixazomib.&#xD;
      (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess preliminary evidence of efficacy of ixazomib in combination with rituximab when&#xD;
      administered as post-transplant maintenance in mantle cell lymphoma. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate for preliminary evidence of efficacy of ixazomib (+/- rituximab) maintenance&#xD;
      therapy in patients with mantle cell lymphoma undergoing autologous stem cell transplant in&#xD;
      first partial or complete remission. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate for preliminary evidence of efficacy of ixazomib (+/- rituximab) maintenance&#xD;
      therapy in patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have a complex karyotype and other&#xD;
      high-risk cytogenetic or clinical markers. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate toxicities associated with prolonged administration of ixazomib maintenance&#xD;
      therapy in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients who have completed an&#xD;
      autologous transplant for mantle cell lymphoma and to assess the impact of MRD on outcomes&#xD;
      for patients receiving maintenance therapy. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate efficacy of ixazomib with rituximab maintenance therapy in patients with MCL&#xD;
      who undergo autologous stem cell transplantation in first remission who have a complex&#xD;
      karyotype and/or additional high risk cytogenetic or clinical features at diagnosis. (Phase&#xD;
      II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To further evaluate safety and toxicity of prolonged administration of ixazomib. (Phase&#xD;
      II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate long-term disease-related and survival outcomes for patients with MCL who&#xD;
      receive post-transplant maintenance therapy with ixazomib with rituximab. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To evaluate the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients who have completed&#xD;
      an autologous transplant for mantle cell lymphoma and to assess the impact of MRD on outcomes&#xD;
      for patients receiving maintenance therapy. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the prognostic value of pre-transplant positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in mantle cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the ability of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to identify&#xD;
      high-risk cytogenetic features in patients with MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the impact of ixazomib maintenance (+/- rituximab) on immunoglobulin levels&#xD;
      for patients completing autologous stem cell transplantation for mantle cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ixazomib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning between 70-180 days after stem cell transplant, patients receive ixazomib orally&#xD;
      (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15, and rituximab intravenously (IV) (or subcutaneously [SC] after&#xD;
      first dose if deemed appropriate) on day 1 of courses 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

             initiating therapy but must remain off of growth factor for at least 7 days before&#xD;
             starting therapy and must meet eligibility on cycle 1, day 1. Patients who complete&#xD;
             the consent process but do not meet hematologic eligibility within 30 days may be&#xD;
             re-consented and enrolled on study if they ultimately do meet eligibility requirements&#xD;

             patient may initiate therapy before day +70 and initiation of therapy beyond day +130&#xD;
             is allowed ONLY for patients who meet all eligibility criteria except for hematologic&#xD;
             parameters, in which case patients may be delayed until their hematologic laboratories&#xD;
             meet criteria but no later than day +180. Regardless of the time of therapy&#xD;
             initiation, patients must meet all eligibility criteria and must have completed all&#xD;
             consent documentation and screening procedures within the specified window.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Central nervous system involvement with lymphoma at any time in the patient's history;&#xD;

             hypertension, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina, or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months; patients&#xD;

             known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. Patients who have previously tested&#xD;
             positive for hepatitis B core antibody may be eligible if they are confirmed to NOT&#xD;
             have active disease and are on appropriate anti-viral therapy. No additional hepatitis&#xD;
             or HIV testing is required for patients who have been evaluated during their induction&#xD;
             and/or pre-transplant work-up and have had no clinical evidence of HIV, hepatitis B or&#xD;

             disease; patients with non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of any type, or low&#xD;
             risk cervical cancer are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection and&#xD;
             are deemed free of disease by their treating physician; patients with low risk&#xD;
             prostate cancer who are under observation are eligible if their urologist or&#xD;

          -  Receipt of therapy on a clinical trial, including investigational and&#xD;
             non-investigational agents not included in this trial, within 30 days of the start of&#xD;

             clinical studies is allowed, and patients who participated on a clinical trial for&#xD;
             induction and/or transplant but who have completed the prescribed therapy course for&#xD;
             that study and have been off therapy for at least 30 days are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior exposure to ixazomib; however, prior bortezomib exposure is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;

             without any measurable nodal disease or morphologic evidence of disease in the bone&#xD;
             marrow or peripheral blood are eligible.&#xD;
