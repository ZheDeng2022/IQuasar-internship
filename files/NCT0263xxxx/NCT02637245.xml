    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the most common cause of vision loss in diabetic patients.&#xD;
      While anti-VEGF treatments and to a lesser extent corticosteroid and macular photocoagulation&#xD;
      have improved outcomes in patients with DME, no single therapy is universally effective and&#xD;
      currently there is no a priori means of determine which patients will respond best to any&#xD;
      given therapy. The purpose of this study is to determine whether specific parameters of&#xD;
      ocular imaging studies including optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiography can&#xD;
      predict response to treatment in patients with DME. This is a prospective observational&#xD;
      cohort study that will collect clinical data and imaging studies obtained as standard of&#xD;
      care. Up to 150 subjects with clinically significant DME will be enrolled at Duke Eye Center&#xD;
      or its satellite offices. These imaging studies will be analyzed to determine whether&#xD;
      specific parameters are associated with poor or favorable response to specific treatments.&#xD;
      There will be no intervention as part of this observational trial, thus the primary risk to&#xD;
      subjects is loss of confidentiality, which will be minimized by the study team.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that DME is a common endpoint caused by differing pathobiology&#xD;
      which varies between patients. Clinically fluorescein angiography (FA) and optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT) are used to diagnose and assess diabetic retinopathy including DME. These&#xD;
      two imaging modalities provide different biological information with FA giving functional&#xD;
      data regarding the perfusion and integrity of the retinal water homeostasis system where OCT&#xD;
      gives structural information including the quantity and location of fluid in patients with&#xD;
      DME. The investigators believe that careful analysis of both the leakage pattern on FA and&#xD;
      the characteristics of intraretinal fluid on OCT have potential to provide insight into the&#xD;
      predominant mechanism of DME in an individual patient. Specifically, it has been proposed&#xD;
      that at least two forms of DME exist, focal and diffuse. In focal DME, leakage seen on FA&#xD;
      originates predominantly from leaking microaneurysms present in the retinal microvasculature,&#xD;
      which are markers for endothelial dysfunction and focal breakdown of the blood retinal&#xD;
      barrier. Similarly, it has been hypothesized that focal leakage imaged by OCT will result in&#xD;
      accumulation of noncystic fluid in the extracellular space. In contrast, diffuse pattern&#xD;
      leakage has no discernable source on FA and it is believed that this pattern represents&#xD;
      failure of the Müller and RPE cell pump function resulting in accumulation of intracellular&#xD;
      fluid in the retina. Diffuse leakage imaged with OCT may appear as cystic fluid accumulation&#xD;
      which represents swollen Müller or other retinal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, most patients with DME have a mixture of focal and diffuse leakage with&#xD;
      one type being predominant. The investigators hypothesize that, because they are driven by&#xD;
      disparate pathobiology, different DME subtypes will respond differently to treatment. Thus,&#xD;
      it may be possible to use fluorescein angiography and/or optical coherence tomography to&#xD;
      predict the optimal treatment for an individual patient, thereby improving patient outcomes&#xD;
      and possibly reducing treatment burden. To date, there are no prospective studies correlating&#xD;
      FA and OCT imaging parameters with response to specific therapies, nor is there prospective&#xD;
      data on using imaging parameters to guide choice of treatment modality in subjects with DME.&#xD;
      As a first step toward determining whether imaging parameters predict treatment response, the&#xD;
      investigators will prospectively collect imaging, treatment and outcome data in patients with&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema treated at Duke Eye Center.&#xD;
