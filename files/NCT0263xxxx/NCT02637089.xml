  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is known for its motor symptoms and affects more than 100,000&#xD;
      Canadians. However, PD patients also show cognitive deficits and neuropsychiatric problems&#xD;
      that significantly impair their quality of life. The occurrence of dementia in PD is much&#xD;
      higher than in the general population. The proposed study will allow the principal&#xD;
      investigator, his team and his collaborators to investigate the origins and evolution of the&#xD;
      cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Participants with PD with and without mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (MCI) and participants with and without MCI over the age of 60 years will be&#xD;
      assessed during eight study visits over three years. Through brain imaging, clinical testing,&#xD;
      as well as genotyping the cognitive patterns in the four different groups will be observed&#xD;
      and compared. The results will be used to identify biomarkers that can predict the occurrence&#xD;
      of dementia early in the disease. Ultimately, the results of the proposed research will&#xD;
      contribute to interventions and treatment strategies tailored to different cognitive profiles&#xD;
      in PD before the occurrence of dementia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent chronic neurodegenerative disorder,&#xD;
      affecting up to 2% among persons older than 65 years of age and nearly 10% of people over 80.&#xD;
      The cardinal symptoms of PD include tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia originating from the&#xD;
      loss of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum. It has recently been shown that the non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms in PD such as cognitive and behavioural impairment are highly prevalent and have a&#xD;
      severe and direct negative effect on health-related and perceived quality of life. It is now&#xD;
      well established that 25 to 40% of persons with PD will develop cognitive deficits early in&#xD;
      the disease. Moreover, the risk of developing dementia is almost six times higher in PD&#xD;
      patients than in age-matched controls. The nature and evolution of cognitive deficits in PD&#xD;
      remain poorly understood, so is their relationship with neuropsychiatric features often&#xD;
      observed in the disease including depression, anxiety and apathy. Furthermore, the medication&#xD;
      treatment of cognitive deficits in PD yields very modest results. PD neuropathology is&#xD;
      associated with alpha-synuclein-containing Lewy-Bodies whereas that of Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      (AD) is usually associated with AÃŸ-amyloid plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary&#xD;
      lesions. However, recent post-mortem studies suggest that between 30 and 45% of PD patients&#xD;
      with dementia also meet neuropathologic diagnostic criteria for AD. With such a high&#xD;
      proportion of demented PD patients with concurrent AD, it would be valuable, from a&#xD;
      therapeutic standpoint, to identify those with AD earlier. In the context of the present&#xD;
      proposal the investigators will be able to follow different groups of PD patients&#xD;
      longitudinally and compare them to non-PD patients with mild cognitive impairment who are at&#xD;
      risk of developing a medio-temporal lobe dementia such as Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three major aims for this longitudinal study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify anatomical and functional neuroimaging, neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric&#xD;
           profiles that can serve as markers for the early prediction of dementia in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Uncover the cognitive and neural characteristics that are specific to PD-MCI subjects&#xD;
           vs. characteristics shared by all MCI subjects whether due to PD or other aetiology such&#xD;
           as Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify the effect of specific genotypes that can influence the cognitive profile and&#xD;
           evolution in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 100 PD and 100 non-PD individuals. None of them will have&#xD;
      dementia. Participants will be selected in order to obtain about 65% MCI and 35% cognitively&#xD;
      intact individuals in each cohort (PD, non-PD). At study start they will be asked to consent&#xD;
      to a blood draw for genotyping purposes. At each time point, they will receive a&#xD;
      neuropsychological evaluation to determine whether and which domain(s) of cognition is (are)&#xD;
      affected and whether the participant meets the criteria for dementia. Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms which are often present before the onset of cognitive symptoms will be assessed at&#xD;
      each time point using the Mild Behavioural Impairment-Checklist (MBI-C). At Time points 1 and&#xD;
      2 they will also undergo two MRI sessions containing anatomical acquisitions as well as BOLD&#xD;
      functional series while performing an executive (set-shifting) task that the investigators&#xD;
      have shown to rely on fronto-striatal regions and an (associative) memory task that solicits&#xD;
      the medial temporal lobe. At Time point 3 they will undergo just one MRI session not&#xD;
      containing any task. This will allow the investigators to identify markers that can&#xD;
      distinguish subgroups with respect to their possible evolution towards dementia. This&#xD;
      multi-faceted, longitudinal project promises to enhance the understanding of the nature and&#xD;
      evolution of cognitive dysfunction in PD relative to general aging. To the investigators'&#xD;
      knowledge, this is the first time that PD and non-PD patients stratified according to&#xD;
      cognitive profile will be studied longitudinally using neuropsychological evaluation,&#xD;
      anatomical and functional neuroimaging measures as well as genotyping. This information has&#xD;
      the potential to yield markers that can be used in clinics to determine the diagnosis and&#xD;
      prognosis of cognitive dysfunction in PD, allowing for an early prediction of dementia in the&#xD;
      disease. This will ultimately yield intervention and treatment strategies tailored to&#xD;
      different patient subtypes, aimed at improving cognitive deficits and decelerating the&#xD;
      decline.&#xD;
