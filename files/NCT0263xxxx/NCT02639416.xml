  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with complicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM), such as inability to take adequate&#xD;
      feeds, infection and diarrhoea, require in-patient management. Despite following a&#xD;
      well-established World Health Organisation (WHO) protocol, outcomes are poor. Case fatality&#xD;
      often exceeds 20%. Amongst survivors discharged home, many subsequently die, have long-term&#xD;
      poor growth or recurrence of SAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has long been recognized that children with SAM have intestinal inflammation and that this&#xD;
      persists despite management according to WHO guidelines. The inflammation is thought to&#xD;
      result from increased exposure to microbial pathogens in the gut in areas with poor&#xD;
      sanitation. The damaged lining of the intestine impairs food digestion and absorption, likely&#xD;
      allows gut bacteria to enter the blood stream to cause sepsis and also exposes the gut immune&#xD;
      cells to microbial and food antigens causing the inflammation to persist. Failure to treat&#xD;
      the intestinal inflammation is likely to contribute to the poor response to treatment and&#xD;
      poor long-term outcomes in many children with SAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intestinal inflammation seen in SAM is very similar to that which occurs in food&#xD;
      intolerance (e.g. intolerance to cow's milk protein) and inflammatory bowel disease. In these&#xD;
      conditions, the inflammation is treated very effectively with hypoallergenic (&quot;elemental&quot;)&#xD;
      and anti-inflammatory (&quot;polymeric&quot;) formulas. These are nutritionally complete feeds that&#xD;
      have a similar composition to the feeds used for nutritional rehabilitation in SAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to undertake a pilot study to see if an elemental and/or polymeric formula are&#xD;
      tolerated by children with SAM and help to reduce intestinal inflammation. We also aim to&#xD;
      learn more about the intestinal inflammation in general that occurs in SAM by observing&#xD;
      carefully the effect of these specific formulae and to do in-depth metabolic analyses.&#xD;

      We will study children admitted to the Moyo ward at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital,&#xD;
      Blantyre, Malawi with complicated SAM. Following informed consent, children will be recruited&#xD;
      once they have completed the initial stabilisation phase of management and enter the&#xD;
      transition phase to nutritional rehabilitation. They will be randomly allocated to one of 3&#xD;
      arms, either 1) standard feeds (F-100 and/or ready-to-use therapeutic feeds), 2) a polymeric&#xD;
      therapeutic formula or 3) an elemental therapeutic formula. The alternative feeds will be&#xD;
      supplemented with micronutrients to be equivalent in composition to F-100. All children will&#xD;
      remain admitted to the ward for 2 weeks and receive exclusively the allocated formula. All&#xD;
      other aspects of the management of SAM will follow current practice based on WHO guidelines.&#xD;
