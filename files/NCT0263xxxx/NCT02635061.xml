&#xD;
          4. Patients must have histologically confirmed unresectable NSCLC for which nivolumab is&#xD;
             clinically appropriate. Patients must have had one line of prior therapy and have&#xD;
             progressed or have discontinued due to toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST&#xD;
             1.1) and Immune related Response Criteria (irRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1,&#xD;
             or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Willingness to have pre treatment and on treatment tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with the potential for pregnancy or impregnating their partner must agree to&#xD;
             follow acceptable birth control methods to avoid conception. Female patients of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive measures until 3&#xD;
             months after the last study drug is taken. Females of childbearing potential must have&#xD;
             a negative pregnancy test. It is not known if the antideacetylase activity of this&#xD;
             experimental drug may be harmful to the developing fetus or nursing infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Male patients should be willing to use barrier contraceptive (ie, condoms) until 3&#xD;
             months after last study drug is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that&#xD;
             would prevent the patient from giving informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any serious concurrent medical conditions, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness that might make the patient nonevaluable, put the patient's safety at risk, or&#xD;
             prevent the patient from following the study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnant or lactating females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with uncontrolled brain metastases. Existing brain metastases must have been&#xD;

             who have not recovered from AEs to ≤ Grade 1 due to agents administered more than 14&#xD;
             days earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Previous therapy with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and/or anti PD 1, anti PD&#xD;
             L1, or anti CTLA4 immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any of the following laboratory abnormalities:&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  AST or ALT &gt; 2.5 × ULN. For patients with liver metastasis AST or ALT &gt; 5 × ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 mg/dL or &gt; 3 × ULN for patients with hereditary&#xD;
                  benign hyperbilirubinemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Corrected QT interval (QTc) using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) value &gt; 480 msec at&#xD;

             treatment: major surgery, radiation therapy, and/or systemic therapy (standard or an&#xD;
             investigational or biological anticancer agent).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Current enrollment in another clinical study involving treatment and/or is receiving&#xD;
