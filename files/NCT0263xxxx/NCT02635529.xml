  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amniotic membrane may be considered as a biologically active scaffold, which in combination&#xD;
      with Bone Replacement Grafts (BRG) can be widely used to reconstruct periodontal Intrabony&#xD;
      Defects (IBDs), due to the presence of stem cells and growth factors. The goal of the present&#xD;
      study was to evaluate if a biologic AM in combination with DFDBA applied in periodontal IBDs&#xD;
      would enhance the regeneration of periodontium.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a bacterially induced inflammatory disease of the supporting tissues of the&#xD;
      teeth. It is one of the major dental diseases that affect human populations worldwide and has&#xD;
      a huge economic impact on national health care systems.The consequence of periodontitis is&#xD;
      commonly the formation of intrabony defects.Intrabony defects are more amenable for&#xD;
      regenerative procedures. Periodontal regeneration remains a fundamental therapeutic goal for&#xD;
      the preservation of teeth through the restoration of health, function, and esthetics of the&#xD;
      periodontium. Several treatment procedures like open flap debridement (OFD), autogenous bone&#xD;
      replacement bone grafts (BRG), guided tissue regeneration (GTR), bioactive agents like EMD,&#xD;
      rhPDGF-BB, laser assisted regeneration (LAR) have shown histologic proof of principle that&#xD;
      the periodontal ligament apparatus can be regenerated in human studies. Intrabony defects&#xD;
      with the depth of &gt;3 mm and radiographic defect angle â‰¤ 25 are amenable for periodontal&#xD;
      regeneration. DFDBA has stood the test of time and has shown consistent good quality patient&#xD;
      oriented evidence in achieving periodontal regeneration with long term stability. GTR&#xD;
      techniques have shown added advantage of space maintenance, clot stability, guided cell&#xD;
      population, epithelial cell occlusion and the combination therapies. Periodontal regeneration&#xD;
      with GTR and BRG demonstrates better results as compared with GTR alone. More recently in the&#xD;
      realm of reconstructive biology, the concept of Tissue engineering (TE) has been introduced&#xD;
      which utilizes mechanical, cellular or biologic mediators to facilitate&#xD;
      reconstruction/regeneration of a particular tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of this novel biologic membrane AM and the already established BRG-DFDBA can&#xD;
      be an added advantage in treatment of IBDs. To the best of the investigators knowledge only&#xD;
      one clinical trial reports this combination therapy in the scientific literature. There is a&#xD;
      need for further research in this area.&#xD;
