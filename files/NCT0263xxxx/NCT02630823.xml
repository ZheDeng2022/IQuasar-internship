  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the high expression of PD-L1 in endometrial cancers as well as in ovarian cancers&#xD;
      which are molecularly similar to uterine serous cancers, using pembrolizumab should be&#xD;
      beneficial in this patient population. Since the investigators are able to get a&#xD;
      pre-treatment research- related endometrial biopsy as well as the surgical specimen post two&#xD;
      cycles of pembrolizumab, the investigators will be able to evaluate the mechanism of action&#xD;
      of this drug on the endometrial cancer tumor environment.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will undergo endometrial biopsy followed by 2 doses of MK-3475 3 weeks apart. 3-4 weeks after the second dose of MK-3475, the standard of care surgical resection will take place, followed by standard of care adjuvant therapy. Tissue and blood will be collected at the time of surgical resection for immune analysis. For patients whose pathology confirms high-risk features and advanced stage, MK-3475 will be given every 3 weeks starting 4 -6 weeks after completion of adjuvant therapy for a maximum of 4 doses post-surgery.&#xD;
MK-3475 will be given intravenously at a dose of 200 mg over the course of 30 minutes.&#xD;
The standard of care chemotherapy will consist of 6 cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin AUC 5 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.&#xD;
The decision to administer radiation therapy will be per the treating physician. If the patient does not receive radiation therapy, then the patient will start MK-3475 every 3 weeks x 4 doses after the completion of chemotherapy.</description>
