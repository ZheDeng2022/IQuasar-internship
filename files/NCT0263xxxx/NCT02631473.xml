      This study is an open-label, prospective pharmacokinetic study investigating two&#xD;
      antiretroviral agents in parallel and employing an adaptive design with two stages, whereby&#xD;
      the results obtained in the primary stage inform the doses selected for investigation in the&#xD;
      secondary stage&#xD;

      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetics of a new pharmaceutical formulation of efavirenz&#xD;
           (NANO-efavirenz) in HIV negative healthy volunteers after single dose and a&#xD;
           steady-state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetics of a new pharmaceutical formulation of lopinavir&#xD;
           (NANO-lopinavir) in HIV negative healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of NANO-efavirenz and NANO-lopinavir in HIV&#xD;
           negative healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the bioequivalence of a selected single-dose of NANO-efavirenz to a single&#xD;
           dose 600mg of efavirenz as Sustiva®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms in drug disposition genes&#xD;
           and drug exposure&#xD;
