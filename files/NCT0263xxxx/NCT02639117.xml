    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 single site study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a combination&#xD;
      therapy that includes the administration of vismodegib and photodynamic therapy (PDT) using&#xD;
      aminolevulinic acid (20 percent ALA) for multiple basal cell carcinomas. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive vismodegib 150mg by mouth every day for 3 months, and undergo three PDT sessions with&#xD;
      topical application of ALA. The PDT will be first administered at 7+ 4 business days after&#xD;
      the beginning of the Erivedge and at 45 + 5 business days and then at 90 + 10 business days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of&#xD;
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) with vismodegib (combination therapy) for patients with multiple&#xD;
      BCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Secondary Objective To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) to the combination&#xD;
      therapy in patients with multiple BCCs.ORR is defined as the proportion of evaluable study&#xD;
      subjects who has complete or partial response to the study treatment.&#xD;

      Use of PDT for the treatment of BCC Indications for PDT include superficial and nodular BCC.&#xD;
      Eight randomized clinical trials have reported the results of PDT for superficial or nodular&#xD;
      BCC with a total of 1583 patients. Results of the meta analysis showed overall complete&#xD;
      clearance of PDT was 86.4 % compared to 98.2 % for surgery. The 1 year recurrence for PDT was&#xD;
      10.3 % vs 0. 6% for surgery. Cosmetic outcomes were much better with PDT than surgery. (Wang,&#xD;
      2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial of PDT with MAL versus surgical excision in 196 patients with&#xD;
      superficial BCC showed a 9.3% recurrence rate for PDT versus a 0% recurrence rate for surgery&#xD;
      at 12 months. However, the good-to-excellent cosmetic outcome was 94% and 60% for patients&#xD;
      treated with PDT and surgical excision, respectively. Similarly, in trials of PDT versus&#xD;
      surgery for nodular BCC, recurrence rates are less than 5% for surgery versus 14% to 30% for&#xD;
      PDT with ALA. As with superficial BCC, cosmetic effects are consistently shown to be more&#xD;
      favorable with PDT with ALA (Wang, 2015). In the largest single institution experience with&#xD;
      1440 nodular and superficial BCCs, PDT using systemically administered porfimer sodium showed&#xD;
      an initial (6-month) complete response rate of 92%, with a recurrence rate of less than 10%&#xD;
      at 4 years. At this same institution, a 92% complete response rate was achieved with PDT with&#xD;
      topical ALA in 330 patients with superficial BCC, but the response rate dropped to 71% in 75&#xD;
      patients with nodular BCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a multicenter randomized trial of PDT with MAL versus cryotherapy for superficial BCC,&#xD;
      complete response rates at 3 months were 97% and 95%, respectively, with 5-year recurrence&#xD;
      rates of 22% and 20% for PDT with MAL and cryotherapy, respectively. In this study, the&#xD;
      excellent-to-good cosmetic outcome was 89% for PDT with MAL and 50% for cryotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical studies have reported an increase in the initial response rate with a lower&#xD;
      recurrence rate after repeated PDT sessions. Initial responses usually are apparent between&#xD;
      3-6 months after treatment when the skin has healed over and treatment related changes have&#xD;
      resolved. Cycles of MAL PDT repeated after 3 months for persistent BCC has been shown to&#xD;
      offer high and durable response rates. Both efficacy and safety have also been demonstrated&#xD;
      using repeated sessions with red or blue light at follow up times of 3, 6 and 12 months. At&#xD;
      Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Oseroff and colleagues safely used repeated sessions of ALA&#xD;
      PDT in children with BCNS (multiple BCC), and Gilchrest also reported the benefits of ALA PDT&#xD;
      with red light at 2-4 month interval treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common adverse event with either ALA or MAL PDT is the burning or stinging pain&#xD;
      experienced by patients during illumination. Zeitouni and colleagues published their&#xD;
      retrospective and prospective data using a 2 step irradiance approach with ALA/MAL PDT and&#xD;
      red light in non BCNS patients with multiple BCC. Follow up times ranged from 6-24 months.&#xD;
      The 2 step irradiance schedule (bilevel) effectively minimized the treatment related pain and&#xD;
      maintained good clinical outcomes (Zeitouni x 2).&#xD;
