  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate a drug called AG-519, which is being developed for&#xD;
      the treatment of a disease called pyruvate kinase deficiency (also known as PK deficiency)&#xD;
      and other forms of anemia. This study is a 5 part study with Part 1 enrolling healthy&#xD;
      volunteers into single ascending dose (SAD) groups, Part 2 enrolling healthy volunteers into&#xD;
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) groups and Part 3 enrolling healthy volunteers to investigate&#xD;
      how much of the study drug is taken up by the body and how food affects the uptake of a&#xD;
      prototype formulation of AG-519, Part 4 enrolling healthy volunteers of Japanese origin to&#xD;
      compare to the results of subjects of non-Japanese origin, and Part 5 a non-randomized,&#xD;
      open-label, multiple dose study enrolling healthy volunteers to further investigate how much&#xD;
      of the study drug is taken up by the body when dosed over 14 days.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    Agios is no longer developing its second pyruvate kinase-R (PKR) activator, AG-519, and&#xD;
    withdrew its investigational new drug (IND) application in December 2016&#xD;
