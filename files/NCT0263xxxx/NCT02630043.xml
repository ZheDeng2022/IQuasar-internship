  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate an investigational drug (Tolcapone) alone&#xD;
      and in combination with oxaliplatin, for relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma. Tolcapone is&#xD;
      approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults, but is an investigational&#xD;
      drug in this study because it has not been approved in pediatrics for this indication.&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin, although a drug approved by the FDA for other cancers, is investigational for&#xD;
      treatment of neuroblastoma in this study. This study will look at the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of tolcapone in combination with oxaliplatin as well as the tumors response to this study&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;

          -  Subjects with CNS lesions are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of depression, anxiety, or psychotic disorders (due to&#xD;
