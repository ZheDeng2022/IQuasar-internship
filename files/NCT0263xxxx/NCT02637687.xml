  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being done to test the safety of a cancer drug called larotrectinib in children.&#xD;
      The cancer must have a change in a particular gene (NTRK1, NTRK2 or NTRK3). Larotrectinib&#xD;
      blocks the actions of these NTRK genes in cancer cells and can therefore be used to treat&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first study part (Phase 1) is done to determine what dose level of larotrectinib is safe&#xD;
      for children, how the drug is absorbed and changed by their bodies and how well the cancer&#xD;
      responds to the drug. The main purpose of the second study part (Phase 2) is to investigate&#xD;
      how well and how long different cancer types respond to the treatment with larotrectininb.&#xD;

      The primary objectives are to determine the safety and efficacy of oral larotrectinib in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with advanced solid or primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives comprise e.g. the determination of the pharmacokinetic properties,&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose/ recommended dose and the tumor-type specific efficacy of&#xD;
      larotrectinib. In addition, pain status and health-related quality of life of the pediatric&#xD;
      patients will be assessed.&#xD;
