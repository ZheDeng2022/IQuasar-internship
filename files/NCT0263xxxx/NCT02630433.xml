      There are controversies optimal timing for cholecystectomy in patients with mild biliary&#xD;
      pancreatitis. The safety of cholecystectomy performed during an episode of pancreatitis has&#xD;
      been questioned. The aim of the present randomized controlled trial is to compare the outcome&#xD;
      in terms of recurrent pancreatitis and gallstone-related events between index&#xD;
      cholecystectomy, performed during the first admission for acute pancreatitis, and scheduled&#xD;
      cholecystectomy, performed 4-6 weeks after discharge.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is still considerable debate regarding the optimal timing of cholecystectomy in mild&#xD;
      biliary pancreatitis. It is widely accepted to wait until the patient's clinical condition&#xD;
      allows performing cholecystectomy in severe biliary pancreatitis with systemic or local&#xD;
      complications. On the other hand, the recommendations are not very clear when it comes to&#xD;
      patients with mild biliary pancreatitis. The British Society of Gastroenterology and American&#xD;
      Gastroenterological Association guidelines recommendation is to perform cholecystectomy&#xD;
      within 2-to 4- week interval after the initial episode. However, the safety of&#xD;
      cholecystectomy performed during an episode of pancreatitis is also controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a systematic review the overall readmission rate was 18% after index cholecystectomy, 8%&#xD;
      for recurrent biliary pancreatitis, 3 % for acute cholecystitis and 7 % for biliary colic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study is performed as a Randomised controlled trials with two parallel arms and a&#xD;
      ratio of 1:1. Patients admitted with acute pancreatitis are checked for eligibility criteria&#xD;
      for the study. Mild pancreatitis is defined as pancreatitis without local complications such&#xD;
      as necrosis or organ failure. Patients who are eligible obtained oral and written information&#xD;
      about the study and invited to be included. Patients who accept participation sign a consent&#xD;
      form and are included. The included patients are randomized into index cholecystectomy (IC)&#xD;
      or scheduled cholecystectomy (SC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is done with a sealed envelope system. The allocation sequence is created by an&#xD;
      online random generator. There is no blocking. After randomization, the patient as well as&#xD;
      the responsible are immediately informed about the allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IC and SC are protocolled to be performed within 24-48 hours from randomization, and&#xD;
      after 6 weeks from discharge respectively. Daily blood samples, pain and well-being scores&#xD;
      are obtained during index admission until discharge, at 1-month follow-up for SC group and at&#xD;
      the scheduled cholecystectomy. Quality of life is assessed with SF-36 prior to randomization&#xD;
      and 4 weeks after inclusion. Pain is measured with the McGill Pain Questionnaire before&#xD;
      randomization and daily until discharge of two days after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation If IC reduces the risk of gallstone- or treatment-related adverse&#xD;
      events from 40% to 10%, a total sample of 32 patients in each group is required in order to&#xD;
      reach a chance of 80% of detecting a significant difference at the p&lt;0.05 level. In order to&#xD;
      compensate of drop-outs, a total sample of 70 is stipulated.&#xD;
