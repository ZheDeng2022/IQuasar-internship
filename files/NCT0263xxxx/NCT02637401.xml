  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar Disorders (BD) typically involve repeated episodes of both depression and excessively&#xD;
      high mood or irritability (hypomania or mania). BD presents considerable challenges for the&#xD;
      individual, his or her supporters, and society more generally. Medication is generally&#xD;
      considered to be the mainstay treatment, however a substantial number of individuals with BD&#xD;
      continue to experience episodes despite use of medication. Furthermore, ongoing mood&#xD;
      instability either outside of episodes, or as the main feature of their BD, is a significant&#xD;
      difficulty experienced by many. Whilst studies suggest that certain psychological therapies&#xD;
      can be helpful for people experiencing full bipolar episodes, or to reduce risk of future&#xD;
      episodes, there are no evidencebased psychological therapies available for individuals&#xD;
      experiencing ongoing mood instability. Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) was developed&#xD;
      several decades ago as an approach for people with Borderline Personality Disorder. DBT aims&#xD;
      to give individuals who experience rapid and intense shifts in affect skills for managing&#xD;
      this. Despite the many similarities in the symptoms experienced by individuals with&#xD;
      Borderline Personality Disorder and those with Bipolar Disorder only a small number of&#xD;
      studies have tested DBT for BD, and no studies to date have specifically investigated DBT as&#xD;
      a means to help individuals with ongoing mood instability. We have developed a version of&#xD;
      groupbased DBT that draws upon our own research to adapt standard DBT for this client group&#xD;
      (DBTBD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group is designed to be delivered efficiently within the U.K. healthcare system whilst&#xD;
      meeting the needs of individual participants through use of additional individual sessions&#xD;
      and a mobile phone application. The current study investigates how acceptable DBTBD is to&#xD;
      clinicians and patients, and whether - for the small number of individuals in the study&#xD;
      -changes in symptoms and key ways of thinking and behaving appear to take place across the&#xD;
      period of treatment.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria for patient participants are: i) aged 18 or over; i) meets DSMV criteria&#xD;
        for Bipolar Spectrum Disorder; iii) current bipolar mood instability (over the past two&#xD;
        years numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic&#xD;
        episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a&#xD;
        depressive episode, continuing into the past month); iv) client wishes to engage in&#xD;
        psychological therapy that focusses primarily on ongoing mood instability and its&#xD;
        consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria are: i) current substance dependence disorder; ii) currently receiving&#xD;
        other psychological therapy; iii) the patient is currently actively suicidal; iv)&#xD;
        presenting difficulties that are characteristic of Borderline Personality Disorder rather&#xD;
        than Bipolar Disorder and that would be an early treatment target in standard DBT (frequent&#xD;
        and serious deliberate selfharm, marked disturbance in ability to form or maintain&#xD;
        interpersonal relationships); v) presence of another area of difficulty that the therapist&#xD;
        and client believe should be the primary focus of intervention (for example panic disorder&#xD;
        with agoraphobia, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder); vi) the information available suggests&#xD;
        that the person may present a significant risk to other group members (such as aggression,&#xD;
        likelihood of carrying out sexual or other exploitation); vii) the person lacks capacity to&#xD;
        consent to treatment or research participation; viii) currently experiencing an episode of&#xD;
        mania.&#xD;
