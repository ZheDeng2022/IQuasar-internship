  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant mothers who develop high blood pressure and other vascular problems (preeclampsia)&#xD;
      deliver babies with increased neonatal health problems, which include lung disease and&#xD;
      vascular complications, later in life. Investigators will evaluate whether infants of mothers&#xD;
      with preeclampsia have evidence for impaired development of the lungs and blood vessels.&#xD;

      The overall objective of this study is to determine whether the anti-angiogenic environment&#xD;
      of preeclampsia results in pulmonary and vascular dysfunction in infants. Specifically, study&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the anti- angiogenic environment of preeclampsia will impair&#xD;
      pulmonary development and promote vascular dysfunction in infants. Furthermore, study&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that circulating progenitor cell (CPC) measurements in cord blood&#xD;
      will correlate with infant pulmonary (Aim #1) and systemic vascular (Aim #2) function. Study&#xD;
      investigators will determine whether the pro-angiogenic circulating progenitor cells (CPC)&#xD;
      versus non-circulating progenitor cells ratio in cord blood of pregnancies complicated by&#xD;
      preeclampsia predicts pulmonary diffusing capacity and systemic vascular dysfunction, as well&#xD;
      as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This research&#xD;
      represents an important translational study that extends observations made in pre-clinical&#xD;
      animal models that have clearly established a critical relationship between angiogenesis and&#xD;
      lung development. Preliminary data strongly suggest a relationship between pro-angiogenic&#xD;
      circulating progenitor cells (CPCs), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and pulmonary&#xD;
      diffusion in human infants. Investigators will evaluate whether circulating progenitor cells&#xD;
      (CPC)s are a biomarker for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), investigators will&#xD;
      relate circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) to the underlying pathophysiology, as assessed by&#xD;
      pulmonary function testing methods that we developed for this very difficult age group to&#xD;
      evaluate. A positive finding in the study would provide the rationale for future&#xD;
      translational studies evaluating the therapeutic potential of circulating progenitor cells&#xD;
      (CPCs) to stimulate lung development of premature infants, as there are currently no known&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions that minimize or prevent the development of bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      dysplasia (BPD). One of several approaches could be applied in the future to increase&#xD;
      circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) in premature infants: 1) pharmacologic mobilization of&#xD;
      pro-angiogenic cells from the bone marrow, 2) expansion of pro-angiogenic cells from an&#xD;
      infant's cord blood for autologous infusion, and 3) transfusion of pooled pro-angiogenic&#xD;
      cells from multiple donors.&#xD;
