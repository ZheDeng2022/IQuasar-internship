  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arterial hypertension (AH) is an important clinical social and economic problem, related to&#xD;
      the increased cardiovascular risk. AH is associated with cardiovascular hemodynamic&#xD;
      alterations, including left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVddf). In consequence of&#xD;
      increased blood pressure, the effectiveness of LV as a blood pump decreases and the symptoms&#xD;
      of heart failure (HF) may occur. Thus, the identification of noninvasive markers related with&#xD;
      the progression from the asymptomatic AH to LVddf/HFpEF would be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another issue is that the diagnostic difficulties in patients with LVddf and HFpEF stem from&#xD;
      the limited possibility to assess the hemodynamic response to exercise. Thus, there is a need&#xD;
      for more detailed methods of cardiovascular monitoring while exercise testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that some new noninvasive hemodynamic parameters, characterizing left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) function and arterial stiffness, may help to predict the risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and future occurrence of LVddf/HFpEF. Moreover, we assume that&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), completed with new methods of noninvasive hemodynamic&#xD;
      monitoring (impedance cardiography and applanation tonometry), would provide additional value&#xD;
      in the assessment of the cardiovascular hemodynamic response to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is intended to verify these hypothesis.&#xD;

      Arterial hypertension (AH) is an important clinical social and economic problem, related to&#xD;
      the increased cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AH is associated with cardiovascular hemodynamic alterations, including left ventricular&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction (LVddf). In consequence of increased blood pressure, the effectiveness&#xD;
      of LV as a blood pump decreases and the symptoms of heart failure (HF), even with preserved&#xD;
      ejection fraction (HFpEF), may occur. At the early stage, patients' complaints are not&#xD;
      specific and difficult to clinical interpretation. As a consequence, these subjects&#xD;
      frequently remain undiagnosed. Thus, the identification of noninvasive markers related with&#xD;
      the progression from the asymptomatic AH to LVddf/HFpEF would be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another issue is that the diagnostic difficulties in patients with LVddf and HFpEF stem from&#xD;
      the limited possibility to assess the hemodynamic response to exercise. Thus, there is a need&#xD;
      for more detailed methods of cardiovascular monitoring while exercise testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that some new noninvasive hemodynamic parameters,&#xD;
      characterizing left ventricular (LV) function and arterial stiffness, may help to predict the&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular events and future occurrence of LVddf/HFpEF. Moreover, the&#xD;
      investigators assume that cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), completed with new methods of&#xD;
      noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring (impedance cardiography and applanation tonometry), would&#xD;
      provide additional value in the assessment of the cardiovascular hemodynamic response to&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The identification of the new markers of cardiovascular risk in patients with arterial&#xD;
           hypertension..&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The identification of the new markers of progression from normal left ventricular&#xD;
           diastolic function to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The identification of the new noninvasive markers of progression to symptomatic heart&#xD;
           failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The evaluation of the feasibility and usefulness of new methods of noninvasive&#xD;
           hemodynamic monitoring (impedance cardiography and applanation tonometry) in the&#xD;
           assessment of the cardiovascular hemodynamic response to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Multivariate assessment of cardiovascular response to the controlled exercise, taking&#xD;
           into account left ventricular diastolic function and symptoms of heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The relation between laboratory markers of left ventricular remodeling with resting and&#xD;
           exercise (noninvasive) hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in a prospective and observational design. No less than 120&#xD;
      hypertensive subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recruitment the following assessment will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anamnesis and physical examination with anthropometrics (including body composition&#xD;
           analysis with use of bioimpedance method);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  electrocardiogram;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  echocardiography (resting), including assessment of left ventricular systolic (2-D left&#xD;
           ventricular ejection fraction, longitudinal strain) and diastolic function (including&#xD;
           tissue Doppler imaging);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  impedance cardiography (resting);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Applanation tonometry (resting);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-h Holter-ekg (including heart rate variability analysis);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  flow-mediated dilation of brachial artery (FMD);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-minute walking test (6-MWT);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), supported by hemodynamic monitoring with impedance&#xD;
           cardiography and applanation tonometry;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life assessment (SF 36 questionnaire);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory tests (including creatinine, urea, uric acid, lipids, glucose,&#xD;
           microalbuminuria, N-terminal of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide, galectin-3,&#xD;
           copeptin, soluble ST2, Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), human tissue inhibitor&#xD;
           of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), metalloproteinase 9&#xD;
           (MMP-9), syndecan-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 12 months (first control visit) and 24 months (second control visit) the&#xD;
      echocardiography and clinical assessment (HF symptoms) will be performed to identify: 1/&#xD;
      patients with new onset LVDdf (among group N); 2/ patients with new onset HF (among group D)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morover, the follow-up of min 48 months concerning cardiovascular events will be performed&#xD;
      (as defined below)&#xD;
