    <textblock>
      Legitimized by the Leonetti law of April 22, 2005, advance directives (AD) appear in various&#xD;
      places of care that alongside the end of life, and even tend to be generalized to all areas&#xD;
      related to health care in general. In this context, a prospective study to assess how the&#xD;
      patient will seize the AD and identify the different problems writing these AD will be&#xD;
      conducted. From this study, it will establish recommendations for the implementation of AD in&#xD;
      the Multidisciplinary Oncology Department and Therapeutic Innovations service and in oncology&#xD;
      in general. They will be asked patients if they choose to write their AD, complete and sign&#xD;
      the AD pre-written in the book or not to draft their AD. The choice of the patients, but also&#xD;
      the reasons they associate thereto and, where appropriate, their AD written will be&#xD;
      collected. The patient will also inform its demographic and socio the case report (clinical&#xD;
      data) should be completed by the investigator. During the first part of research, the use of&#xD;
      AD by patients and will be assessed and analyzed in connection with the characteristics of&#xD;
      these patients (history of the disease, course of care, socio-demographic) and the reasons&#xD;
      they set out to explain their choice. For those who write their AD, they will, in a second&#xD;
      step, subject to thematic content analysis to identify the main aspects that the subject&#xD;
      convened to consider its end of life.This research therefore lead to the definition of the&#xD;
      contours of a user device AD in oncology in general. This study was qualified biomedical&#xD;
      research because of the sensitive nature of the study population and bring the patient to&#xD;
      personal preoccupations when filling the questionnaire on the choice of directing advance&#xD;
      directives and their contents.&#xD;
