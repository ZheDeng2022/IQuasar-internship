  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are limited prospective data regarding the potential benefit and risks associated with&#xD;
      switching between anti-VEGF therapies in patients with nAMD who have initially achieved a&#xD;
      favorable response to the first anti-VEGF therapy used but subsequently have evidence of&#xD;
      increasing disease activity despite continuation of therapy. This study will fill this&#xD;
      knowledge gap by prospectively evaluating the effectiveness and safety of switching from&#xD;
      aflibercept to ranibizumab in nAMD patients that have non - sustained response to initial&#xD;
      treatment with aflibercept.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence, at Screening, of active, angiographically confirmed Choroidal&#xD;
             Neovascularization (CNV) secondary to AMD, directly or indirectly affecting the center&#xD;
             of the fovea in study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior anti-VEGF treatment other than aflibercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack or myocardial&#xD;
             infarction within 3 months of the Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any type of systemic disease or its treatment, including any medical condition&#xD;
             (controlled or uncontrolled) that could be expected to progress, recur, or change to&#xD;
             such an extent that it may bias the assessment of the clinical status of the patient&#xD;
             to a significant degree or put the patient at special risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for ocular medical history and conditions for either eye:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any active periocular or ocular infection, or active intraocular inflammation at the&#xD;
             time of Screening or Baseline (as per contraindications in the Lucentis® Product&#xD;
             Monograph).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma (intraocular pressure [IOP] ≥30 mm Hg on medication or according&#xD;
             to Investigator's judgment) at the time of Screening or Baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of bilateral active CNV during the Screening Period or at Baseline requiring&#xD;
             bilateral anti-VEGF injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior intravitreal injection of ranibizumab or bevacizumab into the study eye and/or&#xD;
             prior intravitreal injection of bevacizumab into the fellow eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study eye exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At Baseline, intraocular surgery was performed within the previous 28 days or&#xD;
             intraocular surgery is planned at any time during the 6 month study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cataract (if causing significant visual impairment), aphakia, severe vitreous&#xD;
             hemorrhage, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, proliferative retinopathy or choroidal&#xD;
             neovascularization of any other cause than wet AMD (e.g. ocular histoplasmosis,&#xD;
             pathologic myopia (≥-8 dioptres)) at the time of Screening and Baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Irreversible structural damage involving the center of the fovea (e.g. advanced&#xD;
             fibrosis or geographic atrophy) which in the opinion of the Investigator is sufficient&#xD;
             to irreversibly impair visual acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), RPE tear, central serous retinopathy (CSR),&#xD;
             or significant vitreomacular traction identified during Screening period or within 4&#xD;
             months of Baseline visit. Note that small vitreomacular adhesions that do not result&#xD;
             in deformity of the retina are permitted.&#xD;
