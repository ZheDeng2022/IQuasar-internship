  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2012, the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) issued guidance to clarify&#xD;
      the principal benefit-risk factors FDA considers during the reviews for premarket approval&#xD;
      applications and de novo classification requests. In addition to a detailed description of&#xD;
      benefits and risks, CDRH listed &quot;patient tolerance for risk and perspective on benefit&quot; as a&#xD;
      factor that CDRH may consider in regulatory reviews. It underlined the need for developing&#xD;
      methods to measure patient preference and incorporate it into regulatory decision-making. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to advance methods for patient and community engagement in&#xD;
      patient-centered outcome research (PCOR) and has three objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, demonstrate good practices for patient and community involvement in PCOR projects by&#xD;
      applying principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, address methodological gaps pertaining to the use of stated-preference methods in&#xD;
      studying priorities in PCOR. These include identifying the best methods for identifying&#xD;
      patient priorities and strategies for analyzing variation in priorities. The investigators&#xD;
      also seek to assess the relevance of stated-preference methods to patients and stakeholders&#xD;
      using both qualitative and quantitative methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, demonstrate good practices for applying stated-preference methods by studying the&#xD;
      priorities of patients with type II diabetes. While type II diabetes provides an important&#xD;
      case study, this research will advance approaches and methods that will be broadly&#xD;
      generalizable to other diseases, and to diverse patient and stakeholder groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will illustrate and advance methods for assessing the values of patients and&#xD;
      stakeholders. It will demonstrate how CBPR methods apply to PCOR studies and the value of&#xD;
      stated-preference methods in measuring the priorities of patients and stakeholders and&#xD;
      directing health care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study will apply the principles of CBPR to involve patients and stakeholders associated&#xD;
      with a local community board and a national diabetes advisory board in key decisions in the&#xD;
      project. During year 1, the investigators will utilize mixed methods to develop, pretest, and&#xD;
      pilot the survey instruments to assess the priorities of patients with type II diabetes. In&#xD;
      year 2, the investigators plan further engagement to finalize the survey instruments, and&#xD;
      will implement a nationally representative, racially/ethnically diverse sample of patients&#xD;
      with type II diabetes. Based on further consultation, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      statistical analysis, including stratified analyses and segmentation of patients with similar&#xD;
      priorities. In year 3, mixed methods will be applied to assess beliefs of patients and other&#xD;
      consumers about the relevance of this work and its generalizability to other PCOR topics.&#xD;
      Finally, lay language reports will be developed to highlight patient and stakeholder&#xD;
      engagement and the application of stated-preference methods to the study of the priorities of&#xD;
      patients with type II diabetes.&#xD;
