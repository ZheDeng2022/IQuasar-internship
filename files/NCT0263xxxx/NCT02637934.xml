  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 30 women with known or suspected epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer will participate in two different imaging cohorts. The Biodistribution&#xD;
      cohort will include up to 10 patients and the Dynamic cohort will include up to 20 patients.&#xD;
      Human dosimetry will be calculated from the Biodistribution cohort. The Dynamic cohort date&#xD;
      will evaluate preliminary information on uptake of [18F]FTT in gynecological cancer and&#xD;
      compare with PARP-1 activity in tissue.&#xD;
