      The primary objective is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of gabapentin following the&#xD;
      single-dose administration of HORIZANT (Gabapentin Enacarbil) in adolescents (13 to 17 years&#xD;
      of age) diagnosed with moderate-to-severe Primary Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS).&#xD;

      One-treatment, 1-period study in adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) diagnosed with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe primary RLS. Patients will check-in at the clinical site in the evening of&#xD;
      Day -1 or the morning of Day 0, and baseline safety assessments will be performed. On Day 0,&#xD;
      after the review of these safety assessments and confirmation of eligibility, patients will&#xD;
      receive a single oral 300 mg dose of HORIZANT with a meal (at approximately 6 AM). Study&#xD;
      assessments will continue until approximately 14 hours (h) post dose, at which time patients&#xD;
      will be discharged. Prior to discharge, patients will be advised not to drive a car or&#xD;
      operate other complex machinery for at least 30 h after dosing; therefore, patients can&#xD;
      remain at the clinical site overnight or can be escorted home. Patients will return to the&#xD;
      clinical site for a follow-up visit 7 days (Â± 1 day) post dose.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and female adolescent patients, aged 13 to 17 years, diagnosed with RLS based on&#xD;
             the IRLSSG consensus criteria, which is presented in Appendix 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Total RLS severity score of 15 or greater on the IRLS rating scale at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body weight greater than 33.4 kg and a healthy weight using age-based body mass index&#xD;
             (BMI) range 5th to 85th percentile. Appendix 3 contains BMI-for-age charts that can be&#xD;
             consulted.&#xD;

             childbearing potential must agree to use one of the following acceptable birth control&#xD;
             methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months prior to dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. barrier methods (male condom, female condom, diaphragm or cervical cap) with&#xD;

                  use effective methods of birth control as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Male patients able to father a child must agree to use a barrier method (male condom,&#xD;
             female condom, diaphragm or cervical cap) with spermicide for at least 30 days prior&#xD;
             to dosing and throughout the study. Male patients who normally abstain from sexual&#xD;
             activity may be recruited providing they remain abstinent during the study, or if they&#xD;
             become sexually active, they must agree to use a barrier method as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Signed patient/parent Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed&#xD;

             of RLS (eg, Tourette's syndrome, tic disorder, periodic limb movement disorder [PLMD],&#xD;
             sleep disorders).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Currently meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fifth Edition&#xD;
             (DSM-5) criteria for substance use disorder, or history thereof, within 12 months&#xD;
             prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current or past history of any significant psychiatric disorder including but not&#xD;

             schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation as indicated by the Columbia Suicide&#xD;
             Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), administered at screening (the questionnaire is&#xD;
             presented in Appendix 4), and as per investigator's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of seizure disorder or at increased risk for development of a seizure&#xD;

             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of gabapentin enacarbil, or, in the&#xD;
             investigator's judgment is considered to be clinically significant and may pose a&#xD;
             safety concern, or, could interfere with the accurate assessment of safety or&#xD;
             efficacy, or could potentially affect a patient's safety or study outcome.&#xD;
