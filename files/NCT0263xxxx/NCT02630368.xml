      For the phase I study, this is a prospective open-label phase I trial based on a dose&#xD;
      escalating study design assessing two dose level of JX-594 when associated to metronomic&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the phase II study, two distincts treatment strategies will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, treatment by JX-594 and metronomic cyclophosphamide:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stratum soft-tissue sarcoma, this is a monocenter, randomized non comparative phase II&#xD;
           clinical trial. This phase II trial was based on an optimal 2-stage Simon's design.&#xD;
           Randomization 2:1 with 2 patients randomized in experimental arm n°1 (association of&#xD;
           metronomic cyclophosphamide and JX-594) and 1 patient randomized in control arm n°2&#xD;
           (treatment by metronomic cyclophosphamide alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stratum breast cancer, this is a monocenter, one-arm phase II clinical trial, based on&#xD;
           two-stage optimal Simon's design (association of metronomic cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
           JX-594).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, treatment by Avelumab, intratumoral JX-594 and metronomic cyclophosphamide:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stratum soft-tissue sarcoma, this is a monocenter, single arm phase II clinical trial&#xD;
           based on an optimal 2-stage Simon's design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stratum breast cancer, this is a monocenter, one-arm phase II clinical trial, based on&#xD;
           two-stage optimal Simon's design).&#xD;
