    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of idasanutlin and ixazomib&#xD;
      citrate when given together with dexamethasone in treating patients with multiple myeloma&#xD;
      that has returned after a period of improvement. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      idasanutlin and dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Ixazomib citrate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving idasanutlin, ixazomib citrate, and dexamethasone&#xD;
      together may work better in treating patients with multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of idasanutlin and ixazomib (ixazomib&#xD;
      citrate) to be used in combination with dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma with TP53 (17p) deletion. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the confirmed response&#xD;
      rate of ixazomib and idasanutlin used in combination with dexamethasone in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with TP53 (17p) deletion. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the toxicities and the confirmed response rate associated with the combination&#xD;
      of idasanutlin, ixazomib and dexamethasone. (Phase I) II. To describe the toxicities&#xD;
      associated with the combination of idasanutlin, ixazomib and dexamethasone. (Phase II) III.&#xD;
      To describe the complete response (CR) and very good partial response (VGPR) rates. (Phase&#xD;
      II) IV. To assess progression-free and overall survival. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess murine double minute 2 (MDM2) inhibition in bone marrow plasma cells. II. Identify&#xD;
      potential biomarkers associated with response. III. To explore the pharmacodynamic effects of&#xD;
      idasanutlin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of idasanutlin and ixazomib citrate&#xD;
      followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15 and idasanutlin PO once&#xD;
      daily (QD) on days 1-5 every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients also receive dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 28 days for&#xD;
      12 courses at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 3 months,&#xD;
      and then every 6 months.&#xD;
