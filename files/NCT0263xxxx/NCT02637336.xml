      The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute cardiovascular responses in hypertensive&#xD;
      individuals, in waking and sleeping periods after application of different&#xD;
      non-pharmacological therapies for the control of blood pressure (BP). Randomly and random&#xD;
      volunteers held a session of each therapy: Acupuncture, aerobic exercise, essential oil&#xD;
      inhalation, and session control with a minimum interval of 72 hours between them. On the day&#xD;
      of sessions the volunteers did not use antihypertensive medication. The variables measured in&#xD;
      the survey were the blood pressure and heart rate variability (HRV). Descriptive statistical&#xD;
      averaging procedures, standard deviation and standard error of mean were adopted. Two-way&#xD;
      ANOVA for repeated measures was performed post-hoc Tukey. The level of the study significance&#xD;
      was set at p &lt;0.05.&#xD;

      This study deals with a controlled trial and randomized crossover, with intentional&#xD;
      non-probabilistic sample. All participants were informed of the procedures adopted in the&#xD;
      research, and then signed the Informed Consent and Informed (IC) according to the resolution&#xD;
      466/12 of the National Health Council (Annex 1). The initial recruitment of volunteers was&#xD;
      held in October 2014 with the initial assessments being carried out in the same month, after&#xD;
      the project is approved by the Ethics Committee and Ethics Studies and Research of the&#xD;
      Federal University of São Francisco Valley under the registration number 0010 / 240914 CEDEP&#xD;
      / UNIVASF, and data collection with volunteers was completed in July 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plant material of Eucalyptus globulus was collected in January and May 2015 in the city&#xD;
      Petrolina, Pernambuco state, Brazil. The process of extraction of essential oil of&#xD;
      eucalyptus, made by hydrodistillation method by Clevenger system. To set the number of survey&#xD;
      participants was conducted sample calculation by G.Power 3.0 program where the F test was&#xD;
      chosen - two-way ANOVA for repeated measures between groups and within the group. Whereas&#xD;
      four (04) experimental sessions and eighteen (18) measures time for each session, as well as&#xD;
      α = 0.05 and power = 0.80, the sample size of 12 subjects was required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomly recruited in health centers in the city of Petrolina / PE through&#xD;
      disclosure / meeting to present the research project, in addition to the collaboration of&#xD;
      health workers from surrounding neighborhoods to UNIVASF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were divided into blocks in accordance with CONSORT criteria. Initially, the&#xD;
      research project, along with the IC, was presented to each of the candidates to volunteer,&#xD;
      with discussion of the risks and benefits, both scientific and individual would be likely to&#xD;
      compose the study sample. After agreeing on participation, and application of history about&#xD;
      health history, readiness for exercise and risk stratification according to guidelines from&#xD;
      the American College of Sports Medicine, the informed consent was signed, and then scheduled&#xD;
      with the volunteer the day and time of the completion of resting ECG examination (held in a&#xD;
      large hospital in Petrolina / PE and funded by the researchers), to check for possible&#xD;
      abnormalities and ischemia suggestion above or below unevenness in the ST segment&gt; 2 mm or&#xD;
      inversion of the T wave. All ECG's 12-lead were performed and evaluated by a cardiologist,&#xD;
      where no examination apesentou suggestion ischemia or abnormality that would prevent&#xD;
      volunteer to carry out all stages of safely search. After meeting and selection of the sample&#xD;
      in accordance with the guidelines on inclusion profile, participants were invited to attend&#xD;
      the morning to CEFIS of UNIVASF to carry out the anthropometric measurements (height, weight,&#xD;
      body mass index, waist circumference and body fat percentage), and schedule for the start of&#xD;
      the experimental sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers had the orientation to suspend the anti-hypertensive medication on the day of each&#xD;
      session, and only return to use after the removal of equipment (next day) by the researcher.&#xD;
      In addition to this recommendation, the volunteers should not eat on the day of the&#xD;
      interventions, substances that contain caffeine, alcohol, chocolate, tea, passion fruit or&#xD;
      any other stimulant or CNS retardant, but the eating routine should be followed. The practice&#xD;
      of physical activity, including sexual, was banned in the days that applied sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On different days, with an interval of at least 72 hours, and in a randomized order,&#xD;
      acupuncture, aerobic exercise, inhalation of essential oil of eucalyptus, and control were&#xD;
      applied. In order to minimize the influence of the circadian rhythm, the sessions were always&#xD;
      made at the same time of day (between 8 am and 9 am). Each treatment lasted for twenty (20)&#xD;
      minutes. The living laboratory procedures was controlled temperature between 23 ° C and 24 °&#xD;
      C for all sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acupuncture session (ACUP) were placed, and maintained for 20 minutes so perpendicularly&#xD;
      to the skin, two specific needles, stainless steel, sterilized and disposable (one on each&#xD;
      arm) of 0.25mm brand Dongbang x 0.30 mm, in Section 6 of the pericardium channel (Neiguan),&#xD;
      located 2 tsun (approximately 5 cm) proximal to the crease of the wrist, ventral aspect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aerobic exercise session (EXER) was conducted through 20-minute walk or jog on a&#xD;
      treadmill of CEFISE brand, model TK30 (Campinas, BRA). The intensity was equivalent to 60% of&#xD;
      the RHR (maximal HR - resting HR x 0.6 + HR rest).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In session eucalyptus essential oil (OIL) the subject sat, as in the rest time, and remained&#xD;
      breathing naturally for 20 minutes with a disposable face mask, soaked in 0.25 ml of&#xD;
      essential oil of eucalyptus measured by Adjustable Pipettor Kacil DSA ® Model 100 / 1000μl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The session control (CONT) volunteers remained seated on standing for 20 minutes in the same&#xD;
      manner and same chair used in acupuncture and inhalation of essential oils, but without&#xD;
      performing any treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BP was assessed by ABPM device brand Meditech ABPM-04 (Micromed, BRA). The contents of&#xD;
      the BP analyzed in this study were: systolic BP (SBP); Diastolic BP (DBP); BP Average (PAM),&#xD;
      as follows: MAP = DAP + [(PAS-DAP) / 3]; Pressure overload (percentage&gt; 125/75 mmHg in 24&#xD;
      hours;&gt; 130 / 85mmHg in the Vigil and&gt; 110/70 in Sleep, respectively for SBP and DBP); Night&#xD;
      decline (relative percentage difference between the average sleep BP and the BP in the wake&#xD;
      average). The measurements were taken every 15 minutes during daytime and every 30 minutes&#xD;
      during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRV was analyzed through the records of RRi intervals obtained by heart rate monitor brand&#xD;
      Polar RS800CX model (Polar Electro Oy, FI-90440 KEMPELE, Finland) and this validated&#xD;
      equipment and high reproducibility. The HRV indexes were analyzed by linear methods in the&#xD;
      time domain (RRi, RMSSD, pNN50) and frequency (LF, HF and LF: HF), and the non-linear method&#xD;
      by the standard deviation of RRI intervals (SD1). Records of RRi series were captured and&#xD;
      recorded on the watch belonging to the equipment, continuously throughout the period of the&#xD;
      day after the session, and analyzed using the software Kubios v. 2.0 at intervals of 5&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistical averaging procedures, standard deviation (SD) and standard error of&#xD;
      the mean (SEM) was adopted. Shapiro-Wilk test for normality analysis was used, and in case of&#xD;
      normality given a two-way ANOVA for repeated measures was performed post-hoc Tukey. For&#xD;
      non-parametric data we used nonparametric ANOVA for analysis. The level of the study&#xD;
      significance was set at p &lt;0.05, using the Statistica software version 7.0.&#xD;
