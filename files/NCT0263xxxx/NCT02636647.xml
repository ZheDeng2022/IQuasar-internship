      Randomized, open-label safety, tolerability study with exploratory endpoints and&#xD;
      pathophysiological evaluation of the FMT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of outpatients with cirrhosis will be randomized using random sequence generator&#xD;
      into no-treatment and FMT groups.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group 1 (FMT group) will undergo the following procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-FMT preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will obtain written informed consent per the IRB guidelines. After the patients are&#xD;
      consented and are eligible, we will perform a detailed medical history and physical exam at&#xD;
      day 0. We will also perform cognitive testing. As in prior studies, we will prescribe&#xD;
      patients an antibiotic regimen. Drawing from ecological principles of microbial niche&#xD;
      environments and data from recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, pre-treatment&#xD;
      antibiotics are likely to increase the probability of disrupting the hosts intrinsic&#xD;
      microbiota and creating an opportunity for a 'healthy' microbiota from the FMT to engraft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After antibiotics and on the day of FMT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At day 5, we will re-evaluate patients with a directed interval history and focused physical&#xD;
      exam as needed. After ensuring that they are still candidates according to the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, we will collect stool, urine and blood again for pre-FMT&#xD;
      evaluation and urine for pregnancy tests from eligible women. Cognitive testing will be&#xD;
      performed again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation and handling of stool for FMT infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard protocol for handling bio-hazardous material will be employed in order to avoid&#xD;
      contamination and risk to healthcare handlers. Sterile microbiological technique will be&#xD;
      employed during material transfer peri-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At that point we will provide the fecal material using universal precautions to a standard&#xD;
      retention enema bag. The procedure will be completed by a trained Registered Nurse, Nurse&#xD;
      practitioner, or physician in an outpatient clinic, endoscopy recovery area, or standard&#xD;
      endoscopy unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be recorded in all FMTs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unit ID/Lot# of each treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expiration Date&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Storage Condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FMT retention time (in minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of FMT: One administration Duration of Follow-up after FMT: 5 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up after FMT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will see the patient in clinic the day following FMT (day 6 or FMT+1), day 12 (FMT+7), day&#xD;
      20 (FMT+15), and day 35 (FMT+30), at which point a detailed history regarding abdominal&#xD;
      symptoms, evaluation of infectious complications, hospitalizations or complications of&#xD;
      cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits on day 6, day 12 and day 35 will be purely safety associated while, on the day 20&#xD;
      visit, we will repeat the pathophysiological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure that we have enough samples, in case patients are not able to return at&#xD;
      day 20, we will also collect all samples at day 12, but will only analyze them in case the&#xD;
      day 20 visit does not occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These visits, apart from the visit after FMT, will be Â±2 days for patient convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 5 months post-FMT, subjects will be followed up with a phone call to evaluate potential&#xD;
      SAEs, new onset of transmitted infections, new onset or significant worsening of chronic&#xD;
      medical conditions or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions that have occurred in&#xD;
      between 35 days and 5 months for reporting purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples collected at baseline (before FMT), after antibiotics and at day 15 will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stool&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Urine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: No treatment arm The group 2 will undergo all sample collections, follow-up and&#xD;
      cognitive testing as in group 1 but without the 5-day antibiotic therapy or the FMT. In&#xD;
      addition, we will also not perform the sample collection that is done after 5 days of&#xD;
      antibiotics in this group since no reasonable change in microbiota are expected over 5 days&#xD;
      without antibiotics. The follow-up of this group will be same as that of the FMT group.&#xD;
