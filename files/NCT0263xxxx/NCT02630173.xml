      Title: EVALUATION OF ENDODONTIC STATUS ON PERIODONTAL HEALING OF CONCOMITANT ENDODONTIC&#xD;
      PERIODONTAL LESIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although deleterious effects of endodontic tissue on the periodontium are well documented,&#xD;
      the converse effect of periodontal disease on pulp remains unclear. There is abundance of&#xD;
      research on the avenues of communication but still many doubts exist. High prevalence of&#xD;
      accessory canals has been seen but not all primary endodontic lesions drain through the&#xD;
      periodontal ligament. Many endodontic lesions are more prone to drain through cortical bone&#xD;
      rather than through the periodontal ligament. It may be because of the nature of&#xD;
      periradicular lesions which initially try to expand horizontally through cancellous bone and&#xD;
      then progressing vertically. Evidence also suggests that endodontically treated teeth lack&#xD;
      the same proprioceptive capability as endodontically untreated teeth so they may be subjected&#xD;
      to greater occlusal forces. More forces could enhance the propagation of fracture lines along&#xD;
      the root surface, resulting in more periodontal attachment loss. Also teeth associated with&#xD;
      either root perforations or fractures appear to follow periodontal drainage routes whereas&#xD;
      lesions of primarily pulpal origin seem to remain localized or drain through cortical bone.&#xD;
      Many explanations are provided, firstly periodontal ligament may be resistant to bacterial&#xD;
      insult of endodontic origin, or injuries originating through mechanical trauma are faintly&#xD;
      recognized, causing a subtle attachment loss occurring secondary to routine endodontic&#xD;
      disease. Another explanation could be that the main or accessory canals might not be the solo&#xD;
      and most important route of communication and endodontic infection might also proceed along&#xD;
      cervically located dentinal tubules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of retrospective and experimental studies in the past demonstrated the effect of&#xD;
      endodontic infection on periodontal status and healing. A series of retrospective studies&#xD;
      performed on single rooted teeth of periodontitis prone patients correlated endodontic&#xD;
      infection with periodontal status in terms of pocket depth and attachment loss. Teeth with&#xD;
      periapical radiolucency demonstrated deeper pockets and more radio graphic attachment loss as&#xD;
      compared to a healthy tooth. Non surgical periodontal treatment with horizontal defects&#xD;
      depicted reduced mean pocket depth reduction and increased radio graphic attachment loss in&#xD;
      teeth with periapical pathology in comparison with endodontically intact tooth. Even multi&#xD;
      rooted teeth with periapical destruction in periodontitis prone patients exhibited&#xD;
      significantly greater mean probing depth compared to teeth without periapical destruction.&#xD;
      Mandibular molars with periapical destruction showed ≥ 3 mm horizontal furcation depth. In&#xD;
      all these studies periodontal parameters of teeth (either root filled or with a periapical&#xD;
      radiolucency) were compared with an endodontically intact tooth also present in the patients&#xD;
      without any consideration of quality of obturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has denoted that endodontic treatment influences the periodontal healing and&#xD;
      periodontal status of tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced healing potential of the periodontal structures by endodontic treatment was evident&#xD;
      in human studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endodontic infection is a local modifying risk factor is based on retrospective studies&#xD;
      experimental studies. Prospective studies have been carried out to evaluate effect of&#xD;
      endodontic treatment on periodontal healing only. The present understanding on the effect of&#xD;
      endodontic status on periodontal status and healing is mainly based on retrospective studies&#xD;
      where numbers of variables evaluated are limited with a low level of reliability. They lack&#xD;
      the power to accept or reject any hypothesis. The retrospective studies had no control on&#xD;
      quality of obturation and lacked standardization of radiographs. Moreover the experimental&#xD;
      studies were conducted in extreme conditions and lacked similarity to clinical conditions. No&#xD;
      prospective study has yet compared the periodontal status as well as periodontal healing in&#xD;
      untreated non vital teeth and successfully endodontically treated teeth with contralateral&#xD;
      vital teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of untreated endodontic infection on&#xD;
      periodontal status in untreated non vital teeth with periapical radiolucency as compared to&#xD;
      contralateral vital teeth. And also to evaluate the role of endodontic treatment on&#xD;
      periodontal healing in successfully endodontically treated teeth with contralateral vital&#xD;
      teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with the diagnosis of generalized chronic periodontitis were screened for a non&#xD;
      vital tooth with periapical radiolucency that also had contralateral vital tooth with normal&#xD;
      periapical conditions in the radio graph. A split mouth design was followed with non vital&#xD;
      tooth with periapical radiolucency (test group 1) and a contralateral vital tooth (test&#xD;
      group2) present in each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Site specific clinical parameters like probing depth, clinical attachment loss, bleeding&#xD;
           on probing, plaque score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Digital radio graphic evaluation was done by taking intra oral periapical radiographs.&#xD;
           Bone level and periapical score was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up of patients was done at 1, 3 and 6 months to evaluate the improvement in&#xD;
      periodontal parameters and PAI score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endodontic treatment protocol: Using a standardized protocol root canal treatment was&#xD;
      performed by a single operator for all cases. Initially local anesthesia was provided (2%&#xD;
      Novocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine), isolation was achieved by rubber dam and standard&#xD;
      access cavity preparation was done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using 3 % sodium hypochlorite, canal negotiation was done &amp; apical patency was achieved with&#xD;
      #10 or #15K-files. Coronal flaring was created with # 2 and #3 Gates-Glidden drills (Dentsply&#xD;
      Maillefer, Tulsa, OK). With the help of a Root-ZX apex locator working length of each canal&#xD;
      was established (J Morita, Irwine, CA) and then verified with radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A crown down technique for canal instrumentation was followed using hand K files. The master&#xD;
      apical file size was set at 3 sizes larger than the first binding file at working length.&#xD;
      Instrumentation was accompanied with copious irrigation of 3% sodium hypochlorite using 27&#xD;
      gauge needles. Calcium hydroxide was filled in the canals with the help of a lentulo spiral&#xD;
      and patients were scheduled for a second appointment to complete root canal therapy within 10&#xD;
      days to obturate the canal. At the second appointment, after removing the calcium hydroxide&#xD;
      paste circumferential filing with Hedstrom-type files was done and copious irrigation with 3%&#xD;
      sodium hypochlorite was followed by 5.0 ml 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid with a final&#xD;
      rinse of 5.0 ml of 3% sodium hypochlorite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The canals were dried with sterile paper points and obturated by using lateral condensation&#xD;
      technique with gutta-percha (Dentsply Tulsa Dental) and ZOE sealer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal treatment protocol - Non surgical periodontal treatment in the form of scaling&#xD;
      and root planing was provided in minimum of two sessions using ultrasonic scaler (Satelec P5&#xD;
      Booster Suprasson) and hand instruments (Hu-friedy scalers and curettes). In the first&#xD;
      session supragingival scaling was done and in the second session root planing was performed&#xD;
      until a clinically hard, smooth surface was achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming the effect size of 0.5, power .95 and α=0.05 a sample of 105 patients in each group&#xD;
      was required for the survey to show clinically significant difference. For the clinical trial&#xD;
      with the effect size of 1, power .80 and α=0.05, 17 patients in each group were required to&#xD;
      elicit a clinical significant difference. To further compensate for the drop outs, 28&#xD;
      patients in each group were enrolled for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk normality test showed that data for the survey and for the clinical trial was&#xD;
      non normally distributed. The differences between the groups in survey and the clinical trial&#xD;
      for continuous variables were assessed using Mann-Whitney U test and for categorical&#xD;
      variables (brushing habits and dexterity) using chi square (χ2) test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial correlation between variables in the survey was assessed after controlling the&#xD;
      potential confounders like age and PI. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to&#xD;
      develop models of predictor variables (PAI, tooth, gender) associating to the dependent&#xD;
      variables (mean probing depth (PD), maximum probing depth (PD max), mean attachment loss&#xD;
      (AL), maximum attachment loss (AL max), mean bone level. Scoring of pocket depth, attachment&#xD;
      loss and PAI was further categorized as 0 (PD&lt;4mm, AL&lt;4mm and PAI=absence of radiolucency)&#xD;
      and 1 (≥4 to ≤8 PD, AL and PAI=presence of radiolucency). Similarly scoring of mean bone&#xD;
      level was categorized as 0 (&lt;5mm) and 1 (≥5mm) for purpose of logistic regression. The&#xD;
      evaluation of the association between PD, AL and PAI was estimated by odds ratio (OR) and 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals (95% CI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of improvement in clinical parameters (PD, PD max, AL, AL max, BOP, PI, PAI) in&#xD;
      the two test groups (Test group1 and Test group 2) was done using intra group comparison at&#xD;
      baseline to 1month, baseline to 3 months, baseline to 6 months,1 to 3 months, and 3-6 months&#xD;
      using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The differences in improvement of clinical parameters&#xD;
      between the two test groups ((Test group1 and Test group 2) was assessed using Mann-Whitney-U&#xD;
      analysis. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at the 95% probability level (P &lt; .05).&#xD;
