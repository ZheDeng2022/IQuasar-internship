    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of-concept study designed to demonstrate whether increases in cerebral blood&#xD;
      flow, improvements in brain functioning, and reductions in symptomology associated with&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result from treatments consisting of near-infrared&#xD;
      phototherapy (NIR).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of traumatic brain injury is widespread. The Centers for Disease Control&#xD;
      estimate that 1.7 million TBIs occur each year and that TBI is a contributing factor in about&#xD;
      30% of all injury-related deaths. In addition, about 75% of these TBIs are concussions, or&#xD;
      mild TBIs (mTBI). However, such concussions, especially multiple concussions that occur over&#xD;
      time, are not harmless. The damage of even mild TBI can potentially lead to neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      sequelae. Moreover, injury to the brain can worsen over time depending on the degree of&#xD;
      inflammatory response and the areas of injury. TBI induces a number of neuropathological&#xD;
      changes like aggregation of beta amyloid and tau proteins along with neuroinflammatory&#xD;
      changes that resemble the pathology of degenerative diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many of our returning Veterans, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) have been the cause&#xD;
      of these TBIs. For example, data from the Defense Manpower Data Center indicates that as of&#xD;
      October 3, 2011, explosive devices have been responsible for an estimated two-thirds or more&#xD;
      of the battlefield injuries in Iraq; of the 46,532 warriors wounded in Operations Enduring&#xD;
      Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, 30,347 were wounded by explosive devices, many of which were IEDs.&#xD;
      Most of these injuries involved concussive brain injury. While current estimates are that&#xD;
      15-19% of all returning Warfighters have a history of acute concussion or TBI during their&#xD;
      tour(s) of duty. It has been noted that &quot;22.8% of a Brigade Combat Team returned from Iraq&#xD;
      with confirmed deployment-acquired traumatic brain injury.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no effective treatments for reversing or reducing the brain damage&#xD;
      following TBI. Confounding the situation further, the symptoms of TBI can often overlap with&#xD;
      those of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) such as headache, dizziness, irritability,&#xD;
      memory impairment, delayed problem solving, slowed reaction time, fatigue, visual&#xD;
      disturbances, sleep disturbances, sensitivity to light and noise, impulsivity, judgment&#xD;
      problems, emotional outbursts, depression, and anxiety. In addition, the rates of depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, and other psychological symptoms are markedly elevated in TBI survivors, based on&#xD;
      studies involving large samples of patients. As a result of this complexity and overlap of&#xD;
      symptoms between TBI, PTSD, and depression, a clear diagnosis of TBI can be challenging,&#xD;
      which can lead to misdirected treatment efforts and hamper the ability to accurately assess&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple published research studies have validated the healing mechanisms of NIR, which can&#xD;
      be delivered via light-emitting diodes (LED). NIR phototherapy has been used extensively for&#xD;
      wound healing of soft tissue, for increasing circulation, for the treatment of pain and for&#xD;
      specific conditions such as hair growth and carpal tunnel syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of action that is central to the healing effect of NIR is increased blood&#xD;
      circulation via the release of nitric oxide from red blood cells. Local increases in nitric&#xD;
      oxide increase blood flow through arteries, veins and lymphatic ducts. Increased return of&#xD;
      flow from treated sites helps to diminish intracellular acidosis that could alter&#xD;
      mitochondrial membrane potential(s). This hypothesis holds that when blood flow is adequate,&#xD;
      it provides a sufficient amount of oxygen and glucose to cells for adenosine triphosphate&#xD;
      (ATP) generation by mitochondria. However, even a modest decrease in regional or global blood&#xD;
      flow in the brain, such as that seen in TBI, will limit the amount of glucose and oxygen&#xD;
      delivered to neurons. Restoring blood flow levels in damaged regions of the brain thus&#xD;
      restores the necessary levels of glucose and oxygen required for ATP generation and proper&#xD;
      neuronal functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, nitric oxide stimulates angiogenesis and increased numbers of capillaries will&#xD;
      aid in increasing blood flow (and oxygen and glucose) in injured areas of the brain where&#xD;
      blood flow was subnormal. This effect contributes to enhanced mitochondrial function. The&#xD;
      1998 Nobel Prize for physiology was awarded to Furchgott, Ignarroand, and Murad for their&#xD;
      discovery that nitric oxide acts as a signaling molecule and activates an enzyme, guanylate&#xD;
      cyclase (GC), which is necessary for subsequent vasodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, nitric oxide is an effective analgesic; it appears to reduce pain either by&#xD;
      reversing local ischemia or directly in a manner akin to the analgesic effect of morphine. In&#xD;
      the latter case, nitric oxide helps to regulate membrane potential via alterations in the&#xD;
      activity of the ATP dependent potassium channel. This effect may be mediated by activated GC&#xD;
      and subsequent phosphorylation of the potassium channel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to its capacity to non-invasively penetrate the skull, NIR has been safely used since the&#xD;
      late 1970s for the determination of cerebral blood flow and oxygen levels in brain injured&#xD;
      adults, post-stroke patients, and in pediatric patients. Furthermore, transcranial NIR has&#xD;
      been shown to increase cortical perfusion and is associated with clinical improvement in&#xD;
      human subjects with traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative disease, and depression. The&#xD;
      NIR device for this study is FDA cleared (510K; K101894) for increasing circulation and&#xD;
      reducing pain.&#xD;

    <description>Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). To obtain this outcome measure, at pre- and post-treatment, a resting SPECT brain scan is performed as follows. Patient is placed in a comfortable reclining chair in a quiet room and an IV is started. Patient is allowed to acclimate in a quiet, semi-darkened room with eyes open and sound-dampening headphones on for 15 min, in accordance with the 2014 American College of Radiology Practice Guidelines. After 15 min., a dose of approximately 30 millicuries of Technetium-99m radiotracer is injected. SPECT scan is performed 60 min following injection by using a Siemens Symbia E SPECT gamma camera with low-energy high-resolution parallel hole collimators.</description>
