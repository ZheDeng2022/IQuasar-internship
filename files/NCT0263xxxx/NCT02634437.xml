        Inclusion Criteria for Patients with Renal Impairment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a negative result from a serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative result&#xD;
             from a serum or urine pregnancy test on Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If premenopausal, have regular menstrual cycles (cycles of 24-35 days duration) over&#xD;
             the past 6 months as reported by the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female of childbearing potential, agree to use an effective method of contraception&#xD;
             (i.e., condom plus diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or nonhormonal&#xD;
             intrauterine device) and not become pregnant throughout the study. Subjects who are at&#xD;
             least 2-years postmenopausal (with supporting documentation from an&#xD;
             obstetrician/gynecologist) or who have had tubal ligation or hysterectomy will not be&#xD;
             considered to be of childbearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be nonsmoking (never smoked or have not smoked within the previous 6 months) or a&#xD;
             light smoker (fewer than 10 cigarettes per day within the previous 3 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Patients with Renal Impairment, have medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
             laboratory, and other test results consistent with their degree of renal impairment,&#xD;
             as determined by the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Patients with Normal Renal Function, have a state of general good health based on&#xD;
             medical history and routine physical examination and are matched to the age and weight&#xD;
             of the renal dysfunction patients (mean group difference ±10 years for age and &lt; 20%&#xD;
             for weight)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to Ulipristal Acetate (UPA) or other selective progesterone&#xD;
             receptor modulators&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Patients with Renal Impairment, clinically significant disease state, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the examining physician, in any body system (other than renal function&#xD;
             impairment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Patients with Normal Renal Function, clinically significant disease state, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the examining physician, in any body system&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive test results for anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1, hepatitis B&#xD;
             surface antigen, or anti-hepatitis C virus at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal and clinically significant results on physical examination, medical history,&#xD;
             serum chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of alcohol or other substance abuse within the previous 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive test results for benzoylecgonine (cocaine), methadone, barbiturates,&#xD;
             amphetamines, benzodiazepines, alcohol, cannabinoids, opiates, or phencyclidine at&#xD;
             screening or Day -1. Patients with Renal Impairment many be enrolled if the positive&#xD;
             test result is due to prescription drug use and approved by the Principal Investigator&#xD;
             and Sponsor Study Physician, on a case-by-case basis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any other clinical investigation using an experimental drug requiring&#xD;
             repeated blood or plasma draws within 30 days of IP administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a blood or plasma donation program within 60 or 30 days,&#xD;
             respectively, of Investigational Product (IP) administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously participated in an investigational study of Ulipristal Acetate&#xD;
