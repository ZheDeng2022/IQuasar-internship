  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is the most common cause of neuropathic pain in peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathies, with a prevalence of at least 53/100.000. Patients with SFN may have&#xD;
      excruciating pain and current anti-neuropathic and other pain drugs do not relief pain&#xD;
      substantially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies suggested an immunological basis in SFN and case studies have reported&#xD;
      efficacy of treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in patients with SFN. It is&#xD;
      therefore conceivable that immunological mechanisms play a role in idiopathic SFN (I-SFN).&#xD;
      However, to date no randomized controlled study with IVIg in patients with SFN has been&#xD;
      performed. The aim of the current study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of IVIg in&#xD;
      patients with I-SFN in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of IVIg treatment (4 courses of&#xD;
      treatment, 3 weeks apart) compared to placebo on pain alleviation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small nerve fiber neuropathy (SFN) is a disorder of thinly myelinated and unmyelinated nerve&#xD;
      fibers recently recognized as a distinct clinical syndrome, with a minimum incidence of 12&#xD;
      per 100.000 and a minimum prevalence of 53 per 100.000. The clinical picture is typically&#xD;
      dominated by neuropathic pain, often with a burning quality, and autonomic symptoms. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of SFN is usually made on the basis of the clinical picture, no involvement of&#xD;
      large nerve fibers at neurological examination and normal nerve conduction studies (NCS), and&#xD;
      is confirmed by demonstration of reduced intra-epidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) or&#xD;
      abnormal quantitative sensory testing (QST). Despite intensive search for underlying causes&#xD;
      such as diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, Fabry's disease, hereditary disorders,&#xD;
      celiac disease, sarcoidosis, HIV and other systemic illnesses which may be potentially&#xD;
      treatable, the proportion of patients with idiopathic SFN (I-SFN) remains substantial,&#xD;
      ranging in different series from 24% up to 93%. It is conceivable that immunological&#xD;
      mechanisms play a role in patients with I-SFN, since several immune-mediated diseases, such&#xD;
      as sarcoidosis, Sjogren's disease and systemic lupus erythematosis may cause SFN.&#xD;
      Auto-antibodies have also been reported in patients with SFN. Moreover, inflammatory changes&#xD;
      in nerves have been found. Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines have been suggested to be&#xD;
      involved in the pathophysiology of pain in SFN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other immune-mediated neuropathies, such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating&#xD;
      polyneuropathy, treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has proven to be&#xD;
      efficacious. Moreover, some case studies in patients with SFN and chronic pain have also&#xD;
      reported effect of immunomodulating therapy. Pain reduction with IVIg treatment has also been&#xD;
      summarized recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous infusion of high doses of pooled immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules from thousands&#xD;
      of donors (IVIg therapy) represents an efficient anti-inflammatory treatment for many&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases. Paradoxically, IgG can exert both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities,&#xD;
      depending upon its concentration. When administered in high concentrations, IVIg has&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties. How this anti-inflammatory effect is mediated has not yet been&#xD;
      fully elucidated. Several mutually nonexclusive mechanisms have been proposed, including&#xD;
      modulation of the expression and function of the Fc fragment of IgG to IgG-specific&#xD;
      receptors, interference with activation of the complement cascade and the cytokine network,&#xD;
      neutralization of autoantibodies and regulation of cell proliferation. However, the exact&#xD;
      mechanism of IVIg in the treatment of inflammatory neuropathies has not been elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects of IVIg treatment are usually transient (chills, headache, dizziness, fever,&#xD;
      vomiting, nausea, arthralgia, low blood pressure and moderate low back pain may occur&#xD;
      occasionally).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sudden fall in blood pressure and anaphylactic shock are rare. More severe side effect are&#xD;
      extremely rare (reversible aseptic meningitis, transient cutaneous reactions, reversible&#xD;
      haemolytic reactions, haemolytic anemia, and thromboembolic events).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SFN is considered the most common cause of neuropathic pain in peripheral neuropathies.&#xD;
      Patients with SFN have reported having excruciating pain, since current anti-neuropathic and&#xD;
      other pain drugs do not relief pain substantially. SFN interferes with daily functioning and&#xD;
      may lead to a decrement in quality of life expectations. Therefore, a better treatment is&#xD;
      warranted. The aim of the current pilot study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      IVIg in patients with I-SFN in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
