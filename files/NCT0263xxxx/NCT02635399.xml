  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection in periampullary cancer using pancreaticoduodenectomy is the most&#xD;
      important modality in the treatment. In the past, pancreaticoduodenectomy was associated with&#xD;
      high morbidity and mortality. However, with the advances in techniques, including&#xD;
      perioperative patient management, development of antibiotics, diagnostic radiology, and&#xD;
      interventional treatments, pancreaticoduodenectomy is now considered a safe and feasible&#xD;
      operation. Postoperative complication rates are reported to be in 10 to 20% in experienced&#xD;
      hospitals and operation related mortality is at about 1%. Therefore, surgical treatment for&#xD;
      periampullary cancer is actively considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, postoperative complications, such as postoperative pancreatic fistula, (POPF)&#xD;
      delayed gastric emptying, intraabdominal abscess, and postoperative bleeding, are still&#xD;
      serious complications. Among these complications, delayed gastric emptying is considered less&#xD;
      critical. However, delayed gastric emptying (DGE) can cause poor oral intake, which in turn,&#xD;
      may lead to delay in recovery of postoperative nutritional state and in severe cases,&#xD;
      requires insertion of levine tube and long-term fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been many hypotheses for cause of DGE after pancreaticoduodenectomy, but definite&#xD;
      cause have not been discovered yet. With the introduction of pylorus-preserving&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD), incidences of DGE were initially reported to have increased.&#xD;
      However, results of most randomized comparative studies had concluded that PPPD and PD have&#xD;
      no significance in occurence of DGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hypothesis for cause of DGE we present here has to do with anatomic positioning of&#xD;
      anastomosis site, especially pancreatojejunostomy (PJ) and duodenojejunostomy (DJ), after&#xD;
      PPPD. Reconstruction after PPPD positions PJ and DJ close to each other. PJ site is often&#xD;
      associated with one of postoperative complications, POPF. POPF may create inflammation around&#xD;
      PJ site and pancreatitis, which may lead to severe adhesion around PJ as a secondary change.&#xD;
      This adhesion and inflammation may cause DJ, which is located near PJ, to be pulled towards&#xD;
      PJ site. When DJ is pulled towards PJ site, distal DJ site can become angulated and gastric&#xD;
      contents may not beadle to pass easily. Gastric contents may be stagnated in stomach and&#xD;
      thereby causing DGE. Therefore, in this study, we will fixate DJ on transverse colon using&#xD;
      sutures, and prevent possibility of angulation of DJ. This additional procedure may reduce&#xD;
      occurence of DGE.&#xD;
