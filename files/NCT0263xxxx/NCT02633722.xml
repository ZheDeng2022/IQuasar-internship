      Obesity is a serious medical condition, the adverse consequences of which include increased&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, reduced fertility and cancer. The economic&#xD;
      cost of obesity was placed at $58 billion dollars in Australia in 2008. Studies in mice and&#xD;
      non-human primates have shown that moderate caloric restriction (CR) increases lifespan and&#xD;
      reduces the incidence of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Reduced risk of&#xD;
      chronic diseases is also observed in humans following CR. However, daily CR is difficult to&#xD;
      maintain long term, since the body defends against weight loss by inducing &quot;metabolic&#xD;
      adaptation&quot; and altering the hormonal appetite response. An emerging number of studies are&#xD;
      examining the effects of limiting food intake to prescribed time periods per day, or every&#xD;
      other day. Intermittent, or time restricted feeding describes a dieting approach where food&#xD;
      is available ad libitum, however only for a limited period of time (i.e. 3-12 hours). This&#xD;
      study will examine the effects of fasting for 15h/day and eating for 9-h per day on glycemic&#xD;
      control and metabolic health. This study will build on the existing knowledge base in humans&#xD;
      as to whether meal timing, rather than caloric restriction per se, is important to provide&#xD;
      the stimulus required to improve metabolic health and reduce risk of chronic disease.&#xD;
      Moreover, it will examine whether restricting feeding to later in the day is of lesser&#xD;
      benefit to health.&#xD;

      The timing of meal intakes distributed across the wake cycle may play a role in body weight&#xD;
      regulation and metabolic health in humans. However, only a limited number of studies have&#xD;
      interrogated this in humans. Epidemiological evidence shows that individuals who report&#xD;
      consuming more of their daily energy intake at the evening meal were more overweight, than&#xD;
      those who reported consumed more of their energy intake before lunch. Similarly, eating lunch&#xD;
      late in the day (after 15:00 hrs) was predictive of poorer weight loss during a 20-week&#xD;
      dietary intervention study and individuals randomized to consume more calories at breakfast&#xD;
      had greater weight loss versus those randomized to eat more calories at dinner after 12&#xD;
      weeks. Taken together these data suggest that consuming more calories in the morning may be&#xD;
      beneficial for weight management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised controlled cross-over intervention, where lean individuals were instructed either&#xD;
      to consume all of their calories required for weight maintenance over a 4 hour period from&#xD;
      1700-2100h, or as 3 meals/d for 8 weeks. Significant reductions in body weight and body fat&#xD;
      mass, by 1.4 and 2.1 kg respectively, were noted when following the TRF protocol. Consumption&#xD;
      of the evening meal was supervised within the laboratory, to ensure subjects consumed the&#xD;
      entire meal. In light of evidence that rats switched from a nibbling diet to 1 meal/d&#xD;
      increased gluconeogenesis and free fatty acid flux from fat depots, the authors postulated&#xD;
      that the greater weight loss may be associated with changes in metabolism. Despite this small&#xD;
      amount of weight loss, fasting blood glucose levels were increased, and TRF resulted in&#xD;
      poorer glucose tolerance in response to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Thus,&#xD;
      consuming a single, large &quot;dinner&quot; meal was detrimental for metabolic health, although no&#xD;
      differences in insulinemia were noted. It is unclear whether responses may have differed if&#xD;
      the food allowance was prescribed at breakfast or lunch times. Just one other study has&#xD;
      performed a randomised controlled TRF protocol in humans. In this study, healthy, lean male&#xD;
      subjects were allowed to eat ad libitum for 13h per day (6am-7pm) for 2 weeks. Participants&#xD;
      reported eating significantly less on the TRF versus the control condition, and lost -0.4kg&#xD;
      compared with a gain of +0.6kg in the control condition. Whilst this is a minor change in&#xD;
      body weight, this pattern is not that atypical of modern eating patterns, and further&#xD;
      restriction of eating times, and assessment of obese individuals under these conditions is&#xD;
      warranted. The metabolic health impacts were not reported in that study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies in animals have shown that, when fed in the &quot;wrong&quot; phase (i.e. eating when&#xD;
      the animal would normally rest) the mice become obese, despite similar energy intake and&#xD;
      expenditure, suggesting that the timing of food intake is important in driving the obese&#xD;
      phenotype. Moreover, when high-fat energy intake is restricted to the active phase, the&#xD;
      animals become obese, but do not develop the metabolic sequelae that are observed when the&#xD;
      same foods are provided in the inactive phase. In humans, shift workers are at higher risks&#xD;
      of metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, possibly as a result of clock&#xD;
      desynchronization. Alternatively, this may be the result of mis-timing of meals. For example,&#xD;
      epidemiological evidence suggests that a shift toward consuming more calories at night is&#xD;
      more likely to result in being overweight when compared with breakfast eaters, while eating a&#xD;
      greater proportion of calories at the dinner meal is associated with a higher overall intake&#xD;
      and an increased risk for obesity, metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.&#xD;
      When 10 healthy adults were subjected to a 28 hour &quot;day&quot; during which they consumed 4&#xD;
      isocaloric meals, the resulting circadian misalignment was associated with increased blood&#xD;
      glucose, even in the presence of increased insulin. Moreover, in 3 of the subjects, a&#xD;
      postprandial glucose response was observed that would suggest a pre-diabetic state. Under&#xD;
      these circumstances, it appears that consuming calories at &quot;night&quot; in humans may have&#xD;
      deleterious effects on health, and suggests that meal timing may play a key role in&#xD;
      mitigating the metabolic impairment that occurs when the circadian rhythm is disrupted. To&#xD;
      further confuse the matter, among breakfast skippers, a higher eating frequency (i.e. â‰¥ 4&#xD;
      eating occasions per day) has been shown to be associated with a higher risk for type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, compared with breakfast eaters who consumed 1-3 meals per day. In light of this&#xD;
      evidence, and the apparent beneficial effects of TRF on metabolic health, the importance of&#xD;
      the morning meal and its synchronisation with circadian rhythms is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening (S) - Participants will attend the South Australian Health and Medical Research&#xD;
      Institute (SAHMRI) and have the research protocol explained to them in detail. Informed&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study, including a verbal indication that they understand the&#xD;
      general study protocol and requirements is then obtained. Participants will be assessed by a&#xD;
      screening questionnaire for diet, medical, and exercise history to determine their&#xD;
      eligibility according to the above criteria. Routine clinical checks are then performed&#xD;
      (weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure). If subjects meet eligibility criteria,&#xD;
      they will be invited to take part in the study. Participants will have a dual energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry scan and be fitted with a continuous glucose monitor for one week. During this&#xD;
      time, participants will also wear an accelerometer and complete diet diaries to complete a&#xD;
      baseline assessment of meal intake pattern. Participants will then be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      undergo one of two study arms (TRF-b and TRF-d) for one week each. Conditions are separated&#xD;
      by a 2-week washout period, during which participants will be encouraged to maintain their&#xD;
      usual dietary pattern and physical activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic Testing (D0, D7) during each study condition: Participants arrive at 0700 following&#xD;
      an overnight fast. Weight and blood pressure is measured following a seated 10 min rest. A 20&#xD;
      G cannula is inserted into an antecubital vein. A fasting blood sample is drawn for lipids,&#xD;
      cytokines and glucoregulatory hormones. Resting metabolic rate and whole body nutrient&#xD;
      oxidation is measured via indirect calorimetry. A second fasting blood sample is taken&#xD;
      immediately prior to a standard test meal at 0800am or 1200pm, depending on study condition&#xD;
      and gastric emptying, postprandial glucoregulatory and gut hormone response to re-feeding&#xD;
      will be tested for 3 hours. At the first metabolic visit of each study condition,&#xD;
      participants will be fitted with the continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and follow their&#xD;
      assigned TRF protocol and assessments by CGM will continue for 7 days, before returning for&#xD;
      the D7 metabolic visit. Diet records will be taken and accelerometers worn on the upper arm&#xD;
      for each period during the study.&#xD;
