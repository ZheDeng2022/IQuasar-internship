  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label, single arm, single-stage study. A total of 23 evaluable&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled. If total number of patients free of disease relapse at 1 year is&#xD;
      less than or equal to 15, the drug would not be considered for further study in this setting.&#xD;
      After six patients are treated with at least one dose of study drug, they will be observed&#xD;
      for a minimum of 60 days. During the 60-day observation period, further accrual will be&#xD;
      halted to evaluate &quot;unacceptable toxicities warranting early closure of the trial&quot; defined&#xD;
      as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any definitive durvalumab-related death. A durvalumab-related death will be continuously&#xD;
           monitored throughout the trial and the trial will be suspended for re-evaluation&#xD;
           whenever such an event is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any unexpected and previously unreported grade 4 toxicities definitely related to&#xD;
           durvalumab.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive durvalumab 1500 mg IV every 4 weeks (1 cycle) for a maximum 13 doses&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known HIV infection or chronic hepatitis B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;

             significant is defined as an active infection requiring IV antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued. In&#xD;
