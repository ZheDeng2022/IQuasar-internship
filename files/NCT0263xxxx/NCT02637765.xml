  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial in which patients with previous breast&#xD;
      cancer will be randomized into two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control Group of Usual Physical Activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention Group of Increased Physical Activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      No specific intervention will be performed In the patients randomized in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized in the Intervention group will receive a program of increased physical&#xD;
      activity starting from 5000 steps/day up to 12000 steps/day after 8 weeks. At the same time&#xD;
      patients of this group will receive an 8-week recreational program of brisk walking/running&#xD;
      (3 times a week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients enrolled in this trial will receive a pedometer device (Garmin Vìvofit) able&#xD;
      to count the number of steps, determine a daily goal of steps, determine the covered distance&#xD;
      (in Km), determine daily caloric consumption, and determine the movements during sleep.&#xD;

      In this prospective randomized controlled trial patients with previous breast cancer will be&#xD;
      randomized into two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control Group of Usual Physical Activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention Group of Increased Physical Activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      No specific intervention will be performed In the patients randomized in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized in the Intervention Group will receive a program of increased physical&#xD;
      activity starting from 5000 steps/day up to 12000 steps/day after 8 weeks. At the same time&#xD;
      patients of this group will receive an 8-week recreational program of brisk walking/running&#xD;
      (3 times a week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients enrolled in this trial will receive a pedometer device (Garmin Vìvofit) able&#xD;
      to count the number of steps, determine a daily goal of steps, determine the covered distance&#xD;
      (in Km), determine daily caloric consumption, and determine the movements during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be downloaded in a specific application available online (Garmin Connect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will receive written information on the potential benefits of physical&#xD;
      exercise and better lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, at the end of the study period (8 weeks) and after 1 year patients will be asked&#xD;
      to fill out the following questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Funcional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Breast (FACT-B, 37 items)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient reported symptoms (PRS like International Breast Cancer Study Group form, 19&#xD;
           items)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Funcional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Fatigue (FACT-Fatigue, 13 items)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog; 37 items)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact of Event Scale (IES; 22 items)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, at the end of the study period (8 weeks) patients will be asked to undergo blood&#xD;
      draw for serum analysis of insulin, IGF-1, leptin, PCR, cholesterol, triglycerides leucocyte&#xD;
      count, T lymphocyte subpopulations (T regulatory and TH17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that even a short course of increased physical activity may&#xD;
      improve quality of life of non-regular exercisers women with a personal history of breast&#xD;
      cancer who completed treatment (endocrine treatment excluded).&#xD;
