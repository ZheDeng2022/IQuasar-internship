      This study was a prospective, randomized controlled intervention pilot study conducted in a&#xD;
      metropolitan city in the upper Midwest of the United States. Forty women who met the criteria&#xD;
      for depression based on the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical&#xD;
      Manual of Mental Disorders IV (SCID-I; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &amp; Williams, 1997)were&#xD;
      randomized to an experimental mindfulness-based yoga condition (n=20) or a walking control&#xD;
      condition (n=20). Both programs were home-based motivational sessions delivered over the&#xD;
      telephone and lasted 12 weeks. Assessments were conducted at baseline, three months (i.e.,&#xD;
      post-intervention), one-month follow-up (i.e., one month after the intervention ended).&#xD;
      Participants were instructed to continue their usual depression care. The primary dependent&#xD;
      variable was depressive symptoms based on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The secondary&#xD;
      dependent variable was rumination scores on the Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS). This&#xD;
      protocol was approved by the University of Minnesota's Institutional Review Board (IRB).&#xD;
      Participants completed informed consent forms sent through the mail; consent to participate&#xD;
      in physical activity was also obtained from the participant's healthcare provider.&#xD;
      Recruitment for this trial occurred from February, 2013 to January, 2014 and follow-up&#xD;
      assessments were completed by May, 2014.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the 12-week mindfulness-based yoga condition were guided by a gentle yoga DVD that included postures (asanas), pranayama (breathing exercises), and relaxation (meditation). Participants were asked to complete 60-75 minutes of the DVD twice per week and were encouraged to do more if they were interested.&#xD;
Following the initial baseline assessment and randomization telephone interview, participants in the yoga group completed weekly 15-minute telephone sessions for the first month and bi-weekly telephone sessions for the second and third for a total of eight sessions over the 12 weeks. The mindfulness telephone sessions were modified from the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction.</description>

    <description>The 12-week walking control condition included twice-weekly home practice with a 65-minute walking DVD (Sansone, 2008) and eight telephone sessions with the telephone counselor.&#xD;
Participants were asked to complete 60 minutes of the DVD (or other walking) twice weekly and encouraged to do more if they were interested.&#xD;
Participants received telephone sessions on the same schedule as the yoga condition. The education sessions covered a variety of health and wellness related topics.</description>
