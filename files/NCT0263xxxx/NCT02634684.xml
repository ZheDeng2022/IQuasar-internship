      This application seeks renewed support for MH59803, &quot;Dopaminergic substrates of startle&#xD;
      gating across species,&quot; to extend a clear path of &quot;bench-to-bedside&quot; progress towards a&#xD;
      critical paradigm shift in therapeutic models for schizophrenia (SZ) and schizoaffective&#xD;
      disorder, depressed type (SZA): the use of Pharmacologic Augmentation of Cognitive Therapies&#xD;
      (PACTs). This novel therapeutic strategy for SZ/SZA directly addresses the need for more&#xD;
      effective treatments for this devastating disorder. MH59803 has investigated the neural&#xD;
      regulation of laboratory-based measures of deficient information processing in SZ/SZA&#xD;
      patients, using rodents and healthy human subjects (HS) to explicate the biology of these&#xD;
      deficits, and to establish a rational basis for developing novel therapies for SZ/SZA. In its&#xD;
      first 9 years, MH59803 studies of the neural regulation of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of&#xD;
      startle in rats focused on basic neurobiological and molecular mechanisms. Over the past 2&#xD;
      years of support, MH59803 studies moved &quot;from bench-to-bedside,&quot; focusing on dopamine (DA)&#xD;
      agonist effects on PPI and neurocognition in HS, and their regulation by genes identified in&#xD;
      cross-species studies. These studies detected biological markers that predict PPI-enhancing&#xD;
      and pro-cognitive effects of the DA releaser, amphetamine (AMPH) in humans, leading to&#xD;
      specific predictions of AMPH effects on PPI, neurocognition and Targeted Cognitive Training&#xD;
      in SZ/SZA patients. If confirmed in the present application, these predictions could help&#xD;
      transform therapeutic approaches to SZ/SZA. This renewal application of MH59803 thus reflects&#xD;
      a logical progression of studies at systems and molecular levels, translated first to HS, and&#xD;
      now to potentially transformative therapeutic models in SZ/SZA patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MH59803 demonstrated that AMPH (20 mg p.o.) significantly increased PPI and neurocognitive&#xD;
      performance (MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery; MCCB) in HS characterized by specific&#xD;
      performance-based or genetic biomarkers, including the val/val genotype for the rs4680&#xD;
      polymorphism of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Mechanistically-informative results were&#xD;
      detected in studies of AMPH effects on PPI in rats with high vs. low brain regional Comt&#xD;
      expression. Together with several reports of improved neurocognition and no adverse effects&#xD;
      of acute or sustained AMPH administration to antipsychotic (AP)-medicated SZ/SZA patients,&#xD;
      MH59803 findings provide a strong rationale for the next goal of this application: to test&#xD;
      the potential utility of AMPH in a paradigm of biomarker-informed &quot;PACTs&quot;. This &quot;next step&quot;&#xD;
      is highly innovative - never previously reported, or perhaps even attempted - and consistent&#xD;
      with National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) objectives, directly challenges existing&#xD;
      models for SZ/SZA therapeutics. Investigators will determine whether a test dose of 10 mg&#xD;
      AMPH p.o. administered to biomarker-identified, AP-medicated SZ/SZA patients generates&#xD;
      predicted increases in PPI, MCCB performance, and sensory discrimination learning in a&#xD;
      Targeted Cognitive Training (TCT) module. In total, Investigators will leverage knowledge&#xD;
      generated through converging cross-species studies in MH59803, to directly advance scientific&#xD;
      and clinical domains, by testing the effects of a pro-cognitive drug on neurophysiological&#xD;
      and neurocognitive performance, and Targeted Cognitive Training, in biomarker-stratified&#xD;
      subgroups of SZ/SZA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To assess acute effects of AMPH (0 vs 10 mg po) on PPI, neurocognition and computerized&#xD;
      TCT in AP-medicated SZ/SZA patients. Hypothesis: PPI- and MCCB-enhancing effects of AMPH seen&#xD;
      previously in HS will also be detected in SZ/SZA patients, as will TCT-enhancing effects of&#xD;
      AMPH. Prediction: In a within-subject, placebo-controlled, randomized design, AMPH (10 mg po)&#xD;
      will increase PPI and enhance MCCB and TCT performance in medicated SZ/SZA patients,&#xD;
      particularly among those characterized by low basal performance levels and/or the val/val&#xD;
      rs4680 COMT polymorphism. Concurrent HS testing will confirm and extend findings of AMPH&#xD;
      effects on PPI and neurocognition, and help interpret findings in SZ/SZA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all participants, the aim to assess acute effects of 0 vs. 10 mg po dextroamphetamine&#xD;
      (AMPH) on Prepulse Inhibition (PPI), neurocognition MATRICS: Consensus Cognitive Battery;&#xD;
      MCCB, and computerized Targeted Cognitive Training (TCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: AMPH will enhance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PPI&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. neurocognition (MCCB performance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. computerized TCT performance in biomarker-identified SZ/SZA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The PPI and MCCB-enhancing effects of AMPH seen previously in HS will also be detected&#xD;
           in SZ/SZA patients, as will TCT-enhancing effects of AMPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction: In a within-subject, placebo-controlled, randomized design, AMPH (10 mg po) will&#xD;
      increase PPI and enhance MCCB and TCT performance in medicated SZ/SZA patients, particularly&#xD;
      among those characterized by low basal performance levels and/or the val/val rs4680 COMT&#xD;
      polymorphism. Concurrent HS testing will confirm and extend findings of AMPH effects on PPI&#xD;
      and neurocognition, and help interpret findings in SZ/SZA patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Prepulse Inhibition (PPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>two visits, 1 week apart, each visit lasting approximately 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>PPI was assessed with 42 trials of 6 types: 118 dB 40 ms pulse alone (P) &amp; the same P preceded 10, 20, 30, 60, or 120 ms by a prepulse (pp) 16 dB over background. Startle magnitude (SM), habituation, latency &amp; latency facilitation were measured to interpret changes in PPI.&#xD;
%PPI = 100 x [(SM on P trials) - (SM on pp+P trials)] / SM on P trials. Example:&#xD;
SM on P trials = 80 units SM on pp+P trials = 30 units %PPI = 100 x (80-30)/80 = 100 x 50/80 = 62.5%&#xD;
Greater %PPI mean the reflex has been inhibited to a greater extent in the presence of a pp.&#xD;
%PPI can't exceed 100: when SM on pp+P trials = 0, then %PPI = 100 x (SM on P trials - 0)/SM on P trials = 100 x 1 = 100%.&#xD;
However, %PPI can theoretically be infinitely negative since SM on pp+P trials could be infinitely large (&quot;prepulse facilitiation&quot; (PPF)), i.e. SM is potentiated in the presence of a pp. PPF is &quot;normal&quot; at very short &amp; very long pp intervals, but not within a species-specific physiological range of intervals.</description>

    <time_frame>two visits, 1 week apart, each visit lasting approximately 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Auditory discrimination learning: Subjects identify direction (up vs. down) of 2 consecutive sound sweeps. Parameters (e.g. inter-sweep interval, sweep duration) are established for subjects to maintain 80% correct responses. On screen and test days, subjects complete 1h of TCT. Analytic software yields the key measures: auditory processing speed (APS) and APS &quot;learning&quot;. APS is the shortest inter-stimulus interval at which a subject performs to criteria and APS learning is the difference (ms) between the first APS and the best APS of the subsequent trials. A smaller APS reflects &quot;better&quot; discrimination (i.e., subject correctly identified frequency &quot;sweep&quot; direction despite a smaller ms gap between stimuli) and a larger ms value for APS learning reflects more learning, i.e., faster APS with repeated trials. Limits for APS are capped at 0-to-1000 ms; values for APS learning are capped at (-) 1000-to-APS.</description>

          <title>Subjects With Schizophrenia: Placebo 1st, Then 10 mg Amphetamine</title>
          <description>Drug: Dexedrine, dextroamphetamine, d-amphetamine.&#xD;
Dosage form, frequency and duration: Each participant receives a single pill of placebo or active drug (dextroamphetamine) 30 minutes after arriving at the lab. The participant then completes ~6 hours of testing in the laboratory. The participant stays at the lab for ~7.5 hours to monitor physical condition in case the participant received the active pill. One week later, the participant receives a single pill of comparator and is again tested in the laboratory. Total of 1 visits, approximately 1 week apart; in total, each participant receives one placebo pill and 1 active pill separated by one week.&#xD;
Dextroamphetamine: Each participant receives a single pill of placebo or active drug (dextroamphetamine 10 mg) and completes approximately 6 hours of testing in the laboratory. One week later, that participant receives a single pill of the alternate comparator and is again tested in the laboratory. Thus, in total, each participant receives one placebo pill and one active pill, separated by one week.&#xD;

        <title>Prepulse Inhibition (PPI)</title>
        <description>PPI was assessed with 42 trials of 6 types: 118 dB 40 ms pulse alone (P) &amp; the same P preceded 10, 20, 30, 60, or 120 ms by a prepulse (pp) 16 dB over background. Startle magnitude (SM), habituation, latency &amp; latency facilitation were measured to interpret changes in PPI.&#xD;
%PPI = 100 x [(SM on P trials) - (SM on pp+P trials)] / SM on P trials. Example:&#xD;
SM on P trials = 80 units SM on pp+P trials = 30 units %PPI = 100 x (80-30)/80 = 100 x 50/80 = 62.5%&#xD;
Greater %PPI mean the reflex has been inhibited to a greater extent in the presence of a pp.&#xD;
%PPI can't exceed 100: when SM on pp+P trials = 0, then %PPI = 100 x (SM on P trials - 0)/SM on P trials = 100 x 1 = 100%.&#xD;
However, %PPI can theoretically be infinitely negative since SM on pp+P trials could be infinitely large (&quot;prepulse facilitiation&quot; (PPF)), i.e. SM is potentiated in the presence of a pp. PPF is &quot;normal&quot; at very short &amp; very long pp intervals, but not within a species-specific physiological range of intervals.</description>

        <description>Auditory discrimination learning: Subjects identify direction (up vs. down) of 2 consecutive sound sweeps. Parameters (e.g. inter-sweep interval, sweep duration) are established for subjects to maintain 80% correct responses. On screen and test days, subjects complete 1h of TCT. Analytic software yields the key measures: auditory processing speed (APS) and APS &quot;learning&quot;. APS is the shortest inter-stimulus interval at which a subject performs to criteria and APS learning is the difference (ms) between the first APS and the best APS of the subsequent trials. A smaller APS reflects &quot;better&quot; discrimination (i.e., subject correctly identified frequency &quot;sweep&quot; direction despite a smaller ms gap between stimuli) and a larger ms value for APS learning reflects more learning, i.e., faster APS with repeated trials. Limits for APS are capped at 0-to-1000 ms; values for APS learning are capped at (-) 1000-to-APS.</description>
