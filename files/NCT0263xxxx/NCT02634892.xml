      Objective - To demonstrate the efficacy of the pressure redistributing cooling mattress&#xD;
      overlay compared to usual care in mitigating the progression of early pressure ulcers in&#xD;
      critically ill (ICU) patients via a prospective randomized human clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim - The clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the PRO-TECT ™&#xD;
      mattress overlay in ICU patients who have already developed early pressure ulcers (Stage 1&#xD;
      and 2) and preventing further progression to more severe pressure ulcers (Stage 3 and 4) as&#xD;
      well as potential faster regression (i.e. healing of Stage 1 and 2 pressures).&#xD;

      To demonstrate the efficacy of the pressure redistributing cooling mattress overlay for&#xD;
      prevention of pressure ulcers in critical care units, a prospective randomized human clinical&#xD;
      trial will be performed. The trial will use functionally equivalent test overlays. The&#xD;
      initial pilot clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the PRO-TECT ™ mattress&#xD;
      overlay in ICU patients who have already developed early pressure ulcers (Stage 1 and 2) and&#xD;
      preventing further progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be performed in UPMC ICUs by enrolling patients age 18 or older with Stage 1&#xD;
      and Stage 2 sacral/coccyx pressure ulcers. The trial will consist of 2 arms: 1) current usual&#xD;
      care (UC) vs. 2) UC + targeted cooling overlay mattress (TCOM). Exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      include anticipated ICU length of stay &lt; 3 days, patients initially designated for specialty&#xD;
      overlay/bed for pulmonary or bariatric diagnoses, patients with a Stage 3 or 4 or unstageable&#xD;
      pressure ulcer on the sacrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UC group will receive current UPMC ICU guideline-based care with daily assessments for&#xD;
      sacral pressure ulcers. Nursing care guidelines will be applied including frequent patient&#xD;
      turning, pressure alleviation, moisture control, and friction relief applications. Patients&#xD;
      in this group may receive a specialty bed or overlay mattress without cooling if recommended&#xD;
      by wound care specialist. The TCOM group will receive UC plus overlay mattress with targeted&#xD;
      sacral cooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound care as well as assessment will be performed daily by the non-wound care nurses ( ie.&#xD;
      ICU nurse while under ICU care and Floor nurses while under non-ICU care) as part of their&#xD;
      regular daily assessment for both non-target cooling and targeted cooling patients. Wound&#xD;
      care specialist will assess the wound on Mon/Wed/Fri for any progression or deterioration of&#xD;
      the wounds. These wound care nurses are specialty trained in stage decubitus as well as&#xD;
      recommending changes in care to promote healing. Additionally they will record the data as&#xD;
      part of their routine care of patient with wounds. Theses types of wound assessments are best&#xD;
      performed every 2-3 days in order to see any significant change of therapy and data will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected on Monday, Wednesday and Friday of each week including Braden score, pressure&#xD;
      ulcer stage, healing progression (or deterioration) with measurements (e.g., size), and&#xD;
      evidence of infection. Additionally, frequency of patient reposition will be recorded and if&#xD;
      not, documentation of justification will be provided. Other data collected will include&#xD;
      demographics, vitals, comorbidities, length of times (prior incapacitation at home or nursing&#xD;
      facility, transport, emergency department, operative room), ventilation and oxygenation&#xD;
      requirement, ventilator days, ICU LOS, need for dialysis, vasopressors, and labs including&#xD;
      nutritional labs. Data will be collected until study endpoint of discharge from hospital.&#xD;
      Final cost analysis will be performed to compile a cost-benefit of each arm. Accrual will be&#xD;
      6 months.&#xD;
