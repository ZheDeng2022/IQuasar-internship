      The overall goals of this renewal are to replicate the findings of Seamos Saludables in&#xD;
      Latina women, increase the effectiveness of the intervention, and measure&#xD;
      intervention-related changes in clinical biomarkers. We will enhance the existing&#xD;
      intervention by incorporating participant feedback (desire for greater interactivity and&#xD;
      accountability), further targeting Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) constructs that were not&#xD;
      influenced overall by the original intervention yet improved amongst our most successful&#xD;
      participants (social support, outcome expectancies), and responding to changing trends and&#xD;
      technology use in Latinos. We will conduct a clinical trial among Latina women in California&#xD;
      randomized to either 1) the original Seamos Saludables tailored print only intervention or 2)&#xD;
      a theory and text messaging-enhanced interactive technology based version of the Seamos&#xD;
      Saludables intervention. We will also measure changes in cardiovascular and metabolic&#xD;
      biomarkers (e.g., HbA1c, and LDL) to assess potential clinical impact of the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Latinos are the largest racial/ethnic minority group in the U.S., and report substantial and&#xD;
      widening health disparities. Prevalence of type II diabetes is 60-100% higher in Latinos than&#xD;
      in non-Latino Whites, and incidence in Latinos is projected to increase by 500% by 20503. The&#xD;
      largest disparities are projected for Latino women (Latinas). Rates of overweight and obesity&#xD;
      are 23% and 37% higher in Latinas than in White women respectively, and have grown faster in&#xD;
      Mexican American women, by far the largest subgroup of Latinas, than in White women during&#xD;
      the past decade. Given that Latinos are projected to comprise nearly one-third of the US&#xD;
      population by 2050, this signifies a pressing public health concern in terms of costs,&#xD;
      diminished quality of life, and lost life years. Interventions are therefore needed that are&#xD;
      not only linguistically adapted for this population but address their specific barriers.&#xD;
      &quot;Mediated&quot; intervention delivery approaches (e.g., mail, phone, or web delivered) that&#xD;
      emphasize home-based, lifestyle activities show larger effect sizes than face-to-face&#xD;
      approaches, are more cost-effective, are likely more sustainable, and may be particularly&#xD;
      appropriate for Latinas, as they reduce the burden of time, childcare, and transportation,&#xD;
      barriers commonly cited by Latinas. Thus in the previously funded parent grant (R01NR011295)&#xD;
      we responded to PAR-07-379, &quot;Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and&#xD;
      Reducing Health Disparities,&quot; by modifying an existing print-based mail-delivered PA&#xD;
      intervention and adapting it specifically for Latinas in the North Eastern U.S. with low&#xD;
      acculturation, literacy, and socioeconomic status (SES), and testing the modified&#xD;
      intervention in a randomized controlled trial (N=266). Participants in the PA intervention&#xD;
      arm showed significantly greater increases in at least moderate intensity activity,&#xD;
      increasing from 1.87 min/week at baseline to 73.36 min/week at 6 months (vs. 3.02 min/week to&#xD;
      32.98 min/week in a contact control group). However, this is still well below the national&#xD;
      guidelines of 150 minutes per week. This intervention therefore shows potential in promoting&#xD;
      initial PA adoption, yet enhancements are needed to further help people achieve levels of PA&#xD;
      that will prevent disease and reduce health disparities. The objectives of this renewal are&#xD;
      to 1) enhance the intervention to achieve greater increases in PA, 2) assess its potential&#xD;
      clinical impact by measuring changes in biomarkers, and 3) increase its generalizability by&#xD;
      replicating it in Latina women, all of which would further the goal of designing an&#xD;
      innovative behavioral intervention to promote health and prevent illness in diverse&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;

    <description>The 7-Day PAR is an interviewer administered instrument that uses multiple strategies for increasing accuracy of participant recall regarding many types of activities such as time spent sleeping and moderate, hard, and very hard intensity activities. The 7-Day PAR is used across many studies assessing physical activity and has consistently demonstrated acceptable reliability, internal consistency, and congruent validity with other objective measures of activity levels.</description>

    <description>We designed the Enhanced Tailored Intervention to build upon our previous research in order to outperform the original tailored intervention, in a cost effective, theoretically guided and data driven manner with potential for dissemination. Participants in the Enhanced Tailored Intervention will receive an interactive technology based intervention that: 1) addresses important SCT constructs for increasing PA that were not significantly changed in the original parent trial (enjoyment/outcome expectations and social support) and 2) provides greater accountability and interactivity for self-monitoring (through text messages), as requested by participants in the original parent trial.</description>

Mailings consist of; 1) Manuals matched to the participant's current level of motivational readiness to change, based on TTM 2) Individually tailored computerized expert system feedback reports based on the participant's answers to monthly questionnaires. The computer expert system draws from a bank of over 330 messages developed from previous studies that address different levels of psychosocial and environmental factors affecting PA. 3) PA tip sheets addressing PA barriers specifically identified by Latinas in our formative research (e.g., caregiving duties, neighborhood safety).</description>

Self-monitoring was an important aspect in increasing PA in our previous trials however, participants were only asked to turn in the self-monitoring logs once a month. Based on the importance of self-monitoring and feedback from participants (R01NR011295; R01CA15994) that they wanted greater accountability and interactivity, we added a text-message component for self-monitoring.</description>

Enhanced Tailored Intervention: Participants in the Enhanced Tailored arm will receive all the intervention components of the original tailored intervention, as well as: 1) additional print materials; 2) more in-depth tailored reports; and 3) text-messages. Self-monitoring was an important aspect in increasing PA in our previous trials however, participants were only asked to turn in the self-monitoring logs once a month. Based on the importance of self-monitoring and feedback from participants (R01NR011295; R01CA15994) that they wanted greater accountability and interactivity, we added a text-message component for self-monitoring.</description>

            <description>This existing empirically supported Spanish-language PA intervention, which is based on Social Cognitive Theory and the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), emphasizes behavioral strategies for increasing PA levels (goal-setting, self-monitoring, problem-solving barriers, increasing social support, self-rewards for meeting PA goals).&#xD;
Original Tailored Intervention: The intervention includes regular mailings: weekly in month 1, biweekly in months 2 and 3, monthly in months 4 to 6, and a maintenance dose. Mailings consist of; 1) Manuals matched to the participant's current level of motivational readiness to change, based on TTM 2) Individually tailored computerized expert system feedback reports based on the participant's answers to monthly questionnaires. The computer expert system draws from a bank of over 330 messages developed from previous studies that address different levels of psychosocial and environmental factors affecting PA. 3) PA tip sheets addressing PA barriers specifically identified by Latinas in our formative research (e.g., caregiving duties, neighborhood safety).</description>

        <description>The 7-Day PAR is an interviewer administered instrument that uses multiple strategies for increasing accuracy of participant recall regarding many types of activities such as time spent sleeping and moderate, hard, and very hard intensity activities. The 7-Day PAR is used across many studies assessing physical activity and has consistently demonstrated acceptable reliability, internal consistency, and congruent validity with other objective measures of activity levels.</description>

Original Tailored Intervention: The intervention includes regular mailings: weekly in month 1, biweekly in months 2 and 3, monthly in months 4 to 6, and a maintenance dose.

The computer expert system draws from a bank of over 330 messages developed from previous studies that address different levels of psychosocial and environmental factors affecting PA. 3) PA tip sheets addressing PA barriers specifically identified by Latinas in our formative research (e.g., caregiving duties, neighborhood safety).</description>

Participants in the Enhanced Tailored Intervention will receive an interactive technology based intervention that: 1) addresses important SCT constructs for increasing PA that were not significantly changed in the original parent trial (enjoyment/outcome expectations and social support) and 2) provides greater accountability and interactivity for self-monitoring (through text messages), as requested by participants in the original parent trial.&#xD;
Enhanced Tailored Intervention: Participants in the Enhanced Tailored arm will receive all the intervention components of the original tailored intervention, as well as: 1) additional print materials; 2) more in-depth tailored reports; and 3) text-messages. Self-monitoring was an important aspect in increasing PA in our previous trials however, participants were only asked to turn in the self-monitoring logs once a month. Based on the importance of self-monitoring and feedback from participants (R01NR011295; R01CA15994) that they wanted greater accountability and interactivity, we added a text-message component for self-monitoring.</description>

            <description>This existing empirically supported Spanish-language PA intervention, which is based on Social Cognitive Theory and the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), emphasizes behavioral strategies for increasing PA levels (goal-setting, self-monitoring, problem-solving barriers, increasing social support, self-rewards for meeting PA goals).&#xD;
Original Tailored Intervention: The intervention includes regular mailings: weekly in month 1, biweekly in months 2 and 3, monthly in months 4 to 6, and a maintenance dose. Mailings consist of; 1) Manuals matched to the participant's current level of motivational readiness to change, based on TTM 2) Individually tailored computerized expert system feedback reports based on the participant's answers to monthly questionnaires. The computer expert system draws from a bank of over 330 messages developed from previous studies that address different levels of psychosocial and environmental factors affecting PA. 3) PA tip sheets addressing PA barriers specifically identified by Latinas in our formative research (e.g., caregiving duties, neighborhood safety).</description>

            <description>We designed the Enhanced Tailored Intervention to build upon our previous research in order to outperform the original tailored intervention, in a cost effective, theoretically guided and data driven manner with potential for dissemination. Participants in the Enhanced Tailored Intervention will receive an interactive technology based intervention that: 1) addresses important SCT constructs for increasing PA that were not significantly changed in the original parent trial (enjoyment/outcome expectations and social support) and 2) provides greater accountability and interactivity for self-monitoring (through text messages), as requested by participants in the original parent trial.&#xD;
Enhanced Tailored Intervention: Participants in the Enhanced Tailored arm will receive all the intervention components of the original tailored intervention, as well as: 1) additional print materials; 2) more in-depth tailored reports; and 3) text-messages. Self-monitoring was an important aspect in increasing PA in our previous trials however, participants were only asked to turn in the self-monitoring logs once a month. Based on the importance of self-monitoring and feedback from participants (R01NR011295; R01CA15994) that they wanted greater accountability and interactivity, we added a text-message component for self-monitoring.</description>
