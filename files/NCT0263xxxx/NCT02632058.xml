  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the acoustic perception of sound without any physical source. It is estimated&#xD;
      that 15-21% of adults develop a Tinnitus, which can cause serious distress and debilitation&#xD;
      in all aspects of daily life of the affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no evidence for a successful treatment of tinnitus. While one treatment&#xD;
      approach involves sound-based therapies, e.g. tinnitus retraining therapy. The treatment&#xD;
      aspect in our setting involved cognitive behavioural therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the ears or head unrelated to an external source&#xD;
      [Nondahl 2011]. It is a common condition with a prevalence of 25.3% (approximately 50&#xD;
      million) among adults in the United States and increasing with age, peaking at age 60 - 69&#xD;
      years [Shargorodsky 2012] and above the age of 55 years respectively [Nondahl 2012]. Of&#xD;
      individuals with tinnitus, 7.9% (approximately 16 million) experience frequent tinnitus which&#xD;
      involves perception at least once daily [Shargorodsky 2012]. Prevalence of tinnitus in adults&#xD;
      in Europe is described at a similar level with 21.2% [Hendrickx 2007]. In Switzerland&#xD;
      prevalence for tinnitus in individuals over the age of 15 years is 20%; of these 13% report&#xD;
      having a current tinnitus and 7% report of having had tinnitus in the past five years. [Bieri&#xD;
      2012]. It has been shown that the 10-year cumulative incidence for tinnitus is 12.7% [Nondahl&#xD;
      2010]. Gender seems to play a role in the predisposition for tinnitus; prevalence for men is&#xD;
      26.1% and for women 24.6% [Shargorodsky 2012], while the incidence for men is 14.8% and for&#xD;
      women 11.2% [Nondahl 2010]. There is indication that there is also a gender-related level of&#xD;
      affliction related to tinnitus, so that women feel more distress [Seydel 2013] and emotional&#xD;
      disturbance than men [Pajor 2012].&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has also been shown for tinnitus to have a familial occurrence; subjects related to a&#xD;
      sibling with tinnitus have a 1.7 times higher probability to have tinnitus than subjects from&#xD;
      a family without tinnitus. [Hendrickx 2007]. Tinnitus perceived as severe has a prevalence of&#xD;
      1.3% [Nondahl 2012].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors for developing tinnitus are numerous and include conditions involving auditory&#xD;
      function (i.e. hearing impairment, exposure to noise and history of ear surgery, head injury&#xD;
      or otosclerosis), cardiovascular-related (i.e. cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular&#xD;
      disease, obesity, current smoking, higher number of packyears smoked and history of heavy&#xD;
      alcohol consumption) [Nondahl 2012].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tinnitus is also known to be associated with various complaints such as sleep disturbances,&#xD;
      which are reported to be greater in elderly people [Hebert 2007], although there seems to be&#xD;
      no difference between people suffering from insomnia with or without tinnitus, which was&#xD;
      measured in a population of 38-62 year olds [Crönlein 2007]. Furthermore, tinnitus severity&#xD;
      significantly correlates with depression and anxiety symptoms [Udupi 2013]. In addition,&#xD;
      there is a higher incidence of somatoform disorders in individuals with tinnitus [Zirke&#xD;
      2013]. Although the severity of tinnitus is associated with anxiety and depression, a&#xD;
      causality cannot be concluded [Zöger 2006].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning treatment of tinnitus, tinnitus masking and tinnitus retraining therapy are two&#xD;
      successfully applied methods. While both methods use counseling and acoustic stimulation for&#xD;
      intervention, the main objective in tinnitus masking is to use wide-band noise applied&#xD;
      through ear-level devices, in order to provide immediate relief from tinnitus [Henry 2006].&#xD;
      Although both methods show remarkable improvement in ameliorating tinnitus, in comparison the&#xD;
      effects of tinnitus retraining therapy improve progressively over time [Henry 2006]. The&#xD;
      results of tinnitus retraining therapy also sustain over time [Forti 2009] and improve&#xD;
      quality of life of those affected [Seydel 2014].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years there have been numerous publications implementing a therapeutic model based&#xD;
      on cognitive behavioral therapy with a sound-focused tinnitus retraining therapy, proving its&#xD;
      effectiveness and long-term effects [Herraiz 2005, Robinson 2008, Zenner 2012, Cima 2012],&#xD;
      with long-term effects persisting 15 years after completion of the therapy-program [Goebbel&#xD;
      2006]. Also, tinnitus retraining therapy carried out as a short-term therapy in an outpatient&#xD;
      setting has also showed to be maintained over time [Mazurek 2009]. Apart from its therapeutic&#xD;
      effectiveness tinnitus therapy based on cognitive therapy shows an increased&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness compared to usual therapy [Maes 2014].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the tinnitus-clinic in Chur we have been treating patients with a modified&#xD;
      tinnitus-retraining program based on cognitive therapy for a decade. Patients are either&#xD;
      admitted by their general practitioner, Otolaryngologist or self-admitted. We offer capacity&#xD;
      to treat nation-wide patients in an inpatient setting, for a modified tinnitus retraining&#xD;
      therapy lasting four to six-weeks, depending on severity of comorbid factors. Up to date,&#xD;
      there is no other clinic in Switzerland treating individuals in an inpatient setting to the&#xD;
      likes of ours. Admitted patients usually have a long way of suffering with an unsuccessful&#xD;
      search for enduring relief. With this study we intend to show an improvement in treatment of&#xD;
      tinnitus based upon our model of modified tinnitus retraining therapy. If our therapeutic&#xD;
      model is successful, many individuals could benefit from a substantial improvement in quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;

        The study population consists of patients suffering from chronic tinnitus referred to our&#xD;
        clinic by their treating physician. There is a remarkable level of suffering from chronic&#xD;
        tinnitus in these individuals. The participants received an established routine treatment&#xD;
        as part of multimodal treatment at an inpatient psychiatric facility. Clinical experience&#xD;
        shows that the applied treatment poses a low risk and demonstrates a great amount of&#xD;
        benefit. At admission to our clinic all participants were of age and able to give their&#xD;
        consent to treatment.&#xD;
