  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this antidepressant study is to determine the efficacy of vortioxetine on&#xD;
      depression and cognition in 80 women with breast cancer, and to elucidate&#xD;
      inflammatory-mediated mechanisms by which depression and its treatment influence cancer&#xD;
      outcome. Our hypothesis is that effective vortioxetine antidepressant therapy in depressed&#xD;
      women with breast cancer will attenuate increased intermediate endpoints of inflammation that&#xD;
      contribute to the pathogenesis of depression, cognitive impairment, and cancer progression&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depression is an independent risk factor for incident cancer, recurrence and mortality.&#xD;
      Women with chronic major depression exhibit a four-fold increased rate of incident breast&#xD;
      cancer and a 39% higher mortality rate compared to non-depressed women with breast cancer.&#xD;
      Although the precise biological mechanism linking depression with cancer progression remains&#xD;
      unclear, elevated concentrations of systemic inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and associated cytokine proteins) have been independently&#xD;
      associated with depression and cancer progression. In the context of breast cancer, secretion&#xD;
      of tumor-derived cytokines is a known mechanism by which epithelial tumors are able to&#xD;
      recruit immune cells (MDSCs). The presence of MDSCs at the primary tumor site favors tumor&#xD;
      pathogenesis and correlates with more aggressive breast cancer subtypes. At the systemic&#xD;
      level, increased levels of interleukin-6, circulating MDSCs, circulating tumor cells (CTCs)&#xD;
      and inflammatory markers in the bloodstream of breast cancer patients are found to strongly&#xD;
      correlate with poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical conditions such as major depression are associated with increased levels of systemic&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby creating a host environment that promotes cancer&#xD;
      progression. Indeed, innate immune activation and chronic inflammation have been implicated&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of major depression and may account for the biological mechanism linking&#xD;
      depression and cancer progression. Several studies have shown antidepressant treatment&#xD;
      response attenuates and normalizes pro-inflammatory cytokine plasma levels in&#xD;
      medically-healthy patients with depression. To date, only three randomized controlled&#xD;
      antidepressant studies have been conducted in depressed women with breast cancer. Two studies&#xD;
      found mainserin to be effective and superior to placebo, whereas paroxetine and desipramine&#xD;
      were comparable to placebo. Notably, several randomized controlled trials in depressed breast&#xD;
      cancer patients found psychotherapy to be an effective depression treatment. Moreover, these&#xD;
      studies found psychotherapy significantly lengthened survival time in depressed breast cancer&#xD;
      patients with metastatic disease. Remarkably, no randomized controlled trials have examined&#xD;
      the impact of antidepressant medications on cancer survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there have been no randomized, placebo-controlled antidepressant studies in&#xD;
      depressed women with breast cancer to investigate the impact of depression treatment on&#xD;
      cognition and the inflammatory mediators that promote cancer progression. This study will&#xD;
      explore the efficacy of vortioxetine on depression and cognition in women with breast cancer,&#xD;
      and determine whether successful treatment of depression alters circulating cytokines, immune&#xD;
      mediators, and circulating tumor cells, thus elucidating a possible mechanism to explain&#xD;
      improved cancer outcome with effective antidepressant treatment. Given the disproportionately&#xD;
      high rate of depression in women with breast cancer and its negative impact on cancer&#xD;
      outcome, understanding the biological mechanism that drives this relationship is critical.&#xD;
      This study may uncover novel immune-mediated mechanisms by which vortioxetine treatment&#xD;
      ameliorates depression, enhances cognition, and influences cancer outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective - To assess antidepressant efficacy of vortioxetine (VTX) treatment in&#xD;
      women with major depressive disorder (MDD) who have completed curative treatment of Stage I,&#xD;
      II or III breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint Antidepressant efficacy will be assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating&#xD;
      Scale-21 (HDRS-21) total score administered at specified time points. Antidepressant response&#xD;
      is defined as a 50% reduction in baseline HDRS-21 total score, and treatment remission is&#xD;
      defined as an HDRS-21 total score ≤7. Antidepressants will be deemed effective if the&#xD;
      patient's depression does not worsen. A participant's depression will be classified as&#xD;
      &quot;worse&quot; if a) the participant becomes suicidal or psychotic, b) their HAM-D score increases &gt;&#xD;
      18, or over a four-week period of time: c) the HAM-D score increases, and d) the CGI&#xD;
      Improvement Rating has increased by at least one point. The definitions of antidepressant&#xD;
      efficacy and worsening depression remain the same during Cycle 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Cognitive function will be assessed by Brief Assessment of Cognition in Affective Disorders&#xD;
      (BAC-A) test battery with measures in: (1) list learning, (2) digit sequencing task, (3)&#xD;
      token motor task, (4) verbal fluency, (5) tower of London test, (6) symbol coding, and (7)&#xD;
      affective processing subtest. All BAC-A measures will be administered at specified time&#xD;
      points, and the total composite z-scores will be compared to baseline total composite&#xD;
      z-scores.&#xD;
