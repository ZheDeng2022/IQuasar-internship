                  standard guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  At least 1 (segmental) perfusion defect(s) in ventilation/perfusion (V/Q)&#xD;

          -  Any medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could jeopardize the&#xD;
             safety of the patient or his/her compliance in the study, or otherwise make the&#xD;
             patient inappropriate for study participation&#xD;
