      of Colorado Hospital will be screened for eligibility and enrollment in the study to receive&#xD;

      This study plans to learn more about whether simpler diagnostic tests can be used to identify&#xD;
      the development of acute neuromuscular loss of function in patients with critical illness and&#xD;
      respiratory failure receiving mechanical ventilation. ICU patients admitted to the University&#xD;
      of Colorado Hospital will be screened for eligibility and enrollment in the study to receive&#xD;
      weekly measurements of nerve and muscle function through nerve conduction studies (NCS),&#xD;
      muscle ultrasound tests, and concentric needle electromyography (EMG) tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data includes the subject's age, gender, race, ethnicity, length of stay in ICU,&#xD;
      time on mechanical ventilation and pertinent medical history that could indicate baseline&#xD;
      neuromyopathy (CNS disease, diabetes, HIV, alcohol use disorder). Baseline neurological&#xD;
      examination will be performed within 48 hours of meeting the inclusion criteria. This&#xD;
      examination will include the level of consciousness, muscle tone, motor strength using the&#xD;
      Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale, sensory function, muscle stretch reflexes, and plantar&#xD;
      responses. For MRC testing, six muscle groups will be tested bilaterally: shoulder abduction,&#xD;
      elbow flexion, wrist extension, hip flexion, knee extension, and foot dorsiflexion. Clinical&#xD;
      weakness on examination (which is necessary to make the diagnosis of CIPNM (Critical Illness&#xD;
      Polyneuropathy and Myopathy)) is defined as an MRC score equal to or less than 48 (maximum&#xD;
      score is 60). If a subject cannot participate in any MRC strength testing (e.g. due to&#xD;
      sedation or encephalopathy) they will be coded at the lowest level (most severe clinical&#xD;
      weakness). Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and concentric needle electromyography (EMG) will&#xD;
      be performed (as described below) on the same day as the initial neurological examination.&#xD;
      The neurological examination and NCS/EMG will be repeated on a weekly basis until CIPNM is&#xD;
      diagnosed or the subject is discharged from the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM #1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1.1: To determine whether amplitude reductions in the peroneal and sural nerve action&#xD;
      potentials on NCS can serve as accurate screening tests for CIPNM in patients with acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1.2: To determine whether increased duration of the CMAP on NCS can serve as an accurate&#xD;
      screening test for CIPNM in patients with acute respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1.3: To determine whether changes in muscle ultrasound echogenicity and/or thickness can&#xD;
      serve as accurate screening tests for CIPNM in patients with acute respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1.4: To determine the incidence of CIPNM in patients with neurological critical illness&#xD;
      (such as intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage), which requires prolonged length of&#xD;
      stay in a neurosurgical intensive care unit.&#xD;

    <description>Ultrasound will be performed using a linear-array transducer with standardized gain and varying depth based on the amount of overlying soft tissue and muscle size. The subjects will be examined in the supine position with extended limbs and relaxed muscles. We will perform bilateral scans of the biceps, anterior forearm, and anterior thigh at standardized sites. For muscle echogenicity measurements, we will scan the same muscles at the same points.</description>

    <description>Nerve Conduction Studies will be performed using a Nicolet EDX using standard procedures. Repetitive stimulation of the median motor nerve are performed in all subjects. Bilateral sural, radial and median sensory nerves will be analyzed. We will only perform surface, not subdermal sensory recordings. The bilateral peroneal, tibial and median motor responses will be recorded over extensor digitorum brevis, abductor hallucis brevis, and abductor pollicis brevis muscles. The peroneal motor nerve will be stimulated at the fibular head and lateral popliteal fossa, recording from the tibialis anterior muscle. The compound motor action potential (CMAP) responses will be elicited from standard distal and proximal sites.</description>

    <description>EMG studies will be performed using standard precautions. Insertional activity, spontaneous activity, motor unit potential (MUP) morphology and recruitment/activation pattern will be recorded from some combination of the deltoid, triceps, biceps, first dorsal interosseous, abductor pollicis brevis, iliopsoas, vastus medialis, and tibialis anterior muscles. The specific muscles studied for each patient will vary according to the patient's level of consciousness and ability to activate the muscles either voluntarily or during spontaneous limb movement. If possible, we will try to examine 3 unilateral upper extremity and 3 unilateral lower extremity muscles. If a patient is not able to volitionally participate in EMG testing (by contracting their muscles on command), we will analyze insertional/spontaneous activity and potentially morphology/recruitment (e.g. stroking the sole of the foot to stimulate contraction of the tibialis anterior).</description>
