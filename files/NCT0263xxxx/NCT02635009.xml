  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well whole-brain radiation therapy works and&#xD;
      compares it with or without hippocampal avoidance in treating patients with small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer that is found in one lung, the tissues between the lungs, and nearby lymph nodes only&#xD;
      (limited stage) or has spread outside of the lung in which it began or to other parts of the&#xD;
      body (extensive stage). Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and&#xD;
      shrink tumors. The hippocampus is part of the brain that is important for memory. Avoiding&#xD;
      the hippocampus during whole-brain radiation could decrease the chance of side effects on&#xD;
      memory and thinking. It is not yet known whether giving whole-brain radiation therapy is more&#xD;
      effective with or without hippocampal avoidance in treating patients with small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether the 12-month intracranial relapse rate following hippocampal avoidance&#xD;
      (HA)-prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is non-inferior compared to the rate following&#xD;
      PCI for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). (Randomized Phase II Component&#xD;
      [Non-Inferiority]) II. Determine whether HA-PCI reduces the likelihood of 6-month&#xD;
      deterioration from baseline in Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT)-Revised (R) delayed recall&#xD;
      compared to PCI for patients with SCLC. (Phase III Component [Efficacy])&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare time to cognitive failure, as measured by a battery of tests (HVLT-R, Controlled&#xD;
      Oral Word Association [COWA] test, and Trail Making Test [TMT] parts A and B), after PCI&#xD;
      versus HA-PCI in SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare time to cognitive failure as separately measured by each test (HVLT-R for Total&#xD;
      Recall and Delayed Recognition, COWA test, and TMT parts A and B), after PCI versus HA-PCI&#xD;
      for SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare patient-reported cognitive functioning and other quality of life domains&#xD;
      (assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] Quality&#xD;
      of Life Questionnaire [QLQ]-Core [C]30 and BN20) between PCI versus HA-PCI for patients with&#xD;
      SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Compare overall survival after PCI versus HA-PCI for patients with SCLC. V. Compare&#xD;
      12-month intracranial relapse rate (at completion of phase III) and time to intracranial&#xD;
      relapse after PCI versus HA-PCI for patients with SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Evaluate adverse events according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (CTCAE) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Correlate changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) domains with changes in&#xD;
      cognitive testing outcomes following PCI versus HA-PCI for patients with SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Assess cost-effectiveness of HA-PCI (intensity modulated radiation therapy [IMRT]) and&#xD;
      PCI (3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy [3DCRT]) using the EuroQual (EQ)-5-Dimensions&#xD;
      (5D)-5L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. Correlate miRNA signatures with cognitive failure in SCLC patients who received PCI and&#xD;
      HA-PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. Evaluate APOE genotyping as potential predictor of neurocognitive decline, hippocampal&#xD;
      atrophy after brain irradiation and/or differential benefit from hippocampal avoidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. Evaluate baseline MR imaging biomarkers of white matter injury and hippocampal volumetry&#xD;
      as potential predictors of cognitive decline and differential benefit from HA-PCI as compared&#xD;
      to PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Collect serum, whole blood, and urine for future translational research analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate baseline magnetic resonance (MR) imaging biomarkers of white matter injury and&#xD;
      hippocampal volumetry as potential predictors of cognitive decline and differential benefit&#xD;
      from HAPCI as compared to PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo PCI using 3DCRT daily for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo PCI with HA using IMRT daily for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then&#xD;
      every 6 months until 3 years and then annually until death.&#xD;

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness as measured by the EQ-5D (Phase III)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Quality-adjusted life years (QALY's) will be assessed as the area under the preference-weighted survival curve. Cost will be assessed using a societal perspective. The primary cost-effectiveness outcome will be the pooled incremental cost-per QALY ratio for HA-PCI versus standard PCI. The incremental cost per QALY ratio will be calculated as the total cost of the HA-PCI minus total cost of standard PCI which will be divided by the quality adjusted survival of the patients treated with HA-PCI minus the quality adjusted survival of patients receiving standard PCI.</description>

    <measure>Intracranial relapse rate (Phase III)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of intracranial relapse will be defined as appearance of brain metastasis in brain. Cumulative incidence approach will be used to estimate the median time to intracranial relapse to account for the competing risk of death. Gray's test will be used to test for statistically significant difference in the distribution of intracranial relapse times. Cause-specific Cox proportional hazards regression model will be used to evaluate effect of stratification variables (age, stage, and planned concurrent memantine use) and other baseline characteristics, on time to intracranial relapse.</description>

    <measure>Patient-reported HRQOL, as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BN20 (Phase III)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation of changes in HRQOL domains measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BN20 with changes in cognitive function will be assessed. Additionally cognitive function decline at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months will also be assessed and compared using Fisher's exact test. Decline from baseline to each time point (3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months from the start of treatment) in the following subscales will also be assessed and compared using Fisher's exact test: global QOL, physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, and social functioning domains along with fatigue and pain items.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Standardized scores that adjust for age, education, and gender when necessary will be analyzed. For discrete time point analyses, the change from baseline to each follow-up time point (3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months from the start of treatment) will be calculated and compared between treatment arms using a t-test or Wilcoxon-Mann- Whitney test, depending on the normality of the data. Neurocognitive decline using the RCI for the HVLT-R, COWA, and TMT also will be compared between treatment arms at each follow-up time point using Fisher's exact test.</description>

    <measure>Time to neurocognitive failure, where a failure is defined using the RCI criteria, as measured by HVLT-R, COWA test, and TMT Parts A and B (Phase III)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative incidence approach will be used to estimate the median time to neurocognitive failure to account for the competing risk of death. Gray's test will be used to test for statistically significant difference in the distribution of neurocognitive failure times. The cause-specific Cox proportional hazards regression model will be used to evaluate the effect of stratification variables (age, stage, and planned concurrent memantine use) and other baseline characteristics, on time to neurocognitive decline.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>White matter injury and hippocampal volume on neurocognitive function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline to 6 months will be compared between arms using the t-test (or Wilcoxon test if not normally distributed) in the total score and the two subscale scores (agency and pathway). These scores will be correlated with the EORTC- QLQ-C30 total score using a Pearson correlation coefficient. A general linear model will be used to assess hopefulness, performed separately for the AHS total score and subscale scores, between treatment arms while adjusting for depression.</description>
