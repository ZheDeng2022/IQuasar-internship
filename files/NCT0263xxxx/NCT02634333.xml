  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple studies have implicated vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF as a major causative&#xD;
      factor in human eye diseases characterized by neovascularization including proliferative&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and vascular permeability including diabetic macular edema (DME).&#xD;
      While there is strong evidence that PDR outcomes are markedly reduced in eyes that are&#xD;
      treated with monthly anti-VEGF therapy (A Study of Ranibizumab Injection in Subjects With&#xD;
      Clinically Significant Macular Edema (ME) With Center Involvement Secondary to Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus: RIDE/RISE) and moderately reduced in eyes that received fairly frequent dosing&#xD;
      during the 1st year of treatment (Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network protocol I),&#xD;
      it is unknown whether or not an earlier but less frequent dosing regimen would result in&#xD;
      similar, favorable anatomic outcomes, and whether favorable anatomic outcomes subsequently&#xD;
      would result in favorable visual acuity outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this study demonstrates that intravitreous aflibercept treatment is effective and safe for&#xD;
      reducing the onset of PDR or center involved- DME (CI-DME) in eyes that are at high risk for&#xD;
      these complications, a new strategy to prevent vision threatening complications of diabetes&#xD;
      will be available for patients. The application of intravitreous aflibercept earlier in the&#xD;
      course of disease (i.e., at the time when an eye has baseline severe non-proliferative&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy) could help to reduce future potential treatment burden in patients, at&#xD;
      the same time resulting in similar or better long-term visual outcomes, if PDR and DME are&#xD;
      prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this protocol are to 1) determine the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      intravitreous aflibercept injections versus sham injections (observation) for prevention of&#xD;
      PDR or CI-DME in eyes at high risk for development of these complications and 2) compare&#xD;
      long-term visual outcomes in eyes that receive anti-VEGF therapy early in the course of&#xD;
      disease with those that are observed initially, and treated only if high-risk PDR or CI-DME&#xD;
      with vision loss develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing other visual acuity outcomes between treatment groups, such as proportion of&#xD;
           eyes with at least 10 or at least 15 letter loss from baseline, or gain or loss of at&#xD;
           least 5 letters at the consecutive study visit just before and at the 2- or 4-year visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing optical coherence tomography (OCT) outcomes, such as mean change in OCT&#xD;
           central subfield thickness and volume from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing proportion of eyes with at least 2 and 3-step worsening or improvement of&#xD;
           diabetic retinopathy severity level (scale for individual eyes) by central reading&#xD;
           center from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing associated treatment and follow-up exam costs between treatment groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing safety outcomes between treatment groups&#xD;

             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • The widest method of imaging available at the site must be used to document whether&#xD;
             there is NV present in the periphery; however, presence of NV outside of the&#xD;
             7-modified ETDRS fields on ultrawide field imaging will not be an exclusion provided&#xD;

             (anti-VEGF) treatment not required AND investigator and potential participant are&#xD;
             willing to wait for development of high-risk characteristics (defined in protocol) to&#xD;
             treat PDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Media clarity, pupillary dilation, and study participant cooperation sufficient to&#xD;
             obtain adequate fundus photographs, fluorescein angiogram, and OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Investigator must verify accuracy of OCT scan by ensuring it is centered and of&#xD;

             randomization with any drug that has not received regulatory approval for the&#xD;
             indication being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Note: study participants cannot participate in another investigational trial that&#xD;
             involves treatment with an investigational drug while participating in the study.&#xD;

             pregnant within the next 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Women who are potential study participants should be questioned about the potential&#xD;
             for pregnancy. Investigator judgment is used to determine when a pregnancy test is&#xD;
             needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Individual is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center to an area not&#xD;
             covered by another Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network certified clinical&#xD;

             retinal vein or artery occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,&#xD;
             vitreomacular traction, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of DME or diabetic retinopathy treatment with laser or intraocular injections&#xD;
             of medication within the prior 12 months and no more than 4 prior intraocular&#xD;
             injections at any time in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Enrollment will be limited to a maximum of 25% of the planned sample size with any&#xD;
             history of treatment for DME and/or diabetic retinopathy. Once this number of eyes has&#xD;
             been enrolled, any history of treatment for DME and/or diabetic retinopathy will be an&#xD;
             exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any&#xD;
             intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 4 months or anticipated within the next 6&#xD;
