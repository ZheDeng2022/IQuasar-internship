      The purpose of this study is to observe whether hepatic infusion by oxaliplatin, irinotecan&#xD;
      and raltitrexed with or without embolization by lipiodol or microspheres are effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of refratory liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of most popular cancer worldwide. Patients with liver metastasis&#xD;
      have poor prognosis except for curative resection. Chemotherapy combined biologic agents have&#xD;
      improved mCRC median progress free survival and median overall surivival, but it is difficult&#xD;
      to deal with liver lesions after FOLFOX and FOLFIRI treatments failed. We aim to observe the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of hepatic infusion and embolization of oxaliplatin, irinotecan and&#xD;
      raltitrexed treatment for refratory liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
             colon or rectum that is metastatic to the liver and for which standard curative&#xD;
             measures do not exist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received prior irinotecan-based treatment for their disease and had&#xD;
             documented progression by RECIST criteria; patients must also have received prior&#xD;
             fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin-based therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver disease must not be amenable to potentially curative surgical resection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have liver-only or liver-predominant disease to be eligible for this&#xD;
             study; hepatic disease must be dominant, but patients are allowed to have extrahepatic&#xD;
             disease provided it is not judged likely to be life threatening within 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a patent portal vein as documented by CT, MRI, or ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy is allowed but must have been completed &gt;= 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             study entry; patients with history of prior radiation to the liver including&#xD;
             radio-labeled microspheres cannot take part in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous surgery or RFA to the liver is allowed; patients with history of&#xD;
             chemoembolization or radio-labeled microspheres are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of &gt;= 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)/Alkaline Phosphatase =&lt; 2.5 X institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PT/PTT &lt; 1.5 X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and sexually active males must agree to use an&#xD;
             accepted and effective method of contraception prior to study entry and for the&#xD;
             duration of the study; WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who&#xD;
             has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal; even women who are using&#xD;
             oral, implanted or injectable contraceptive hormones or mechanical products such as an&#xD;
             intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent&#xD;
             pregnancy or practicing abstinence or where partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy)&#xD;

             risk of fetal harm including death from the therapeutic agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this study because of their&#xD;
             poor prognosis and frequent development of progressive neurological dysfunction that&#xD;
             would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, known HIV-positive patients and those with&#xD;
             known hepatitis B or C are excluded from the study Uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
             including, but not limited to, ongoing or active bacterial infection, symptomatic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically evident ascites requiring medical management or paracentesis,&#xD;
             or Childs-Pugh score B/C are not eligible&#xD;
