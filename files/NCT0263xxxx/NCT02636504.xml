      The objectives of this study are to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive&#xD;
      predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of laser Doppler flowmetry in&#xD;
      determining the vitality of teeth and comparing with those of electric pulp testing and cold&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prior to starting any endodontic treatment, it is essential to determine the vitality of the&#xD;
      tooth in question. Vitality of a tooth is defined as the presence of blood flow into the&#xD;
      tooth. The vitality status of a tooth will affect the success of endodontic treatment, and&#xD;
      therefore plays an important role in treatment planning. Two established methods of&#xD;
      determining vitality are electric pulp tests and cold tests. However, both these methods have&#xD;
      drawbacks. Both methods use the presence of sensory feedback in the tooth as a predictor of&#xD;
      tooth vitality. This can lead to errors because blood flow and nerves in the tooth may be&#xD;
      lost at different times, resulting in false-positive and false-negative responses. Both are&#xD;
      subjective and patient-dependent, relying on the patient to indicate when pain is felt. In&#xD;
      addition, studies have suggested that electric pulp testing and cold tests are not as&#xD;
      reliable in immature teeth, teeth undergoing orthodontic movement, traumatized teeth, and&#xD;
      teeth with significant secondary dentin. Laser Doppler flowmetry is a technique that utilizes&#xD;
      the Doppler principle to determine blood flow. It has been used widely in the medical field&#xD;
      to measure blood flow in the skin. Some studies have also shown good results in measuring&#xD;
      blood flow in the pulp of teeth. The objectives of this study are to determine the&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy&#xD;
      of laser Doppler flowmetry in determining the vitality of teeth and comparing with those of&#xD;
      electric pulp testing and cold testing.&#xD;

    <measure>The number of teeth showing the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative after pulp vitality testing</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who present to the endodontic clinic for a consultation visit prior to treatment. The patient will have three types of pulp vitality tests done on the tooth that is to receive endodontic treatment. The number of teeth that show the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative after pulp vitality testing will be measured. For example, a tooth that is diagnosed nonvital based on the pulp vitality testing will be confirmed when endodontic treatment is performed. If there is a discrepancy, it can be counted as false negative. When a tooth is diagnosed vital based on the pulp testing and confirmed to be vital, it can be counted as true positive. When a tooth is diagnosed vital based on the pulp testing and confirmed to be nonvital, it can be counted as false positive. When a tooth is diagnosed nonvital and confirmed novital, it is counted as true negative.</description>

        Patients that need endodontic treatment will have a consultation visit first. In most&#xD;
        cases, the endodontic treatment will be provided at a subsequent visit. In some cases the&#xD;
        endodontic treatment will be provided at the same visit. Patients who present to the&#xD;
        endodontic clinic for a consultation visit for endodontic treatment. The patient will have&#xD;
        three types of pulp vitality tests done on the tooth that is to receive endodontic&#xD;
        treatment.&#xD;
