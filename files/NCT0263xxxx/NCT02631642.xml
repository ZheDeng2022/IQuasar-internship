    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of&#xD;
      HMPL-689 in healthy volunteers To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of single oral doses&#xD;
      of HMPL-689 in healthy volunteers&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive a single dose of HMPL-689 or matching placebo during Day 1. The planned&#xD;
      dose levels are: 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 25 and 30 mg (about 7 cohorts of 8 subjects). In each&#xD;
      dose cohort, 8 subjects will be randomized to receive HMPL-689 (6 subjects) or placebo (2&#xD;
      subjects) under fed condition with a standard meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first dose Cohort (1 mg), a sentinel group of 2 subjects (1 HMPL-689 and 1 placebo)&#xD;
      will be dosed 24 hours prior to the planned dosing of the remaining six subjects. The&#xD;
      decision of dose escalation or study termination will be made jointly by the principal&#xD;
      investigator and the sponsor based on the clinical data (safety, tolerability, available PK&#xD;
      data and clinical laboratory values). Any dose level may be repeated, reduced or split into 2&#xD;
      doses if deemed appropriate by the Principal Investigator and Sponsor's medical Expert.&#xD;
