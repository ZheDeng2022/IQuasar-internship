  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the second Phase-II trial analyzing efficacy outcomes of PBF-680 in asthmatic&#xD;
      subjects, following the supportive data from the proof-of-concept trial on the effect of&#xD;
      PBF-680 on airway hyperresponsiveness to adenosine monophasphate (AMP). The purpose of the&#xD;
      present study is to provide an assessment on the efficacy of a 5-day treatment course of once&#xD;
      daily, orally administered, 10-mg PBF-680 doses, to attenuate &quot;Late Asthmatic Responses&quot;&#xD;
      (LAR) as a primary efficacy outcome. The study also aims at analyzing the effect of the&#xD;
      PBF-680 treatment course on airway inflammation-related outcomes including airway&#xD;
      hyperresponsiveness to AMP at 24 h after allergen bronchoprovocation, plus nitric oxide&#xD;
      fraction in exhaled air (FeNO) and airway inflammatory cells counts in induced sputum under&#xD;
      the effect of an additional 10-mg PBF-680 dose on the 6th treatment period day. Overall, the&#xD;
      study aims at providing evidence on the efficacy of PBF-680 on outcomes, particularly the&#xD;
      LAR, that are well established to screen valid drugs for asthma maintenance therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and female adults aged ³18, who have signed the informed consent form prior to&#xD;
             initiation of any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who have controlled asthma, diagnosed and determined as such as per the&#xD;
             Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, with low-to-medium dose inhaled&#xD;
             corticosteroid (ICS) as maintenance monotherapy and inhaled, short-acting β2-agonist&#xD;
             bronchodilator as rescue medication, for a minimum 4-week period before screening&#xD;
             visit V1. Controlled asthma under the stated therapy can be the current, stable&#xD;
             condition presented at visits V0 and V1 or can be achieved through GINA&#xD;
             guideline-based clinical practice through one or more discretionary V0b visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have a body mass index between 18 and 35 kg/m².&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must be able to perform acceptable spirometry in accordance with American&#xD;
             Thoracic Society (ATS) / European Respiratory Society (ERS) criteria for acceptability&#xD;
             and repeatability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current smokers, smokers within six months prior to Visit V1, or subjects with an&#xD;
             smoking history greater than 10 packs-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Asthmatics classed as &quot;intermittent asthma&quot; managed in GINA-1 therapeutic step or&#xD;
             asthmatics that need any maintenance controller medication beyond low-to-medium&#xD;
             inhaled corticosteroid (ICS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients under any immunosuppressive medication whether asthma-related or indicated&#xD;
             for any concomitant morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with a history of life-threatening asthma attacks (i.e. requiring intensive&#xD;
             care unit (ICU) admission, orotracheal intubation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with a history of a respiratory tract infection or an asthma exacerbation&#xD;
             requiring the use of antibiotics and/or systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to visit V1, or who develop a respiratory tract infection or asthma exacerbation&#xD;
             during the screening period. In the latter case, the subjects can be re-screened 4&#xD;
             weeks after the last dose of systemic corticosteroid (except for depot&#xD;
             corticosteroids; see Table 5.5-1) or antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects that received bronchial thermoplasty treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with a concomitant pulmonary or thoracic disease other than asthma that may&#xD;
             compromise safety or interfere with efficacy outcomes as per site investigator&#xD;
             assessment. This includes, but is not limited to, COPD (COPD) attributable to tobacco&#xD;
             or α1- antitrypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung&#xD;
             disease, pulmonary hypertension, active pulmonary tuberculosis, or any prior condition&#xD;
             that led to pulmonary resection surgery or lung transplantation. Non-cystic fibrosis&#xD;
             bronchiectasis without clinically significant morbidity, moderate α1-antitrypsin&#xD;
             deficiency without evidence of emphysema or related COPD, or past pulmonary&#xD;
             tuberculosis that received proper medical treatment, are acceptable provided that the&#xD;

             interpretation of skin prick allergy tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with symptoms of angina pectoris or with a history of confirmed coronary&#xD;
             disease or cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Women of child-bearing potential, unless they are surgically sterile (i.e. bilateral&#xD;
             tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy), are at least 2&#xD;
             years postmenopausal, practice abstinence, or agree to employ effective contraception&#xD;
             from Visit 1 through final visit. Acceptable contraception procedures are oral,&#xD;
             transdermal, or implanted contraceptives, intrauterine device, female condom with&#xD;
             spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, or use of a condom with spermicide by the&#xD;
