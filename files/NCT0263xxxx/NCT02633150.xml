    <textblock>
      Obesity, chronic disease, is a real public health problem because of its high prevalence but&#xD;
      also because of the high risk of complications, including insulin resistance (IR) and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D). The mechanisms involved in the development of IR are not well known.&#xD;
      Oxidative stress and inflammation induced by food overload could be the initiators IR&#xD;
      mechanisms in skeletal muscle, responsible for the use of nearly 80% glucose in response to&#xD;
      insulin and therefore plays a major role in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Thus, an&#xD;
      increase in ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species), markers of oxidative stress and chronic low-grade&#xD;
      inflammation have been demonstrated in subjects with obesity, the latter decreasing in weight&#xD;
      loss. Therapeutically, loosing weight is still very difficult these days, because of the&#xD;
      complexity of this chronic disease. Thus, it is well established that restrictive diets to&#xD;
      expose weight rebound, dramatic medically as in human terms for these patients. Support for&#xD;
      physical activity is also difficult because of reduced mobility in patients, refer to the&#xD;
      lack of motivation among some. Finally, investigators have no treatment &quot;against-obesity&quot; who&#xD;
      have demonstrated a benefit / risk enough to be used routinely. It is therefore essential to&#xD;
      seek other means of struggle against the IR, see help in weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, it is well established that the consumption of certain antioxidants, including&#xD;
      polyphenols (PP) grape as extracts and whole foods, modulates favorably several pathways&#xD;
      responsible for the development of IR in cell models animals. The results of antioxidants&#xD;
      supplementation in humans are few and controversial. However, most supplementation studies in&#xD;
      human used a PP, Resveratrol at supra nutritional doses (ie not compatible with a balanced&#xD;
      diet of fruits and vegetables). In a previous study, investigators tested the interest of a&#xD;
      supplementation with red grape PP nutritional doses in healthy subjects with metabolic risk&#xD;
      (overweight subjects and related to the first degree of T2DM patients) on IR hyperinsulinemic&#xD;
      euglycemic clamp measured. During this study, the PP have prevented the central mechanisms of&#xD;
      muscle IR that are oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by a load fructose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this project, investigators propose to test the effect of a red grape PP supplementation&#xD;
      at nutritional doses for 8 weeks on IR and weight loss in 30 obese insulin resistant. This is&#xD;
      a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled. This supplementation will be associated with a&#xD;
      standard support for their obesity performed routinely in the Nutrition and Diabetes unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific inclusion criteria: Female or male nondiabetic 50-65 years, BMI&gt; 30 kg / m2 and with&#xD;
      a HOMA&gt; 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to test whether supplementation PP improves systemic insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity (GIR: rate glucose infusion) measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (gold&#xD;
      standard for measuring insulin sensitivity) in insulin-resistant obese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test whether supplementation PP improves insulin sensitivity to tissue (fat and muscle)&#xD;
           and compare the response to supplementation in these two tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in improving IR: regulation&#xD;
           of inflammation, oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether supplementation PP optimizes weight reduction compared to a standard&#xD;
           single support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NSN: The number of subjects required was evaluated from our previous work (2013 Hokayem et&#xD;
      al.) Whose main objective was to assess the impact of PD versus placebo in first degree&#xD;
      relatives of patients with diabetes type 2. Under a bilateral alternative hypothesis of a&#xD;
      nonparametric test (Mann-Whitney), 1: 1 ratio, a power of 80% and an alpha risk of 0.05, the&#xD;
      number of subjects was estimated at 15 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Anthropometric measurements, assessment of body composition (DEXA) system&#xD;
      application characterization (metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, adipokines and&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity: clamp hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic, lipopolysaccharides: LPS) / tissue&#xD;
      characterization (biopsies of skeletal muscle and tissue adipose): insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      inflammation, oxidative stress, gene regulation (sirt1), mitochondrial activity / cell&#xD;
      characterization (adipocyte precursor and muscle) insulin sensitivity, inflammation,&#xD;
      oxidative stress, sirt1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hope to demonstrate that a non-pharmacological treatment based on nutritional&#xD;
      doses of PP supplementation can improve insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant obese&#xD;
      patients, refer to optimize weight loss compared to a standardized management of obesity and&#xD;
      determine the mechanisms involved.&#xD;
