      A 12-month, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Treat and Extend Regimen (TER) of&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter, single arm study. The study group will be composed of both type 1&#xD;
      or 2 diabetes mellitus patients with center involving DME. Patients with partial or&#xD;
      incomplete response to first-line Bevacizumab (Avastin) treatment of at least 4 monthly&#xD;
      intravitreal injections and no longer than 12 months of treatment (maximum 12 injections )&#xD;
      the last 3 injections must be up to 4-6 weeks . Only one eye of each patients can be&#xD;
      recruited to the study (fellow eye will receive standard of care treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study eye will receive intravitreal injection of aflibercept 2mg/0.05ml at enrolment (day&#xD;
      0). The next follow up visit will be 4 weeks later. At any visit, if sub- or intra-retinal&#xD;
      (or both) fluid is present or if central macular sub-field thickness according to SD-OCT of&#xD;
      larger than 300 micron (Heidelberg Spectralis OCT or equivalent), the patient will receive&#xD;
      intravitreal injection of aflibercept 2mg/0.05ml and treatment interval will remain 4 weeks.&#xD;
      In case that there will not be resolution or improvement (define as decrease in central&#xD;
      macular sub-field thickness of 10% or more from the previous visit or gain of one ETDRS line&#xD;
      or more), the intravitreal injection of aflibercept will be discontinued after 6 monthly&#xD;
      injections and the patient will be followed every 4 weeks. If there will be worsening of 10%&#xD;
      or more in macular thickness and/or loss of one EDTRS line or more of acuity following&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation then injections will be resumed. In cases when there will be no&#xD;
      sub- or intra-retinal fluid on OCT 4 weeks after an injections, a treat and extend regimen&#xD;
      (TER) will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any time point there is an option for rescue treatment if there will be worsening of more&#xD;
      than 10% or increase of 50 micron in macular thickness and loss of one EDTRS line (5 letters)&#xD;
      or more of acuity, or per the decision of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive injection of aflibercept 2mg/0.05ml, and the follow up interval will be&#xD;
      extended by2 weeks. Maximal treatment interval will be 12 weeks . At any point where sub- or&#xD;
      intra-retinal (or both) fluid will appear after the TER regimen was initiated, the interval&#xD;
      between visits and treatments will be reduced back to previous interval which obtained a&#xD;
      fluid free macula. The follow up period will be 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 months, focal laser phothocoagulation can be added if needed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ophthalmic Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Incomplete response to previous intravitreal treatment, defined as remaining of sub or&#xD;
             intraretinal (or both) fluid involving the fovea per OCT after at least 6 monthly&#xD;
             intravitreal injections and no more than 18 months of treatment (maximum 18&#xD;
             intravitreal injections). The last 3 injections must be up to 4-6 weeks apart. The&#xD;
             interval from last treatment to day 0 treatment of the study should be up to 6 months.&#xD;
             If there will be 10% or more of improvement in central macular sub-field thickness&#xD;
             according to SD-OCT, in screening compared with examination 4-6 weeks following last&#xD;
             bevacizumab injection patient cannot be recruited to the study. Patients that will&#xD;
             have an increase in central thickness of more than 50 microns following 3 intravitreal&#xD;
             injections will be allowed to participate in the study without the required need of 6&#xD;
             intravitreal injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Central macular sub-field thickness according to SD-OCT of at least 300 micron&#xD;
             (Heidelberg Spectralis OCT or equivalent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Best corrected visual acuity in the study eye 20/200 and better, .&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilatation to allow fundus imaging.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ophthalmic Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual&#xD;
             acuity loss would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy,&#xD;
             pigmentabnormalities, dense sub-foveal hard exudates).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. An ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of&#xD;
             the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,&#xD;
             neovascular glaucoma, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of pan-retinal photocoagulation or focal laser treatment within three months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment or anticipated need for pan-retinal photocoagulation in the six&#xD;
             months following enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of intraocular surgery (including vitrectomy, cataract extraction, scleral&#xD;
             buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior three months or anticipated within&#xD;
             the next six months following enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        General Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring&#xD;
             dialysis or kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in&#xD;
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular&#xD;
             disease, and glycemic control).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any treatment with an investigational agent in the 60 days prior to trial entry for&#xD;
             any condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known serious allergies to the fluorescein dye used in angiography (mild allergy&#xD;
             amenable to treatment is allowable), or to the components of the aflibercept&#xD;
             formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become&#xD;
             pregnant within the next 24 months.Women who are potential study participants should&#xD;
             be questioned about the potential for pregnancy. Investigator judgment is used to&#xD;
             determine when a pregnancy test is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Stroke or Myocardial infraction within 6 months of trial entry. -&#xD;
