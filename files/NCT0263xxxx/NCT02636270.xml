  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study we want to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) effect of a single injection&#xD;
      of rhIGF-1 in patients with PAPP-A2 mutations compared to heterozygous carriers and healthy&#xD;
      controls. This will be followed by treatment of PAPP-A2 deficient patients with IGF-1 for a&#xD;
      period of one year to assess growth velocity. Additionally we want to further describe the&#xD;
      phenotypic characteristics of patients with PAPP-A2 deficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 24-hour pharmacokinetic response of free and total IGF-1 and IGF binding protein-3&#xD;
      (IGFBP-3) to a single dose of rhIGF-1 (120 mcg/kg) in three patients with PAPP-A2 mutation&#xD;
      compared to up to four unaffected heterozygous relatives and 2 healthy adult controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-year trial of rhIGF-1 at standard dose given to the two youngest males with PAPP-A2&#xD;
      mutation. The primary end point of this trial will be first year height velocity. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include change in height SDS, change in height velocity SDS, and change in&#xD;
      whole body and lumbar spine bone mineral density. The study was amended to extend the&#xD;
      treatment period to continue until the subject has stopped growing. All study procedures&#xD;
      remain the same. Important note: the treatment phase continues to follow the youngest&#xD;
      affected male. The older affected male developed an adverse event that resulted in&#xD;
      discontinuation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of additional phenotypic characteristics of patients with PAPP-A2 mutation will&#xD;
      be studied by collecting information on glucose and insulin metabolism, body composition,&#xD;
      bone geometry and bone density before and after treatment with rhIGF-1. These measures will&#xD;
      be collected at the 12 month time period, and every year thereafter until the completion of&#xD;
      the study. All three affected siblings will take part in the phenotyping activities.&#xD;
