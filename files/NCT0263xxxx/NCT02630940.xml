      This study will aim to investigate the levels of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#xD;
      8-isoprostane in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients' exhaled breath condensate (EBC). EBC&#xD;
      samples will be collected using RTube, prior to analysis for levels of 8-isoprostane. An&#xD;
      acceptability assessment will be performed for this non-invasive method of EBC collection&#xD;
      through a non-validated questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A regression analysis will then be performed for 8-isoprostane levels against the severity of&#xD;
      the patient's cough, assessed through the use of the visual analogue scale for cough (VAS),&#xD;
      the King's brief interstitial lung disease questionnaire (KBILD), the Medical Research&#xD;
      Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale and the Leicester cough questionnaire. Alongside this an&#xD;
      exploratory comparison of cough scores and 8 isoprostane concentration between patients with&#xD;
      and without honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis.&#xD;

        Male or Female Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis sufferers over the age of 40, who have been&#xD;

        thoracic high resolution computed tomography and/or surgical lung according to&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female above the age of 40&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IPF diagnosed by a multi-disciplinary team meeting following review of clinical&#xD;
             history, thoracic high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and/or surgical lung&#xD;
             according to international guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A recognised significant co-existing respiratory disease, defined as a respiratory&#xD;
             condition that exhibits a clinically relevant effect on respiratory symptoms and&#xD;
             disease progression as determined by the principal investigator following&#xD;
             multi-disciplinary discussion. For example, patients with bronchiectasis will only be&#xD;
             included if the bronchiectasis is deemed to be traction bronchiectasis as a result of&#xD;
             idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Airflow obstruction defined as a forced expiratory volume at one second over forced&#xD;
             vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) &lt;60% predicted or a residual volume greater than 120%&#xD;
             predicted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant medical ,surgical or psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             patient's attending physician would exhibit a clinically relevant effect on the&#xD;
             patient's health related quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is unable to provide written informed consent&#xD;
