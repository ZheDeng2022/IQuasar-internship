      This is a pilot study to determine if a standard bolus dose and infusion of dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      can significantly decrease the dose of propofol (infusion) required for accomplishing an MRI.&#xD;
      The investigators are adding a second arm to this study to examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine (single) bolus dose (with no infusion) followed by propofol infusion to&#xD;
      accomplish MRI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine highlighted the accumulating&#xD;
      evidence for neurotoxic effects of anesthetics in animal models and a collection of&#xD;
      epidemiologic studies in humans. Recent studies of anesthesia in fetal and neonatal primates&#xD;
      are yielding more evidence of neurotoxicity associated with many common anesthesia and&#xD;
      sedation techniques (e.g. propofol, etomidate, sevoflurane, desflurane and isoflurane). On&#xD;
      the other hand, the data suggests that some alternative sedative agents, such as&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine, may not have the same neurotoxic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children routinely undergo sedation for MRI scanning with large doses of propofol and other&#xD;
      sedatives. Many of these scans occur at young ages when these children may be at risk of&#xD;
      neurological injury from sedative exposure. In addition, these scans do not involve any&#xD;
      stimulation - which could be protective against neurodegeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a pilot study to determine if a standard bolus dose and infusion of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine can significantly decrease the dose of propofol (infusion) required for&#xD;
      accomplishing an MRI. Based on previous work with the combination of propofol with&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine for other procedures, the investigators propose a standard dose of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine (1 mcg/kg bolus followed by an infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/hour). The&#xD;
      investigators will augment this sedation with propofol 2-3mg/kg titrated bolus followed by&#xD;
      100mcg/kg/min infusion which can also be titrated up or down to a maximum of 300mcg/kg/min to&#xD;
      keep the blood pressure and heart rate within 30% of baseline levels.) This arm of the study&#xD;
      was completed in January 2018 and results were posted on clinicaltrials.gov thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are now adding a second arm to this study (amendment submitted to the FDA&#xD;
      August 2021) to examine the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine (single) bolus dose (with no&#xD;
      infusion) followed by propofol infusion to accomplish MRI. Recruitment for this arm is&#xD;
      currently open (started October 2021) and therefore no data is available to be reported on&#xD;
      this arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of low dose propofol with dexmedetomidine will be&#xD;
      effective undergoing MRI while sparing exposure to the high dose of the sedative.&#xD;

            <description>Patients in this cohort will receive a combination of Dexmedetomidine 1mcg/kg and Propofol100mcg/kg/minute to accomplish an MRI examination.&#xD;
Dexmedetomidine-Propofol: The investigators will administer dexmedetomidine 1mcg/kg over 5 minutes. Next, the investigators will begin an infusion at 1mcg/kg/hour. At the 5 minutes, propofol will be given (2mg/kg bolus followed by 100mcg/kg/min infusion). The attending clinician will determine if the child is in an adequate state to begin the MRI scan. If the child is not sufficiently sedated within 10 minutes, a repeat bolus of propofol 2mg/kg will be administered. The dose will be repeated if the child is not adequately sedated in 2 more minutes. At this time infusion rate of propofol will be increased to 200 mcg/kg/minute. If the child is not sedated in 5 more minutes, the outcome will be recorded as a technique failure and sedation will continue at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.</description>

Dexmedetomidine-Propofol: First, the investigators will administer dexmedetomidine 1mcg/kg over 5 minutes. Next, the investigators will begin an infusion at 1mcg/kg/hour. At the 5 minute point, propofol will be given (2mg/kg bolus followed by 100mcg/kg/min infusion). The attending clinician will determine whether or not the child is in an adequate state to begin the MRI scan. If the sedative effect of the dexmedetomidine-propofol does not produce a sufficiently sedated state within 10 minutes, a repeat bolus of propofol 2mg/kg will be administered. The dose will be repeated if the child is not adequately sedated in 2 more minutes. At this time infusion rate of propofol will be increased to 200 mcg/kg/minute.
