  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of cobimetinib in pediatric and young adult&#xD;
      participants with solid tumors with known or potential kinase pathway activation for which&#xD;
      standard therapy has proven to be ineffective or intolerable or for which no curative&#xD;
      standard-of-care treatment options exist. The study will be conducted in two stages: a&#xD;
      dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage at the recommended dose.&#xD;
