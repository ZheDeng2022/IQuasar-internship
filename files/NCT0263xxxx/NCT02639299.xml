      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria is a serious infection caused by a parasite. People get malaria when an infected&#xD;
      mosquito bites them. Malaria can cause major health and social problems in places were&#xD;
      malaria is common, such as Africa but can also affect travelers who have never been exposed&#xD;
      to malaria. Researchers at the NIH want to find a safe and effective malaria vaccine,&#xD;
      antimalarial drugs, or prevention regimen. To do this, healthy volunteers are recruited under&#xD;
      a general screening study in order to see if are qualified to join a future malaria study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To screen healthy volunteers to see if they are eligible to join investigational malaria&#xD;
      studies. The studies will be trials of investigational antimalarial drugs, malaria vaccines,&#xD;
      or prevention regimens. They may also involve controlled human malaria infection trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18 50&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will first be prescreened by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may go more than 1 year without joining a clinical trial. If this happens, they&#xD;
      may be re-contacted to see if they still want to be part of this screening protocol. Those&#xD;
      who still want to participate and have had relevant medical changes will be rescreened.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a screening protocol for healthy volunteers to participate in research studies&#xD;
      conducted by Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology (LMIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria-related morbidity and mortality have a major economic impact in endemic regions and&#xD;
&#xD;
      present a substantial health risk to non-immune travelers and people living in endemic areas.&#xD;
      To stem the worldwide impact of this devastating disease, a safe and broadly effective&#xD;
      malaria vaccine and improved antimalarial therapeutics are urgently required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This screening protocol is designed to continuously evaluate potential healthy volunteers to&#xD;
      build a pool of volunteers who may participate in future and ongoing LMIV malaria drug,&#xD;
      vaccine, or controlled human malaria infections (CHMI) trials. A complete medical history and&#xD;
      blood and urine samples will be obtained to evaluate whether volunteers are eligible for&#xD;
      study-specific screening.&#xD;
