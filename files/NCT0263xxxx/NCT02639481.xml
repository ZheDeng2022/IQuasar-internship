  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acquired brain injury (ABI) often suffer from severe disorders of consciousness&#xD;
      (DOC), such as coma, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), or minimally conscious state&#xD;
      (MCS). This study examines the effect, a novel robotic rehabilitation device (the Erigo®Pro&#xD;
      system) has on the recovery of consciousness of DOC patients. The device enables patients to&#xD;
      be verticalized very early during acute neurorehabilitation and includes robotic leg movement&#xD;
      training as well as functional electrical stimulation (FES) of leg nerves. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups: (i) control group with standard&#xD;
      physiotherapy without the device, (ii) device treatment without FES, and (iii) device&#xD;
      treatment with FES. Time until recovery of consciousness, rehabilitation outcome, and amount&#xD;
      of complications will be the outcome variables.&#xD;

      Patients with acquired brain injury (ABI) often suffer from severe disorders of consciousness&#xD;
      (DOC), such as coma, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), or minimally conscious state&#xD;
      (MCS). These DOC can be temporary or persistent. Verticalization and multisensory stimulation&#xD;
      are traditionally important therapeutic principles in the neurorehabilitation of such&#xD;
      patients. These principles have not yet been tested in randomized controlled trials yet. This&#xD;
      trial will therefore evaluate the effect that a 4 week training with a verticalization device&#xD;
      (the Erigo®Pro system) with integrated repetitive robotic leg movements and functional&#xD;
      electrical stimulation of the leg muscles (FES) has on the clinical course of DOC patients in&#xD;
      an inpatient neurorehabilitation setting, following acute ABI. 156 patients will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following groups: (i) control group without the Erigo®Pro,&#xD;
      (ii) treatment with the Erigo®Pro without FES, and (iii) treatment with the Erigo®Pro and&#xD;
      simultaneous FES. There will be 4 training sessions per week for 4 weeks with each session&#xD;
      being 60 minutes in length. This will be part of the standard neurorehabilitation program,&#xD;
      which in Germany comprises 300 minutes of therapy per day. Patients in the active treatment&#xD;
      groups ii) and iii) are required to be verticalized above 60° for at least 35 minutes per&#xD;
      treatment session. Patients in the control group will be treated with conventional methods,&#xD;
      including verticalization by therapists but without the help of the device. FES will be&#xD;
      conducted with the following parameters: 8 channels covering the major ventral and dorsal&#xD;
      muscles of the upper and lower, initial current 10 milli ampere (mA), pulse with 250 micro&#xD;
      seconds (µs), frequency 25 herz (Hz), ramp 3. Current will be gradually increased to the&#xD;
      motor threshold plus 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment with the Erigo®Pro system will lead to a quicker recovery of consciousness&#xD;
           (increase of at least one diagnostic category of the CRS-R) than conventional therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment with the Erigo®Pro system including FES will lead to a quicker recovery of&#xD;
           consciousness than using the Erigo®Pro without FES, 3).) Treatment with the Erigo®Pro&#xD;
           system will decrease spasticity and complications of neurorehabilitation (pneumonia,&#xD;
           pressure ulcers) than conventional therapy, and&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.) Treatment with the Erigo®Pro system will lead to an improved longterm patient outcome (6&#xD;
      months) with regard to independence in the activities of daily living, compared to&#xD;
      conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome variable is the Coma Recovery Scale - revised (CRS-R), secondary variables&#xD;
      are the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), the Nociception Coma Scale (NCS), the Modified&#xD;
      Ashworth Scale for spasticity, and quantitative HD-EEG measures for brain activity (power,&#xD;
      variability, entropy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will be prior to first treatment (t0), during the first treatment in vertical&#xD;
      position (t1), directly following the first treatment in horizontal patient positioning (t2),&#xD;
      2 weeks after the first treatment (halfway through treatment protocol, t3), at the end of the&#xD;
      final treatment after weeks (t4), and final outcome measurement, 6 months after the patient&#xD;
      inclusion (t5) within the patients living environment (nursing home or home).&#xD;
