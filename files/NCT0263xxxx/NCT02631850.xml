  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current proposal aims to conduct a multi-site randomized controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      virtual-reality gaming delivery of Constraint Induced Movement therapy (CI therapy) with (1)&#xD;
      traditional clinic-based CI therapy of equal total active therapy duration and (2) a control&#xD;
      group equating the dose of in-person therapy. Individuals with chronic stroke will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of four different interventions: (1) traditional clinic-based CI therapy&#xD;
      (35 therapist/client contact hours), (2) therapist-as-consultant virtual reality CI therapy&#xD;
      (5 therapist/client contact hours in the clinic and 15 hours of independent game play at&#xD;
      home), (3) therapist-as-consultant virtual reality CI therapy with additional therapist&#xD;
      contact via telerehabilitation (5 therapist/client contact hours in the clinic, 2.6 therapist&#xD;
      contact hours via teleconference, and 15 hours of independent game play in the home), and (4)&#xD;
      5 hours of standard occupational therapy (OT) / physical therapy (PT). After 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up, individuals assigned to standard OT/PT will cross over to a modified gaming&#xD;
      therapy condition (a stand-alone application of the rehabilitation game without additional&#xD;
      therapist contact).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 1 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses the time to complete 15 standardized tasks (e.g., folding a towel, stacking checkers, placing hand on top of a box). Items that cannot be accomplished score 120 seconds. Times are natural log transformed to reflect proportional improvement (approximate % change) and correct for skew. On the log transformed scale, -.22 reflects normal ability, 4.79 = can't accomplish task. For improvement in mean log transformed performance time, -4.79 = best possible improvement, 0 = no improvement, positive scores = worsening. A proportional improvement of 16% (mean log transformed performance time change = -.17) is considered clinically meaningful.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Activity Log Quality of Movement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 1 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment evaluates the amount and quality of everyday arm use. The scale consists of 28 activities of daily living (e.g., washing hands, drinking from a cup). Participants self-report on an 11-point scale (0-5 with half-point increments, 0=not attempted to 5=attempted with normal movement). The total score on the measure reflects the mean of the individual item scores. A change of 1.0 on the scale is considered clinically meaningful.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Neuro-Quality of Life (Neuro-QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 1 months</time_frame>
    <description>Computerized adaptive assessment on several domains of quality of life: sleep, mobility, positive affect and well-being, fatigue, satisfaction with social roles, cognitive function, anxiety, and communication. Neuro-QOL uses a T score which has a mean of 50 and SD of 10, based on the norming sample used. All Neuro-QOL banks and scales are scored such that a higher score reflects more of what is being measured. Scores are reported as mean T-scores across the assessed domains. Positive changes indicate an improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bilateral Activity Monitors</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Devices to monitor upper extremity movement are worn throughout treatment. The devices count movements made with each arm, defined as an acceleration of 2g for at least 500 ms. The ratio of more affected to less affected arm use is then calculated for each treatment day. The best linear fit trajectory for each participant is calculated after removal of outliers. The treatment change reported here reflects the difference between the best-fit-line at post-treatment and the best-fit-line at pre-treatment. Positive change indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Brief Kinesthesia Test (BKT)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 1 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measures was intended to measure proprioception in the upper extremity; however, performance on the measure is also known to be adversely affected by motor impairment. The experimenter guides individuals along movement trajectories between 2 and 9 inches with their vision obscured. They are then asked to reproduce the movement trajectories. The summed difference between the desired and produced trajectory endpoints in cm is reported. A negative change indicates an improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament Test</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 1 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sensory evaluator of touch sensation. Units are the log transformed grams of pressure detected by the index finger of the paretic hand. Scores range from -1.8 to 5.7. Smaller scores indicate better sensation. Negative change indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>9 Hole Peg Test</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 1 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment to measure upper extremity distal motor function. The assessment measures the time to place 9 pegs into grooves on a board. Due to the inability of a majority of the participants to place all 9 pegs during the 120 seconds allotted for the test, performance was transformed into a rate metric to reduce floor effects. The outcome is expressed as change in the number of pegs per minute.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline only measure, exploratory covariate in the analysis</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment to measure cognitive function at baseline. The range of the MoCA assessment is 0-30. Scores below 24 indicate cognitive impairment and scores below 16 indicate severe cognitive impairment. The MoCA was administered for the purpose of characterizing the study population and was examined as a potential covariate in linear mixed effect models examining primary and secondary outcome measures.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a 35-hour &quot;dose&quot; of CI therapy. Treatment will consist of 35 therapist/client contact hours in the clinic, 10 weekdays, over 3 weeks. To promote carry-over of motor gains to daily activities, participants will complete: (1) a treatment contract, (2) daily self-report of arm use, and (3) problem-solving to overcome barriers to use of the more affected upper extremity. In addition, the client will agree to wear a padded restraint mitt on the less affected hand for the majority of waking hours to encourage use of the weaker hand for daily activities. Finally, the participant will agree to 30 minutes per day of individualized task-practice outside the clinic (in addition to training in the clinic) focused on functional activities catered towards accomplishing the person's therapeutic goals.</description>

    <description>15 hours of progressive massed motor practice will occur through in-home video game play over 15 consecutive weekdays. Participants will play the game during times of their choosing. The participant will wear an activity monitor biofeedback device for the majority of waking hours. As with traditional CI therapy, the client will agree to an additional 30 minutes per day of individualized task-practice. Five therapist/client contact hours will occur in the clinic on approximate treatment days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and will focus on treatment elements that cannot be readily addressed through the game, such as problem-solving to help the participant carry over motor gains to daily life.</description>

    <description>Five therapist/client contact hours will occur on approximate treatment days 1, 3, 6, and 11 (same schedule as gaming CI therapy). 1 hour progressive resistance exercise to establish and progress an upper extremity home exercise program, 2 hours of neuromuscular reeducation, and 2 hours functional practice on activities of daily living (ADLs) with verbal encouragement to use the more affected upper extremity to the largest extent possible. Home practice consists of strengthening exercises, designed to increase range of motion, prescribed twice daily. After completing their participation in the standard OT condition (6 months), participants will be crossed-over to a CI therapy gaming only condition. This condition will be identical to that described above, excluding therapist contact throughout the intervention. Rather, participants will receive a DVD explaining the intervention and guiding them through use of the system.</description>

          <title>Traditional CI Therapy</title>
          <description>Participants will receive a 35-hour &quot;dose&quot; of CI therapy. Treatment will consist of 35 therapist/client contact hours in the clinic, 10 weekdays, over 3 weeks. To promote carry-over of motor gains to daily activities, participants will complete: (1) a treatment contract, (2) daily self-report of arm use, and (3) problem-solving to overcome barriers to use of the more affected upper extremity. In addition, the client will agree to wear a padded restraint mitt on the less affected hand for the majority of waking hours to encourage use of the weaker hand for daily activities. Finally, the participant will agree to 30 minutes per day of individualized task-practice outside the clinic (in addition to training in the clinic) focused on functional activities catered towards accomplishing the person's therapeutic goals.&#xD;

          <title>Gaming CI Therapy</title>
          <description>15 hours of progressive massed motor practice will occur through in-home video game play over 15 consecutive weekdays. Participants will play the game during times of their choosing. The participant will wear an activity monitor biofeedback device for the majority of waking hours. As with traditional CI therapy, the client will agree to an additional 30 minutes per day of individualized task-practice. Five therapist/client contact hours will occur in the clinic on approximate treatment days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and will focus on treatment elements that cannot be readily addressed through the game, such as problem-solving to help the participant carry over motor gains to daily life.&#xD;

          <title>Traditional Occupational Therapy/Physical Therapy</title>
          <description>Five therapist/client contact hours will occur on approximate treatment days 1, 3, 6, and 11 (same schedule as gaming CI therapy). 1 hour progressive resistance exercise to establish and progress an upper extremity home exercise program, 2 hours of neuromuscular reeducation, and 2 hours functional practice on ADLs with verbal encouragement to use the more affected upper extremity to the largest extent possible. Home practice consists of stretching exercises, designed to increase range of motion, prescribed twice daily. After completing their participation in the standard OT condition (6 months), participants will be crossed-over to a CI therapy gaming only condition. This condition will be identical to that described above, excluding therapist contact throughout the intervention. Rather, participants will receive a DVD explaining the intervention and guiding them through use of the system.&#xD;

          <description>The MoCA is a cognitive screening tool. Scores on this measure range from 0-30 and reflect the number of items successfully answered; +1 point is given for &lt;12 years of education. Items assess language, executive function, memory, orientation, and visuoconstruction ability. Below 24 indicates mild cognitive impairment. Below 16 indicates more severe cognitive impairment (e.g., may indicate dementia).</description>

            <description>Five therapist/client contact hours will occur on approximate treatment days 1, 3, 6, and 11 (same schedule as gaming CI therapy). 1 hour progressive resistance exercise to establish and progress an upper extremity home exercise program, 2 hours of neuromuscular reeducation, and 2 hours functional practice on ADLs with verbal encouragement to use the more affected upper extremity to the largest extent possible. Home practice consists of strengthening exercises, designed to increase range of motion, prescribed twice daily. After completing their participation in the standard OT condition (6 months), participants will be crossed-over to a CI therapy gaming only condition. This condition will be identical to that described above, excluding therapist contact throughout the intervention. Rather, participants will receive a DVD explaining the intervention and guiding them through use of the system.&#xD;

          <title>Bilateral Activity Monitors</title>
          <description>Devices to monitor upper extremity movement are worn throughout treatment. The devices count movements made with each arm, defined as an acceleration of 2g for at least 500 ms. The ratio of more affected to less affected arm use is then calculated for each treatment day. The best linear fit trajectory for each participant is calculated after removal of outliers. The treatment change reported here reflects the difference between the best-fit-line at post-treatment and the best-fit-line at pre-treatment. Positive change indicates improvement.</description>

            <description>Five therapist/client contact hours will occur on approximate treatment days 1, 3, 6, and 11 (same schedule as gaming CI therapy). 1 hour progressive resistance exercise to establish and progress an upper extremity home exercise program, 2 hours of neuromuscular reeducation, and 2 hours functional practice on activities of daily living (ADLs) with verbal encouragement to use the more affected upper extremity to the largest extent possible. Home practice consists of strengthening exercises, designed to increase range of motion, prescribed twice daily. After completing their participation in the standard OT condition (6 months), participants will be crossed-over to a CI therapy gaming only condition. This condition will be identical to that described above, excluding therapist contact throughout the intervention. Rather, participants will receive a DVD explaining the intervention and guiding them through use of the system.&#xD;

          <title>Traditional CI Therapy</title>
          <description>Participants will receive a 35-hour &quot;dose&quot; of CI therapy. Treatment will consist of 35 therapist/client contact hours in the clinic, 10 weekdays, over 3 weeks. To promote carry-over of motor gains to daily activities, participants will complete: (1) a treatment contract, (2) daily self-report of arm use, and (3) problem-solving to overcome barriers to use of the more affected upper extremity. In addition, the client will agree to wear a padded restraint mitt on the less affected hand for the majority of waking hours to encourage use of the weaker hand for daily activities. Finally, the participant will agree to 30 minutes per day of individualized task-practice outside the clinic (in addition to training in the clinic) focused on functional activities catered towards accomplishing the person's therapeutic goals.&#xD;

          <title>Gaming CI Therapy</title>
          <description>15 hours of progressive massed motor practice will occur through in-home video game play over 15 consecutive weekdays. Participants will play the game during times of their choosing. The participant will wear an activity monitor biofeedback device for the majority of waking hours. As with traditional CI therapy, the client will agree to an additional 30 minutes per day of individualized task-practice. Five therapist/client contact hours will occur in the clinic on approximate treatment days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and will focus on treatment elements that cannot be readily addressed through the game, such as problem-solving to help the participant carry over motor gains to daily life.&#xD;
