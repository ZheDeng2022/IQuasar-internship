  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together&#xD;
      with liposomal irinotecan in treating patients with solid tumors. Liposomal irinotecan and&#xD;
      veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of liposomal irinotecan&#xD;
      (MM-398) + veliparib combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the&#xD;
      combination of MM-398 + veliparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To characterize the preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      the combination using key efficacy indicators, such as objective response rate, clinical&#xD;
      benefit rate defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD)&#xD;
      at 24 weeks, and progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Imaging, tumor, and blood biomarkers to assess the sensitivity or resistance to each drug&#xD;
      and/or correlation with clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive liposomal irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and&#xD;
      veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 5-12 and 19-25 or 3-12 and 17-25. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within&#xD;
      2-6 days prior to beginning liposomal irinotecan treatment, patients may optionally receive&#xD;
      ferumoxytol (FMX) IV and undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and 24 hours&#xD;
      after FMX infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Based on animal data, MM-398 (ONIVYDETM) and veliparib causes embryo toxicity and&#xD;
             teratogenicity; thus, women of childbearing potential and male patients should use&#xD;
             effective contraception during treatment with MM-398 and for 90 days following the&#xD;
             final dose of veliparib and MM-398 for both female and male patients; should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IMAGING CORRELATIVE STUDY: Patients will be eligible to participate in the FMX imaging&#xD;

             the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evidence of iron overload as determined by:&#xD;

                       full prescribing information for ferumoxytol injection&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Any IV iron replacement product (e.g. parenteral iron, dextran,&#xD;
                       iron-dextran, or parenteral iron polysaccharide preparations)&#xD;

                    -  Multiple drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unable to undergo MRI or for whom MRI is otherwise contraindicated (e.g. presence&#xD;

                  devices; or history claustrophobia or anxiety related to undergoing MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those whose adverse events&#xD;
             have not resolved to grade 1 or less (except alopecia) from agents administered more&#xD;
             than 4 weeks earlier; patients must have completed prior biological therapies and/or&#xD;
             targeted therapies &gt;= 2 weeks prior to study enrollment; patients who have had&#xD;
             radiation to the pelvis or other bone marrow-bearing sites will be considered on a&#xD;
             case by case basis and may be excluded if the bone marrow reserve is not considered&#xD;
             adequate (i.e. radiation to &gt; 25% of bone marrow)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from trial secondary to&#xD;
             poor prognosis; however, subjects who have had treatment for their brain metastasis&#xD;
             and whose brain disease is stable without steroid therapy for at least 3 months may be&#xD;
             enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to veliparib and MM-398; if patients have a history of allergic reactions&#xD;
             to compounds resembling MM-398, they will be excluded from participating in the FMX&#xD;
             MRI study, if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have severe hypersensitivity to irinotecan hydrochloride (HCl)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known and confirmed diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (IDL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, including history of small&#xD;
             bowel obstruction unless the obstruction was a surgically treated remote episode&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is unable to swallow or keep down oral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) site and other selected centers who&#xD;
             are willing to undergo an optional pre-treatment ferumoxytol MRI must not have&#xD;
             evidence of iron overload, a known hypersensitivity to ferumoxytol or any other IV&#xD;
             iron product, a documented history of multiple drug allergies, or those for whom MRI&#xD;
             is otherwise contraindicated, including claustrophobia or anxiety related to&#xD;
             undergoing MRI; this exclusion criterion applies only to patients enrolling at NCI and&#xD;
             other selected sites; of note, the principal investigator (PI) will allow other&#xD;
             centers to offer FMX MRI scans if the site in question is willing and the site PI can&#xD;
             identify the necessary resources and expertise at their center&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because veliparib, MM-398 and ferumoxytol&#xD;
             are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there&#xD;
             is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with veliparib, MM-398 and/or ferumoxytol breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with any of these agents; these potential&#xD;
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             veliparib, MM-398 and/or ferumoxytol; in addition, these patients are at increased&#xD;
             risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate&#xD;
             studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
             when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who need chronic use of medications or substances that are strong inhibitors&#xD;
             or inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Veliparib has a potential seizure risk, therefore patients with a high risk of&#xD;
             seizures should be excluded from the protocol (e.g. those patients with an&#xD;
             uncontrolled seizure disorder, and/or patients who have had a focal or generalized&#xD;
             seizure within the last 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (t-AML)/myelodysplastic&#xD;
             syndrome (MDS) or with features suggestive of AML/MDS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation&#xD;
