  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of tryptophan depletion on mood and&#xD;
      behavior in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of&#xD;
      the subthalamic nucleus (STN). By doing this, the investigators hope to be able to identify&#xD;
      risk factors for and mechanisms underlying psychiatric side effects of STN DBS. The study&#xD;
      will be an intervention study with a placebo controlled, randomized cross-over design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms such&#xD;
      as tremor, rigidity and slowness of movement. In later stages of the disease, when&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment becomes less efficient, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the&#xD;
      subthalamic nucleus (STN) becomes a treatment option. Although motor symptoms improve&#xD;
      significantly by DBS, a number of operated patients experience severe side effects, mostly&#xD;
      related to mood, cognition or behavior. These adverse effects are most likely mediated&#xD;
      through the serotonin (5-HT) system. Additionally, a dysfunction of the 5-HT system is&#xD;
      implied in the pathophysiology of PD. PD patients are therefore regarded as 'vulnerable' to&#xD;
      experiencing mood, cognitive and emotional problems due to changes in 5-HT activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To elucidate whether STN DBS is indeed the trigger for psychiatric and cognitive problems to&#xD;
      arise in the PD patient, the 5-HT levels in PD patients implanted with STN DBS will be&#xD;
      manipulated. In order to do this, the investigators will make use of the tryptophan (TRP)&#xD;
      depletion method, an established research paradigm. In TRP depletion, the brain is depleted&#xD;
      of TRP, the precursor of 5-HT, which consequently leads to lowered 5-HT levels. In both the&#xD;
      normal and 5-HT depleted condition, mood- and cognitive parameters of the PD patients both&#xD;
      with the STN stimulation on (ON) and off (OFF) will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to get more insight into the effects of STN DBS in PD patients with a 5-HT&#xD;
      vulnerabililty and the effects on 5-HT related mood and cognitive behaviour. This way,&#xD;
      possible risk factors for and mechanisms underlying psychiatric side effects of STN DBS can&#xD;
      be identified. The study is an intervention study with a placebo controlled, randomized&#xD;
      cross-over design.&#xD;
