      Patients with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) who have completed the&#xD;
      ApoPharma-sponsored study TIRCON2012V1-EXT and who wish to continue to take deferiprone will&#xD;
      be offered the opportunity to receive it on a compassionate basis. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      locally by their own neurologist or other appropriate specialist.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with PKAN who have completed both the randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      TIRCON2012V1 and its follow-up, the single-arm open-label extension study TIRCON2012V1-EXT,&#xD;
      may enroll in this compassionate-use/expanded access program in order to continue receiving&#xD;
      the iron chelator deferiprone. Participants in this program will be followed locally by their&#xD;
      own neurologist or other appropriate specialist. Patients will take deferiprone oral solution&#xD;
      80 mg/mL at the same dose they were prescribed in the TIRCON2012V1-EXT clinical trial. Safety&#xD;
      monitoring of the patients will be performed. At a minimum, the program will continue until&#xD;
      the analysis of the currently blinded TIRCON2012V1 trial is completed (approximately Q4&#xD;
      2016), at which time it will be re-evaluated.&#xD;
