  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a predictor of functional-limitation, leading to loss of independence, lowered&#xD;
      quality of life, and ultimately death. The impaired ability of aged skeletal muscle to adapt&#xD;
      to anabolic stimulation may be a factor that contributes to sarcopenia. This project will&#xD;
      provide novel insights into the role of microRNA in the attenuation of aging skeletal muscle&#xD;
      to changes in gene expression after anabolic stimulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and function (sarcopenia) is associated with&#xD;
      substantial social and economic costs. The plasticity and adaptability of skeletal muscle to&#xD;
      contraction (ie. resistance-exercise) is a fundamental physiological event leading to larger&#xD;
      and more robust skeletal muscle. However, muscle growth in response to resistance exercise&#xD;
      (RE), like other anabolic stimuli, is attenuated in older adults. The cause of aberrant&#xD;
      muscle adaptation with aging is complex. Recent work has revealed a novel role for small&#xD;
      non-coding RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNA) in the regulation of gene expression. Using an&#xD;
      integrated bioinformatics analysis of protein-coding gene and miRNA array data from young and&#xD;
      older men, I identified ten specific miRNAs as important regulators of muscle plasticity&#xD;
      (Plasticity Related miRs [PR-miRs]) leading to the transcriptional response to exercise and&#xD;
      lean mass in young and older men. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the expression&#xD;
      of PR-miRs on age-related changes in muscle anabolism and sarcopenia are currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the overall objective of this K01 application will be to determine the mechanistic&#xD;
      role(s) of these PR-miRs in skeletal muscle adaptation to anabolic stimulation in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. healthy young,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. sarcopenic older and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. age- and functionally-matched non-sarcopenic older males and females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be accomplished by determine the differences in expression of PR-miRs with aging&#xD;
      and sarcopenia in response to anabolic stimulation (AIM 1). Mechanistically determine the&#xD;
      extent to which manipulation of PR-miR levels in vitro, in human primary myocytes, can&#xD;
      reverse anabolic resistance observed with age and sarcopenia (AIM 2) and the effect of&#xD;
      altering PR-miRs levels on skeletal muscle growth and development (AIM 3). This project will&#xD;
      improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the loss of skeletal&#xD;
      muscle and eventually leading to the development of drug therapies for the treatment of&#xD;
      sarcopenia in the ever growing aging population.&#xD;
