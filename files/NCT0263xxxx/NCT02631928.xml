  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study in healthy volunteers aims to demonstrate similar PK and PD properties of the new&#xD;
      human biphasic insulin, Julphar Insulin 30/70 and an already approved reference insulin,&#xD;
      Huminsulin® Profil III. All participants will receive both study treatments on two separate&#xD;
      dosing days.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Daily injections of insulin is a necessity for many patients with diabetes mellitus in order&#xD;
      to treat hyperglycaemia. Julphar Insulin 30/70 and Humininsulin® Profil III are both biphasic&#xD;
      insulins, i.e. consist of a mixture of short-acting soluble insulin and intermediate-acting&#xD;
      isophane insulin. The new insulin, Julphar Insulin 30/70, is biosimilar to Huminsulin® Profil&#xD;
      III. Demonstration of similar absorption (PK) and effects (PD) are necessary to achieve&#xD;
      market approval of Julphar Insulin 30/70.&#xD;
