      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some people with brain tumors have seizures related to the tumor. This is called&#xD;
      tumor-related epilepsy. Usually brain tumors are treated by removing as much of the brain&#xD;
      tumor as possible without causing problems. Researchers think this may improve the outcome&#xD;
      for people with brain tumors. It may completely relieve or greatly reduce the number of&#xD;
      seizures they have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate people with brain tumors that are associated with seizures and to offer surgical&#xD;
      treatment. Also, to study how surgery affects seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 8 and older who have a brain tumor with associated seizures. They must be willing&#xD;
      to have brain surgery to treat their epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the hospital at NIH. They will have&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests of memory, attention, and thinking&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about their symptoms and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood drawn&#xD;
&#xD;
      They may also have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI or CT scan. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of a machine that takes&#xD;
      pictures. For part of the MRI, they will get a dye through an intravenous (IV) catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video electroencephalography monitoring. Electrodes will be placed on the scalp. The&#xD;
      participant s brain waves will be recorded while doing normal activities. Participants will&#xD;
      be videotaped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a seizure diary before and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have surgery to remove their brain tumor and the brain area where their&#xD;
      seizures start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will stay in the hospital up to a week after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have for follow-up visits at NIH.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is being performed to 1) study the natural history and disease pathogenesis in&#xD;
      patients with tumor related epilepsy, 2) collect prospective data on seizure outcomes&#xD;
      following standard surgical treatment of brain tumors with associated seizures2, 3) follow&#xD;
      the clinical course of patients after surgical resection of brain tumors with associated&#xD;
      seizures, such as outcomes in seizure activity as they relate to type of tumor and extent of&#xD;
      resection, 4) investigate neuropsychological and cognitive outcomes as they relate to&#xD;
      surgical and seizure outcomes, 5) evaluate patient reported outcomes such as symptom burden&#xD;
      changes as a result of surgical resection in patients with tumor-related epilepsy, 6) examine&#xD;
      changes in structural and, when available, functional imaging in the context of tumor related&#xD;
      epilepsy before and after surgical resection, 8) investigate molecular markers of&#xD;
      tumor-related seizures in tumor and peritumoral specimens and, when available, to compare&#xD;
      them to electrophysiological markers of tumor-related seizure activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 8 years and older with brain tumors and associated seizures may participate in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened by study neurosurgeon or neuro-oncologists to verify their&#xD;
      confirmed or likely diagnosis of brain tumor and associated seizures. Patients confirmed to&#xD;
      have a brain tumor with associated seizures will be offered standard diagnostic and surgical&#xD;
      procedures. Non-invasive diagnostic procedures include structural MRI and neuropsychological,&#xD;
      cognitive, and outcome assessments which may be performed under other NIH protocols. Some&#xD;
      patients may receive functional MRI when clinically indicated, which will be performed under&#xD;
      separate NIH protocols. Prior to tumor resection, diagnostic invasive monitoring with&#xD;
      intracranial electrodes for further localization of seizure focus and identification of&#xD;
      eloquent cortex may be clinically required. In these cases, invasive monitoring will be&#xD;
      performed under a separate protocol, 11-N-0051 Epilepsy Surgery. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      for three-six months after the surgical procedure to collect prospective data on seizure&#xD;
      outcomes following standard surgical treatment of brain&#xD;
&#xD;
      tumors with associated seizures. Patients may also be seen at one year following surgery if&#xD;
      medically stable and healthy. Participants in this protocol will not forego other standard&#xD;
      treatments for their brain tumor, including chemotherapy and radiation treatment.&#xD;
      Participation in this protocol will not preclude eligibility or participation in other NIH&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the change in seizure frequency, as measured by the Engel&#xD;
      scale before and 3-6 months after treatment. Secondary outcome measures include 1) mean Engel&#xD;
      Class and absolute and relative change in seizure frequency three-six months after surgery&#xD;
      stratified by the type of brain tumor and location and Engel scale, seizure frequency, and&#xD;
      mean Engel Class and absolute and relative change in seizure frequency one year after surgery&#xD;
      stratified by the type of brain tumor and location; 2) extent of tumor and peri-tumoral&#xD;
      resection as seen on MRI imaging and correlation with seizure outcome; 3) changes in&#xD;
      neuropsychological and cognitive assessment following surgical resection stratified by&#xD;
      location and type of tumor and extent of resection; 4) longitudinal changes in symptom burden&#xD;
      and interference scores using established instruments in brain tumor patients; 5) changes in&#xD;
      structural imaging following surgical resection; 6) change in the use of anti-epileptic&#xD;
      medication; and 7) percentage of patients with permanent neurological side-effects from&#xD;
      surgical treatment.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible for entry into the study, a candidate must meet all the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be 8 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have solitary primary or recurrent brain tumor with associated seizures. Brain tumor&#xD;
             may be diagnosed radiologically. Associated seizures are defined as those with&#xD;
             activity starting within three months of radiologic diagnosis of the primary or&#xD;
             recurrent tumor. In cases when the timing of seizure activity is unclear with respect&#xD;
             to the timing of diagnosis, seizures will be considered associated with the tumor if&#xD;
             seizure semiology is consistent with that location. Ongoing seizures are not required.&#xD;
             Patients can be included if they have had a single previous seizure. Patients who have&#xD;
             not experienced seizures after institution of anti-convulsant therapy are not&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to undergo brain surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to appoint a durable power of attorney.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Candidates will be excluded if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a bleeding disorder that cannot be corrected before invasive testing or surgery,&#xD;
             or other medical conditions that would make surgery unsafe, such as lung or cardiac&#xD;
             disease that would render them unable to tolerate the risk of general anesthesia, or&#xD;
             severe immunodeficiency or systemic cancer not related to a brain lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cannot have an MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have multiple brain tumors, evidence of carcinomatous meningitis, gliomatosis cerebri,&#xD;
             or primary CNS lymphoma. Patients with multiple metastatic lesions that for which&#xD;
             surgery is not indicated will be exluded. Patients with peripheral neurological or&#xD;
             systemic metabolic disorders that cause seizures will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an underlying seizure disorder that is unrelated to the brain tumor, or&#xD;
             underlying neurological disorder that is unrelated to the brain tumor and that may&#xD;
             contribute to seizure activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of enrollment, lack consent capacity due to cognitive impairment that&#xD;
             would make them incapable of understanding the explanation of the procedures in this&#xD;
             study. Cognitive capacity to consent will be determined at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
             Patients with mental disorders or those patients who are cognitively impaired yet&#xD;
             still retain consent capacity will not be excluded. Children may be enrolled if there&#xD;
             is a parent or guardian able to consent on their behalf.&#xD;
