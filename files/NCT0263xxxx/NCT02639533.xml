  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome represents a &quot;spectrum disorder&quot; characterized by widespread chronic&#xD;
      pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, mood and cognitive alterations. The most accepted models&#xD;
      explaining the causes of the disease have focused on the reduced pain inhibitory systems&#xD;
      activity, that allow low intensity stimuli to be processed easier, and that finally amplify&#xD;
      pain stimuli. One of the interventions approved for Fibromyalgia is Pregabalin, which&#xD;
      demonstrated to be effective reducing pain. Different studies in animals have shown that it&#xD;
      works reducing the liberation of neuronal messengers, which slow the conduction of pain&#xD;
      signals. Although studies in humans have confirmed Pregabalin clinical benefits, there are&#xD;
      still few studies aiming to explain how it actually works in patients with fibromyalgia,&#xD;
      though.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of the mechanisms by which Pregabalin reduces pain in patients with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia would allow designing new interventions to enhance its clinical effects. Thus,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to study in real-time the electrical, vascular and hormonal&#xD;
      response of the brain of patients with fibromyalgia who receive a single dose of Pregabalin.&#xD;
      The vascular response will be assessed using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)&#xD;
      neuroimaging techniques. The electrical response will be assessed using Transcranial Magnetic&#xD;
      Stimulation (TMS). The hormonal response will be assessed in blood, measuring neurotrophins&#xD;
      (Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor) and inflammatory mediators (Tumor Necrosis Factor). These&#xD;
      responses will be studied in consideration of the patients' characteristics that will be&#xD;
      assessed using validated scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken into account the above considerations, a crossover, double-blinded randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial is proposed. In the investigators' study, patients and healthy volunteers will be asked&#xD;
      to visit the investigators' laboratory in three opportunities: one for a baseline assessment,&#xD;
      and the other two to test the effects of either Pregabalin 150 mg PO or Placebo. All&#xD;
      participants will eventually receive both, Pregabalin and Placebo. In each visit a brain&#xD;
      hemodynamic, electrical, hormonal and clinical evaluation will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A crossover, double-blinded randomized clinical trial is proposed. The investigators will&#xD;
      recruit literate adult females aging 18 to 65 years old; fulfilling the diagnosis criteria&#xD;
      for fibromyalgia according to the American College of Rheumatology 2010; with mean pain ≥6 in&#xD;
      the verbal analog scale; who speak Brazilian Portuguese; and were able to perform the three&#xD;
      visits. Female adult participants without chronic pain will also be recruited. Participants&#xD;
      with severe psychiatric disorders that would limit consenting; neurologic deficits;&#xD;
      decompensated systemic disease or chronic inflammatory disorders (Systemic Erythematous Lupus&#xD;
      or Rheumatoid arthritis); contraindications for TMS; and those with previous use of&#xD;
      Pregabalin will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigators' study, participants will be asked to visit the investigators'&#xD;
      laboratory in three opportunities: one for a baseline assessment, and the other two to test&#xD;
      the effects of either Pregabalin 150 mg PO or Placebo. All participants will eventually&#xD;
      receive both, Pregabalin and Placebo. In each visit a brain hemodynamic, electrical, hormonal&#xD;
      and clinical evaluation will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first visit, after explaining the research, solving doubts and signing the informed&#xD;
      consent, participants will be randomized to an allocation sequence (either Pregabalin in the&#xD;
      second or in the third visit). Then, a blood sample will be gathered and participants will be&#xD;
      asked to fill some questionnaires to understand better their pain, and its impact on their&#xD;
      quality of life (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), Anxiety (State/Trait Anxiety Inventory),&#xD;
      Depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory II), Catastrophizing thinking (Pain&#xD;
      Catastrophizing Scale - PCS), Sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and resiliency. Then, a&#xD;
      fingertapping task will be performed while assessing hemodynamic changes using fNIRS. After&#xD;
      that, heat perception will be tested using quantitative sensory testing (QST) and Conditioned&#xD;
      Pain Modulation (CPM) with cold. Also, the pain pressure threshold (PPT) using a digital&#xD;
      algometer will be evaluated. Finally, cortical excitability parameters (motor evoked&#xD;
      potentials, intracortical facilitation and inhibition, and cortical silent period) will be&#xD;
      determined using paired pulsed TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second visit, according to the randomized allocation participants will receive either&#xD;
      Pregabalin 150 mg PO or Placebo. Then, the M.I.N.I. International Neuropsychiatric Interview&#xD;
      will be performed. One hour after taking the medication, the fNIRS, QST, CPM, PPT and TMS&#xD;
      evaluations will be repeated, and a new blood sample will be collected. In the third visit, a&#xD;
      blood sample will be gathered, followed by administration of the corresponding intervention&#xD;
      according to the randomized allocation. Then, the pain level, PCS, STAI and International&#xD;
      Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) will be asked again. One hour after taking the&#xD;
      medication, the fNIRS, QST, CPM, PPT and TMS evaluations will be repeated, and a final blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected. Participants' guess about blinding will be assessed after each&#xD;
      intervention. All evaluators will remain blind to the allocation.&#xD;

    <description>Cortical excitability parameters assessed non-invasively using paired-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Intracortical inhibition will be assessed using a conditioning stimuli of 80% of the motor threshold (MT) and a testing pulse of 120% the of the MT, with interstimuli interval (isi) of 2 and 4 microseconds. The Intracortical Inhibition corresponds to the ratio between the resultant potential and the motor evoked potential.</description>
