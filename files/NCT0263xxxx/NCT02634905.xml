  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Atopic dermatitis is a chronic relapsing disease, which is highly prevalent in children&#xD;
           (15%). Therapeutic patient education (TPE) has been recognized as a key priority topic&#xD;
           for future AD research. The strongest evidence in favour of TPE efficacy in AD comes&#xD;
           from a large study assessing repeated multi-disciplinary group education sessions in a&#xD;
           hospital setting. However, this type of intervention is both resource and time consuming&#xD;
           and is not adapted to typical French practice. However, in some french dermatology&#xD;
           centers, simple &quot;first level&quot; nurse-led TPE interventions are offered in addition to&#xD;
           physicians consultations. Unfortunately, the content of these interventions seems to&#xD;
           vary greatly depending on the caregiver and the center and the benefits of these&#xD;
           practices have not yet been assessed. Therefore, nurse-led TPE is not considered as&#xD;
           current care in France for AD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thus, there is a need to rigorously assess the benefits of additional, well-structured,&#xD;
           simple nurse-led individual TPE interventions for children with AD and their families&#xD;
           compared to standard care alone. This study will be the first large, adequately powered,&#xD;
           multicenter RCT trial assessing this type of intervention in children with AD.&#xD;
