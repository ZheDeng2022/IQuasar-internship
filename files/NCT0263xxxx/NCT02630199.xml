  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single center open label phase I study of AZD6738, DNA damage repair/novel&#xD;
      cancer agent, in combination with paclitaxel in metastatic cancer patients who have failed&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD6738 is an orally dosed selective and potent inhibitor of Ataxia Telangiectasis and Rad3&#xD;
      Related (ATR) kinase with good selectivity against other Pi3 kinase family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATR is a serine/threonine protein kinase and member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase&#xD;
      related kinase (PIKK) family. During normal replication, ATR is recruited at stalled&#xD;
      replication forks which can progress to double strand breaks if left unrepaired. ATR is also&#xD;
      recruited to single strand DNA coated with Replication Protein A (RPA) following single&#xD;
      strand DNA damage or the resection of double strand breaks. Recruitment and activation of ATR&#xD;
      leads to cell cycle arrest in the S phase while the DNA is repaired and the stalled&#xD;
      replication fork resolved, or nuclear fragmentation and entry into programmed cell death&#xD;
      (apoptosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinic ATR inhibitors are expected to cause growth inhibition in tumour cells&#xD;
      dependent upon ATR for DNA repair e.g. ATM-deficient tumours. In addition to monotherapy&#xD;
      activity, ATR inhibitors are also predicted to potentiate the activity of cytotoxic DNA&#xD;
      damaging agents and radiotherapy (through inhibition of ATR-dependent DNA repair processes)&#xD;
      when used in combination. While significant enhancement of anti-tumour activity may be&#xD;
      achieved, data with AZD6738 suggest the potential need to reduce the ATR inhibitor dose and&#xD;
      intensity (relative to monotherapy dose) and introduce dosing breaks to allow normal tissue&#xD;
      recovery when used in combination with systemic DNA damaging chemotherapy agents, in order to&#xD;
      maintain tolerable therapeutic margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of action of AZD6738 suggests the potential to combine it with a number of&#xD;
      anti-cancer treatments, resulting in either synergistic or additive activity. This study is&#xD;
      evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumour activity of AZD6738 at&#xD;
      increasing doses, in combination with paclitaxel as one of standard salvage regimen in&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two parts, each evaluating the safety and tolerability of a&#xD;
      specific combination agent, paclitaxel with different drug schedules. An oral formulation of&#xD;
      AZD6738 will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PART A will be in combination with paclitaxel; the starting dose of 40 mg AZD6738 OD will&#xD;
      be escalated to reach a maximum tolerated dose in patients with advanced solid malignancies,&#xD;
      as defined by dose-limiting toxicity. The PART B will be an independent parallel PK expansion&#xD;
      cohort with cycle 0 of AZD6738 on D1, D8~D21 monotherapy followed by combination therapy with&#xD;
      weekly paclitaxel from cycle 1. Investigators will modify to recruit the minimum or maximum&#xD;
      number of patients depending on data generated from other studies using AZD6738.&#xD;
