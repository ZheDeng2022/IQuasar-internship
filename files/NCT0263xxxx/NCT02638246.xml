  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-management of diabetes can result in long-term benefits, such as delaying or preventing&#xD;
      the development of a number of unnecessary health complications, and can even reduce the&#xD;
      chances of premature death. Because adherence to diabetes self-management often declines&#xD;
      during adolescence, it is critically important to develop interventions that increase&#xD;
      adherence of diabetes self-management skills in this population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive glycemic control among diabetics decreases the risk of both the development and&#xD;
      progression of a number of medical complications associated with diabetes. Self-monitoring&#xD;
      blood glucose is a critical component of diabetes self-management and is correlated with&#xD;
      improvements in glycemic control. Nevertheless, adherence to blood glucose monitoring is&#xD;
      generally poor, particularly among youth, with one study reporting that only ~ 25% of&#xD;
      adolescents adhered to the recommended frequency of blood glucose testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will use a powerful, scientifically-based behavioral intervention -&#xD;
      contingency management (CM) to increase self-monitoring of blood glucose and improve glycemic&#xD;
      control among adolescents with Type 1 diabetes. CM involves giving incentives for objective&#xD;
      evidence of a target behavior and has been shown to have a robust and reliable impact in&#xD;
      promoting behavior change. Our previous research used the Internet to objectively monitor&#xD;
      smoking and reinforce smoking cessation (via video recorded carbon monoxide submissions),&#xD;
      which resulted in robust increases in smoking abstinence. The current proposal extends this&#xD;
      effective Internet-based CM intervention to address the significant health issue of&#xD;
      non-adherence to blood glucose testing and glycemic control among youth. Two groups of&#xD;
      non-adherent adolescents will be recruited. One group will earn incentives over the Internet&#xD;
      for submitting webcam recorded videos that show them testing their blood glucose. A different&#xD;
      group will be given standard care recommendations for blood glucose testing and management&#xD;
      and will be encouraged to submit glucose monitoring videos, but incentives will not be&#xD;
      delivered contingent on submissions (instead, they will earn monetary incentives independent&#xD;
      of video submissions, but in an overall amount that matches the earnings of a participant in&#xD;
      the other group). The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility, convenience, and&#xD;
      efficacy of using Internet-based CM to increase blood glucose monitoring in adolescent Type 1&#xD;
      diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining the accessibility of the Internet with a powerful, evidence-based behavioral&#xD;
      intervention can have profound effects on adherence to diabetes self-management in this&#xD;
      important population. Improving adherence to diabetes management in adolescents is a&#xD;
      significant public health issue - serious medical complications, such as heart disease and&#xD;
      nerve damage, that would develop with poor glycemic control can be avoided. Importantly, the&#xD;
      current study offers a scientifically-based behavioral intervention that could be applied to&#xD;
      a range of populations and behavior relevant to adherence with diabetes regimens (e.g.,&#xD;
      adults, medication adherence, carbohydrate counting, insulin dose adjustment, etc.).&#xD;
