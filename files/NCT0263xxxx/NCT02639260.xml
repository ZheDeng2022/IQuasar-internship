  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three kidney diseases that affect both children and adults are minimal change disease (MCD),&#xD;
      focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and membranous nephropathy (MN). These diseases are&#xD;
      characterized by proteinuria (protein in the urine) and in the cases of FSGS and membranous&#xD;
      nephropathy, a tendency to progressive scarring of the glomerulus (the filtering units of the&#xD;
      kidneys) that leads to end-stage kidney disease. Several therapies are available for these&#xD;
      diseases, but these therapies do not provide lasting reduction in proteinuria for many&#xD;
      subjects. In the current study, carried out at the NIH Clinical Center, we are testing a new&#xD;
      therapy, ManNAc. ManNAc is a naturally occurring uncharged sugar that cells use to produce&#xD;
      negatively charged sialic acid. Kidney cells attach sugars such as sialic acids to proteins&#xD;
      and lipids (resulting in glycans), and these assist in cell function. Mouse models of the&#xD;
      inherited muscle disease GNE myopathy, which is due to sialic acid deficiency on muscle&#xD;
      glycans, responded favorably to oral ManNAc therapy and a clinical trial of ManNAc is ongoing&#xD;
      in GNE myopathy subjects. There is evidence that some subjects with MCD, FSGS or MN do not&#xD;
      put enough sialic acids on glomerular proteins and so ManNAc therapy may increase sialic acid&#xD;
      production and sialylation of glomerular proteins in these subjects. For the present study,&#xD;
      we will recruit 12 subjects who have MCD, FSGS or MN. Each subject will stay at the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center for 11 days to receive oral ManNAc. The primary purposes of the study are to&#xD;
      determine: 1) the safety of ManNAc in subject s with kidney disease; and 2) the ManNAc and&#xD;
      sialic acid metabolism related to ManNAc in subjects with kidney disease. Concentrations of&#xD;
      ManNAc and sialic acid will be measured in plasma at various times before and after dosing.&#xD;
      If this study suggests that ManNAc is safe in subject with kidney disease, the results will&#xD;
      be used to plan a longer-term study to determine whether it is effective at reducing&#xD;
      proteinuria....&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background. ManNAc (N-acetyl D-mannosamine) is an uncharged monosaccharide that is the&#xD;
      biologic precursor of N-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, sialic acid). Sialic acids are the&#xD;
      negatively charged, terminal monosaccharides of carbohydrate chains that are attached to&#xD;
      glycoproteins and glycolipids (glycans). Most glycans serve cellular signaling functions, and&#xD;
      frequently appear on the cell surface or are secreted into the circulation. ManNAc is&#xD;
      currently in development as a therapy for the rare muscular dystrophy, GNE Myopathy (also&#xD;
      called HIBM, hereditary inclusion body myopathy), caused by deficiency of GNE, the key enzyme&#xD;
      in sialic acid synthesis (clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01634750).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase 1a trial was completed and a Phase 2 trial for ManNAc for GNE myopathy subjects has&#xD;
      been initiated through efforts of NCATS (TRND program; PI: Dr. Carrillo-Carrasco) and NHGRI&#xD;
      (Dr. Huizing, Dr. Malicdan; Sponsor: Dr. Gahl), most of whom are Associate Investigators on&#xD;
      this protocol. The NHGRI basic research group has documented podocytopathy, glomerular&#xD;
      protein hyposialylation and severe proteinuria in mice deficient in GNE and found that their&#xD;
      podocyte ultrastructure improved, sialylation increased and proteinuria decreased with oral&#xD;
      ManNAc therapy. Human kidney biopsy tissue from subjects with various primary podocyte&#xD;
      diseases, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)&#xD;
      and membranous nephropathy (MN), also showed glomerular hyposialylation (manuscript in&#xD;
      preparation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose. We propose to carry out a Phase 1 escalating dose study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of ManNAc in nephrotic subjects with primary podocyte&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects. We propose to enroll 12 subjects with MCD, FSGS or MN. Up to 24 total subjects may&#xD;
      be enrolled to accomodate screening failures and withdrawals, for a total of 12 subjects&#xD;
      receiving at least one dose of the study drug. We will recruit subjects in 4 groups (2-3&#xD;
      subjects each) grouped by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. This dose escalation study will involve two progressive ManNAc dose cohorts&#xD;
      (each with N= 6) of 3,000 mg/day and 6,000 mg/day. Drug exposure will occur in a single dose&#xD;
      phase, involving one dose of oral ManNAc followed by a 72 hour pharmacokinetics and safety&#xD;
      study, and a multiple dose phase, involving ManNAc administered two times/day for 5 days.&#xD;
      Dose escalation will occur when the lower dose is assessed safe in all subjects by a Safety&#xD;
      Review Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes. We will assess safety by self-reported symptoms and by standard laboratory testing.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics will be analyzed using plasma ManNAc and Neu5Ac (sialic acid) levels. The&#xD;
      effects of reduced eGFR on these parameters will be assessed. While the study duration is&#xD;
      short and there is no placebo control, the effect of ManNAc therapy on proteinuria, from the&#xD;
      baseline to the end of the extension phase, will be examined on a research basis.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Kidney biopsy manifesting MCD, FSGS (including collapsing glomerulopathy) or MN.&#xD;
                  Prior kidney biopsy is a requirement for inclusion. Kidney biopsy materials will&#xD;
                  be reviewed by NIH pathology (Dr. Avi Rosenberg, or another member of his team in&#xD;
                  his absence) to confirm the diagnosis. With regard to FSGS, all histologic&#xD;
                  variants, including collapsing, tip, cellular, perihilar and NOS will be&#xD;
                  included; primary, adaptive, and genetic FSGS will be included; viral-associated&#xD;
                  and drug-associated FSGS will be excluded. The rationale for including multiple&#xD;
                  primary nephrotic diseases is that the pharmacokinetics is likely to be similar&#xD;
                  and all these diseases have a need for effective therapy with low toxicity&#xD;
                  profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Age &gt;18 years weighing more than 40 kg of either sex. The rationale for excluding&#xD;
                  children is that we lack safety data for patients with nephrotic and/or reduced&#xD;
                  GFR and that we have no evidence for benefit in proteinuric subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Subjects must either not be taking immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., prednisone,&#xD;
                  cyclosporine, tacrolimus or mycophenolate mofetil) or, alternatively, be able to&#xD;
                  tolerate a stable dose of such a therapy from day -30 to day +31. If medically&#xD;
                  necessary, immunosuppressive therapy will be adjusted during the study. Subjects&#xD;
                  who are on renin angiotensin pathway inhibitor therapy will not be asked to&#xD;
                  discontinue their current regiment and will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Weight &gt;40 kg. Subjects 40-50 kg will only be placed in the low-dose Cohort A.&#xD;
                  Subjects &gt;50 kg can be placed in either Cohort A (3,000 mg/day) or Cohort B&#xD;
                  (6,000 mg/day). The rationale is to adhere to the maximum allowable starting dose&#xD;
                  of 193.5 mg DEX-M74/kg body weight/day, derived from preclinical animal&#xD;
                  toxicology studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Subjects with random void urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 1 g/g.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) .15 mL/min/1.73 m^2&#xD;
                  will be included. The rationale is that we wish to determine the effect of eGFR&#xD;
                  on ManNAc and Neu5Ac (sialic acid) metabolism (including plasma PK). We will&#xD;
                  compare 2 eGFR groups: subjects with stage 4 CKD (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73m^2), and&#xD;
                  individuals with stage 1, 2, or 3 CKD (eGFR grearter than or equal to 30&#xD;
                  mL/min/1.73m^2). Therapy for individuals with stage 4 CKD is a particularly&#xD;
                  compelling unmet need, as many therapies become problematic (e.g. calcineurin&#xD;
                  inhibitors will further lower GFR and intensification of&#xD;
                  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors may lower GFR and raise serum&#xD;
                  potassium levels). eGFR will be assessed using serum creatinine (Cr) and cystatin&#xD;
                  C (CystC) using the CKD-EPI Cr/CystC equation for adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Subjects must be able to comply with requirements of the protocol, including&#xD;
                  blood collection, drug administration, and effective communication with study&#xD;
                  staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Heterosexual couples must use at least one effective form of birth control,&#xD;
                  unless a hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or vasectomy has been performed. These may&#xD;
                  include the following: barrier methods, oral or an injection (for example,&#xD;
                  Norplant or Depo-Provera) contraception medication, and intrauterine devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Unwilling or unable to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subject who requires use of intravenous diuretics to control edema, as this may&#xD;
                  result in fluid shifts between the intravascular space and the remainder of&#xD;
                  extracellular fluid volume. Oral diuretics will not be exclusionary, and we&#xD;
                  reserve the option to use intravenous diuretics during the study if this becomes&#xD;
                  necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Subject has a psychiatric illness or neurological disease that would interfere&#xD;
                  with the ability to comply with the requirements of this protocol. This includes,&#xD;
                  but is not limited to, uncontrolled/untreated psychotic depression, bipolar&#xD;
                  disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse or dependence, antisocial personality&#xD;
                  disorder, panic disorder, or behavioral problems, which interfere with effective&#xD;
                  communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4 Vulnerable subjects, including those with impaired cognitive function or are&#xD;
             incarcerated will be excluded;&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Compromised venous access, such that it would interfere with peripheral intravenous&#xD;
             access suitable for taking blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Subject has a severe disease manifestation that would interfere with the ability to&#xD;
             comply with the requirements of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7 Subjects with a positive HIV test including antibody or viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Individuals whose blood contains HBV surface antigen or HCV antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Subject has hepatic laboratory parameters (AST, ALT, GGTP) greater than 3 times the&#xD;
             upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             10. Subject is anemic with hematocrit .less than or equal to 30 (for both men and&#xD;
             women).&#xD;
&#xD;
             11. Subject shows evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary,&#xD;
             hepatic, renal, hematological, metabolic (including diabetes mellitus), or&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disease, or has a condition that requires immediate surgical&#xD;
             intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             12. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding at any time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             13. Subject has received treatment with another investigational drug, investigational&#xD;
             device, or approved therapy for investigational use less than 60 days prior to ManNAc&#xD;
             dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             14. Subject has a hypersensitivity to ManNAc or in the judgment of the investigator,&#xD;
             has a condition that places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             15. Subject has been treated with ManNAc, sialic acid, intravenous immunoglobulin&#xD;
             (IVIG), and/or other supplements containing sialic acid (e.g., St. John s Wort,&#xD;
             sialyllactose) less than 60 days prior to planned ManNAc dosing.&#xD;
