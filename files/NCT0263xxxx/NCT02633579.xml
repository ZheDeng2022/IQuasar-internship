    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will evaluate if the food intake associated with the&#xD;
      infusion of erythromycin is caused by the phase 3 contractions or by another yet unknown&#xD;
      effect of erythromycin. To obtain this the investigators will use atropine, a muscarinic&#xD;
      receptor antagonist, to inhibit the formation of contractions induced by a low dose of&#xD;
      erythromycin&#xD;

      The role of induced phase 3 contractions in the control of hunger and food intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Background In between meals the motor activity of the upper gastrointestinal tract is&#xD;
           characterized by a cyclical pattern of contractions that consists of 3 phases: maximal&#xD;
           contractile activity originating in the stomach and migrating down the small intestine&#xD;
           (phase 3), followed by a phase of motor quiescence (phase 1) and a phase of&#xD;
           progressively increasing motor activity (phase 2). In 1975 Itoh et. al. linked the phase&#xD;
           3 contractions of the migrating motor complex (MMC) to hunger sensations, by increasing&#xD;
           the hunger sensations through exogenously administered motilin. The investigators&#xD;
           previously demonstrated that phase 3 is associated with a 'hunger pang'. The trigger for&#xD;
           the phase 3 initiation is unclear, but the gut hormones ghrelin and motilin are presumed&#xD;
           to play a role. If either of these substances are administered intravenously, they&#xD;
           induce a premature phase 3 in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In previous studies, 'hunger pangs' could objectively be detected as peaks in subjective&#xD;
           hunger ratings on a visual analog scale (VAS) using a custom made algorithm. A close&#xD;
           association between phase 3 contractions of gastric origin and hunger peaks was observed&#xD;
           and spontaneous food intake was also found to be associated with hunger peaks. By&#xD;
           inducing phase 3 contractions through the administration of IV erythromycin, the time of&#xD;
           food intake could be manipulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In a new study the investigators will evaluate if the food intake associated with the&#xD;
           infusion of erythromycin is caused by the phase 3 contractions or by another yet unknown&#xD;
           effect of erythromycin. To obtain this the investigators will use atropine, a muscarinic&#xD;
           receptor antagonist, to inhibit the formation of contractions induced by a low dose of&#xD;
           erythromycin. Since food intake is no longer a pure physiological act to still hunger&#xD;
           sensations, it has obtained a social and emotional status in modern times where&#xD;
           palatable food is abundant, the relationship of the subject towards food using multiple&#xD;
           questionnaires will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim To investigate whether contractions in the antrum are necessary to induce food&#xD;
           intake with erythromycin or if erythromycin has a secondary effect to stimulate food&#xD;
           intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methodology 3.1. Subject selection Healthy volunteers will be recruited. See eligibility&#xD;
           criteria for details&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dutch eating behaviour questionnaire (DEBQ):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DEBQ will be administered as a measure of dietary restraint and disinhibition. The DEBQ&#xD;
      investigates three fields of behavioral eating: restrained eating, emotional eating and&#xD;
      external eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Council of nutrition appetite questionnaire (CNAQ):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This questionnaire is an appetite-monitoring instrument developed by the Council for&#xD;
      Nutritional Strategies in Long-Term Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale (HAD):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This questionnaire will be used to exclude subjects with mood &amp; anxiety disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power of food scale (PFS):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PFS evaluates the psychological impact of living in an environment where palatable food&#xD;
      is abundant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3. Protocol Study design Gastric motility will be registered for 7h after an overnight fast&#xD;
      (see below). During this period the volunteers are allowed to ingest a standardized liquid&#xD;
      meal twice at time points of their choice. The volunteers are exposed to the liquid meal&#xD;
      before the start of the experiment and the palatability of the meal is scored; this is done&#xD;
      in a standardized way (same cup, temperature, duration, only smelling not tasting). The&#xD;
      liquid meal is a low-caloric soup with a similar composition as the one used by Hjelland et.&#xD;
      al. The volunteers are not aware that the investigators want to study the association between&#xD;
      gastric motility, hunger and food intake; they receive the information that the investigators&#xD;
      want to examine the effect of fasting on the motility of the stomach and hunger. During the&#xD;
      experiment they will watch standardized movies with a neutral emotional content at&#xD;
      standardized time points. They will rate hunger every 5 minutes and they will be offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to drink the meal at a time point of their choice. At the start of the experiment&#xD;
      two intravenous catheters will be placed in separate arms of the subject. During the entire&#xD;
      study saline will be administered intravenously at a low rate to blind the subject towards&#xD;
      the time of drug administration. The infusion bag will be positioned behind a curtain, in&#xD;
      this way the time of drug administration will be blind for the subject. The administration of&#xD;
      the drug, 40 mg of the motilin receptor agonist erythromycin lactobionate (Erythrocine;&#xD;
      Abbott, Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium), will be given in a randomized fashion at time&#xD;
      point 90, 180, 270 or 360 min after the start of the study. An infusion of this macrolide&#xD;
      antibiotic will be given at two of the above time points, one of these erythromycin infusions&#xD;
      will be preceded by a 15 µg/kg IV bolus of atropine (Stellatropine; Pharmacobel, Brussels,&#xD;
      Belgium) plus a 30 min infusion of 15 µg/kg/hr of atropine. The administration of atropine&#xD;
      will be given 10 minutes before the infusion of erythromycin in the opposite arm of the&#xD;
      erythromycin infusion. The arterial pulse frequency will be monitored continuously during the&#xD;
      administration of atropine. If the start point of an infusion coincides with a spontaneous&#xD;
      phase 3, then the infusion will be postponed for 15 min until the phase 3 is passed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manometry Recording of antroduodenal intraluminal pressures will be performed using a&#xD;
      Manoscan® high resolution manometry catheter (outer diameter 4.2 mm, 36 channels spaced 1 cm&#xD;
      apart). The catheter will be introduced via the nose and the position of the catheter, see&#xD;
      figure 1, will be briefly checked by fluoroscopy (typically 5 seconds, never more than 25&#xD;
      seconds). This part will comply with the relevant guidelines of radioprotection and&#xD;
      participants will be protected by a leaden shield that covers the lower abdomen, Personnel&#xD;
      will carry a leaden jacket, will not be exposed to the primary beam and will wear dosimeters&#xD;
      at all time. The catheter will be placed in such a way, that there are measuring points in&#xD;
      the antrum and just distal to the pylorus to accurately record the migrating motor complex.&#xD;
      The output of the manometry channels is recorded and monitored on-line via the ManoScan 360™&#xD;
      (Sierra Scientific Instruments, Los Angeles, CA). After an overnight fast, the manometry&#xD;
      assembly will be introduced as described above and secured to the subject's nose with&#xD;
      adhesive tape. The subjects will then be positioned in a comfortable sitting position with&#xD;
      the knees bent (80°) and the trunk upright in a specifically designed bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioural ratings At 5-minute intervals, volunteers will indicate scores for hunger and&#xD;
      expected amount to eat on a 10cm VAS. Emotions will be scored at a 15-minute interval on an&#xD;
      electronic grid mood scale.&#xD;
