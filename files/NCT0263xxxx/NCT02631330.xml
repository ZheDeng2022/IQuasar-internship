      INTRODUCTION The World Health Organization (WHO) defines fall as a result of any event&#xD;
      precipitating the patient down, involuntarily .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with instability and gait disturbances, falls are one of the great geriatric syndromes&#xD;
      and are the second cause of death worldwide by unintentional injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the field of public health, falls in the elderly are considered a major biopsychosocial&#xD;
      problem due to medical, psychological, social and family and economic consequences. It is&#xD;
      estimated that in 2020 the cost generated to the social and health care by falls will be&#xD;
      about 30,000 million euros. This is because about 20% of falls require medical attention,&#xD;
      with approximately 10% of consultations in emergency services and 6% of urgent&#xD;
      hospitalization in the elderly .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality in elderly people as a result of falls is nearly 40,000 deaths annually in Europe,&#xD;
      obtaining in Spain a mortality rate 15 . It also has a high morbidity, as declines are&#xD;
      directly related to decreased mobility and ability to perform basic activities of daily&#xD;
      living, raising fears of a new fall and thus favoring the loss of one's safety same. Thus the&#xD;
      dependence on a caregiver or institutionalization in a home increases, in turn, the family,&#xD;
      social and economic impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Falls in the elderly, unlike the adult, are the result of the adaptive imbalance of the&#xD;
      person from the environment. The clinician relativizes this problem by attributing the fall&#xD;
      to the normal aging process and ignore its potential consequences: injury, disability,&#xD;
      institutionalization and even death in this population. For this reason, falls are considered&#xD;
      a factor of frailty in the elderly .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance of health workers to a fall in the elderly patient should consist of the&#xD;
      realization of the following measures :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct a comprehensive assessment of elderly: biomedical, functional, social, mental&#xD;
           and psycho-sphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify intrinsic, extrinsic risk factors and circumstances of the fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate early physical, psychological and socio-economic consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevention of falls at primary, secondary and tertiary levels. Frailty is a&#xD;
           pathophysiological syndrome characterized by decreased functional reserve which is&#xD;
           mainly linked to the loss of muscle mass or sarcopenia. This is caused by the decline in&#xD;
           physical activity, associated in turn with poor health habits, cardiovascular risk&#xD;
           factors and various chronic diseases. The consequences in the elderly affect multiple&#xD;
           systems , causing greater vulnerability to external agents and increasing the risk:&#xD;
           disability, hospitalization, institutionalization and death . The prevalence of frailty&#xD;
           in subjects over 65 years is between 7 and 16.3% , increasing every decade from this age&#xD;
           .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic criteria for fragility, described by Linda Fried, include the assessment of&#xD;
      functional aspects as the gait assessment, exhaustion or strength of palmar pressure with&#xD;
      weight loss and energy consumption associated with physical activity . Since therapeutic&#xD;
      perspective, one of the best ways to reverse the frailty is the physical exercise. Several&#xD;
      articles have described heterogeneous effects on physical interventions in elderly frailty&#xD;
      people , ranging from isolated programs of aerobic, anaerobic or balance to different&#xD;
      combinations of the same training. A multicomponent exercise program increased muscle&#xD;
      strength, improve cardiorespiratory fitness and balance11. Exercise programs have observed&#xD;
      improvement in symptoms of depression in elderly patients10 up to 3 months after completion&#xD;
      of the program . This benefit may be due to increased central monoamine activity and&#xD;
      increased secretion of beta-endorphin. Similarly, it has been linked exercise programs with&#xD;
      improvement in various cognitive domains, especially in executive functions. A 2003&#xD;
      meta-analysis indicates that the combined program of aerobic and anaerobic exercise have a&#xD;
      better outcome on cognitive status than those designed with only aerobic programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY JUSTIFICATION Nearly six million Spanish people are older than 70 years, 12.64% of the&#xD;
      Spanish population is elderly. The first study in Spain on falls in the elderly was conducted&#xD;
      in 1985 and from then until now, it has encouraged the investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practice guidelines in caring for the geriatric population recommend performing an annual&#xD;
      screening of falls . Moreover, they suggest to advice the elderly on possible risk factors&#xD;
      associated. However, one of the problems that interfere with fall prevention programs is the&#xD;
      lack of importance accorded to health professionals to falls. This lack of awareness of the&#xD;
      risks faced by the associated geriatric population falls generates reluctance to adherence to&#xD;
      a fall prevention program .&#xD;
&#xD;
      At European level there are the same gaps in knowledge about the real effectiveness and&#xD;
      efficiency of fall prevention programs .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Add the practice of physical activity in nursing interventions, under the environment of the&#xD;
      community, have shown a reduction in the use of emergency services at relatively short&#xD;
      intervals, probably due to improved continuity of care .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hunter study showed that a training program low-level resistance (twice a week) is&#xD;
      associated with a decrease in the progression of functional limitations within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity associated with an interdisciplinary approach improves overall assessment&#xD;
      of the frail elderly population on the functional, psychological, cognitive, clinical and&#xD;
      social part , , , .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is necessary to create an interdisciplinary team in daily clinical practice in frail&#xD;
      patients to perform adequately the full recognition of these patients with the following&#xD;
      characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shared management between nursing and primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Support staff (nurses, social workers) with specialized training in gerontology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Audit of the home and technical devices needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular team meetings to evaluate changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishment of communication with community resources to incremental improvements in&#xD;
           the home, health promotion and support to caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS The implementation of a multicomponent fall prevention program in frail and&#xD;
      pre-frail elderly community-dwelling people reduce the incidence of falls.&#xD;
