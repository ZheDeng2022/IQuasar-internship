      The aim of this observational study is to describe for the first time a complete set of&#xD;
      morphometric and morphokinetic parameters of frozen-thawed human embryos in order to select&#xD;
      the embryo with the highest implantation potential. These parameters will be correlated with&#xD;
      (1) data of the fresh embryos and their subsequent survival, the evolution of the contact&#xD;
      surfaces between surviving blastomeres and the resumption of mitosis; (2) patient&#xD;
      characteristics and clinical outcome of frozen-thawed embryos and (3) a comparison between&#xD;
      embryos cryopreserved with vitrification or the slow method regarding these parameters will&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to introduce new evaluation criteria of the frozen-thawed embryos to&#xD;
      improve success rate of FET cycles. By establishing new precise, reliable and non-invasive&#xD;
      measurable parameters, we aim to (1) select which supernumerary embryos are at chance to&#xD;
      survive the freezing/thawing procedures, (2) establish cut off parameters for the survival&#xD;
      rate of the embryo, (3) assess implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates depending on the&#xD;
      developmental characteristics after thawing and after 24h of culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our strategy for improving the outcome of FET cycles is based on the study of morphometric&#xD;
      and morphokinetic parameters in frozen-thawed embryos and the correlation with embryological,&#xD;
      clinical and cycle parameters. Transferring a well-defined thawed embryo with a high&#xD;
      implantation potential may lead towards an increase in the implantation and life birth rate&#xD;
      and an increase in the cumulative live birth rate with a reduction of the IVF costs in order&#xD;
      to optimize the health-economic situation of reproductive medicine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cryopreservation of supernumerary embryos is an essential part of Assisted Reproduction&#xD;
      Techniques (ART) and is nowadays a standard routine procedure in the IVF laboratory. Its&#xD;
      clinical application consists in (1) the possibility of increasing cumulative delivery rates&#xD;
      per cycle and (2) the reduction of the number of transferable embryos in both fresh and&#xD;
      successive frozen thawed embryo transfer cycles (FET) decreasing the risk of multiple&#xD;
      pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different techniques to cryopreserve embryos are commonly used: slow freezing and&#xD;
      vitrification. During slow freezing, the embryo is exposed to subzero temperatures in a&#xD;
      controlled rate with the use of low concentration of cryoprotectant. Alternatively, using&#xD;
      vitrification the embryo rapidly enters into a glass-like state with the use of high&#xD;
      concentrations of cryoprotectant and rapid cooling rates. Several studies comparing&#xD;
      cryopreservation of human embryos by vitrification or slow freezing are available and&#xD;
      meta-analyses have been published. Although vitrification has been found to have&#xD;
      significantly higher survival rates than slow freezing, results on implantation rate,&#xD;
      clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate remain unclear, mostly due to a paucity of&#xD;
      well-designed and powered prospective randomized controlled studies assessing live birth&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryo evaluation to select the embryo(s) with the highest implantation potential is&#xD;
      routinely based on embryo developmental and morphological characteristics using light&#xD;
      microscopy. The embryo parameters usually correlated to the implantation capacity of an&#xD;
      embryo in a fresh cycle are the number of blastomeres, their symmetry and the percentage&#xD;
      cytoplasmic fragmentation. For the evaluation of frozen-thawed embryos, the percentage of&#xD;
      blastomeres that survive the freezing-thawing process and their developmental capacity after&#xD;
      overnight culture have to be added to these factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current research in the development of non-invasive methods for scoring embryos and ranking&#xD;
      them according to their ability to implant and give rise to a healthy birth include both&#xD;
      morphometrics and morphokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphometrics Multilevel computerized images enable assessment over an unlimited time period&#xD;
      and allow a detailed evaluation of the embryo. Several morphometric studies of human fresh&#xD;
      oocytes and embryos with embryo implantation and development have been published.&#xD;
      Morphometric studies using multilevel images combined with a computer-assisted scoring system&#xD;
      (CASS) may be superior compared to standard scoring system (SSS) to predict implantation&#xD;
      and/or live birth based on the number and size of blastomeres on day 3. Semi-automated&#xD;
      morphometric analysis also revealed correlations between total embryo volume and clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy. Another study evaluating morphometric characteristics including the absolute&#xD;
      volumes, coefficients of form and the coefficient of diversity of human embryos and/or&#xD;
      oocytes showed a higher coefficient of diversity between sister blastomeres in embryos that&#xD;
      successfully implanted and progressed to birth. Morphometric characteristics including the&#xD;
      external and internal diameter of the zona pellucida, the thickness of the zona pellucida and&#xD;
      the embryo cell mass diameter were described. They stated that image analysis could be used&#xD;
      to predict the criteria needed for more efficient embryo assessment before transfer. The mean&#xD;
      blastomere size was correlated with the degree of fragmentation and multinucleation in a&#xD;
      study using computer-controlled multilevel analyses with 232 embryos. However, until now, no&#xD;
      morphometric studies in human frozen thawed embryos have been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphokinetics Time-lapse imaging allows documentation of early growth without disturbing the&#xD;
      culture environment. At this moment, no prospective randomized trial data are available&#xD;
      showing that embryos selected from time-lapse imaging have significantly improved&#xD;
      implantation rates compared with embryos selected with conventional morphological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, time lapse imaging of embryos have revealed a correlation between first cleavage&#xD;
      time, time between cleavages, blastomere size and multinucleation and implantation potential&#xD;
      of human embryos. A correlation between the times of each embryo cleavage between 2 to 8 cell&#xD;
      stage, the ability to become a blastocyst and implantation potential. Moreover, morphokinetic&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that direct cleavage from 2 cells to 3 cells has been correlated&#xD;
      with a low implantation and ongoing pregnancy rate. According to time-lapse recording in 38&#xD;
      oocytes, embryo quality was related to fertilization events and periodicity of the&#xD;
      cyctoplasmic wave: good quality embryos arose from oocytes that had more uniform timing from&#xD;
      injection to pronuclear abuttal and longer cytoplasmic wave. Furthermore, cellular fragments&#xD;
      in human embryos can disappear during in vitro culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a few studies on morphokinetics in human cryopreserved embryos have been published.&#xD;
      Using videocinematography on respectively 50 and 103 frozen-thawed embryos, it was shown that&#xD;
      the occurrence of smooth membranes and the cell-cell adherence were predictive for the&#xD;
      implantation capacity of frozen-cleaved embryos. Wong et al. followed the development of 242&#xD;
      supernumerary frozen d1-old embryos in a study combining time lapse microscopy and gene&#xD;
      expression profiling: success in progression to the blastocyst stage could be predicted by&#xD;
      measuring three dynamic, noninvasive imaging parameters by day 2 after fertilization before&#xD;
      embryonic genome activation: (1) duration of the first cytokinesis, (2) time interval between&#xD;
      the end of the first mitosis and the initiation of the second and (3) the time interval&#xD;
      between the second and third mitoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study aims to describe morphometric and morphokinetic parameters of thawed&#xD;
      human embryos after freezing (slow freezing or vitrification). The study will focus on the&#xD;
      evolution of the blastomere volume, the evolution of the contact surfaces between surviving&#xD;
      blastomeres and the development of the embryo using time lapse imaging. Embryo morphometric&#xD;
      and morphokinetic parameters will be analyzed together with patient characteristics and&#xD;
      clinical parameters using cluster analysis techniques. The correlation between&#xD;
      morphometrics/morphokinetics and the implantation potential of frozen-thawed embryos will be&#xD;
      studied in cycles with single embryo transfer and in cycles with dual implantation after&#xD;
      double embryo transfer.&#xD;
