  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a 6 week pilot study, 20 individuals with habitual sleep restriction will all be asked to&#xD;
      extend their nightly sleep by 1 hour, and will then be randomized 1:1 to nightly&#xD;
      controlled-release oral melatonin (2mg) or placebo. The investigators will assess whether&#xD;
      sleep extension and nightly melatonin supplementation in the community is a feasible&#xD;
      intervention with a beneficial effect on the following chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk&#xD;
      factors: systemic and renal specific renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system (RAAS) activation&#xD;
      (systemic plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin II levels, 24-hour urine aldosterone&#xD;
      excretion, and renal plasma flow response to captopril); nocturnal blood pressure measured by&#xD;
      24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor; central blood pressure measured by pulse wave&#xD;
      analysis; and glucose metabolism measured by Minimal Model assessment of insulin resistance&#xD;
      and β-cell response to a mixed meal protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit individuals from the Boston area who meet the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. The investigators will include both men and women and all races and&#xD;
      ethnicities. The only exception will be women who are pregnant because certain medications&#xD;
      used during the inpatient evaluations (e.g., nitroglycerine), and certain study medications&#xD;
      (i.e., captopril) are contraindicated during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responders to advertisements will be pre-screened by telephone to obtain a body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) estimate and a medical history to gauge potential eligibility. For participants who may&#xD;
      be eligible following this phone query, the basic study schema will be described to identify&#xD;
      those who remain interested in participation after learning the duration, inpatient&#xD;
      requirements, and potential medication use. These individuals will then be invited to attend&#xD;
      an outpatient screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial, in which 16 subjects&#xD;
      with obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2), pre-diabetes (hemoglobin A1C [HbA1C],&#xD;
      5.7-6.4%), and self-reported short sleep duration (&lt;7 hours/night) are randomly assigned 1:1&#xD;
      to receive either placebo or 2 mg of controlled-release melatonin, taken orally every evening&#xD;
      1 hour before bed for 6 weeks. All subjects will be asked to extend their sleep time by one&#xD;
      hour during the 6 week period between inpatient visits. Endpoints will be measured at both&#xD;
      the baseline and 6-week inpatient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit: Screening visits will take place at the Brigham and Women's Outpatient&#xD;
      Center for Clinical Investigation During the outpatient screen, Dr. McMullan will explain the&#xD;
      study in detail, review the consent form, and answer questions. After obtaining written&#xD;
      informed consent for participation, a history and physical examination will be performed in&#xD;
      order to initially judge eligibility based upon the criteria set out in that section of this&#xD;
      record. Participants deemed potentially eligible based upon the screening history and exam&#xD;
      will undergo phlebotomy and analysis for HbA1c, serum chemistries and glucose, and complete&#xD;
      blood count (CBC) to confirm eligibility using the criteria presented in the table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures Pre-admission: All participants will wear a wrist activity monitor for a&#xD;
      total of 8 weeks; 2 weeks prior to the baseline inpatient visit and for the 6 weeks between&#xD;
      inpatient visits. Participants will complete a daily sleep log during the 2 weeks preceding&#xD;
      each visit. Three days before admission, participants will be placed on a high salt diet by&#xD;
      supplementing their usual diet with 150 millimoles (mmol) sodium/day for 3 days using dry&#xD;
      bouillon added to food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment assignments: Prior to admission for the baseline visit, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized (1:1) to receive study medication (melatonin 2mg of controlled release formulation&#xD;
      or placebo). All participants will be asked to extend their sleep time by one hour during the&#xD;
      6 week period between inpatient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and Follow-up inpatient visit: Baseline and 6-week inpatient visits will be&#xD;
      virtually identical. Each inpatient visit will begin at 4:00PM on Day 0 and end at 4:00 PM on&#xD;
      Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0 - All participants will begin 24 hour urine collection on admission to the Brigham and&#xD;
      Women's Hospital Center for Clinical Investigation (CCI) on the evening of day 0. The 24-hour&#xD;
      urine collection will be continued overnight (nurses will keep the daytime (8AM to 8PM) and&#xD;
      nighttime (8PM to 8AM) urine separate to permit analysis of diurnal variation in urinary&#xD;
      analytes). Subjects will fast after 9 pm to ensure a 12-hour fast by the next morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 -At 8 am, central blood pressure and vascular compliance will be assessed, followed at&#xD;
      approximately 9 am by measurement of renal specific RAAS activity via para-aminohippurate&#xD;
      (PAH) renal plasma flow testing with captopril, and systemic renin-aldosterone-angiotensin&#xD;
      system (RAAS) will be measured by plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma angiotensin II (Ang II)&#xD;
      and urine aldosterone. Next the participant will receive a mixed meal (10kcal/kg, 45%&#xD;
      carbohydrate, 15% protein, 40% fat, 1g/kg glucose) to be consumed in 15 minutes with blood&#xD;
      draws at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes from the time the meal had begun to be&#xD;
      consumed. Plasma glucose, insulin and c-peptide will be measured in all 7 samples of blood.&#xD;
      The 24-hour urine collection will conclude at 4 pm on day 1 and will be used to measure&#xD;
      24-hour excretion of sodium and aldosterone. Finally the participant will be fitted with a&#xD;
      Spacelabs 90207 ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitor prior to discharge to be worn for&#xD;
      24-hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up - During the study, participants will be phoned weekly by a study coordinator to&#xD;
      assess for compliance and potential side effects. Dr McMullan will call all subjects every 2&#xD;
      weeks to discuss difficulties encountered with their new sleep schedule, to recommend&#xD;
      improvements and encourage compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters Measured: At the inpatient visits, the following measurements will be made:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal Specific renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system (RAAS) - The activity of the local kidney&#xD;
      RAAS can be measured by examining the change in effective renal plasma flow (RPF) after oral&#xD;
      captopril while in high sodium balance. Effective RPF is measured as clearance of&#xD;
      para-aminohippuric acid (PAH), because PAH is cleared solely and nearly entirely by the&#xD;
      kidney. The protocol to measure PAH clearance is performed with the participant supine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system (RAAS) - plasma renin activity (PRA) and&#xD;
      angiotensin II (Ang II) levels will be measured on the first morning blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central Blood Pressure - Will be measured using pulse wave analysis using the SphygmoCor&#xD;
      system (AtCor Medical, West Ryde, New South Wales, Australia), which measures central blood&#xD;
      pressure and arterial stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose metabolism - Will be evaluated by applying the Oral Minimal Model method to the&#xD;
      results of a 2 hour 7- measurement, mixed meal tolerance test.2 Subject will be given&#xD;
      breakfast in the form of a mixed meal (10kcal/kg, 45% carbohydrate, 15% protein, 40% fat,&#xD;
      1g/kg glucose) which must be consumed within 15 minutes with glucose, insulin and c-peptide&#xD;
      measured from arterialized blood drawn at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes from start of&#xD;
      meal. From the glucose, insulin and c-peptide measurements calculation of insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      (reciprocal of insulin resistance) and β-cell responsivity will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will collect demographic information (age, self-described race and ethnicity,&#xD;
      sex), and physical data (height, weight, screening blood pressure). Blood and urine samples&#xD;
      will be analyzed for various biomarkers to collect the data necessary to carry out the&#xD;
      specific aims, as described in the section above. All of these data will be recorded in&#xD;
      association with a study identification (ID) number, and kept as secure excel files by the&#xD;
      statistician and programmer. The only individually identifiable private data that will be&#xD;
      collected are names, addresses, and contact phone numbers so that participants can be&#xD;
      screened with follow-up phone calls, and they will be admitted to the inpatient CCI under&#xD;
      their name. This personal information, however, will not be associated with the results&#xD;
      obtained from the various tests performed, as the latter will be associated with a study ID&#xD;
      number. The file linking the study ID number and the personally identifiable information will&#xD;
      be kept by the Principal Investigator in a secure location and will not be violated unless it&#xD;
      becomes medically necessary to contact a participant on the basis of one of their lab&#xD;
      screening tests (e.g., elevated liver function tests).&#xD;
