    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of tablets containing probiotic candidate&#xD;
      strains, on gingival inflammation and the levels of selected pro- and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF). A secondary aim is to describe the effect of&#xD;
      the tablets on the salivary microbiome. The null hypothesis is that the clinical&#xD;
      measurements, levels of cytokines and microbial composition of saliva will not differ from&#xD;
      baseline or between the study and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned as a double-blind; placebo controlled randomized trial with two parallel&#xD;
      arms. The intervention period is planned to be 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 participants are planned to be enrolled after informed consent and then randomly allocated&#xD;
      to either the probiotic group or the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are randomly assigned to one of the study groups and given supply of either&#xD;
      probiotic tablets or placebo tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probiotic tablets contain Lactobacillus rhamnosus PB01 and Lactobacillus curvatus P2-2 at&#xD;
      a dose of 1 * 109 CFU(Colony Forming Units)/tablet. The participants will take two tablets a&#xD;
      day for four weeks. Follow up registrations are conducted after two weeks, four weeks and six&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, saliva and GCF will be collected and then plaque index (PI)) and bleeding on&#xD;
      probing (BOP) will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be processed with SPSS software (v 22.0; Chicago, Ill, USA). The follow-up&#xD;
      values are compared to baseline within each group by Wilcoxon paired two-sided test and&#xD;
      differences between groups are analyzed by Wilcoxon unpaired test. A p-value &lt; 0.05 is&#xD;
      considered statistical significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are fully covered by the patient insurance of The School of Dentistry which&#xD;
      cover any damage to the trial participant during the study .There is no expected side effects&#xD;
      to the treatment with probiotics. Probiotics are generally considered safe (GRAS: Generally&#xD;
      Recognized As Safe) by The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will not benefit directly from the treatment, but the knowledge gained from&#xD;
      the study might contribute to the prevention of microbial derived illnesses in the mouth,&#xD;
      e.g. caries and periodontitis, in the future. The sample collection does not cause any&#xD;
      discomfort to the participants and the tablets have no known side effects. Therefore, the&#xD;
      personal benefit of the participants corresponds to the minimal risk and discomfort to the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human saliva offers an easy accessible and non-invasive opportunity to study bacterial&#xD;
      interactions as well as biomarkers of health and disease. The Human Microbiome Project has&#xD;
      provided insights that the biofilms inside and outside our bodies have co-evolved with&#xD;
      mankind and play an important role for health. This is also true for the oral cavity in which&#xD;
      the microbiota does not play a passive role but actively contributes to the maintenance of&#xD;
      oral health. However, certain ecological shifts in the microbiome allow pathogens to manifest&#xD;
      and cause oral diseases. According to the ecological plaque hypothesis, caries and&#xD;
      periodontitis are the result of environmentally induced overgrowth of aciduric and&#xD;
      proteolytic species, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacteriotherapy is the term used when a harmless effector strain is implanted in the host's&#xD;
      microflora to maintain or restore a natural microbiome by interference and/or inhibition of&#xD;
      other microorganisms, and especially pathogens. This might open up alternative ways of&#xD;
      fighting infectious diseases with less harmful side effects and may also help in the&#xD;
      treatment of disorders that seem to have nothing to do with bacteria, such as asthma, obesity&#xD;
      and diabetes. Probiotic bacteria, defined as &quot;Live microorganisms which, when administered in&#xD;
      adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host&quot; (WHO), are commonly suggested&#xD;
      candidates for bacteriotherapy. The potential mechanisms of action are still not fully&#xD;
      understood but it seems clear that there are local (direct) as well as systemic (indirect)&#xD;
      effects. According to Reid the potential avenues are: i) co-aggregation with pathogens and&#xD;
      growth inhibition, ii) bacteriocin and hydrogen peroxide production, iii) competitive&#xD;
      exclusion through antagonistic activities on adhesion sites and nutrition, iv) systemic&#xD;
      immunomodulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro studies have shown effect on co-aggregation and growth inhibition and clinical&#xD;
      studies have shown effect on clinical parameters of gingival inflammation but still little is&#xD;
      known about the immunomodulatory effect and the host-microbe interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal diseases are among the most widespread infectious diseases in man and can lead to&#xD;
      tooth loss. If left untreated gingivitis can lead to periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different surfaces of the oral cavity are all continuously bathed in saliva and several&#xD;
      pathogenic species in saliva have been associated with periodontal disease. Studies on the&#xD;
      microbial effect of probiotic bacteria on oral health have so far been based on conventional&#xD;
      cultivation methods and have been focused on one or a few strains. The new high-throughput&#xD;
      techniques provide a possibility for more comprehensive and precise picture of the bacterial&#xD;
      profiles, but to date only a few studies have used sequencing to determine the bacterial&#xD;
      composition of saliva after intake of probiotic bacteria. Most analyze the composition after&#xD;
      a very short term intake of the probiotic bacteria. Hence, there is only one study which have&#xD;
      analyzed the composition after longer intervention period and correlated this to clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of tablets containing probiotic candidate&#xD;
      strains, on gingival inflammation and the levels of selected pro- and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF). A secondary aim is to describe the effect of&#xD;
      the tablets on the salivary microbiome. The null hypothesis is that the clinical&#xD;
      measurements, levels of cytokines and microbial composition of saliva will not differ from&#xD;
      baseline or between the study and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned as a double-blind; placebo controlled randomized trial with two parallel&#xD;
      arms. The intervention period is planned to be 4 weeks. The study plan will be submitted for&#xD;
      ethical approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be recruited among patients at the clinic at School of Dentistry and&#xD;
      through www.forsogsperson.dk. 80 participants are planned to be enrolled after informed&#xD;
      consent and then randomly allocated to either the probiotic group or the placebo group.&#xD;
      Sample size was determined by a power analysis (α= 0.05 and β=0.2) based on values of BOP&#xD;
      obtained previously. Seventy-four participants are needed and 80 are enrolled in order to&#xD;
      compensate for expected drop-outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: If the participants after reading the notice about the study express interest in&#xD;
      the study they will be invited to an information appointment with assistant professor and&#xD;
      dentist Mette Kirstine Keller. Prior to the appointment, the participants will be informed&#xD;
      that they have the right to bring a companion to the information meeting. They will also&#xD;
      receive the written information about the study. The appointment will take place in a meeting&#xD;
      room without other people present than the investigator, the participant and possibly a&#xD;
      companion. The oral information will be based on the written information and will be given in&#xD;
      a plain language without any value-laden terms. The investigator is responsible for ensuring&#xD;
      that the participant has understood all given information before the project begins. All&#xD;
      comments from the participant are taken into relevant consideration both during the&#xD;
      information interview and the study. At any time the participant can withdraw from the&#xD;
      project. The informed consent for participation in the trial is given on the basis of oral&#xD;
      and written information, and such consent may be given after at least 24 hours of reflection&#xD;
      time. The project does not include subjects who, because of physical or mental handicap,&#xD;
      cannot give the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent, baseline examination and sampling, the participants are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the study groups and given supply of either probiotic tablets or placebo&#xD;
      tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probiotic tablets contain Lactobacillus rhamnosus PB01 and Lactobacillus curvatus P2-2 at&#xD;
      a dose of 1 * 109 CFU/tablet. The strains are chosen based on in vitro assays investigating&#xD;
      growth inhibition of pathogens and immunomodulation. The placebo tablets are identical in&#xD;
      size and composition but without the addition of the probiotic strains. Both tablets are&#xD;
      provided by Bifodan A/S. The participants will be instructed to take one tablet in the&#xD;
      morning and one in the evening thirty minutes after tooth brushing. The tablets are packed in&#xD;
      identical pots with color coding. The code will be kept from the investigators until the&#xD;
      analysis are finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will take two tablets a day for four weeks. Follow up registrations are&#xD;
      conducted after two weeks, four weeks and six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, saliva and GCF (Gingival Crevicular Fluid) will be collected and then plaque&#xD;
      index (PI)) and bleeding on probing (BOP) will be registered. For the collection of GCF, two&#xD;
      contralateral buccal sites from the upper incisors, canines or premolars will be selected&#xD;
      from each participant. Visual supragingival plaque on the selected teeth will be removed and&#xD;
      the sites will be dried with cotton pellets. GCF will be collected using periopaper strips&#xD;
      (ProFlow, Amityville, NY, USA) gently inserted in the gingival sulcus for 20 s. The position&#xD;
      of the strip is marked on a chart to secure the identical sample site at the follow ups. In&#xD;
      case of blood contamination, the strip is discharged and the sampling is repeated after 5&#xD;
      min. The volume of GCF is recorded using a Peritron 8000 (Proflow) and expressed in μL. One&#xD;
      strip holds approximately 0.1-0.4 μL GCF. The strips are then transferred to plastic tubes&#xD;
      and stored at -80ºC until further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the saliva samples, paraffin-stimulated whole saliva is collected during a 3-minute&#xD;
      period at least two hours after any food intake. The approximate amount of saliva at normal&#xD;
      rate will be 3-6 ml after 3 minutes. The collected saliva is immediately frozen in 1.5 ml&#xD;
      aliquots and stored at -80ºC until further analysis. The remainder of the sample will be&#xD;
      destroyed after completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of cytokines on GCF: The absorbed GCF is eluated in 120 μL PBS (phosphate buffered&#xD;
      saline) containing 0.05 % Tween 20. The levels of INFγ, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12 is&#xD;
      determined using luminex and multiplex immunoassay panels (LINCOplex, LINCO Research, Inc,&#xD;
      USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's manual. The concentrations of the cytokines are&#xD;
      expressed as pg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the salivary microbiome: Total bacterial DNA will be extracted from 2 ml of&#xD;
      thawed saliva sample for identification and comparison of the composition and stability of&#xD;
      the total microbial communities in the two trial groups through amplicon sequencing of the&#xD;
      phylogenetic marker gene 16S rRNA. The hypervariable region V3-V4 of bacterial and archaeal&#xD;
      16S rRNA genes will be PCR amplified using specific primers 341F and 806R and analyzed by an&#xD;
      established high-throughput sequencing pipeline developed by the University of Copenhagen&#xD;
      Microbiology partner based on state-of-the-art sequencing technologies (Illumina Mi-Seq) and&#xD;
      custom made bioinformatic tools specifically designed for analysis of large microbiome&#xD;
      datasets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be processed with SPSS software (v 22.0; Chicago, Ill, USA). The follow-up&#xD;
      values are compared to baseline within each group by Wilcoxon paired two-sided test and&#xD;
      differences between groups are analyzed by Wilcoxon unpaired test. A p-value &lt; 0.05 is&#xD;
      considered statistical significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All collected data will be treated in compliance with the Act on Processing of Personal Data&#xD;
      and &quot;The Health Law&quot;. At inclusion the participants will be assigned a unique number and a&#xD;
      separate protocol without personal identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific importance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may provide evidence that the probiotic tablets can influence clinical markers of&#xD;
      gingival inflammation and/or pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which can lead to new&#xD;
      strategies in managing gingivitis and maintaining oral health. The use of probiotic bacteria&#xD;
      in treatment of dental diseases could be one option the use of antibiotics. Furthermore it&#xD;
      will provide new insights to the effect of introducing new strains to the salivary microbiome&#xD;
      which is supposed to be a significant event in bacteriotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Adverse Effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are fully covered by the patient insurance of The School of Dentistry which&#xD;
      cover any damage to the trial participant during the study .There is no expected side effects&#xD;
      to the treatment with probiotics. Probiotics are generally considered safe (GRAS: Generally&#xD;
      Recognized As Safe) by The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be asked to report any unexpected adverse effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will not benefit directly from the treatment, but the knowledge gained from&#xD;
      the study might contribute to the prevention of microbial derived illnesses in the mouth,&#xD;
      e.g. caries and periodontitis, in the future. The sample collection does not cause any&#xD;
      discomfort to the participants and the tablets have no known side effects. Therefore, the&#xD;
      personal benefit of the participants corresponds to the minimal risk and discomfort to the&#xD;
      participants. The participants who complete the trial will be compensated with a gift voucher&#xD;
      of 500 DKK to Magasin. It should be emphasized that positive, negative and inconclusive&#xD;
      results will be published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of the study will be carried out in the winter 2014/2015. After ethical approval,&#xD;
      patients can be recruited to the study during winter/spring 2015.&#xD;
