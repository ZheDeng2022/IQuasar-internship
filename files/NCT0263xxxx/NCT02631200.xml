  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the feasibility of carrying out a randomised controlled trial,&#xD;
      incorporating a mixed methods process evaluation, to evaluate advance care planning with&#xD;
      older patients who have end-stage kidney disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney failure becomes more common as people age. It increases the risks of other major&#xD;
      illnesses, sudden worsening of symptoms, and death. Even so, many people with kidney failure&#xD;
      do not talk about their preferences for end-of-life care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advance care planning (ACP) can help patients and families think through their preferences&#xD;
      for future care and discuss these with the professionals looking after them. This may lead to&#xD;
      care more in keeping with patients' wishes and so reduce distress for patients and families.&#xD;
      ACP is recommended as good practice for people with kidney failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, questions remain about the impact of ACP on patients and families; and also about&#xD;
      the best ways to put ACP into practice. Doing research about ACP is challenging for everyone&#xD;
      involved, so we need to thoroughly test our research methods in a pilot study before we&#xD;
      attempt a larger study that would fully answer those questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test our methods we will carry out a small-scale randomised controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      those patients who use ACP with those who do not, in terms of: quality of life, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, physical functioning, well-being, satisfaction with decision-making and agreement&#xD;
      between the patient and their nominated carer in terms of the patient's preferences for care&#xD;
      at the end of life.&#xD;
