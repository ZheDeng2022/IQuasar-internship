      ABSTRACT:-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic periodontitis (CP), the commonest type of periodontal disease, it is an infectious&#xD;
      disease resulting in inflammation within of the tissues supporting the teeth, progressive&#xD;
      loss of attachment and bone loss. It is closely related to several systemic diseases, such as&#xD;
      diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The link between periodontal disease and chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD) may be due to infection and inflammation. The periodontal inflammatory state&#xD;
      may increases the chronic inflammation present in CKD, thus decreasing renal function.&#xD;
      Periodontal therapy may reduce inflammation and improves endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:- To investigate the effect of mechanical non-surgical periodontal therapy on serum renal&#xD;
      function markers in systematically healthy CP subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:- To evaluate the effect of scaling and root planing (SRP) on serum renal function&#xD;
      markers such as urea, creatinine, bilurubin in systematically healthy CP patient and to&#xD;
      compare the clinical parameters such as Gingival index (GI), Plaque index (PI), Probing depth&#xD;
      (PD), Bleeding on probing (BOP), Clinical attachment level (CAL) between test group (TG) &amp;&#xD;
      control group (CG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: - 51 CP patients; age ranging between 35-60 years was selected.&#xD;
      Categorized equally into group I and groups II. Group I was test group (TG) included 25&#xD;
      patients and group II was control group (CG) included 26 patients. The serum levels of renal&#xD;
      function markers included Urea, Creatinine, Bilurubin were measured. SRP was done in test&#xD;
      group only. All the parameters were checked at baseline and one month after SRP. Comparisons&#xD;
      of baseline and value after 1 month among each criterion among each group unpaired-t test and&#xD;
      comparisons of two groups for each criterion by paired-t test.&#xD;

      MATERIAL AND METHODS:- A non-surgical interventional clinical study was carried out from&#xD;
      January 2015 to March 2015 in 51 patients at the department of Periodontology, Tatyasaheb&#xD;
      Kore Dental College &amp; Research Centre, New Pargaon. Prior approval for the study was obtained&#xD;
      from the local ethical committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic generalized periodontitis [(moderate and severe) according to CDC&#xD;
      working group, 2007 criteria]. Age ranging from 35-60 ( mean 45) years, should have at least&#xD;
      20 natural teeth, who have not received periodontal therapy, within preceding six months were&#xD;
      included in this study. Tobacco in any form and alcoholics, any other systemic disease which&#xD;
      can alter the course of periodontal disease, subjects should have pregnant, women on hormone&#xD;
      replacement therapy or hormonal contraceptives, patients taking steroidal or non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (previous 3 months) or antibiotics (previous 6 months),&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics in the previous six month and patients with&#xD;
      aggressive periodontitis were excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study was explained, including the benefits, risks and alternative treatments, the patients&#xD;
      signed an informed consent form indicating their agreement to participate in the study and&#xD;
      each patient was assigned a patient number in ascending order to maintain the masking of&#xD;
      evaluators. Eg. First patient is given a number D1, Second D2, and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUPS This was a Phase 2 clinical trial with an Interventional model of parallel assignment&#xD;
      with two arms. Hence, after screening through inclusion and exclusion criteria patients were&#xD;
      divided into two groups, 25 (13 males and 12 females) patients were included in TG and 26 (13&#xD;
      males and 13 females) subjects included in CG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION:- The study was non-surgical controlled clinical trial. A single study&#xD;
      co-ordinator patients into two groups by using Quick Cals, Graph pad software and it has&#xD;
      stratified with a 1:1 allocation. SRP had performed for all subjects in TG at baseline by one&#xD;
      trained Periodontist under local anaesthesia (if required) using Piezoelectric scaler&#xD;
      [Satelec ACTEON P5TM], Hand scalers, Universal curette and Gracey Curette. Clinical and&#xD;
      biochemical parameters had recorded by trained examiner in both TG and CG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLOOD COLLECTION:- 5 ml of blood was collected from the antecubital fossa by venipuncture&#xD;
      using 20-guage needle with 5 ml syringes. Blood samples were left to clot for (1-2) hours,&#xD;
      then centrifuged to obtain the serum. Serum was collected in disposable plastic serum&#xD;
      containing tube, which was stored at (2-40C) until time of assay. Estimation of levels of&#xD;
      urea (by GLDH- urease method), bilirubin total (by Diazo Method), creatinine (modified&#xD;
      JAFFE'S method) was done at the baseline and one month in both the groups, at ANANT&#xD;
      laboratory, kodoli, Kolhapur (INDIA).&#xD;
