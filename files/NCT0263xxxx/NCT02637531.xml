      This dose-escalation study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of IPI-549 monotherapy and IPI-549 in combination with nivolumab in subjects&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study IPI-549-01 is a first-in-human multicenter, open-label, up to five-part Phase 1/1b&#xD;
      dose-escalation study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of IPI-549 monotherapy and IPI-549 in combination with nivolumab in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 175 subjects will receive IPI-549, either as a monotherapy or in combination&#xD;
      with nivolumab. Subjects will receive IPI-549 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is&#xD;
      achieved or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A (QD dosing) (and Part B (BID dosing) if necessary) a dose escalation part of the study&#xD;
      will evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, and PD of IPI-549 as a single agent in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced solid tumors. Part A/B will determine the recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) for IPI-549 single agent that is going to be administered in Part D as a single agent&#xD;
      and Part C in combination with nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C a dose-escalation part of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, and&#xD;
      PD of IPI-549 when administered in combination with IV nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W)&#xD;
      in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Part C will determine the RP2D for the combination of&#xD;
      IPI-549 and nivolumab (combination RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part D will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical activity of&#xD;
      IPI-549 administered as a single agent in a cohort of subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
      Part D, Cycle 2 will also include a pilot food (a high-fat meal) effect evaluation that will&#xD;
      have 8 subjects out of the entire cohort of subjects participating in the Part D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part E will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical activity of&#xD;
      IPI-549 in combination with intravenous (IV) nivolumab 240 mg Q2W in a cohort of subjects&#xD;
      with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a cohort of subjects with melanoma and a cohort of&#xD;
      subjects with Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck (SCCHN). One or more cohorts of&#xD;
      subjects with additional tumor types may be enrolled if supported by data generated in dose&#xD;
      escalation or earlier expansion cohorts. To be eligible for enrollment in Part E, subjects&#xD;
      must have received an anti-PD1/PD-L1 as their most recent treatment prior to study entry. The&#xD;
      dose level to be administered in Part E will be the combination RP2D as determined in Part C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part F will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical activity of&#xD;
      IPI-549 in combination with intravenous (IV) nivolumab 240 mg Q2W in a cohort of subjects&#xD;
      with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). One or more cohorts of subjects with additional&#xD;
      tumor types may be enrolled if supported by data generated in dose escalation or earlier&#xD;
      expansion cohorts. To be eligible for enrollment in Part E, subjects must have no prior&#xD;
      anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy. The dose level to be administered in Part E will be the combination&#xD;
      RP2D as determined in Part C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part G will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical activity of&#xD;
      IPI-549 in combination with intravenous (IV) nivolumab 240 mg Q2W in a cohort of subjects&#xD;
      with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and a cohort of subjects with mesothelioma who have&#xD;
      received at least first line available therapy. One or more cohorts of subjects with&#xD;
      additional tumor types may be enrolled if supported by data generated in dose escalation or&#xD;
      earlier expansion cohorts. The dose level to be administered in Part E will be the&#xD;
      combination RP2D as determined in Part C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part H will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary clinical activity of&#xD;
      IPI-549 in combination with IV nivolumab 240 mg Q2W in subjects with advanced cancer with&#xD;
      high-circulating MDSCs (ie, ≥ 20.5% as measured by Serametrix CLIA-certified assay); other&#xD;
      indication(s) are to be determined. For subject's with a microsatellite instability-high&#xD;
      tumor, or tumor type for which anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy is considered standard of care,&#xD;
      that subject must have previously received an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy.&#xD;
