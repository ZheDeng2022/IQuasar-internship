  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial for patients with metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive human&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer who have progressed on an&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitor plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor (either palbociclib or ribociclib) to either&#xD;
      fulvestrant alone or fulvestrant with ribociclib (LEE-011). The purpose of the trial is to&#xD;
      determine whether there is continued benefit for patients to remain on a CDK4/6 inhibitor at&#xD;
      the time of switching anti-estrogen therapy. As ribociclib and palbociclib have a similar&#xD;
      toxicity and drug profile and mechanism of action, we feel that it is appropriate for&#xD;
      patients to receive either drug with an aromatase inhibitor prior to randomization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in early detection and therapeutic options, unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer remains incurable and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality.&#xD;
      Breast cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease. This study will be evaluating estrogen&#xD;
      receptor (ER) expression positivity and/or progesterone receptor (PgR) positivity of breast&#xD;
      cancer with the absence of over-expression or amplification of HER2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibitors of the cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) have been developed and&#xD;
      demonstrated impressive activity in patients with ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer&#xD;
      with marked improvements in progression free survival. This question is asking whether CDK&#xD;
      4/6 inhibition should be continued with hormone therapy in patients who will be switching&#xD;
      their hormone therapy in the metastatic breast cancer setting.&#xD;

    <description>This study is designed to examine the proportion of patients who remain progression-free at 24 weeks from study entry (randomization day). Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. Disease status will be assessed with comprehensive radiographic studies every three treatment cycles (approximately every 12 weeks (+/- 1 week)).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men or women at least 18 years of age with histologically or cytologically confirmed&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma of the breast with unresectable or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Most recent tumor biopsy or surgical resection specimen must be either&#xD;
             estrogen-receptor (ER) positive, progesterone receptors (PgR) positive, or both, as&#xD;
             defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) ≥1% (as per the American Society of Clinical&#xD;
             Oncology (ASCO)-College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. HER2-negative breast cancer defined as a negative in situ hybridization test or an&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) status of 0, 1+ or 2+. If IHC is 2+ (i.e. indeterminate), a&#xD;
             negative in situ hybridization (Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), Chromogenic&#xD;
             in situ hybridization (CISH), or Silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH)) test is&#xD;
             required by local laboratory testing. (as per the ASCO-CAP guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Postmenopausal status or receiving ovarian ablation with a GnRH agonist such as&#xD;
             goserelin. Postmenopausal status is defined by any one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior bilateral oophorectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age ≥60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age &lt;60 and amenorrhea for 12 or more months (in the absence of chemotherapy,&#xD;
                  tamoxifen, toremifen, or ovarian suppression) and FSH, LH, and estradiol in the&#xD;
                  postmenopausal range per local normal If the patient does not meet criteria for&#xD;
                  postmenopausal status but is receiving ovarian ablation therapy with a&#xD;
                  gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist such as goserelin, the patient is&#xD;
                  eligible for this study, provided that the GnRH agonist is started at least 2&#xD;
                  weeks prior to C1D1 of anti-estrogen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have evidence of measurable or unmeasurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No prior cdk 4/6 inhibitor (Closed to Accrual). If patient has not previously received&#xD;
             letrozole, letrozole will be supplied by Novartis. If previously progressed on&#xD;
             letrozole, another aromatase inhibitor that the patient has not previoulsy received is&#xD;
             allowed, per standard of care (anastrazole or exemestane, not supplied by study).&#xD;
             Ribociclib will be supplied by Novartis. If patient has previously received letrozole,&#xD;
             anastrazole, and exemestane, (s)he is not eligible. For scenario 1, patients are&#xD;
             allowed to have started the aromatase inhibitor within 4 consecutive weeks prior to&#xD;
             protocol registration. For instance, it is acceptable for patient who will be treated&#xD;
             with letrozole in scenario #1, to have started letrozole within 4 consecutive weeks&#xD;
             prior to protocol registration. No prior fulvestrant allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Scenario 2: the patient must have received an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole,&#xD;
             arimidex, exemestane) or tamoxifen or fulvestrant plus palbociclib as standard of care&#xD;
             or received a CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib or ribociclib or abemaciclib), and&#xD;
             demonstrated evidence of disease progression. If the patient was enrolled in a&#xD;
             randomized clinical trial involving ribociclib or abemaciclib or palbociclib (such as&#xD;
             the MONALEESA or PALOMA series of trials), then it must be known after study&#xD;
             discontinuation and unblinding that the patient received the investigational drug and&#xD;
             not placebo. Ribociclib or abemaciclib or palbociclib can also be given as standard of&#xD;
             care. Documentation of progression and duration of response on aromatase inhibitor or&#xD;
             tamoxifen plus CDK 4/6 inhibitor should be provided whenever possible. If patient&#xD;
             received prior fulvestrant, exemestane must be the hormone therapy backbone in the&#xD;
             randomization. If patient received prior exemestane, fulvestrant must be the hormone&#xD;
             therapy backbone in the randomization. If neither has been administered, selection of&#xD;
             fulvestrant or exemestane in the randomization will be per investigator discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Adequate baseline laboratory studies (hematologic and chemistry), including the&#xD;
             following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500 per microliter, Platelets ≥ 75,000 per&#xD;
                  microliter, Hemoglobin level ≥ 8.0 gm/dL on screening complete blood count.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Potassium, sodium, total calcium (corrected only in the case of hypoalbuminemia),&#xD;
                  magnesium, and phosphorus within normal limits of the local laboratory (screening&#xD;
                  values can be rechecked after electrolyte repletion and before the first dose of&#xD;
                  study medication, if necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine level ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt; 50&#xD;
                  mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In absence of liver metastases, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate&#xD;
                  aminotransferase (AST) should be below 2.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN). If&#xD;
                  the patient has liver metastases, ALT and AST should be &lt; 5 × ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN. (In patients with well documented Gilbert's&#xD;
                  Syndrome, total bilirubin ≤ 3 × ULN with direct bilirubin within normal range.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  international normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. a) Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization obtained from the subject/legal&#xD;
             representative prior to performing any protocol-related procedures b) Subjects must be&#xD;
             willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule, laboratory&#xD;
             testing, and other requirements of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Must be able to swallow ribociclib and oral aromatase inhibitor, such as letrozole or&#xD;
             exemestane.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has a known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of ribociclib, aromatase&#xD;
             inhibitors (such as letrozole) or fulvestrant&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active central nervous system (CNS) disease. History of CNS metastases or cord&#xD;
             compression is allowable if the patient has been clinically stable for at least 4&#xD;
             weeks since completion of definitive treatment and is off systemic steroids. In the&#xD;
             case of brain metastases, the patient must have stable or improved imaging at least 4&#xD;
             weeks after completion of definitive treatment. If there is evidence of active&#xD;
             leptomeningeal disease, the patient is ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Identified as having visceral crisis, lymphangitic spread, or leptomeningeal&#xD;
             carcinomatosis. Visceral crisis is not the mere presence of visceral metastases but&#xD;
             implies severe organ dysfunction as assessed by symptoms and signs, laboratory&#xD;
             studies, and rapid progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Received more than 1 prior systemic chemotherapy in the unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
             setting. If the patient received 1 prior systemic chemotherapy, the patient is&#xD;
             eligible. Having received prior therapies for breast cancer (such as everolimus or&#xD;
             experimental agents) does not affect eligibility for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Completion of major surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy (such as everolimus or&#xD;
             experimental agents_ or radiation within 14 days prior to starting investigational&#xD;
             drug or has not recovered from major side effects. There is no required washout period&#xD;
             from completion of prior anti-estrogen therapy (either scenario) or prior CDK 4/6&#xD;
             inhibitor (if scenario 2) to initiation of ribociclib/placebo and anti-estrogen on&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Residual acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy that have not resolved to&#xD;
             CTCAE v.4 Grade ≤1. Exception to this criterion: patients with grade 1 taxane-induced&#xD;
             neuropathy, any grade of alopecia, amenorrhea or other toxicities not considered a&#xD;
             safety risk for the patient as per investigator's discretion, are allowed to enter the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Presence of a concurrent malignancy or malignancy diagnosed within 5 years of&#xD;
             randomization, with the exception of basal or squamous cell carcinoma,&#xD;
             non-melanomatous skin cancer, curatively resected cervical cancer, localized prostate&#xD;
             cancer treated with curative intent, and stage I colorectal cancer treated with&#xD;
             curative resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may&#xD;
             significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g. ulcerative diseases,&#xD;
             uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel&#xD;
             resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has a known history of HIV infection (testing not mandatory).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization&#xD;
             abnormality including any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris, symptomatic pericarditis,&#xD;
                  or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) within 6 months prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documented cardiomyopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient has a known Left Ventricular Fraction (LVEF) &lt;50% as determined by&#xD;
                  Multiple Gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Long QT syndrome or family history of long QT syndrome or family history of&#xD;
                  idiopathic sudden death or congenital long QT syndrome, or any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  i. Risk factors for Torsades de Pointe (TdP) including uncorrected hypocalcemia,&#xD;
                  hypokalemia or hypomagnesaemia, history of cardiac failure, or history of&#xD;
                  clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia ii. Concomitant medications(s)&#xD;
                  with a known risk to prolong the QT interval and/or known to cause Torsades de&#xD;
                  Pointe that cannot be discontinued or replaced by safe alternative medication&#xD;
                  (e.g. within 5 half-lives or 7 days prior to starting study drug) iii. Inability&#xD;
                  to determine the QTc interval&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia),&#xD;
                  complete left bundle branch block, high-grade AV block (e.g., bifascicular block,&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Corrected QT interval (QTcF) &gt; 450 msec (QT interval using Fridericia's correction) on&#xD;
             screening electrocardiogram. If QTc prolongation is felt to be related to electrolyte&#xD;
             imbalance, an EKG can be repeated after correction of electrolytes. Mean resting heart&#xD;
             rate 50-100 bpm (determined from ECG).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The presence of any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that&#xD;
             would, in the investigator or treating physician's judgment, cause unacceptable safety&#xD;
             risks, contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study or compromise&#xD;
             compliance with the protocol. This includes uncontrolled infections that could&#xD;
             potentially be exacerbated by anti-neoplastic treatment, active untreated or&#xD;
             uncontrolled fungal bacterial or viral infections, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Currently receiving treatment, including medications and herbal preparations, with&#xD;
             known strong inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome p450 enzymes CYP3A4/5 medications&#xD;
             that have a narrow therapeutic window and are predominately metabolized through&#xD;
             CYP3A4/5 or herbal preparations/medications, dietary supplements, which cannot be&#xD;
             discontinued prior to receiving investigational drug. Anti-retrovirals,&#xD;
             anti-microbials, and anti-arrhythmics are the most common medications that interact&#xD;
             with these enzyme. Please refer to Section 5: Pharmaceutical Information and Appendix&#xD;
             B for more information and a list of drugs that should not be used concurrently with&#xD;
             ribociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents concurrently or have&#xD;
             received investigational agents within 14 days or 5 half-lives of the compound or&#xD;
             active metabolites, whichever is longer before the first dose of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        15 Patient is concurrently using hormone replacement therapy. 16. Subject is pregnant or&#xD;
        nursing. Serum or urine Beta-Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) must be checked in all pre-&#xD;
        and peri-menopausal patients. (Fulvestrant is pregnancy category D and CDK4/6 inhibitors&#xD;
        have demonstrated teratogenicity/fetotoxicity in animal studies.)&#xD;
