      This study evaluates the outcomes of stroke patients treated for intravascular thrombectomy,&#xD;
      using either a local anesthetic with sedation, or a general anesthetic. Historical data will&#xD;
      be used for those treated with the local anesthetic, and prospective data will be used for&#xD;
      those treated with the general anesthetic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label pilot study, comparing intravascular thrombectomy patients treated&#xD;
      using either general anesthetic (prospective arm) or local anesthetic with sedation&#xD;
      (retrospective arm), with blinded outcome evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New evidence has established that the addition of endovascular thrombectomy for large, and/or&#xD;
      proximal occlusions improves outcome in addition to, and/or in place of tPA therapy. There&#xD;
      have been no randomized prospective trials assessing the relationship of anesthesia on&#xD;
      outcomes for this procedure. This procedure is routinely performed under either local&#xD;
      anesthetic with sedation and under general anesthesia (GA). The choice between these two&#xD;
      techniques is largely institution based. Currently in the Saskatoon Health Region (SHR)&#xD;
      endovascular thrombectomies are performed under general anesthesia due to operator preference&#xD;
      and the optimization of surgical conditions. In the United States and other Canadian centers,&#xD;
      this procedure is performed safely with local anesthesia with or without sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several retrospective trials have suggested that general anesthetics are associated with&#xD;
      poorer outcomes. It has been suggested that general anesthesia can result in a delay in the&#xD;
      time to procedural start since it requires the presence of an anesthesiologist and the&#xD;
      procedure can be performed under sedation without extra personnel. It is also proposed that&#xD;
      the induction of general anesthesia can cause a decrease in blood pressure and a decrease in&#xD;
      collateral perfusion which can result in further cellular hypoxia. Anesthesiologists ,&#xD;
      however, are able to expertly manipulate hemodynamic parameters during general anesthesia to&#xD;
      the specific requirements of the operators potentially creating optimal tissue oxygenation&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for a prospective trial to assess the effect of general anesthetic on patient&#xD;
      outcome during endovascular thrombectomy. At this time, it is premature to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). Therefore in this pilot study, adult acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      participants who undergo intravascular thrombectomy in Saskatchewan will receive a general&#xD;
      anesthetic as per their current practice, and their data will be collected prospectively.&#xD;
      This cohort of participants will then be compared to participants that underwent the same&#xD;
      procedure in another study, who received local anesthesia with sedation. Approximately 77&#xD;
      prospective participants will be recruited for the prospective arm of this study.&#xD;
