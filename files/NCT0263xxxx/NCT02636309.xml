      BACKGROUND: Individual approaches at the workplace might not be sufficient to control Work&#xD;
      Related Musculoskeletal Diseases (WMSDs) since they are multifactorial and refractory cases&#xD;
      might need an additional rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate multifaceted intervention efficacy to manage the WMSDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: A Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire was applied pre and post intervention to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of a multifaceted program, including ergonomics, exercise program and&#xD;
      acupuncture/physical therapy exercises orientation at the workplace in 126 workers of a&#xD;
      hearing-aid industry. Additionally, a self-perception survey (Likert scale) concerning&#xD;
      absenteeism, quality of life and work ability helped to evaluate the program that lasts one&#xD;
      year and ten months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) have substantially increased worldwide from&#xD;
      the 1980s In Brazil, MSDs are the leading cause of occupational diseases. The harm to society&#xD;
      is enormous and justifies the study of methods to prevent them and / or reduce them. Many&#xD;
      authors have evaluated isolated approaches to manage the problem, but as this is usually&#xD;
      multifactorial, a set of interventions could bring better results. Physiotherapy is a&#xD;
      specialty that works to improve working conditions through ergonomic interventions, physical&#xD;
      therapy treatments and gymnastics and thus contributes to prevention and treatment of these&#xD;
      disorders. The objective of this study is: to determine the effect of this set of&#xD;
      interventions on the quality of life of workers and the productivity of a company that has&#xD;
      been evaluated in a previous study to this. The study population will consist of 185&#xD;
      employees of a multinational company that manufactures and sells hearing aids in Brazil. Of&#xD;
      those, 126 made up the experimental group (headquarter) and 59 control group (subsidiaries).&#xD;
      Two questionnaires, one on musculoskeletal symptoms and another on risk factors at work are&#xD;
      applied. An ergonomic evaluation of activities and tasks will be held, which will assist the&#xD;
      diagnosis of situations which may be modified by ergonomic measures. Management of&#xD;
      pre-existing complaints by acupuncture and orientation of specific exercises are used. The&#xD;
      program's effectiveness analysis will be done by two methods: a questionnaire assessing the&#xD;
      perception of workers about the their quality of life at work and the number of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal complaints pre and post-intervention.&#xD;
