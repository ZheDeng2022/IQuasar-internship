  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study volunteers will be required to conduct a home pregnancy test (HPT) at the trial centre&#xD;
      and provide a sample of urine from the same void for further testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will then complete a product usage questionnaire and leaflet comprehension&#xD;
      questionnaire at site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up information will be required from all volunteers as both additional urine sample(s)&#xD;
      and pregnancy information to establish true pregnancy status at the study visit.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible volunteers will be recruited into the study and provide informed consent. Volunteers&#xD;
      will then test their urine sample with the investigational HPT according to the device&#xD;
      Instructions for use and record their result onto the results sheet. A sample of urine from&#xD;
      the same void will be obtained for further testing by the study technicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technician will then test the volunteer's sample with a second investigational HPT, a&#xD;
      professional use pregnancy test and a Clearblue Digital HPT, the results of which will be&#xD;
      used to provide the volunteer with her pregnancy test result. During technician testing, the&#xD;
      volunteer will complete the device usability and leaflet comprehension questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study visit, all volunteers will be provided with materials to allow&#xD;
      follow-up for the determination of pregnancy status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of volunteers will be requested to provide one additional urine sample,&#xD;
      collected 2 days after the study visit. If early pregnancy is suspected the volunteer will be&#xD;
      requested to provide an additional 7 daily urine samples following the study visit. All&#xD;
      volunteers will be required to provide details of pregnancy status (documented menses or&#xD;
      pregnancy confirmation by health care professional) after the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      True pregnancy status will be determined by laboratory tests and clinical information. The&#xD;
      study will continue until a minimum of 300 pregnant and 300 not pregnant volunteers have&#xD;
      completed the study.&#xD;
