      The general objective of this quasi-experimental study is to assess the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      in-home respite care program compared to a control group not receiving the same type of&#xD;
      in-home respite on the well-being of the caregiver, the care-recipient and on the healthcare&#xD;
      system. The latter in terms of resource use, intention to institutionalize the care-recipient&#xD;
      and time to nursing home placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quasi-experimental study will be designed. The intervention group will consist of&#xD;
      caregiver/care-recipient dyads receiving an in-home respite program called &quot;Baluchonnage&quot; and&#xD;
      will be compared to a control group that doesn't receive &quot;Baluchonnage&quot;. Comparison between&#xD;
      the groups will be done by collecting health related and economic data. The trial will&#xD;
      evaluate outcomes as well in the caregiver as in the care recipient (measured via the&#xD;
      caregiver). The primary research outcome is caregiver burden. Secondary outcomes for&#xD;
      caregivers are: health related quality of life and reactions to behavioral problems of the&#xD;
      care-recipient. A secondary outcome related to the care-recipient is: frequency of behavioral&#xD;
      problems. Secondary outcomes for the healthcare system are: intention to institutionalize the&#xD;
      recipient into a nursing home and resource use of the recipient. Finally, in a follow up&#xD;
      phase of the trial possible differences in time to nursing home placement will be measured&#xD;
      (as well as burden and intention to institutionalize. Additionally, willingness to pay for&#xD;
      &quot;Baluchonnage&quot; per day will be asked to the informal caregivers. Eventually, if the&#xD;
      intervention is effective, modeled and trial based cost-effectiveness analyses will be&#xD;
      undertaken in a separate economic evaluation plan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The in-home respite intervention group will receive in-home respite care also called&#xD;
      &quot;Baluchonnage&quot;. During that period, lasting at least five days (24/24hours), an internally&#xD;
      trained or experienced care worker for persons with dementia takes over all caregiving tasks&#xD;
      while the caregiver takes a break. This care worker also writes down his/her observations in&#xD;
      a diary. The content of this diary enables the caregiver to validate their perceptions,&#xD;
      provides strategies to deal with difficult situations, and let them feel that somebody can&#xD;
      truly understand their daily challenges. The control group receives usual care (standard&#xD;
      dementia care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of the in-home respite intervention group will be recruited by Baluchon staff&#xD;
      when asking for a first or a new period of in-home respite care. First, Baluchon staff will&#xD;
      describe the study to the dyads and ask them about their preparedness to participate. When&#xD;
      they give their verbal consent contact information will be forwarded to the research team who&#xD;
      will then contact them by phone. During this call a home visit will be planned to sign the&#xD;
      informed consent and complete the baseline assessment. Participants in the control group will&#xD;
      be recruited from several general practitioners spread over the different regions in Belgium.&#xD;
      Potentially, in a later phase, control group participants will also be recruited via Memory&#xD;
      Clinics in Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to the recruitment of the intervention group, the physician will give some&#xD;
      information about the study. When verbal consent to participate is given to the physician,&#xD;
      caregivers will be contacted by phone by the research team to check eligibility. This will be&#xD;
      done by listing different support strategies (including &quot;Baluchonnage&quot;) and ask the caregiver&#xD;
      if they would be interested to receive this type of support. Also previous use of&#xD;
      Baluchonnage will be questioned because this is not allowed in the control group. When&#xD;
      caregivers appear to be eligible the research team will plan a home visit to sign the&#xD;
      informed consent and complete the baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection of caregiver and care-recipient characteristics and research outcomes will be&#xD;
      gathered at several assessment moments. The baseline assessment will be conducted during a&#xD;
      home visit by a member of the research team. Background characteristics and baseline values&#xD;
      of the research outcomes will be gathered during this assessment. For the intervention group&#xD;
      this will be in the week preceding the respite period. For the control group this will take&#xD;
      place after inclusion. A second assessment will be done in the intervention group two weeks&#xD;
      after having the intervention. A third assessment moment will be done 6 months after&#xD;
      inclusion and a last follow up assessment will be conducted after 12 months. To fulfill the&#xD;
      assessments after the baseline assessment, caregivers will be contacted by telephone. All&#xD;
      questionnaires will be available in Dutch and French for use in Belgium. When no valid&#xD;
      translation of a certain questionnaire exists in Dutch or French for Belgium a back-forward&#xD;
      translation method will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For caregivers the researchers will obtain the following background characteristics: age,&#xD;
      gender, region, marital status, ethnicity, educational level, relationship with the&#xD;
      care-recipient, employment status, living situation and time spent in caregiving. In both&#xD;
      study groups the reason for (potential) use of respite will be asked. Earlier use of&#xD;
      Baluchonnage will also be questioned to intervention group participants. Time spent in&#xD;
      caregiving (measured twice) will be calculated using the RUD instrument (Resource Utilization&#xD;
      in Dementia). For the care-recipient the following background characteristics will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline: age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, region, National Registration&#xD;
      Number, educational level, being on a waiting list for long-term nursing home placement,&#xD;
      dementia-specific medication use, and severity of dementia. The National Registration Number&#xD;
      of the person with dementia will be gathered. This will allow us to trace study participants&#xD;
      in the IMA database (Intermutualistisch Agentschap) and gather information on resource use&#xD;
      and date of placement in a nursing home over a longer time period than the trial. ADL&#xD;
      (Activities of Daily Living) functioning will be measured using the Belgian Katz scale and&#xD;
      severity of dementia with the Global Deterioration Scale. Both will be measured twice&#xD;
      (baseline and after 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation is performed using SPSS SamplePower 3Â®. First, literature was&#xD;
      searched to determine the needed effect size and standard deviation (SD) allowing to&#xD;
      distinguish a statistical significant and clinical relevant difference in the primary&#xD;
      outcome, i.e. burden. Based on the findings of a similar high quality intervention study an&#xD;
      effect size of 0.4 was used in the analysis, which implies a difference of six points on the&#xD;
      ZBI scale (Zarit Burden Interview), and a SD of 15. Also, an average drop-out rate of 20% was&#xD;
      taken into account, a power of 80% and a significance level at 0.05. Based on these values a&#xD;
      total of 124 caregiver/care-recipient dyads will be needed for the intervention group. To&#xD;
      reduce selection-bias inherent to quasi-experimental studies an allocation ratio of 1:2 will&#xD;
      be used to allow matching techniques. As a result 248 caregiver/care-recipient dyads will be&#xD;
      needed in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When appropriate, i.e. if the intervention demonstrates an effect in the study endpoints,&#xD;
      within-trial and modeled cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted in a separate economic&#xD;
      evaluation plan. First the analysis will be performed from the perspective of the health care&#xD;
      payer taking into account direct health care costs for the government's health care budget&#xD;
      (RIZIV/INAMI) as well as patients' co-payment. Assuming that policy makers would consider&#xD;
      reimbursement of in-home respite in the future the daily cost of Baluchonnage will thus be&#xD;
      included in the analyses. Alongside the costs of Baluchonnage other costs of healthcare&#xD;
      resource use including hospital and community care will be included. Additionally, also a&#xD;
      full societal viewpoint will be undertaken not only including potential health care costs for&#xD;
      the health care budget and patients, but also all other direct and indirect costs for&#xD;
      caregivers and patients. Because in this viewpoint everyone affected by the intervention&#xD;
      should be considered, caregiver time and costs (i.e. time spent in caregiving and&#xD;
      productivity loss) as well as resource use and costs of other sectors (f.e. food delivery)&#xD;
      should be included. Based on the KCE (Belgian Health Care Knowledge Center) guidelines for&#xD;
      health economic evaluations in Belgium future costs will be discounted at 3% and future&#xD;
      QALY's at 1.5%. Health utilities or QALY's of caregivers from both intervention arms will be&#xD;
      derived from the Belgian public preference list based on scores on the EQ-5D (general utility&#xD;
      instrument). Decision analytic modeling will be carried out to extrapolate effects of the&#xD;
      intervention found in the trial to a longer time horizon. The model will be based on results&#xD;
      from the trial as well as existing data from literature. Assumptions, hypotheses and sources&#xD;
      of information will be represented in a transparent and clear way. Finally, the model will be&#xD;
      validated by experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on resources used by the care-recipient of each study group will be obtained by an&#xD;
      adapted version of the RUD instrument at baseline and after six months inclusion. This RUD&#xD;
      instrument attempts to include all resource use including: health care resource use&#xD;
      containing hospital resources (in-patient and out-patient attendances,â¦) and community care&#xD;
      resources (general practitioner visits, nurse visits,â¦), caregiver and patient resources&#xD;
      (time spent in caregiver,â¦), and resource use in other sectors (social worker visits, home&#xD;
      help visits,â¦). Duration and frequency of the used services will be multiplied by each unit&#xD;
      cost of the corresponding service. These unit costs will be obtained from the Belgian&#xD;
      Reimbursement scheme using standard fees for regularly insured patients and other publicly&#xD;
      available sources. Time spent in caregiving will be calculated at baseline and after six&#xD;
      months using the recall method for which also a part of the RUD instrument will be utilized.&#xD;
      Next, the amount of time spent in caregiving will be monetized using the opportunity cost&#xD;
      method which estimates the value of lost informal caregiver benefits due to spending time on&#xD;
      providing informal care. For informal caregivers not active on the labor market wage rates of&#xD;
      similar people will be imputed. Basically, productivity loss should be included but given the&#xD;
      average high age of informal caregivers it can be expected that productivity loss will have a&#xD;
      negligible impact on costs because most of them are retired. Nevertheless, based on the&#xD;
      results of mean age and employment status of the included caregivers the researchers will&#xD;
      decide to whether or not include productivity loss as a cost. The costs of the intervention&#xD;
      will be obtained from the current unit cost per day of Baluchonnage and multiplied by the&#xD;
      amount of days the in-home respite care was delivered. Currently the daily cost of&#xD;
      Baluchonnage is set at 350â¬/day covered by charity and 65â¬/day direct cost for the patient.&#xD;
      Additional costs above the fixed daily tariff for Baluchonnage will also be included such as:&#xD;
      travel expenses during the respite period and having a pet (5â¬ extra per day). Additionally,&#xD;
      willingness to pay for one day of in-home respite care by Baluchon will be obtained from both&#xD;
      study groups using the contingent valuation method (CVM). This method can be defined as a&#xD;
      stated preference method for eliciting a monetary value to a health care program. In this&#xD;
      trial a closed response format will be used. Finally, for use in the decision analytic model,&#xD;
      costs of nursing home placement will be derived from the average daily cost for staying in a&#xD;
      nursing home in Belgium at the time of completing secondary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be represented to draw a clear profile of the characteristics of&#xD;
      study participants. Therefore the mean, percentages and the standard deviations of all&#xD;
      continuous variables will be displayed. To determine possible baseline differences between&#xD;
      the groups, mean values of baseline characteristics will be compared using independent sample&#xD;
      t-tests for continuous variables if normally distributed or by performing Pearson's&#xD;
      chi-square test for categorical variables. To help control for bias and confounding&#xD;
      statistical techniques such as propensity score matching will be used. Propensity score&#xD;
      matching can be seen as a tool to simulate a RCT setting. In this way the observed effect can&#xD;
      be considered an unbiased estimate of the real effect. To investigate possible effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on the primary and secondary outcomes, analysis of variance will be conducted if&#xD;
      the outcome variables are normally distributed. A P-value of 0.05 will be considered as&#xD;
      significant. All analyses will be based on intention to treat also taking drop-outs into&#xD;
      account and avoiding overestimation of respite care effects. When the intervention is&#xD;
      effective a cost-effectiveness analysis in a separate economic evaluation plan will be&#xD;
      performed. Also ICERs (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio) will be calculated for the mean&#xD;
      and upper and lower confidence levels of the costs and consequences. To explore uncertainty&#xD;
      one-way-sensitivity analysis will be conducted around the ICER and illustrated in a Tornado&#xD;
      diagram. Additionally, on all input variables a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, also&#xD;
      called Monte Carlo analysis, will be conducted to test robustness of the model. These results&#xD;
      will also be illustrated. Finally, the results and the willingness to pay threshold of the&#xD;
      Belgian Health Care System will be presented in a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. To&#xD;
      compare time to nursing home placement of persons who use respite care to those who don't,&#xD;
      the researchers will use Kaplan-Meier survival curves to illustrate association between the&#xD;
      comparison groups. By additionally conducting a log-rank test statistical difference between&#xD;
      the groups in time to placement can be found.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The study participants are caregiver/care-recipient dyads.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The caregivers must be informal, meaning that they must not be professional healthcare&#xD;
             workers in this caregiving role.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The caregivers have to identify themselves as the main person responsible for the&#xD;
             informal care (primary caregiver).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Also, the caregivers must speak Dutch or French with some fluency and be able to read&#xD;
