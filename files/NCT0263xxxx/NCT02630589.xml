      Tinnitus is the perception of sound or noise in the absence of an external physical source.&#xD;
      It is a highly prevalent condition and for a high percentage of patients, there is no&#xD;
      satisfying treatment modality. For some people, tinnitus has a very severe impact on quality&#xD;
      of life, leading to incapacity for work and sometimes even suicidality. The auditory&#xD;
      brainstem implant (ABI) is an implant indicated for the restoration of hearing in patients&#xD;
      with an hypo-, or aplasia of the cochlear nerve or with dysfunction of the nerve caused by&#xD;
      tumor growth in neurofibromatosis type II. It has been shown that the standard intended&#xD;
      effect of an ABI has reduction of tinnitus as a welcome side effect in about 66% of the&#xD;
      cases. This is in analogy with the promising effect of a cochlear implant (CI) as a treatment&#xD;
      for patients with unilateral tinnitus. In this study, the effect of an ABI on severely&#xD;
      invalidating, unilateral, intractable tinnitus will be investigated. The ABI may have an&#xD;
      advantage over the CI as tinnitus treatment, because CI-implantation leads to destruction of&#xD;
      inner ear structures, leading to profound deafness, while an ABI is presumed to not damage&#xD;
      anatomical structures. This is the first study to implant an ABI for the primary aim of&#xD;
      tinnitus reduction in an intervention pilot study. In total 10 patients with unilateral,&#xD;
      intractable tinnitus and severe hearing loss in the ipsilateral ear, will be implanted with&#xD;
      the ABI.&#xD;

      Rationale: Tinnitus is the perception of sound or noise in the absence of an external&#xD;
      physical source. It is a highly prevalent condition and for a high percentage of patients,&#xD;
      there is no satisfying treatment modality. For some people, tinnitus has a very severe impact&#xD;
      on quality of life, leading to incapacity for work and sometimes even suicidality. The&#xD;
      auditory brainstem implant (ABI) is an implant indicated for the restoration of hearing in&#xD;
      patients with an hypo-, or aplasia of the cochlear nerve or with dysfunction of the nerve&#xD;
      caused by tumor growth in neurofibromatosis type II. It has been shown that the standard&#xD;
      intended effect of an ABI has reduction of tinnitus as a welcome side effect in about 66% of&#xD;
      the cases. This is in analogy with the promising effect of a cochlear implant (CI) as a&#xD;
      treatment for patients with unilateral tinnitus. In this study, the effect of an ABI on&#xD;
      severely invalidating, unilateral, intractable tinnitus will be investigated. The ABI may&#xD;
      have an advantage over the CI as tinnitus treatment, because CI-implantation leads to&#xD;
      destruction of inner ear structures, leading to profound deafness, while an ABI is presumed&#xD;
      to not damage anatomical structures. This is the first study to implant an ABI for the&#xD;
      primary aim of tinnitus reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. To evaluate the efficacy of an ABI for the suppression of unilateral, intractable&#xD;
      tinnitus and to establish the safety of the ABI for this new indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. This is a single center, non-randomized, prospective cohort, intervention pilot&#xD;
      study. There is no control group. In this study, 10 patients will be implanted with an ABI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population. Adult patients with invalidating, unilateral, intractable tinnitus and&#xD;
      ipsilateral severe hearing loss are included in this study. All study participants have no&#xD;
      significant comorbidity and are mentally competent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. All study participants receive an ABI, which will be neurosurgically implanted.&#xD;
      The ABI will be switched on 6 weeks after implantation. The surgery and post-surgery&#xD;
      follow-up and switch-on procedures are consistent with the intended use of the ABI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters. The primary outcome is change in the Tinnitus Functioning Index (TFI).&#xD;
      The endpoint is set at 1 year after implantation. Follow up will take place until 5 years&#xD;
      after implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness. The implantation, activation and fitting of the ABI will be performed exactly as&#xD;
      described in the existing protocols for intended use, however in this study, the ABI is&#xD;
      placed for another indication. Implantation of the ABI requires hospital admission for&#xD;
      estimated 4 days. After dismissal, patients visit the outpatient clinic at least 8 times in&#xD;
      the first year, depending on the amount of fitting session necessary. Implantation of the ABI&#xD;
      is an invasive procedure, which potentially can cause severe complications (meningitis 3,8%,&#xD;
      transient hydrocephalus 1,3%, cerebellar contusion 1,2%). Other complication that may occur&#xD;
      are infection, bleeding, hearing loss and other cranial nerve dysfunctions. By an extensive&#xD;
      training program for the neurosurgeon and presence of the experienced surgeon during the&#xD;
      first surgical procedures, the investigators feel that neurosurgical risks and risk of device&#xD;
      failure due to inadequate implantation can be limited. In this pilot study, the effects on&#xD;
      hearing and tinnitus are still uncertain, however based on the results published in&#xD;
      literature the investigators are confident that the effects on both will be positive.&#xD;
      Nonauditory side-effects and disappointing results on hearing and/or tinnitus can be well&#xD;
      managed by altering stimulation strategy or if necessary, by turning off the device. Tinnitus&#xD;
      can be severely invalidating with a large impact on quality of life and the ABI is promising&#xD;
      in reducing tinnitus in these patients. This study imposes a significant risk on the study&#xD;
      participants. However, the investigators feel that the risks outweighs the potential to&#xD;
      ameliorate severely debilitating tinnitus.&#xD;

    <description>Unit of measure: items on a scale.&#xD;
The VAS (Visual analog scale) is a subjective measurement scale. Registration of VAS-scores gives the ability to quickly measure the aspects of the tinnitus complaints. It consists of a 100mm-horizontal line with 2 endpoints labeled as 0 and 10. The patient states on a scale from 0-10 how much patient is bothered by the complaint. The VAS-tinnitus annoyance (VAS-TA) was labeled as 0 (not annoyed by tinnitus) and 10 (worst possible annoyed by tinnitus). The VAS-tinnitus loudness (VAS-TL) was labeled as 0 (no tinnitus) and 100 (loudest tinnitus ever).(31). Also, the VAS-scores are measured at every follow up moment in 'on' and 'off' mode of the ABI (which will be blinded for the patient), with estimated 10 minutes between the measurements.</description>

The HADS (hospital anxiety and depression scale) is validated in Dutch consists of 14 items, each using a Likert scale (0-3), with subscales for anxiety (seven items) and depression (seven items).(30) The suggested cut-off score (with ranges of 0-21 for each subscale) for screening for possible cases is 8, and for probable cases of anxiety and depression 11. Time to complete the HADS is approximately 10-15.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unilateral tinnitus&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &lt;5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of blood coagulation pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ASA &gt;II&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anatomic abnormalities that would prevent appropriate placement of the stimulator&#xD;
             housing in the bone of the skull&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anatomical abnormalities or surgical complications that might prevent placement of the&#xD;
