  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary angiography (CAG) and possible angioplasty (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention =&#xD;
      PCI) can be performed by access from the groin (a. femoralis), the wrist (a. radialis) or the&#xD;
      elbow (a. brachialis). It is well established that there is less risk of bleeding&#xD;
      complications when using a radial access. The smaller diameters of the vessels in the&#xD;
      forearm, however, may result in increased risk of pain during CAG/PCI via a. radialis. This&#xD;
      is associated with vascular spasm (spasm tendency). Ultimately this means that one may have&#xD;
      to convert to access via a. femoralis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform a CAG/PCI, a tube (a so-called sheath) has to be inserted in a. radialis. It is&#xD;
      unclear whether the design of the sheaths can reduce the spasm tendency, thus reducing pain.&#xD;
      Terumo has recently introduced a new kind of sheath, so-called Terumo Glide Slender Heath&#xD;
      Coated (hereafter referred to as &quot;Slender sheath&quot;). This sheath is partly coated, partly made&#xD;
      of a thinner material. &quot;Slender sheath&quot; thus has an outer diameter smaller than that of the&#xD;
      sheath from traditional use (Terumo Radio Focus sheath, hereafter referred to as &quot;Standard&#xD;
      sheath&quot;), although the inner diameter (lumen) is the same in the two sheaths. In turn, the&#xD;
      &quot;Slender sheath&quot; is more fragile and far more expensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate whether use of slender sheath compared with&#xD;
      standard sheath is Associated with less pain and fewer complications following CAG/PCI.&#xD;

      Study design: Randomized study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposes: to investigate whether the use of &quot;Slender sheath&quot; is associated with less pain&#xD;
      compared to use of &quot;Standard Sheath&quot; and less complications corresponding at the access site.&#xD;
      Specific hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use of &quot;Slender sheath&quot; results in less pain related to CAG/PCI compared to use of&#xD;
           &quot;Standard sheath&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use of &quot;Slender sheath&quot; is associated with fewer conversions to femoral access compared&#xD;
           to use of &quot;Standard sheath&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use of &quot;Slender sheath&quot; is associated with less use of analgesic during the procedure&#xD;
           compared to use of &quot;Standard sheath&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Use of &quot;Slender sheath&quot; is associated with fewer cases of occlusion of a. radialis at&#xD;
           discharge and post-examination compared to use of &quot;Standard sheath&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Schedule The trial will run from December 2015 until a total number of 1000 patients are&#xD;
      included. It is expected that the data collection and publication of the results will be&#xD;
      completed within a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain related to the application of the sheath (Visual Analog Scale = VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Maximal pain during CAG/PCI (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Frequency of conversions to femoral access&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Use of analgesics (cumulative amount of mg Fentanyl given)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Use of sedatives (cumulative amount of mg Midazolam given)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Use of Verapamil (cumulative amount of mg given, used to reduce spasms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Number of catheters used&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Number of sheaths used (femoral and radial)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Occlusion of a. radialis at the time of discharge estimated by ultrasound of the artery&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Occlusion of a. radialis after a month (Assumes that all patients with open vessels at&#xD;
           discharge also have open vessels after a month. Only patients with occluded vessels at&#xD;
           discharge will be offered a new ultrasound scan)&#xD;
