      This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      induction treatment consisting of atezolizumab in combination with obinutuzumab plus&#xD;
      lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL), followed by&#xD;
      maintenance treatment with atezolizumab plus obinutzumab plus lenalidomide in patients who&#xD;
      achieve a complete response (CR), a partial response (PR), or stable disease at end of&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 59 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

    <description>Does limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any one of the following events occurring during Cycle 2 of treatment and assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment: - Adverse event of any grade that leads to a delay of more than 14 days at the start of the next treatment cycle; - Hematologic adverse events (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia); - Non-hematologic adverse event, except IRRs, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>All participants received daily low-dose aspirin (81-100 mg) during lenalidomide treatment and until 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide. Participants who are unable to tolerate aspirin, who have a history of thromboembolism (TE), and who are at high risk of TE, received warfarin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH).</pre_assignment_details>
