  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supported self-management (SM) is one of the key recommendations in management of chronic low&#xD;
      back pain (CLBP). SM programmes for patients with CLBP have failed to show clinically&#xD;
      meaningful improvement in pain and disability markers, which potentially reflect the lack of&#xD;
      treatment matching of SM programmes. Patient selection for a SM programme for patients with&#xD;
      CLBP is particularly difficult due to lack of extensive research on what predicts SM and its&#xD;
      change. The overarching purpose of this study is to identify predictors of SM and its change&#xD;
      over time in patients with CLBP. This study is a prospective non-experimental longitudinal&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      Materials and methods: Patients will be recruited at baseline from the physiotherapy&#xD;
      outpatient clinics. Three different methods have been planned to identify suitable patients&#xD;
      in this study: from the outpatient clinics, through advertisements and therapist referrals to&#xD;
      the study. All willing participants will be screened against the study selection criteria.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be provided with a pre-approved information sheet and verbal&#xD;
      explanation about the study before obtaining written consent. The consenting patients will be&#xD;
      requested to fill in the baseline questionnaire. The patients will be requested to fill the&#xD;
      follow up questionnaire after six months from their baseline data collection via an online,&#xD;
      telephone or paper-based questionnaire depending on their preference. Data required for the&#xD;
      necessary agreement between paper-based and online or telephone survey, will be collected&#xD;
      from up to 60 participants within two weeks from their baseline data collection. All patients&#xD;
      will receive and continue their normal treatment as recommended by their primary care team. A&#xD;
      participant may be withdrawn by the investigators, involved in major trauma or undergoes&#xD;
      surgery, or a female participant becomes pregnant during the course of the study. Sample size&#xD;
      was estimated using G*Power (version 3.1.5). The statistical analyses will be performed using&#xD;
      a statistical software (IBM SPSS 22) with statistical significance set at p&lt;0.05 for the&#xD;
      entire analysis, unless mentioned. Descriptive statistics, interclass correlation&#xD;
      coefficients, Bland-Altman limits of agreement plots, significance testing, correlations and&#xD;
      regression analyses will be employed.&#xD;
