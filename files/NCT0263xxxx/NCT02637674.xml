      Uterus transplantation may enable women with uterine factor infertility to become pregnant&#xD;
      and give birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will explore the feasibility of a uterine transplant and eight subjects will&#xD;
      undergo deceased donor uterine transplantation at CHU de Limoges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There phases involved in this study: Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Screening, Medical&#xD;
      Evaluation, IVF, Transplantation, Embryo Transfer, Pregnancy/Delivery and Follow up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 1 in 500 women of reproductive age have congenital or acquired uterine&#xD;
      factor infertility (UFI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The solution for such patients who wish to have a child is either to adopt or use a&#xD;
      surrogate. The latter is illegal in France .Uterine transplantation (UT) could be a&#xD;
      beneficial medical alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 13 years, about 30 experimental studies have been conducted on rodents,&#xD;
      rabbits, pigs, sheeps and monkeys. They have shown TU to be feasible, with a number of births&#xD;
      achieved after uterus auto-transplantation, syngeneic transplantation and&#xD;
      allotransplantation. However, animal experiments are not able to provide a definitive answer&#xD;
      to the question of the feasibility of UT in women due to the specific characteristics of each&#xD;
      species and a lower degree of control of immunosuppression and in vitro fertilisation&#xD;
      techniques in animals. Thus, the information from animal experiments and the present&#xD;
      knowledge on immunosuppression in women, based on experiments in other solid organ&#xD;
      transplantation, explain the willingness to take the step of undergoing clinical UT. The&#xD;
      recent human data and the first births after UT obtained by a Swedish team are reassuring and&#xD;
      confirmed the feasibility of the procedure. The data gathered over 50 years of pregnancies in&#xD;
      patients who have received kidney, liver or heart transplants is reassuring, with over 20,000&#xD;
      births recorded and recommendations for the start of the pregnancy, patient follow-up and&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs (ISD) handling are currently relatively well-established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As compared to other solid organ transplantations, UT is particular in being temporary (the&#xD;
      graft will be removed once the child is born or in case of safety issue) and the period of&#xD;
      exposure to immunosuppressants is thus reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team has recognised experience in the field of female fertility preservation and ovarian&#xD;
      grafting. Work begun in animals at the end of the 1990s led to the first pregnancies in&#xD;
      France after an ovarian autograft in 2010. With regard to uterus grafting, the investigators&#xD;
      have published work on uterine allotransplantation involving ewes and the evaluation of the&#xD;
      graft by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinically, the investigator began by working on&#xD;
      cadavers and conducted a study in 2012-2013, which was supported by the French Biomedical&#xD;
      Agency (Agence de la biomédecine), on the feasibility of uterus retrieving as part of a&#xD;
      multi-organ retrieval (MOR) procedure. In this preliminary clinical study, the investigators&#xD;
      were able to show that the technique of uterus retrieval in brain-dead donors can be&#xD;
      reproduced. Acceptance of the retrieval by the relatives of the brain-dead patient was good&#xD;
      (no refusal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present protocol, the investigators propose a pilot study of UT in women with grafts&#xD;
      from brain-dead female donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, UT can be envisaged with grafts from either living or deceased donors. In Turkey,&#xD;
      a UT with a brain-dead donor, performed in 2011, was the first to achieve a pregnancy. This&#xD;
      pregnancy was, unfortunately, non-progressive. In Sweden, the team of Prof. Brannström&#xD;
      performed nine UTs in 2012 and 2013 with living donors. One donor suffered a utero-vaginal&#xD;
      fistula, thus confirming the potential surgical risk of such a procedure for living donors.&#xD;
      Conversely, for the recipients, the success rate of UT after six months was 78% (seven&#xD;
      successful transplantations, with a menstrual period occurring in the first six months, out&#xD;
      of the nine transplantations performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike the Swedish team, the investigators are planning to use grafts from brain-dead donors&#xD;
      in order to avoid the potential surgical risks with alive donors. In addition, according to&#xD;
      the French Biomedical Agency, there are around 220 brain-dead female donors below 50 years&#xD;
      each year in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recipients will be selected according to the inclusion criteria. They will be asked to&#xD;
      promise to live close to Limoges University Hospital during the 3 months post uterus&#xD;
      transplantation. Inclusion will be confirmed if none of the primary, secondary or tertiary&#xD;
      exclusion criteria is present and if at least 10 embryos are obtained via IVF conducted at&#xD;
      Limoges University Hospital. The patients will then be registered on a transplant waiting&#xD;
      list. Since the aim of the project is to perform eight UTs, any patient who has signed the&#xD;
      consent form can be replaced if she is secondarily excluded or wishes to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uterine retrievals will be performed by the surgical team of Limoges University Hospital&#xD;
      in four retrieval centres in the central-western part of France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine transplantation will be performed in Limoges University Hospital by the vascular and&#xD;
      gynaecological surgery teams. Patients will then be monitored jointly by the gynaecology,&#xD;
      renal transplantation and psychiatric teams. The immunosuppressive treatment will include an&#xD;
      induction (anti-CD25 antibodies), tacrolimus, antimetabolites (mycophenolate mofetil followed&#xD;
      by azathioprine before and during pregnancy) and an initial corticotherapy. The graft will be&#xD;
      monitored by imaging (MRI, ultrasound), biopsy of the cervix and therapeutic drug monitoring.&#xD;
      Rejection will be determined according to the criteria of Johannesson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success of transplantation will be confirmed by the occurrence of a menstrual period&#xD;
      during the first year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In successful cases, embryo transfers will begin on the second year of transplantation. In&#xD;
      the absence of a successful pregnancy, the transfer attempts will continue each month until&#xD;
      there are no available embryos left, and for a maximum period of 18 months. The embryos that&#xD;
      have not been used will be managed in accordance with the French law on bioethics. The&#xD;
      patient will receive close multidisciplinary follow-up throughout the pregnancy. The delivery&#xD;
      will be done by caesarean section. The graft will be explanted immediately following the&#xD;
      caesarean when possible or 2 months post partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the UT fails (no menstrual period in one year), the graft will be explanted. The graft&#xD;
      will also be explanted in the following situations: uterine necrosis, corticoresistant&#xD;
      rejection, serious adverse effects attributable to immunosuppressive drugs, severe infectious&#xD;
      complications, haemorrhagic complications, the absence of a progressive pregnancy after a&#xD;
      maximum period of 18 months of embryo transfer attempts, separation of the couple.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will receive follow-up from a paediatrician in accordance with common practice.&#xD;
      All live attenuated vaccines will be contraindicated in the first six months following birth.&#xD;
