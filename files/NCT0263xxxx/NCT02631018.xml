  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of a physical activity-enhanced behavioral&#xD;
      weight loss intervention, compared to a standard behavioral weight loss intervention in&#xD;
      African American women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A disparity exists in the prevalence of overweight and obesity between non-Hispanic white&#xD;
      (NHW) and African American (AA) women. More AA women (78.2%) are overweight or obese compared&#xD;
      to NHW (61.2%). Obesity increases the risk of developing numerous chronic diseases, including&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. Among AA&#xD;
      women, there is a higher prevalence, and almost double the risk, of developing T2DM compared&#xD;
      to NHW. African Americans also have higher rates of complications and mortality from T2DM,&#xD;
      and are more at risk for hypertension compared to NHW. Obesity is a costly epidemic.&#xD;
      Fortunately, weight is a modifiable risk factor for reducing or preventing obesity and&#xD;
      related diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions to reduce overweight and obesity through lifestyle change have been less&#xD;
      effective for AA women compared to NHW women. African American women tend to lose less weight&#xD;
      in standard behavioral weight loss interventions. A potential reason for smaller weight loss&#xD;
      is that compared to NHW women, AA women have been shown to engage in less physical activity&#xD;
      (PA) during these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sisters in Health study will test the efficacy of a 6-month randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      in overweight and obese African American women. Women will be recruited to participate in&#xD;
      this study comparing a standard behavioral weight loss intervention (BWI) to a physical&#xD;
      activity enhanced BWI (BWI-PA) for 6 months. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if AA women randomized to the BWI-PA will experience greater weight loss and PA&#xD;
      compared to women receiving the BWI. Women in both groups will receive 18 face-to-face&#xD;
      sessions on a tapered basis (weekly to biweekly). Face-to-face sessions will provide women&#xD;
      with the knowledge, behavioral skills and strategies for weight loss.&#xD;
