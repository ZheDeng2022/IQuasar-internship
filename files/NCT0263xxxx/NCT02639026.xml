      The main purpose of this study is to determine how best to combine hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy, MEDI4736, and tremelimumab and to determine how safe and tolerable&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiotherapy, MEDI4736, and tremelimumab are when given together in subjects&#xD;
      with metastatic, melanoma, non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, and pancreatic&#xD;

             childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception (as&#xD;
             outlined above) from Day 1 through 90 days after receipt of the final dose of MEDI4736&#xD;
             and tremelimumab. In addition, they must refrain from sperm donation for 90 days after&#xD;
             the final dose of investigational product.&#xD;
