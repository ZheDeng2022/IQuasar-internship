      The Purpose of this study is to assess the correlation between the inflammatory periodontal&#xD;
      status and the medical treatment status in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome(PCOS) women with&#xD;
      systemic inflammation and to evaluate the effect of non-surgical periodontal therapy in the&#xD;
      form of scaling and root planing along with medical treatment on the level of serological&#xD;
      marker of inflammation (High sensitivity-C Reactive Protein) and insulin resistance in PCOS&#xD;
      women with chronic periodontitis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome(PCOS) is a genetically complex endocrine disorder of uncertain&#xD;
      etiology and a common cause of hyperandrogenism, anovulatory infertility, menstrual&#xD;
      dysfunction, hirsutism, alopecia and acne. It was first reported by Stein and Leventhal in&#xD;
      1935. It affects 6-8% of women of reproductive age. Accordingly PCOS might be viewed as a&#xD;
      gender specific form of metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Androgen Excess Society(AES) /2006 criteria PCOS was defined by the presence of&#xD;
      hyperandrogenism (clinical and/or biochemical),Oligo or anovulation, Polycystic ovarian&#xD;
      morphology(PCOM)- at least one ovary with 1)12 or more follicles (2-9 mm in diameter) or 2)&#xD;
      Ovarian volume &gt;10 ml. Patients with PCOS are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors that is diabetes, insulin resistance, visceral obesity and a state of low grade&#xD;
      inflammation.Therefore, PCOS may represent a model for studying the complex interaction among&#xD;
      these Cardiovascular risk factors,especially chronic inflammation and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visceral obesity,insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are prevalent co-morbidities of PCOS&#xD;
      which promotes androgen excess.Insulin resistance in PCOS is due to a post-receptor defect in&#xD;
      insulin receptor mediated cells which leads to induce a decrease in glucose transporters.&#xD;
      Therefore, reduction of insulin secretion and/or improvement of its action at target tissues&#xD;
      offer the possibility of improving the effects of androgen excess by correction of the&#xD;
      reproductive dysfunction and preventing metabolic derangements from becoming entrenched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose many insulin-sensitizing agents like metformin have been tried as a&#xD;
      treatment modality of metabolic as well as reproductive dysfunction in PCOS.Myo-inositol (MI)&#xD;
      is a naturally occurring substance produced in the human body that belongs to the vitamin B&#xD;
      complex group.PCOS has been linked to a deficiency in myo-inositol. MI can be synthesized by&#xD;
      the body from food, but when the investigators are already deficient, the lack of MI can&#xD;
      impact the ability of the body to be sensitive to insulin. MI plays an important role as the&#xD;
      structural basis for a number of secondary messengers including synthesis of&#xD;
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), a key messenger to improve insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      and thereby reducing insulin resistance Supplying extra MI appears to temporarily correct the&#xD;
      impaired insulin pathways and reduce the signs and symptoms of insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal diseases, including gingivitis are common chronic infectious diseases&#xD;
      characterized by a gingival inflammatory response against predominantly pathogenic&#xD;
      microorganisms that colonize the subgingival area and cause local and systemic elevations of&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-6 resulting in&#xD;
      loss of connective tissue attachment, alveolar bone resorption which can result in tooth&#xD;
      loss. It is well established that patients suffering from periodontitis present with a low&#xD;
      grade systemic inflammatory state when compared with healthy subjects.Increased&#xD;
      concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers in both gingival tissues and serum such as&#xD;
      C-reactive protein and interleukin have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal disease has been implicated as risk factor in the onset and development of&#xD;
      various cardiovascular diseases like diabetes mellitus cerebrovascular and coronary artery&#xD;
      diseases.9,10,13 Chronic stimulation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines associated&#xD;
      with periodontal infection contribute to the insulin resistance in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin resistance syndromes such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and PCOS have been linked to&#xD;
      slightly elevated serum C-reactive protein. As already being discussed,Periodontitis has also&#xD;
      been linked to elevated CRP levels, therefore it is postulated that CRP might be a possible&#xD;
      mediator of the association between periodontitis and systemic diseases1 Because of the fact&#xD;
      that both periodontal disease and metabolic syndrome are associated with systemic&#xD;
      inflammation and insulin resistance,these two disorders may be linked through a common&#xD;
      pathophysiologic pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier there have been many cross-sectional studies describing a possible relationship&#xD;
      between PCOS and periodontitis and the impact of PCOS on gingival inflammation However, they&#xD;
      have not taken into account the medical treatment status, duration or the type of treatment&#xD;
      modality employed for the medical treatment of the syndrome. They also have not evaluated the&#xD;
      effect of periodontal therapy on the periodontium, systemic inflammation and insulin&#xD;
      resistance in PCOS women suffering with inflammatory periodontal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore through this study, the investigators aim to assess the correlation between the&#xD;
      inflammatory periodontal status and the medical treatment status in PCOS patients with&#xD;
      systemic inflammation and to evaluate the effect of non surgical periodontal therapy along&#xD;
      with medical treatment on the level of serological marker of inflammation(High&#xD;
      sensitivity-CRP) and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
