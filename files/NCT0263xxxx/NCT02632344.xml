      This research study is evaluating an immune modulatory agent as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      patients with Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP) with significant disease involving&#xD;
      the larynx, trachea, and/or lungs. The investigators will be using Pembrolizumab as the&#xD;
      treating agent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not&#xD;
      approved Pembrolizumab for your specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody. Pembrolizumab is being studied in several&#xD;
      other clinical trials to see if it has an effect in helping the immune system to recognize&#xD;
      and eliminate abnormal cells in the body. The antibody blocks a receptor expressed on immune&#xD;
      cells, called T cells, and by blocking this receptor it has the potential to activate the T&#xD;
      cells to kill abnormal cells, such as virally infected cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking at whether Pembrolizumab can restore&#xD;
      the natural ability of the immune system to recognize and eliminate Human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV)-infected cells from the body.&#xD;
