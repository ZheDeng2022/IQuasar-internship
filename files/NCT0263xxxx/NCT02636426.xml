  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib is an oral anticancer drug and inhibits multiple protein kinases important for&#xD;
      tumor growth and metastases, including VEGFR, PDGFR, and RAF kinases. In daily clinical&#xD;
      practice it is currently used at a dose of 400 mg twice daily in a continuous schedule. In&#xD;
      this phase I study patients will be treated with a new dosing schedule of sorafenib: i.e. a&#xD;
      high-dose, pulsatile schedule. The tolerability and safety of this new schedule is examined&#xD;
      in exposure escalation cohorts based on a target plasma AUC0-12h (area under the curve).&#xD;
      Exposure escalation cohorts are used instead of conventional dose escalation cohorts because&#xD;
      the effect of a drug is dependent of its AUC levels and large differences in plasma sorafenib&#xD;
      AUC0-12h have previously been shown between patients treated at the same dose level. Using&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic monitoring, the sorafenib dose will be adjusted to a target plasma AUC0-12h.&#xD;
      The escalation cohorts consist of 3-6 patients per exposure level starting with a target&#xD;
      plasma sorafenib AUC0-12h level of 25-50 mg/L/h. After the determination of the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated AUC0-12h, 10 additional patients will be entered into an expansion cohort. In the&#xD;
      expansion cohort the patients will be treated with a weekly pulse of sorafenib at the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated AUC0-12h for further assessment of safety and preliminary exploration of efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Preclinical research showed improved efficacy of sorafenib when given in a&#xD;
      high-dose, pulsatile schedule compared with conventional (lower dose) continuous scheduling&#xD;
      as a result of higher peak concentrations in the tumor. In this phase I study patients will&#xD;
      be treated with high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib in exposure escalation cohorts. Exposure&#xD;
      escalations cohorts are based on a target plasma AUC0-12h (area under the curve) and are used&#xD;
      instead of conventional dose escalation cohorts because the effect of a drug is dependent of&#xD;
      its AUC levels and large differences in plasma sorafenib AUC0-12h have previously been shown&#xD;
      between patients treated at the same dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated plasma AUC0-12h of high-dose sorafenib administered&#xD;
           in a weekly, pulsatile schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic behaviour of sorafenib and its major active metabolite&#xD;
           pyridine N-oxide when administered in a weekly, pulsatile schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine a recommended phase II plasma AUC0-12h of high-dose sorafenib in a weekly&#xD;
           pulsatile schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preliminary assessment of the efficacy of high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib administered at&#xD;
           the maximum tolerated plasma AUC0-12h.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine skin and intratumoral concentrations of sorafenib and their correlation&#xD;
           with plasma and whole blood concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To select 1-2 optimal time points from the AUC0-12h data to determine sorafenib exposure&#xD;
           using a finger puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A single center, open-label, phase I study of high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib&#xD;
      administered in exposure escalation cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease for whom no&#xD;
      standard therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Patients will be treated in exposure escalation cohorts with high-dose sorafenib&#xD;
      administered in a weekly pulsatile schedule. Using pharmacokinetic monitoring, the sorafenib&#xD;
      dose will be adjusted to a target plasma AUC0-12h. The escalation cohorts consist of 3-6&#xD;
      patients per exposure level starting with a target plasma sorafenib AUC0-12h level of 25-50&#xD;
      mg/L/h. After the determination of the maximum tolerated AUC0-12h, 10 additional patients&#xD;
      will be entered into an expansion cohort. In the expansion cohort the patients will be&#xD;
      treated with a weekly pulse of sorafenib at the maximum tolerated AUC0-12h for further&#xD;
      assessment of safety and preliminary exploration of efficacy.&#xD;

             measures (e.g., cervical cap, condom, or diaphragm) during the course of the trial.&#xD;
             Oral birth control methods alone will not be considered adequate on this study,&#xD;
             because of the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between study drug and oral&#xD;
             contraceptives. Concomitant use of oral and barrier contraceptives is advised.&#xD;
             Contraception is necessary for at least 6 months after receiving the study protein&#xD;
             kinase inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Concomitant medication with drugs having proarrhythmic potential (such as sotalol,&#xD;
             haloperidol, flecainide) is not permitted during the study.&#xD;
