      In order to better understand how commonly used dietary interventions for obesity influence&#xD;
      brain activity and in turn people's ability to adhere to their healthy nutrition plan, the&#xD;
      investigators need to study how people's brains react to food cues while undergoing such&#xD;
      interventions. Our study will add to our understanding of neural (brain) regulation of&#xD;
      hedonic and homeostatic mechanisms (i.e. pleasure and hunger) in influencing adherence to&#xD;
      calorie-reduced eating plans.&#xD;

      Recruitment of subjects: Advertisements for the recruitment of participants will be posted on&#xD;
      social media and notice boards within the Texas Tech University (TTU) including the web-based&#xD;
      notice boards (including but not limited to Tech Announce, Craig's List). Announcements will&#xD;
      also be made using the same materials targeting the local community through paid&#xD;
      advertisement in local print and online media outlets (e.g. newspapers) and through flyers&#xD;
      distributed within area medical clinics and fitness centers. Thirty-two obese (BMI &gt; 30) male&#xD;
      and female subjects will be enrolled with the intended completion of at least 30 (15 per&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Screening (Telephone): Individuals who express an interest in participating will be&#xD;
      contacted by a graduate or undergraduate research assistant who will administer a structured&#xD;
      telephone interview to: 1) provide information related to the requirements of the study,&#xD;
      along with potential risks and benefits 2) Screen for eligibility based on specific inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria. All potential subjects will be informed that their responses will&#xD;
      remain confidential and that taking part in the screening interview in no way obligates them&#xD;
      to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants who meet participation criteria as assessed via the telephone&#xD;
      prescreening process will be contacted by the study team via email/phone within 48 hours&#xD;
      following the interview to inform of eligibility (or ineligibility) and to schedule an&#xD;
      initial, in person assessment (Visit 1) if deemed eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Screening and Consent): This in-person screening visit will include the following:&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with the Behavioral Medicine and Translational Research (BMTR)&#xD;
      Health &amp; Weight History Form to complete upon arrival at the clinic. Weight, height, BMI and&#xD;
      body fat percentage via bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA) using the TANITA BC-418&#xD;
      segmental body composition analyzer (TANITA Corporation of America Inc., IL, USA) and body&#xD;
      composition analysis unit; measured blood pressure (BP) via Omron Digital BP Monitor&#xD;
      HEM-907XL (Omron Healthcare Inc., IL, USA) will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If inclusion/exclusion criteria are met; informed consent will be obtained and the&#xD;
      participant will be considered 'enrolled' in the study at that time. Participants will be&#xD;
      scheduled for 2 scanning visits (visits 2 and 5) and the 2 check in visits (visits 3 and 4)&#xD;
      at this time and instructed on the procedures for these subsequent visits. At completion of&#xD;
      Visit 1 the participants will be told to make no deviation from their standard diet until&#xD;
      after their initial fMRI scan visit (visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special Scheduling Considerations: The phase of the menstrual cycle may have an effect on&#xD;
      cravings. The first scanning session of pre-menopausal female participants will be scheduled&#xD;
      in the second half of the follicular phase of a menstrual cycle (i.e. 10th - 14th day of a&#xD;
      menstrual cycle). Thus, the second scanning session, which will be performed 3 weeks after&#xD;
      the first session, will be performed in the first half of the follicular phase (approximately&#xD;
      between the 3rd and 7th days) of the next menstrual cycle. This will ensure that both&#xD;
      scanning sessions will be performed within the follicular phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (Pre-intervention fMRI Scan):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants will be requested to refrain from taking any items of food or beverages&#xD;
           (except water) for 8 hours minimum prior to the scanner visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The participants will also be advised to refrain from i) tobacco use in any form ii) the&#xD;
           intake of alcohol or caffeine in any form within the 24 hours prior to the scanning&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The participants will be asked to complete the following paper &amp; pencil measures in an&#xD;
           adjacent room prior to entering the fMRI scanner: i) Food Craving Inventory; ii) Power&#xD;
           of Food Scale; iii) Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire; iv) Yale Food Addiction Scale; v)&#xD;
           Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) on the dimensions of hunger, satiety, thirst, fullness and&#xD;
           emptiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The duration of each scan will be 45-60 minutes (including the time spent on placing&#xD;
           each participant in the scanner).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After the scanning is complete, each participant will be taken to an adjacent room and&#xD;
           VAS will be administered again immediately after the scan (total duration 30 minutes)&#xD;
           according to the procedures outlined in (c) above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The participants will then be shown on a laptop computer, a random subset of 60 images&#xD;
           from the set to which the participants were exposed to, during the fMRI scanning&#xD;
           paradigm, randomly mixed with 60 other images to which the participants were not exposed&#xD;
           with a task of recognizing the images that were presented in the scanning paradigm&#xD;
           (duration 15-20 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI scanning paradigm: An event-related design will be used for all stimulus presentations.&#xD;
      120 images of two categories (food items and objects) will be displayed on an LCD screen and&#xD;
      projected via a mirror attached to the head coil. Images of food and objects will be matched&#xD;
      for contrast, brightness, size and resolution. Food images will represent a continuous&#xD;
      spectrum of highly rewarding to less rewarding items, while selected common objects (e.g. a&#xD;
      paper clip) will be deemed 'neutral'. Each participant will be shown a fixation cross lasting&#xD;
      for 2000-4000ms. Then, each visual image will be presented for 5000-6000ms with 'overlapped'&#xD;
      opportunity for rating of the stimulus by the subject (i.e., ratings performed while viewing&#xD;
      the image). During the presentation of each image, participants will be required to answer&#xD;
      the question &quot;How much do you want it now?&quot; on a 1-7 Likert scale using fiber optic buttons.&#xD;
      This sequence will be conducted 30 times, with different images to complete each run. Eight&#xD;
      such runs will comprise each scanning session. Following the stimulus presentation phase (EPI&#xD;
      scan), a T1-weighted structural scan (SS) lasting approximately 5 minutes will be obtained&#xD;
      followed by a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan (6 minutes) to assess white-matter&#xD;
      connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following the initial fMRI scan subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the&#xD;
      2 arms of the study: the Total Meal Replacement (TMR) group or the Typical Diet (TD) group&#xD;
      (16 participants per group). Each arm will maintain 1120 kcal/day target caloric intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMR Group: Optifast™ 800 total meal replacement shakes (1120 kcal/day) will provide all&#xD;
      nutrition (no additional food). One week supply of meal replacement product is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TD Group: Participants will be directed to use portion control to maintain a calorie level of&#xD;
      1120 kcal per day. Subjects will be provided resources to assist them in determining caloric&#xD;
      content of foods eaten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3 and 4 (Check-in Visits): Subjects of both groups will be requested to return to the&#xD;
      BMTR lab at 1 week intervals over the first 2 weeks following visit 2 to be weighed, have&#xD;
      blood pressure taken, review any issues and report adherence variations from protocol&#xD;
      (including additional caloric intake). Subjects of the TMR group will receive the next week's&#xD;
      product at each visit. Subjects of the TD group will be requested to provide a written list&#xD;
      of daily calorie intake of the past week at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5 (post-intervention Scanning Visit): Preparation for the visit, completion of pencil&#xD;
      and paper measures, procedure of scanning and the post-scan memory task will be similar to&#xD;
      visit 2. In addition, BIA, BP, weight and height will be measured and BMI will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: fMRI analysis will be carried out using a standard mixed effects model implemented&#xD;
      in FMRIB Software Library (FSL). Specifically, analysis of fMRI data will be focused on&#xD;
      identifying pre-post differences in both the location and relative magnitude of whole brain&#xD;
      activation patterns within and between members of each group (TMR vs. TD). Pre-planned&#xD;
      comparisons will also be made for specific regions of interest: a) food-reward related areas&#xD;
      (e.g. insula, orbito-frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala); b) reward&#xD;
      calculating regions (e.g. nucleus accumbens and ventral striatum), c) memory and emotion&#xD;
      related areas (e.g. hippocampus and amygdala); d) homeostatic circuitry (i.e. hypothalamus)&#xD;
      and cortical areas exerting executive control (e.g. pre-frontal cortex). Both structural and&#xD;
      functional connectivity between the considered regions of interest will also be modeled and&#xD;
      compared between and within groups. Demographic, health, weight history and psychosocial&#xD;
      variables may be included as covariates in specific analyses as indicated.&#xD;
