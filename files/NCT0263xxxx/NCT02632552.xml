      Transition from hospital to home places patients in jeopardy of adverse events and increases&#xD;
      their risk for rehospitalization. CHF is the most prevalent chronic condition among U.S.&#xD;
      adults and COPD is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. Both CHF and COPD represent&#xD;
      significant burdens for the VHA healthcare system. Care transitions can be supported through&#xD;
      multi-component interventions, but are costly to implement. Virtual nurses provide an&#xD;
      effective medium for explaining health concepts to patients, and previous work indicates&#xD;
      patients find virtual nurses acceptable. The investigators will implement and evaluate a&#xD;
      virtual nurse intervention to provide automated, tailored, and timely support to Veterans&#xD;
      transitioning from hospital to home. As effective care transition interventions incorporate&#xD;
      both inpatient and outpatient components, the virtual nurse will first engage with patient&#xD;
      onscreen during their inpatient stay and then via text message post-discharge. This project&#xD;
      has the potential to improve the care transition experience for patients, caregivers and&#xD;
      healthcare providers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The last decade has seen a steady increase in the resources that VHA uses to treat chronic&#xD;
      heart failure (CHF) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), both of which are among&#xD;
      the most common reasons for admission and re-admission in VHA facilities. Multi-component&#xD;
      care transition interventions can be effective, but are costly. One approach to reduce&#xD;
      complexity and costs is to offload some work to technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed by the sociotechnical model, this study proposes a technology-assisted care&#xD;
      transition intervention founded on the concept of a virtual nurse that interacts with&#xD;
      Veterans through different technology channels. The virtual nurse is an anthropomorphized&#xD;
      computer program designed to simulate a discharge nurse. During the inpatient stay, the&#xD;
      virtual nurse will appear on a computer touch screen and will educate Veterans with CHF or&#xD;
      COPD about the important components of a care transition (drawing on the Coleman Care&#xD;
      Transition Model) as well as how to send and receive text messages on their mobile phone.&#xD;
      Following discharge to home, the virtual nurse will continue to coach Veterans and their&#xD;
      family members and improve post-discharge access to care through two-way computer-tailored&#xD;
      text messaging made possible by VHA's new HealtheDialog system. Specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Refine methods and collect formative measures to guide implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a randomized trial of the technology-assisted care transition intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the intervention, including its effectiveness, implementation, and budget&#xD;
           impact&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a mixed methods formative assessment and simulation experiment to&#xD;
      refine existing technologies to the VA care transition setting (Aim 1). This will be followed&#xD;
      by a multi-site randomized type1 hybrid implementation trial (Aims 2 and 3). The trial will&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of the virtual nurse intervention in twelve clinical teams and&#xD;
      also gather information about its implementation to inform broader rollout.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Care Transition Measure (CTM) Score Comparison</measure>
    <time_frame>Responses to the CTM were collected from the intervention and control groups 7 days post-discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>The Care Transition Measure (CTM) is a validated, 15-item instrument used to measure the quality of a patient's care transition. The CTM has been shown to discriminate between patients discharged from the hospital who did and did not have a subsequent emergency department visit or rehospitalization for their index condition. Each of the CTM items has a 4-point Likert response scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). When scoring the CTM, the lowest possible score is 0 and the highest possible score is 100, where higher scores indicate a better quality care transition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale (ARMS) Score Comparison</measure>
    <time_frame>ARMS questionnaires were given to all participants at baseline and again at 30-day post-discharge follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Adherence to Refills and Medication Scale (ARMS) is a validated, 12-question instrument that assesses patient medication adherence across all literacy levels. Additionally, ARMS can be used to identify potential adherence barriers. The ARMS uses a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (none of the time) to 4 (all of the time). The score range is 12-48 with lower scores indicating better adherence.</description>

        <title>Care Transition Measure (CTM) Score Comparison</title>
        <description>The Care Transition Measure (CTM) is a validated, 15-item instrument used to measure the quality of a patient's care transition. The CTM has been shown to discriminate between patients discharged from the hospital who did and did not have a subsequent emergency department visit or rehospitalization for their index condition. Each of the CTM items has a 4-point Likert response scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). When scoring the CTM, the lowest possible score is 0 and the highest possible score is 100, where higher scores indicate a better quality care transition.</description>
        <time_frame>Responses to the CTM were collected from the intervention and control groups 7 days post-discharge.</time_frame>

      <time_frame>Study participants were monitored for adverse events during the active enrollment period of thirty (30) days from their hospital discharge date.</time_frame>
      <desc>In monitoring, collecting, and reporting data, the study did not consider rehospitalization to be a serious adverse event as the primary outcome of focus was healthcare utilization, including rehospitalization. The target population for this study, hospitalized Veterans with congestive heart failure and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tends to be older, sicker, and faced with more complex medical needs. For these reasons, rehospitalization can be common among this population.</desc>

    <limitations_and_caveats>It is important to interpret the results in light of this study's sample size limitations. Enrollment was slow and compounded by a recruitment halt during COVID-19. While we believe that we have a sufficient sample to examine utilization outcomes, enrollment was still less than anticipated. Lastly, it can be difficult to determine meaningful differences for the secondary outcomes used in this study, especially in light of the complex patient population and the novelty of the intervention tested.</limitations_and_caveats>
