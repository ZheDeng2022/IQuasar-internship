    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter, clinical trial is to evaluate the safety of AG-120&#xD;
      and AG-221 when given in combination with standard AML induction and consolidation therapy.&#xD;
      The study plans to evaluate up to 2 dose levels of AG-120 in participants with an isocitrate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase protein 1 (IDH1) mutation and up to 2 dose levels of AG-221 in participants&#xD;
      with an isocitrate dehydrogenase protein 2 (IDH2) mutation. AG-120 or AG-221 will be&#xD;
      administered with 2 types of AML induction therapies (cytarabine with either daunorubicin or&#xD;
      idarubicin) and 2 types of AML consolidation therapies (mitoxantrone with etoposide [ME] or&#xD;
      cytarabine). After consolidation therapy, participants may continue on to maintenance therapy&#xD;
      and receive daily treatment with single-agent AG-120 or AG-221 until relapse, development of&#xD;
      an unacceptable toxicity, or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The study will end&#xD;
      when all participants have discontinued study treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy for AML. Hydroxyurea is allowed prior to enrollment for the control&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Qualified scientific and medical researchers can request access to anonymized patient-level and study-level clinical trial data.&#xD;
Access can be requested for all interventional clinical studies:&#xD;
used for Marketing Authorization (MA) of medicines and new indications approved after 1 January 2014 in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United States (US).&#xD;
where Servier is the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH). The date of the first MA of the new medicine (or the new indication) in one of the EEA Member States will be considered for this scope.&#xD;
In addition, access can be requested for all interventional clinical studies in patients:&#xD;
sponsored by Servier&#xD;
with a first patient enrolled as of 1 January 2004 onwards&#xD;
for New Chemical Entity or New Biological Entity (new pharmaceutical form excluded) for which development has been terminated before any Marketing authorization (MA) approval.</ipd_description>
