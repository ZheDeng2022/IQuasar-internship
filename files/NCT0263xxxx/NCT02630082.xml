    <textblock>
      Rectal and genital sampling in HIV prevention trials permits assessments at the site of HIV&#xD;
      entry. Yet the safety and acceptability of circumcision and sigmoidoscopy (and associated&#xD;
      abstinence recommendations) are unknown in uncircumcised men who have sex with men (MSM) at&#xD;
      high risk of HIV infection. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      methods for assessing baseline characteristics of the mucosa of MSM at risk of HIV infection&#xD;
      in Lima, Peru.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic may only be controlled through development and utilization of&#xD;
      a safe and effective vaccine that will prevent HIV infection. To fill gaps in the&#xD;
      understanding of HIV vaccines, studies of mucosal immunity aim to complement assessments of&#xD;
      systemic immunity. Yet it is unclear, and important to understand, how mucosal collections&#xD;
      and the kinetics of immune activation they might initiate may impact peripheral blood&#xD;
      endpoints in HIV vaccine trials. The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and the National&#xD;
      Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) are conducting a single-site,&#xD;
      exploratory cohort study evaluating the feasibility of sampling mucosa and assessing cellular&#xD;
      immune responses in sexually active men who have sex with men, a population in which&#xD;
      later-phase HIV vaccine clinical trials are often conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of HVTN 914 is to assess the feasibility of performing safe and tolerable&#xD;
      circumcision and rectosigmoid biopsy studies on a study population of 30 healthy,&#xD;
      HIV-seronegative, uncircumcised men in Lima, Peru, aged 21 to 30 years, who have sex with men&#xD;
      and who are at high risk for acquisition of HIV; to assess institutional capacities to&#xD;
      process mucosal samples; and to identify methods of evaluating foreskin and rectosigmoid&#xD;
      mucosal immune responses that provide minimal variability for analysis of small sample sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to mimic an HIV vaccine study mucosal collection protocol. Participants&#xD;
      agree to elective sigmoidoscopy biopsy collections and circumcision, and actively participate&#xD;
      in this study for approximately 7 months. The primary analysis will focus on pre- and&#xD;
      post-procedure retention, safety laboratory values, sexual satisfaction, HIV risk behaviors,&#xD;
      and levels of activation markers associated with vulnerability to HIV infection in samples of&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A total of 11 study visits (including a screening visit)&#xD;
      occur at Weeks 0-5, 10, and 26-28. Study procedures include physical exams, blood and urine&#xD;
      collection, HIV testing, and questionnaire. Elective rectosigmoid bioscopy is performed at&#xD;
      Weeks 2 and 27. Elective circumcision is performed at Week 4. Some blood collected from&#xD;
      participants will be stored and used in future research. Risk-reduction counseling will be&#xD;
      conducted at all study visits.&#xD;
