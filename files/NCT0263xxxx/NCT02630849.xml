  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic post-thoracotomy pain is a significant adverse outcome of thoracic surgery.&#xD;
      transcollation technology evaluated with a prospective randomized trial the effect of a&#xD;
      multimodal no-compression suture technique of the intercostal space on postoperative pain&#xD;
      occurrence in patients undergoing mini-thoracotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing a muscle-sparing lateral mini-thoracotomy for different thoracic diseases&#xD;
      were randomly divided into two groups:one group received intercostal muscle flap harvesting&#xD;
      and pericostal no-compression &quot;edge&quot; suture (IMF group), and the second group received a&#xD;
      standard suture technique associated with an intrapleural intercostal nerve block (IINB&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to demonstrate that the multimodal no-compression suture technique&#xD;
      is a rapid and feasible procedure reducing early and chronic post-thoracotomy pain intensity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients' data were prospectively recorded in a single database and surgery was performed in&#xD;
      a single thoracic center in order to achieve homogenous treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After acceptance from the Ethics Committee of our Institution, a prospective randomized study&#xD;
      of 487 patients was performed from October 2011 to October 2013 in the Thoracic Surgery&#xD;
      Division - Sant'Andrea Hospital, Faculty of Medicine and Psychology, University of Rome&#xD;
      &quot;Sapienza&quot;. All patients who were scheduled to undergo a muscle-sparing lateral&#xD;
      mini-thoracotomy for different thoracic diseases were eligible for this trial. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were: history of previous thoracotomy, chronic pain syndrome (any type of pain),&#xD;
      opioid/steroid use 6 months before surgery, chest trauma with rib fractures, radiologic&#xD;
      evidence of parietal pleural or chest wall tumor invasion, and previous neoadjuvant or&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative consent was obtained from all patients, informed that they would have one of the&#xD;
      two methods of chest closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function tests (spirometry and 6-minute walking test [6-MWT]) were performed in all&#xD;
      patients preoperatively and at 1 and 6 months postoperatively. All patients received our&#xD;
      standard muscle-sparing lateral minithoracotomy through the fifth intercostal space without&#xD;
      division of the latissimus dorsi muscle and the serratus anterior muscle. The postoperative&#xD;
      analgesic protocol was the same for all patients in both groups, and consisted of a&#xD;
      continuous intravenous infusion of tramadol (10 mg/h) and ketorolac tromethamine (3 mg/h),&#xD;
      starting at the time of surgical skin incision and continuing until 48-72 h after surgery.&#xD;
      Intravenous analgesia was then continued with ketorolac tromethamine (10 mg tid) and&#xD;
      paracetamol (1 g tid) until discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
