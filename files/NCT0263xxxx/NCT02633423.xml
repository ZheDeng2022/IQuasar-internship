      During general anesthesia a reduction of Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) was observed. The&#xD;
      reduction of FRC could imply that respiratory system closing capacity (CC) exceeds the FRC&#xD;
      and leads to a phenomenon called expiratory flow limitation (EFL). Positive End-Expiratory&#xD;
      Pressure (PEEP) test is a validated method to evaluate the presence of EFL during anesthesia.&#xD;
      Aim of the study will be to asses if mechanical ventilation during CardioPulmonary Bypass&#xD;
      (CPB) in cardiac surgery could reduce the incidence of EFL in the post-CPB period. Primary&#xD;
      end-point will be the incidence of EFL, assessed by a PEEP test, performed at different&#xD;
      time-points in operating room. Co-primary end-point will be shunt fraction, determined before&#xD;
      and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single center single-blind parallel group randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to four parallel arms with an allocation ratio 1:1:1:1, to&#xD;
      receive one of four mechanical ventilation strategies during CPB.&#xD;

        1. Ventilation with a Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O before and after&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction During general anesthesia a reduction of Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) was&#xD;
      observed. The reduction of FRC could imply that respiratory system closing capacity (CC)&#xD;
      exceeds the FRC and leads to a phenomenon called expiratory flow limitation (EFL). Several&#xD;
      factors contribute to the EFL phenomenon during general anesthesia, including anesthesia&#xD;
      induction by itself. High oxygen concentrations, muscle paralysis, supine positioning,&#xD;
      increased extravascular water because of perioperative fluid therapy and inflammatory&#xD;
      response also play a role in this picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with aortic cross-clamping, which is necessary for the&#xD;
      majority of procedures in cardiac surgery, was associated with direct lung damage. Pulmonary&#xD;
      atelectasis, apnea and ischemia during CPB and activation of proteolytic enzymes in the&#xD;
      pulmonary circulation influence the incidence of postoperative pulmonary dysfunction after&#xD;
      cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) test is a validated method to evaluate the presence&#xD;
      of EFL during anesthesia. PEEP-test is a feasible and completely safe measure of the&#xD;
      reduction of FRC in mechanically ventilated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study will be to assess if mechanical ventilation during CPB in cardiac surgery&#xD;
      could reduce the incidence of EFL in the post-CPB period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary End-point The primary endpoint will be a composite end-point of the incidence of&#xD;
      Expiratory Flow Limitation after the weaning from CPB and post-operative pulmonary&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-points&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-points will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Readmission to the ICU;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for re-intubation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for non-invasive ventilation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of mechanical ventilation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative infections;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major adverse cardiac events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of the ICU and hospital stay;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 days and 1 year mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods This will be a single center single-blind parallel group randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to four parallel arms with an allocation&#xD;
      ratio 1:1:1:1, to receive one of four mechanical ventilation strategies during CPB. Patients&#xD;
      that will match the following criteria at the preoperative evaluation will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and masking Patient will be randomized according to a computer-generated list&#xD;
      of casual numbers. Information about patient allocation will be kept in closed opaque&#xD;
      envelopes and nobody will know patient allocation before randomization. Patients will be&#xD;
      blind to allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilation protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be randomized both about the ventilation management before and after CPB&#xD;
      and about the management during CPB: a 2 by 2 trial design. Patients will be casually&#xD;
      assigned to four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: patients will be ventilated with Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) before and&#xD;
      after cadiopulmonary bypass (CPB); during CPB, Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)&#xD;
      will be adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: patients will be ventilated without PEEP (ZEEP) before and after CPB; during CPB,&#xD;
      CPAP will be adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: patients will be ventilated with PEEP before and after CPB; during CPB, no&#xD;
      Mechanical Ventilation (No MV) will be adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group D: patients will be ventilated without PEEP (ZEEP) before and after CPB; during CPB, no&#xD;
      MV will be adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized, immediately before surgery, to receive either a PEEP equal to&#xD;
      the best PEEP, assessed with a PEEP test, immediately after the induction of anaesthesia or&#xD;
      equal to zero. All patients will be furthermore randomized to receive either a CPAP equal to&#xD;
      the best PEEP or a zero PEEP strategy (with deconnection from anaesthesia circuit) during&#xD;
      CPB. The two randomizations will be independent each from other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During CPB our goal will be to maintain PaO2 between 200 and 250 mmHg in order to avoid&#xD;
      hyperoxia-induced lung injury; moreover, the hematocrit will be maintained above 24%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During weaning from CPB we will perform a single alveolar RM. This RM will be performed&#xD;
      manually by the anesthesiologist with a gas mixture of oxygen and air (with an inspired&#xD;
      oxygen fraction lower than 80%) at the end of procedure. After CPB, this recruitment maneuver&#xD;
      will be performed manually, in correspondence to the surgical de-airing procedure. Airway&#xD;
      pressure will be kept at 40 cmH2O for at least 10 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung mechanics determination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quasi-static compliance of respiratory system (Cqst,rs) will be calculated as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tidal volume / (end inspiratory plateau pressure - PEEPtot (ml/cmH2O) where PEEPtot is the&#xD;
      end-expiratory pressure at period of no-flow. Measurement will be performed with an&#xD;
      inspiratory pause of 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Airway resistance (Rmin,rs) will be calculated as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Ppeak - P1) / V' where Ppeak is the peak inspiratory pressure, P1 is the airways pressure at&#xD;
      the point of zero flow and V' is the inspiratory flow. Measurement will be performed with an&#xD;
      inspiratory pause of 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung mechanics will be determinated immediately after every PEEP test execution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dead space calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dead space fraction calculation will be performed with the Enghoff modification of the Bohr&#xD;
      equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vd/Vt = (PaCO2-PECO2)/PaCO2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vd is the dead space&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vt tidal volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PECO2 is pressure of mean expired CO2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shunt fraction calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shunt fraction will be determined before surgery and after surgery in operating room during&#xD;
      general anesthesia, before patient discharge from operating room. Shunt fraction will be&#xD;
      assessed as follows in all patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qs/Qt = (PAO2 - PaO2)*0,0031 / C(a-v mixed)O2 + [(PAO2 - PaO2)*0,0031]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PAO2 is oxygen alveolar concentration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PaO2 is oxygen arterial concentration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C(a-v mixed)O2 is arterovenous difference in oxygen concentration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0,0031 is a conversion factor to volume percent for O2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure will be performed while breathing 100% oxygen for 20 minutes, to achieve a complete&#xD;
      hemoglobin saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a Pulmonary Artery Catheter (PAC) will be placed, according to clinical indications, shunt&#xD;
      fraction will be calculated from the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qs/Qt = CcO2-CaO2 / CcO2-Cv(mixed)O2 * 100&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • CcO2 is pulmonary capillary blood O2 content, estimated with the following equation: CcO2 =&#xD;
      (Hb * 1.34) + (0.0031 * PAO2);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CaO2 is arterial oxygen content;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cv(mixed)O2 is oxygen content in blood samples obtained from the pulmonary artery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PAO2 is alveolar oxygen partial pressure. Blood samples will be collected from arterial&#xD;
           catheter and pulmonary artery catheter, under a FiO2 of 100% in the same moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore Blood Gas Analyses (BGA) will be performed on arterial blood:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after anesthesia induction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after sternotomy, together with heparinization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  before sternosynthesis, together with protamine administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  before discharge from operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Sample size calculation was based on a 2 sided α error of 0.05 and a&#xD;
      80% power (β). On the basis of our experience, we anticipate that the 50% of patients with&#xD;
      ventilation stop during CPB and no PEEP before and after CPB will reach the composite&#xD;
      end-point of EFL after CPB and respiratory complications at 5 days, while only the 30% of the&#xD;
      patients treated with an optimal. A sample size of 93 patients per group, 186 in total will&#xD;
      be necessary to complete the trial. Including a drop-out fraction of 10%, we will enroll 51&#xD;
      patients per group, 204 in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and analysis Data will be collected on the appropriate Case Report Form&#xD;
      (CRF). In particular anamnestic information will be collected, data about surgery and&#xD;
      post-operative clinical data, in particular respiratory parameters. Data will be analyzed&#xD;
      with a professional statistical software. Dichotomous variables will be compared with the&#xD;
      two-tailed Chi square test, using the Yates correction when appropriate. Continuous variables&#xD;
      will be compared by analysis of variance or the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, when&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent and trial conduction Each patients will provide informed consent. All parts&#xD;
      of this trial will be conducted according to the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) statement as&#xD;
      well as Italian and international law on clinical research.&#xD;
