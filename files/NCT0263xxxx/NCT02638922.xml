      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the phenotypic characteristics and diagnoses in a large cohort of 304 consecutive&#xD;
      girls referred due to tall stature. Furthermore, to evaluate the effect of oral&#xD;
      administration of 17β-estradiol on predicted adult height in constitutionally tall statured&#xD;
      girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-centre retrospective observational study of 304 girls evaluated due to tall stature&#xD;
      between 1993 and 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary referral centre for pediatric endocrinology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 304 girls were evaluated for tall stature of whom 39 (13%) were excluded due to&#xD;
      missing data, reclassification, overgrowth syndromes or associated comorbidities. Another 58&#xD;
      (19%) girls did not fulfil auxological criteria for constitutionally tall stature (CTS),&#xD;
      resulting in a total of 207 (68%) girls eligible for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of oral treatment with 17β-estradiol on height, predicted adult height (PAH),&#xD;
      final height and circulating hormones in constitutional tall statured girls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) treatment of extreme tall stature has become increasingly debated&#xD;
      and controversial. In Sweden, percutaneous epiphysiodesis operation is suggested as an&#xD;
      alternative to EE2 treatment. An alternative clinical practise was introduced 20 years ago,&#xD;
      when early treatment with oral administration of natural estrogens (17β-estradiol (E2)) was&#xD;
      introduced in order to initiate or ensure rapid progression of puberty (and epiphyseal&#xD;
      closure) in tall statured girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective 20-year single center experience included evaluation of 304 tall statured&#xD;
      girls and the possible clinical effects of oral administration of E2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population consisted of girls who were referred with tall stature or overgrowth&#xD;
      syndromes (ICD10 34.4, and ICD10 DE874, DQ970, DQ873A, DQ873B) to the Department of Growth&#xD;
      and Reproduction at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark, during a 20-years period (between&#xD;
      1993 and 2013). A total of 304 patients were identified, and the diagnoses were re-evaluated&#xD;
      as part of the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data and medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history was obtained using a structured review of patient record files. Clinical data&#xD;
      on pubertal development were obtained from each patient visit. Puberty was evaluated by&#xD;
      inspection and palpation of the breasts and s pubic hair according to Marshall and Tanner. A&#xD;
      wall-mounted stadiometer (Holtain Ltd., Crymych, United Kingdom) was used to measure standing&#xD;
      height to the nearest 0.1 cm. The girls were weighed on a digital electronic scale (Seca&#xD;
      delta, model 707; Seca, Hamburg, Germany) with a precision of 0.1 kg while wearing light&#xD;
      clothing and no shoes. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m2). The Danish&#xD;
      growth references published by Tinggaard et al. was used in this study. Boneage (BA) was&#xD;
      calculated according to the methods of Greulich and Pyle (GP) using manual readings between&#xD;
      1993-2008 (n=368), and automated BA estimation from 2008-2013 (n=378) . Target height was&#xD;
      calculated as the sum of the mother's and father's heights (cm) minus 13 cm, divided by 2.&#xD;
      Predicted Adult Height (PAH) was calculated using BoneXpert .&#xD;
&#xD;
      17β-Estradiol treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to initiate treatment with E2 was determined individually, and made by the&#xD;
      physician together with the patient and her parents, depending on height SDS, age, PAH and&#xD;
      target height. Oral E2 was administered in increasing doses depending on age and pubertal&#xD;
      stage. The starting doses ranged between 0.2 mg E2 to 4 mg E2. The speed of dose increment&#xD;
      depended on the individual girl (age, bone BA, maturity, pubertal stage and PAH). The&#xD;
      treatment consisted of 17β-estradiol supplemented with norethisteronacetat after 1-2 years of&#xD;
      E2, or after the first menstrual bleeding. Oral E2 treatment was administered in the form of&#xD;
      Trisekvens® (Novo Nordisk Scandinavia AB, Copenhagen, Denmark), Trisekvens Forte® (Novo&#xD;
      Nordisk Scandinavia AB, Copenhagen, Denmark) and/or Femanest® (Sandoz A/S, Copenhagen,&#xD;
      Denmark). Clinical and biochemical values were recorded at baseline and at each year&#xD;
      thereafter. The treatment was generally terminated when the X-ray showed closed epiphyseal&#xD;
      lines at final or near-final (&lt;2 cm/year) height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were drawn from the antecubital vein between 8 AM and 1 PM in the non-fasting&#xD;
      state. Blood samples were clotted and centrifuged, and serum was stored at -20° Celsius until&#xD;
      hormone analyses were performed. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising&#xD;
      hormone (LH) were measured by time-resolved immunofluorometric assays (Delfia, Wallac, Turku,&#xD;
      Finland). The detection limits (dL) for FSH and LH were 0.06 and 0.05 IU/l, respectively.&#xD;
      Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation (CV) were &lt; 5% in both gonadotropin assays.&#xD;
      Testosterone was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) (Coat-a-count, Diagnostic Products&#xD;
      Corporation, Los Angeles, CA) with a dL of 0.23 nmol/L and intra- and interassay CV both &lt;&#xD;
      10%. Serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was measured by time-resolved&#xD;
      immunofluorometric assays (Delfia, Wallac, Turku, Finland) with a dL of 0.20 nmol/l, and&#xD;
      intra- and interassay CVs of 5.8% and 6.4%, respectively. Serum insulin-like growth factor I&#xD;
      (IGF-I) was measured using a highly sensitive in-house RIA as previously described by Juul et&#xD;
      al. The intra- and interassay CV were 3.9% and 8.7%, respectively. From 2008 IGF-I levels&#xD;
      were determined by conventional immunoassays (IMMULITE 2000 IGF-1; Siemens Healthcare&#xD;
      Diagnostics, Los Angeles, CA, USA) on automated IMMULITE 2000 (Siemens). The CV were less&#xD;
      than 4% and 9%, respectively. Serum insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3)&#xD;
      was measured by RIA, as previously described by Blum et al. The intraassay CV was 2.4% and&#xD;
      the interassay CV was 10.7%. Between 1993 and 2013, serum inhibin B was measured using one of&#xD;
      two double antibody enzyme immunometric assays (Inhibin B DSL or Oxford Bio-Innovation&#xD;
      Inhibin B), both with a dL of 20 pg/ml and intra- and interassay CV &lt; 16%. Estradiol was&#xD;
      measured by RIA (Pantex, Santa Monica, CA; before 1998 distributed by Immuno Diagnostic&#xD;
      Systems, Bolton, UK) with a dL of 18 pmol/L, and intra- and interassay CVs &lt; 8% and &lt;13%,&#xD;
      respectively. Only assays for IGF-I changed during the 20-year study period, and we compared&#xD;
      the two assays rigorously and ensured that they yielded similar results before changing the&#xD;
      assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are displayed as the median with interquartile range (25th;75th percentiles) and/or the&#xD;
      range (min - max). Results of treatment effect and IGF-I (SD) are displayed as the mean ± SD.&#xD;
      Hormone values below the dL of the assay were assigned a value corresponding to the dL/2. The&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test and student's test was used to determine significance when comparing&#xD;
      clinical, auxological, and laboratory data between groups, and student's t-test was used when&#xD;
      comparing the effect of treatment within the group of girls treated with oral E2. All&#xD;
      statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, version&#xD;
      22).&#xD;
