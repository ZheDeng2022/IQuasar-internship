      Objective: To compare vNOTES (vaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery) and&#xD;
      established laparoscopic removal of benign adnexal masses Study design: Randomized&#xD;
      controlled/single center/single-blinded/parallel-group/non-inferiority/efficacy trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Women aged 18 to 70 years with symptomatic or persistent benign adnexal&#xD;
      masses detected by clinical examination and ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Women will be randomly allocated to undergo one of two techniques for removal&#xD;
      of the benign adnexal mass immediately before surgery by using a computer generated&#xD;
      randomization list. The investigators will use stratified randomization according to the cyst&#xD;
      diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Women will be treated by a surgeon who is not blinded to the treatment&#xD;
      allocation and who is equally skilled in performing both techniques. In the intervention&#xD;
      group a vNOTES technique will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: In the control group surgery will be done by a classical laparoscopic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, nursing staff and outcome assessors will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: successful removal of a benign adnexal mass without spill. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes: the proportion of women discharged the same day based on their own preference;&#xD;
      postoperative pain scores using a VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) measured between day 1 till 7&#xD;
      by the participating women following surgery and the total amount of analgesics used as&#xD;
      described in the standardized pain treatment protocol between day 1 till 7; postoperative&#xD;
      infection defined by lower abdominal pain with fever &gt; 38Â°C and positive clinical signs or&#xD;
      laboratory findings; per- or postoperative complications according to the Clavien- Dindo&#xD;
      classification detected during the first six weeks of surgery; duration of the surgical&#xD;
      procedure; incidence and intensity of dyspareunia recorded by the participants at 3 and 6&#xD;
      months by self-reporting using a simple questionnaire and VAS scale; sexual wellbeing&#xD;
      recorded by the participants at 3 and 6 months by SSFS (Short Sexual Functioning Scale);&#xD;
      direct costs associated up to 6 weeks after the surgical intervention with both procedures.&#xD;

      1. Objectives of the NOTABLE Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research questions of this IDEAL stage 2b efficacy trial are as follows: is a&#xD;
      vNOTES adnexectomy at least as effective compared to the standard transabdominal laparoscopic&#xD;
      approach (LSC) for removing a benign adnexal mass without spill? (non-inferiority design)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do more women treated by vNOTES prefer to leave the hospital on the day of surgery&#xD;
           compared to LSC?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do women treated by vNOTES suffer from less pain compared to women treated by LSC in the&#xD;
           first postoperative week?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the removal of a benign adnexal mass by vNOTES faster compared to LSC?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does a vNOTES cause more pelvic infection or other complications compared to LSC?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does a vNOTES cause more hospital readmissions within 6 weeks following surgery compared&#xD;
           to LSC?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does a vNOTES approach result in more women reporting dyspareunia, less sexual wellbeing&#xD;
           or less health-related quality of life at 3 or 6 months after surgery when compared to&#xD;
           women treated by LSC?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the direct and indirect costs up to 6 weeks of a vNOTES compared to LSC?&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN 2.1. Design A single center, single-blinded, parallel group randomized,&#xD;
      non-inferiority efficacy trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Simple pilot randomized trial: minimal extra workload 2.3. Time schedule Based upon the&#xD;
      mean number of laparoscopic adnexectomies performed annually at the department of Obstetrics&#xD;
      and Gynecology of the participating center (36) the investigators estimate that the duration&#xD;
      of recruitment will be 21 months. Based upon the follow up (6 months) and the period of&#xD;
      analysis/reporting (3 months) the total study period will be 2.5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. Participating center Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Imeldahospital Imeldalaan 9&#xD;
      2820 Bonheiden Belgium&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. ELIGIBILITY, CONSENT AND RANDOMIZATION 3.1. Screening and consent prior to surgery All&#xD;
      women aged 18 to 70 years regardless of parity presenting with a symptomatic or asymptomatic&#xD;
      persistent benign adnexal mass on clinical examination confirmed by ultrasound are eligible&#xD;
      for inclusion. The diagnosis of benign adnexal mass will be based upon the prospectively&#xD;
      validated IOTA classification(International Ovarian Tumour Analysis Group) simple ultrasound&#xD;
      rules to distinguish between benign and malignant adnexal masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Determining eligibility All women aged 18 to 70 years regardless of parity presenting&#xD;
      with a symptomatic or asymptomatic persistent benign adnexal mass on clinical examination who&#xD;
      provide consent to participation are eligible in the NOTABLE trial based on the findings of&#xD;
      the ultrasound findings and will be randomized before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3. Randomization If the woman is eligible for the NOTABLE trial, the trial secretary will&#xD;
      obtain a randomized allocation the day before surgery. This will be done using a&#xD;
      randomization list generated by a free computer software program offered by Research&#xD;
      Randomizer (https://www.randomizer.org). The random sequence generation will be concealed&#xD;
      using sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes. The envelope will be opened by the nurse&#xD;
      assistant on the day before the surgical intervention for logistic reasons. The investigators&#xD;
      will use stratified randomization in this small pilot RCT (randomized controlled trial)&#xD;
      according to the cyst diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4. Patients with strong preference for treatment A minority of women will express a clear&#xD;
      preference for one of both treatments (e.g. strong desire to have no scar) and for this&#xD;
      reason will not wish to be randomized between surgical treatments. To investigate how&#xD;
      outcomes vary by choice, these women could be followed up in exactly the same way as for&#xD;
      those women randomized into the NOTABLE trial. A formal non-randomized follow-up of these&#xD;
      women will not be done for simple logistical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5. Stratification of randomization A blocked randomization procedure will be used to avoid&#xD;
      chance imbalances for the parameter 'cyst diameter'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid any possibility of foreknowledge, the randomized allocation will not be given until&#xD;
      all eligibility and stratification data have been given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. TREATMENT ALLOCATIONS 4.1. Surgical procedures The principal investigator, who has&#xD;
      training and experience in both laparoscopy and NOTES, will perform all surgical procedures.&#xD;
      He is therefore not blinded. All vNOTES participants will be blinded by three superficial&#xD;
      &quot;mock&quot; skin incisions similar to those routinely done with the laparoscopic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.1 vNOTES adnexectomy This is the surgical procedure done in the intervention arm of the&#xD;
      NOTABLE trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.2 LSC adnexectomy This is the surgical procedure done in the control arm of the NOTABLE&#xD;
      trial. 5. FOLLOW-UP AND OUTCOME MEASURES 5.1. Clinical assessments 5.1.1 Format PROMs will be&#xD;
      collected using a postal questionnaire, which will include a combination of disease specific&#xD;
      and generic measurement instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postal questionnaires will be sent from the NOTABLE Trial Office with postage paid&#xD;
      envelopes two weeks before the due date. Reminders will be sent to the participants if the&#xD;
      questionnaire is not returned within one week of the due date and attempts will be made to&#xD;
      contact the women by phone if the questionnaire is not returned by two weeks after the due&#xD;
      date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2 Timing of assessments The primary outcome will be measured clinically at the end of the&#xD;
      surgical procedure. In addition patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) will take place the&#xD;
      evening of the surgical intervention (return home), during the first postoperative week (pain&#xD;
      by Visual Analogue (VAS)scores and analgetic drugs) and at 3 and 6 months (dyspareunia/&#xD;
      sexual well being/ health related quality of life). Clinical physician assessment will take&#xD;
      place the evening of the surgical intervention (return home) and during the first six weeks&#xD;
      following surgery (pelvic infection, surgical complications, hospital readmission rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2. Primary clinical outcome measure The proportion of women successfully treated by&#xD;
      removing the adnexal mass without spill, using a dichotomous outcome measure, will be used as&#xD;
      a measure of efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3. Secondary clinical outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary outcomes will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of women admitted in-hospital for at least one night observation based on&#xD;
           their own preference, as a dichotomous outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative pain scores, as an ordinal outcome, measured using a Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
           (VAS) scale twice daily from day 1 till 7 self-reported by the participating women. VAS&#xD;
           scores range from 0=no pain to 10= worst imaginable pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative pain defined by the total amount of analgesics used as described in the&#xD;
           standardized pain treatment protocol, as a continuous outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative infection as a dichotomous outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Per- or postoperative complications according to the Clavien- Dindo classification&#xD;
           detected during the first six weeks of surgery, as a dichotomous outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital readmission within 6 weeks following surgery, as a dichotomous outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence and intensity of dyspareunia recorded by the participants at 3 and 6 months by&#xD;
           self-reporting using a simple questionnaire and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scale, as a&#xD;
           dichotomous and ordinal outcome. VAS scores range from 0=no pain to 10= worst imaginable&#xD;
           pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sexual wellbeing at baseline, at 3 and 6 months by self-reporting the Short Sexual&#xD;
           Functioning Scale (SSFS). The SSFS is a questionnaire with 7 open ended questions on&#xD;
           sexual wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related quality of life, at baseline, at 3 and 6 months by self-reporting the&#xD;
           EQ-5D-3L tool consisting of a questionnaire on 5 domains and a scale ranging from&#xD;
           0=worst possible health-related quality of life to 100 = best possible health-related&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of surgery measured as the time in minutes from the insertion of the bladder&#xD;
           catheter to the end of vaginal/abdominal wound closure, as a continuous outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4. Health economic outcomes The direct and indirect costs of both techniques up to 6 weeks&#xD;
      after the surgical intervention will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. ACCRUAL AND ANALYSIS 6.1. Sample size The sample size for this trial has been chosen to&#xD;
      give good statistical power to preclude any clinically important inferiority of vNOTES&#xD;
      compared to laparoscopy and is based on evidence retrieved from a systematic review of the&#xD;
      literature and a RCT comparing the excision of mature teratoma using culdotomy with and&#xD;
      without laparoscopy. Based on the power calculations for the primary outcome and two&#xD;
      secondary outcomes and assuming a loss-to-follow-up rate of 10% the investigators decided to&#xD;
      include 66 study participants in the NOTABLE trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2. Projected accrual and attrition rates It is anticipated that recruitment of participants&#xD;
      will take two years. Based upon the mean number of laparoscopic adnexectomies performed&#xD;
      annually at the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the participating center (36) the&#xD;
      investigators estimate that the duration of recruitment will be 21 months. Based upon the&#xD;
      follow up (6 months) and the period of analysis/reporting (3 months) the total study period&#xD;
      will be 2.5 years. First publication will be possible within four years of trial&#xD;
      commencement.&#xD;
