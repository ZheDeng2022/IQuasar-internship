    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of sodium oxybate on headache response&#xD;
      (frequency), sleep quality and quality of life in the prophylactic treatment of patients with&#xD;
      chronic and episodic cluster headache. Oral sodium oxybate, 3-9g per night, starting with 3g&#xD;
      in two nightly dosages of 1.5g and increased by steps of 1.5g every second or third night&#xD;
      until treatment Response will be evaluated in an interventional, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind, randomised, parallel group, multicentre study. Primary outcome is reduction of&#xD;
      nocturnal pain frequency Secondary outcomes are improvement of sleep quality at a subjective&#xD;
      level as assessed by diary and standardized scales (PSQI, FOSQ), duration of pain free&#xD;
      episodes, general clinical outcome (global evaluation), clinical global impression (CGI-S,&#xD;
      CGI-I, CGI-E), quality of life (SF 36) and daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Score).&#xD;

      Multicenter study to test the safety and efficacy of sodium oxybate in the prophylaxis of&#xD;
      headache and sleep disturbances in patients with chronic and episodic cluster headache using&#xD;
      a placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized study, parallel group design. Patients with&#xD;
      predominant nocturnal attacks and poor sleep quality will be evaluated; At least 1 attack&#xD;
      every other day and at least 8 attacks cumulatively by the time prior to randomization are&#xD;
      required. Sodium oxybate will be orally administered, 3-9g per night, starting with 3g in two&#xD;
      nightly dosages of 1.5g (the first at bedtime and the second 4 hours later). Dosage will be&#xD;
      gradually increased by steps of 1.5g every second night until treatment response during a&#xD;
      titration period of 14 days. Effects od sodium oxybate will be monitored via pain and sleep&#xD;
      diaries during a 14 days stable treatment phase by reviewing sleep/pain diaries and Quality&#xD;
      of life assessement. Primary outcomes are frequency of nocturnal pain attacks; Main secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are frequency, intensity and duration of daytime pain attacks, improvement of sleep&#xD;
      quality, quality of life, duration and rates of pain free episodes, decrease in escape&#xD;
      medication for acute headache attacks (use of triptans). Safety parameters are ECG,&#xD;
      laboratory, depressions scales, vital signs, respiratory polygraphy. Intent-to treat&#xD;
      analysis, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with depending variable (reduction of&#xD;
      pain frequency and pain intensity of nocturnal attacks) and the co-variates (age, sex ,&#xD;
      chronic vs. episodic CH).&#xD;
