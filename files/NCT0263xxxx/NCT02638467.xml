  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients newly diagnosed with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia undergo treatment with&#xD;
      TK inhibitors (TKI). A possible cause of TK failure is represented by the insufficient&#xD;
      recovery of normal Ph- hematopoiesis during TKI treatment, with consequent severe cytopenias&#xD;
      that limit TKI adequate administration. Although rare, this event happens in a proportion of&#xD;
      4-5% of CML patients. Our hypothesis is to circumvent this peculiar condition by providing a&#xD;
      normal hematopoiesis from a HLA-matched donor (Human Leukocyte Antigen). The transplant&#xD;
      procedure is therefore intended in providing a sustained hematopoiesis that will allow an&#xD;
      early treatment with an adequate dosing of TKI. The transplant procedure planned in our study&#xD;
      is built on all available evidences to provide the lowest incidence of acute and chronic GvHD&#xD;
      (Graft-versus-host disease). Therefore, a bone marrow will be the preferential source and a&#xD;
      GvHD prophylaxis based on Anti-thrombocyte globulin (ATG) and Cyclosporine/Methotrexate will&#xD;
      be used according to standard current experience in the field of family and unrelated donors.&#xD;
      The pre-transplant TKI will be continued until aplasia will develop, in order to decrease the&#xD;
      tumor load as much as possible.The use of TKIs shortly after transplant carries the risk of&#xD;
      inhibiting the newly transplanted hematopoietic cells, as Kit, an important kinase in normal&#xD;
      bone marrow cells, is frequently blocked by Abl inhibitors. The use of bosutinib as&#xD;
      post-transplant therapy is justified by the lack of Kit inhibition that distinguishes&#xD;
      bosutinib from all other TKIs, and which could allow a minimal inhibitory activity against&#xD;
      the transplanted normal bone marrow.&#xD;
