    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of the Armeo速Spring Pediatric as therapy for&#xD;
      children with hand and arm weakness. The Armeo速Spring Pediatric is a device that supports the&#xD;
      weight of the child's arm and uses joystick that helps to play computer games. The child will&#xD;
      be assessed before and after this therapy. Participating children with upper extremity&#xD;
      impairments will receive therapy 3x/week for 6 weeks during 30-45 minutes sessions at&#xD;
      progressively increasing degrees of difficulty. Each child's performance will be tracked with&#xD;
      regard to time necessary to complete a predetermined number of trials of the activity. The&#xD;
      standardized assessment tools that will be used are the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA), Box&#xD;
      &amp; Blocks test, Jebsen Taylor hand function test, and the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability&#xD;
      Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT). Data will be analyzed to determine the efficacy&#xD;
      of this training method.&#xD;

      8. &quot;Adverse Events&quot; All serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB immediately, but&#xD;
      no later than [5] days of the occurrence or receipt of notification from an outside source;&#xD;
      the IRB can make changes to the consent form as a result of adverse events. Any such event&#xD;
      will be reported to the IRB on the &quot;Adverse Event Report.&quot; [See attachment.] 9. &quot;Debriefing&quot;&#xD;
      Debriefing is not required because there is no deception of subjects involved or there are no&#xD;
      alternative treatments or procedures used in a &quot;blind&quot; fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. &quot;Intervention&quot; Participants in this study are children who present with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      upper extremity weakness or involvement secondary to various reasons. These children receive&#xD;
      occupational, physical, and/or speech services at St Mary's Hospital for Children. The&#xD;
      children participating in this program will be receiving their occupational therapy session&#xD;
      with the use of the Armeo速Spring Pediatric. They will also continue to receive their regular&#xD;
      physical and speech therapy session. Once the program is completed, they will continue to&#xD;
      receive their regular occupation therapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. &quot;Confidentiality&quot; Data sheets will be coded with a number to represent each child. The&#xD;
      numeric data obtained regarding timed trials will be entered into a computer which is&#xD;
      password-protected at St. Mary's Hospital for Children in Bayside, NY. Consent forms with the&#xD;
      child's name and parental signatures and video tape or photographic images recorded during&#xD;
      data collection will be stored in accordance with St. Mary's Hospital for Children patient&#xD;
      privacy policy.&#xD;
