  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have a biliary cancer that is&#xD;
      incurable and has spread to other organs. Chemotherapy is often used to help shrink the&#xD;
      cancer temporarily and may improve survival. In Canada, the combination of gemcitabine and&#xD;
      cisplatin is the chemotherapy combination used to treat biliary cancer that has spread. There&#xD;
      is no other known treatment for biliary cancer that has spread to other organs. It is hoped&#xD;
      that this new combination of drugs (nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplatin) will improve&#xD;
      the tumor shrinkage rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done because we do not know whether 2 or 3 chemotherapy drugs is better&#xD;
      to treat biliary cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to learn whether giving nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplatin together in&#xD;
      patients with biliary cancer can increase tumor shrinkage without too many side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) nab-paclitaxel,&#xD;
      gemcitabine, and cisplatin has on you and your biliary cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that there is a large degree of pathologic homology between the&#xD;
      pancreas and biliary tract. Indeed, the biliary tract has been referred to as &quot;an incomplete&#xD;
      pancreas&quot; and embryologically the two originate from the same structure. It is thus plausible&#xD;
      that oncogenesis in the pancreas and biliary tract are related and that pancreas and biliary&#xD;
      cancers have reciprocal effective treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the only chemotherapeutic agents effective in advanced biliary tract tumors is the&#xD;
      combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin. Known and approved therapies for advanced pancreas&#xD;
      cancer include single agent gemcitabine, the four drug combination of FOLFIRINOX&#xD;
      (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan), the questionable limited benefit&#xD;
      of inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway, and most recently the combination&#xD;
      of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on promising results in pancreas cancer, investigators hypothesize nab-paclitaxel in&#xD;
      combination with gemcitabine + cisplatin will be an effective cytotoxic combination in BTC&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
