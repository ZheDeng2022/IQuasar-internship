    <textblock>
      Diagnostic Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging procedures can be stressful for children and&#xD;
      parents. Patients must lie still during the procedure to provide diagnostic quality images.&#xD;
      Children &lt;7 years are often sedated or given general anesthesia (GA) for imaging procedures.&#xD;
      The high cost of GA and its associated risks motivate the search for alternatives. The&#xD;
      overall goal of this study is to systematically investigate whether training on the mock MR&#xD;
      scanner reduces the need for GA during Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      160 participants scheduled for diagnostic MRI scans at Alberta Children's Hospital (ACH) will&#xD;
      be recruited to undergo different training methods for MRI scanning. Group 1 will be sent&#xD;
      links to online videos about MRI, audio files with scanner noises, and a children's book&#xD;
      about MR scans, to prepare at home. Group 2 will receive training materials and visit the ACH&#xD;
      to review them with the research team, but will not use the mock scanner. Group 3 will&#xD;
      receive training materials and visit the ACH for training on the mock MR scanner. Visits to&#xD;
      the mock scanner for Group 3 will include practice lying down, staying still, wearing&#xD;
      headphones, and watching a movie on the mirror system. During and after training sessions,&#xD;
      the investigators will collect data on total time spent preparing (mock scanner or other),&#xD;
      the child's feelings of stress/worry before and after visit, and head motion during mock MRI&#xD;
      session (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be scheduled for a clinical scan without GA and a follow-up clinical scan with&#xD;
      GA (to be cancelled if the first scan is successful). Scan success will be determined by a&#xD;
      radiologist. Measures of scan success, quality ratings for each scan, children's feelings of&#xD;
      stress/worry related to the MRI, and saliva samples to measure cortisol and salivary alpha&#xD;
      amylase, will be gathered at the clinical scan. An ANOVA will be used to compare different&#xD;
      training groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical group of 35 neuro-oncology patients aged 3-7 years of age that undergo frequent&#xD;
      MRI scans will also undergo staged preparation by child life specialists using the mock&#xD;
      scanner. The age at which they are able to complete MRI without general anesthesia will be&#xD;
      compared with a retrospective control group in the 3 years prior. Measures to be used for&#xD;
      this group are the same (with the exception of saliva samples). T test and Kaplan- Meier&#xD;
      analysis will be used to compare age at which MRI can be performed awake.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic MR procedures can be scary and stressful for children and parents. Because&#xD;
      patients must lie still during the procedure to provide diagnostic quality images, young&#xD;
      children (typically &lt;7 years) and others not expected to comply are often sedated or given&#xD;
      general anesthesia (GA) for imaging procedures. However, the high cost of GA and its&#xD;
      associated risks motivate the search for alternatives. Previous reports demonstrate that&#xD;
      preparation (including using a mock MR scanner) reduces anxiety and increases compliance for&#xD;
      clinical and research MRI procedures without GA. However, systematic studies of the&#xD;
      advantages of a mock MR scanner versus other training methods are lacking. Furthermore, while&#xD;
      reducing the use of GA is desirable, repeated unsuccessful scanning procedures are also&#xD;
      costly, so identifying factors that predict success for diagnostic MR procedures is important&#xD;
      to effectively allocate resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study is to systematically investigate whether training on the mock&#xD;
      MR scanner reduces the need for GA during MRI scans in children. There are three specific&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether pre-scan training allows children to have successful diagnostic MRI&#xD;
           scans without general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the effects of different types of pre-scan training on reducing anxiety and&#xD;
           stress in children and their parents related to diagnostic MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine whether mock scanner training can lower the age at which neuro-oncology&#xD;
           patients are able to complete a full diagnostic MRI without anesthesia compared with&#xD;
           historic controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient name, date of birth, and hospital identification number are necessary to perform&#xD;
      chart review and access diagnostic images. All identifying information will be removed prior&#xD;
      to data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected/recorded for each participant at enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study number&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age at time of scan(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Type of diagnostic scans requested&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Parent report on overall stress&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Parent proxy measures of child stress/worry (PedsQL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Parent predictions of child success on MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. (Aim 3 only) Primary Oncology Diagnosis: i) Site ii) Histology&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. (Aim 3 only) Treatment mode i) Surgery ii) Chemotherapy iii) Radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training Sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aims 1 and 2, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three training groups.&#xD;
      Group 1 will be sent links to online videos about MRI, audio files with scanner noises, and a&#xD;
      children's book about MR scans, to prepare at home. Group 2 will receive training materials&#xD;
      and visit the ACH to review them with the research team, but will not use the mock scanner.&#xD;
      Group 3 will receive training materials and visit the ACH for training on the mock MR&#xD;
      scanner. Visits to the mock scanner for Group 3 will include practice lying down, staying&#xD;
      still, wearing headphones, and watching a movie on the mirror system. The Child Life&#xD;
      Specialist will talk with the child and his/her family about the experience, and allow them&#xD;
      up to 1 hour of practice time on the mock scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 3, all participants will receive training on the mock scanner similar to group 3 with&#xD;
      the difference being Child Life Specialists will utilize a goal based preparation of 3 X 20&#xD;
      minute sessions to coincide with other visits to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be booked for one MR scan without GA and one with GA a week later in&#xD;
      case the first scan fails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected during/after training sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total time spent preparing (mock scanner or other)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Child's feelings of stress/worry before and after visit (PedsQL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Head motion during mock MRI session (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic MRI Sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be recorded for each child's MRI scan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Date of MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Child's age at time of scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Scan success without anesthesia (pass/fail)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Number of sequences requiring repeating&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Total scan length (mins)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Sum of individual scan sequence times (mins)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Quality of images, as determined by a pediatric neuro-radiologist and graded as&#xD;
           Excellent (no motion artifact ), Good (minimal motion artifact ); Acceptable (motion&#xD;
           artifact; but satisfactory to answer the clinical question); Unacceptable (significant&#xD;
           motion artifact ; unable to answer the clinical question)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Parent proxy measures of child stress ( PedsQL )&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Child's stress/worry (PedsQL)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. (Aims 1 and 2) Saliva sample to measure cortical and salivary alpha amylase before and&#xD;
           after diagnostic MR scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      If images are deemed suitable for clinical diagnosis, the subsequent GA booking will be&#xD;
      cancelled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No raw images will be retained for any patients outside of their hospital record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 3 prospective data, the above information will be recorded at each scanning session&#xD;
      until the patient is able to complete the entire scan without anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 3 retrospective data: The patient's hospital identification number will be used to&#xD;
      identify MRI scans performed on that patient in the 3 years prior to the study. The MRI&#xD;
      report will be cross referenced with the department of anesthesia electronic database to&#xD;
      determine the date and thereby the age at which MRI without GA was able to be performed. In&#xD;
      the case where the MRI report states that scan was performed under GA but no electronic&#xD;
      record of GA is present the paper chart will be reviewed to determine if GA was performed. If&#xD;
      The MRI scan report does not specify that GA was performed and an anesthesia record for the&#xD;
      MRI exists then scan will be considered to have been performed under GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ANOVA will be used to evaluate group differences on scanning success measures. Additional&#xD;
      analyses will focus on correlations between scan successes and age, sex, measures of&#xD;
      child/parent stress, cortisone, salivary alpha amylase, and training session compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 will also explicitly test differences in the mean age in months at which neuro-oncology&#xD;
      patients were able to successfully complete the diagnostic MRI without anesthesia in the&#xD;
      groups with and without mock scanner training. These will be compared utilizing T-test and&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier Analysis.&#xD;
