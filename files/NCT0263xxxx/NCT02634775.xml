  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffer from one of the most devastating diseases&#xD;
      in childhood resulting in a lifelong need for health care, and a 3 times decreased life&#xD;
      expectancy. In addition, they have important comorbidities that negatively impact on their&#xD;
      quality of life and integration in society, jeopardizing their future even after a potential&#xD;
      transplantation. Retention of uraemic toxins is accepted to play a major role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of the comorbid conditions, but studies in children are lacking. Furthermore,&#xD;
      there are currently no good tools to evaluate severity and monitor adequacy of treatment,&#xD;
      resulting in suboptimal management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall scientific objective of this four years UToPaed IWT-TBM project is to provide the&#xD;
      clinician with new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for the management of children with CKD,&#xD;
      based on the improved understanding of uraemic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In UToPaed (part 1), the investigators will associate concentrations of a wide variety of&#xD;
      uraemic toxins with different comorbidities in CKD children, i.e. growth, protein-energy&#xD;
      wasting, quality of life, cardiovascular risk factors, circadian rhythm, sleep quality, and&#xD;
      psychosocial and neurocognitive functioning (i.e. cross-sectional and longitudinal). Those&#xD;
      toxins of which concentrations are best correlated with comorbidities during the progress of&#xD;
      CKD and those having representative kinetics (UToPaed - part 2: Kinetic analysis) will be&#xD;
      selected as markers. During this third part of UToPaed, these markers will be, together with&#xD;
      the comorbidities, further tracked after interventions, i.e. starting on dialysis,&#xD;
      transplantation, changes in dialysis strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the validated kinetic models (UToPaed - part 2 and 3), an open access user-friendly&#xD;
      prediction simulator (PAEDSIM) based on patient characteristics and marker concentrations&#xD;
      will be developed to optimise and individualise the dialysis therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By providing clinicians with more advanced and appropriate tools to improve management of all&#xD;
      children with CKD, i.e. better assessment of the degree of renal dysfunction, better&#xD;
      determination of the ideal time to start renal replacement therapy, and more accurate&#xD;
      monitoring of dialysis adequacy, the investigators aim to improve neurocognitive and&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning (short term), growth, maturation into puberty, and social&#xD;
      integration (median term) and survival (long term).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional multicenter study in children (â‰¤ 18 years) with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD) stage 2 to 5D with or without renal replacement therapy. They will be followed&#xD;
      for a total duration of 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concentrations of the uraemic toxin markers and the different comorbidities will be followed&#xD;
      after an intervention. Some interventions will just happen in the treatment of the CKD child:&#xD;
      e.g. transplantation, start on dialysis, needed switch from PD to HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the patients on PD, different approaches will be followed: more frequent exchanges&#xD;
      overnight, PET-directed dialysis regimes, adapted PD, using a mix of short, small volume&#xD;
      dwells, with longer, high volume dwells. These different strategies have so far only been&#xD;
      tested using the classic adequacy parameters urea and creatinine. The intervention is that&#xD;
      the children, as included in the longitudinal study, will be studied while on at least two&#xD;
      different PD strategies, serving as their own control, whereby the strategy will be linked&#xD;
      with the concentration of the uraemic toxin markers and comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the patients on HD, different dialysis strategies will be studied: conventional&#xD;
      haemodialysis 3x/week, daily haemodialysis, haemodiafiltration 3x/week, nocturnal 8h dialysis&#xD;
      3x/week, and the optimal dialysis regime as derived from the kinetic analysis (UToPaed_2).&#xD;
      The intervention is that the children, as included in the longitudinal study, will be studied&#xD;
      with at least 2 of the strategies, and that differences in plasma concentrations and removal&#xD;
      rate of the uraemic toxin markers will be measured. The measured predialysis concentrations,&#xD;
      time averaged concentrations (TACs), and total solute removal with the different strategies&#xD;
      will be compared to the results of the kinetic simulations in order to validate the&#xD;
      calibrated kinetic models of the uraemic toxin markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results, guidance on the most optimal dialysis strategy for each child will be&#xD;
      developed, and the child will consequently be treated on that modality during 1 year, to&#xD;
      allow evaluation of the longer term impact on quality of life, catch up growth, study results&#xD;
      and emergence of new comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic tool comprises an open access user-friendly prediction simulator, based on&#xD;
      the kinetics of the new markers (PAEDSIM) to simulate different dialysis strategies. With&#xD;
      different patient characteristics and uraemic toxin concentrations as input for the&#xD;
      simulation model, the program will derive the optimal dialysis strategy for the individual&#xD;
      patient striving for low predialysis concentrations and TACs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical use of these findings will be promoted by the organisation of a 'CKD Academy'&#xD;
      with workshops about the prediction simulator (PAEDSIM) and the related laboratory techniques&#xD;
      (see utilisation strategies).&#xD;
