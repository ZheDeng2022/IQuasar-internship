  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and in particular T cells play a critical role in the rejection&#xD;
      of transplanted organs. Thus, in transplant recipients a life-long and individualized&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medication is required to avoid graft rejection. However, a too weak&#xD;
      suppression of CMI causes acute and chronic graft damage leading to transplant loss, whereas&#xD;
      a too potent suppression of CMI supports opportunistic infections and reactivation of&#xD;
      persistent viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the biggest challenges in the field of transplantation is to provide a personalized&#xD;
      immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy based on reliable assessment and monitoring of CMI.&#xD;
      This could lead to a reduction of graft rejections and virus reactivations in transplant&#xD;
      recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the development of both assays T-Track® CMV and T-Track® EBV, Lophius Biosciences GmbH&#xD;
      has implemented its novel proprietary T-activation technology for an improved assessment of&#xD;
      the functionality of CMI in cytomegalovirus (CMV)- and/or Epstein-Barr virus&#xD;
      (EBV)-seropositive individuals. In contrast to other existing systems the Lophius assays open&#xD;
      up the opportunity to characterize the functionality of CMI as an entire network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned clinical multicenter study aims to verify the suitability of the two assays for a&#xD;
      reliable assessment of the functionality of CMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodialysis patients have been identified as an appropriate patient cohort for investigating&#xD;
      the clinical sensitivity of the Lophius assays as these patients closely resemble kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients prior to an immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The determination of the functional CMI in the course of an immunosuppressive treatment may&#xD;
      in future enable physicians to optimize the individual immunosuppressive and antiviral&#xD;
      therapy in transplant recipients to reduce the risk of rejection as well as virus&#xD;
      reactivations and associated diseases.&#xD;

    <description>Determination of the clinical sensitivity of T-Track® CMV and T-Track® EBV. T-Track® assays are based on the stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with preselected immunodominant T-activated proteins derived from the human Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and the Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV) and the subsequent quantification of IFN-gamma producing blood leucocytes (Lophius biomarker for assessing the functionality of CMI) applying ELISpot technology.</description>
