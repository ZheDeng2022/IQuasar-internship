      This randomised double-blind, controlled phase IV trial will compare the efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of preoperative IV iron with placebo in patients with anaemia before&#xD;
      elective cardiac surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Preoperative anaemia is common (≈30%) in patients awaiting cardiac surgery, and is associated&#xD;
      with increased complications, ICU and hospital stay, and mortality. The extent of anaemia is&#xD;
      worsened by haemodilution occurring with cardiopulmonary bypass and surgical bleeding&#xD;
      (average blood loss 0.5-1.5 litres), which in turn impair end-organ blood flow and tissue&#xD;
      oxygen delivery. Further, the need for blood transfusion is greatly increased in anaemic&#xD;
      patients, and is associated with poor outcomes. In addition, blood transfusions are costly&#xD;
      (&gt;$700 per unit), with around 50% of all transfusions used in surgery being for cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. The investigators have identified high rates of bleeding complications and&#xD;
      transfusion requirements in Australian cardiac surgery; and in another international&#xD;
      collaboration, it was found that anaemia, transfusion and kidney injury are inter-related&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery. After risk-adjustment, the combination of these three risk factors was&#xD;
      associated with a 3.5-fold (95% CI 2.3-5.2) increased odds of kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both anaemia and red cell transfusion are independent risk factors in major surgery. Some of&#xD;
      the investigators reviewed Australian cardiac surgery patients from six Victorian hospitals,&#xD;
      2005-2011. We linked the ANZ Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons cardiac surgery database to&#xD;
      laboratory data, including preoperative haemoglobin and all issued blood products (manuscript&#xD;
      in preparation). Anaemia was defined according to the WHO definition (Hb &lt;130 g/L for males&#xD;
      and &lt;120 g/L for females). There were 15,948 cardiac surgery patients available for inclusion&#xD;
      in the analysis, of which 28% were anaemic. Anaemic patients were more likely to receive a&#xD;
      red cell transfusion (71% vs. 40%, p&lt;0.001), more transfused units of blood (median 4 [IQR&#xD;
      2-8] vs. 3 [2-5], p&lt;0.001), and had higher 30-day mortality (5.4% vs. 1.9%, p&lt;0.001), new&#xD;
      renal failure (43% vs. 26%, p&lt;0.001), and longer hospital stay in survivors (13 days [8-23]&#xD;
      vs. 8 days [6-14], p&lt;0.001). After multivariable adjustment, preoperative anaemia was an&#xD;
      independent predictor of mortality (adj. OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.14-1.88, p=0.003). Similar results&#xD;
      were obtained when restricted to elective surgery, but with hospital stay 9 days (7-17) vs. 7&#xD;
      days (6-11), p&lt;0.001. Other large studies are consistent with this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have also analysed data for patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery&#xD;
      from the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database&#xD;
      (a validated outcomes registry from 211 hospitals worldwide). In 227,425 patients undergoing&#xD;
      noncardiac surgery, and found that preoperative anaemia was associated with increased 30-day&#xD;
      mortality (adj. OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.31-1.54) and morbidity (adj. OR 1.35, 1.30-1.40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alfred hospital (Melbourne) transfusion data for 2012-14 (n=2,091) show that anaemic (27% of&#xD;
      cohort) and non-anaemic cardiac surgical patients had intraoperative red cell transfusion&#xD;
      rates of 31% and 14%, respectively; p&lt;0.01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of anaemia worldwide, and iron deficiency per se&#xD;
      independently worsens outcomes after surgery. The traditional textbook definition of iron&#xD;
      deficiency anaemia refers to depletion of the body's iron stores due to dietary deficiency or&#xD;
      chronic blood loss - an absolute iron deficiency. Chronic disease and inflammation have a&#xD;
      direct effect in the pathway of iron absorption and metabolism leading to a state of&#xD;
      functional iron deficiency and anaemia. Specifically, the iron regulatory protein hepcidin is&#xD;
      upregulated, blocking pathways of iron transport. This prevents iron absorption from the gut,&#xD;
      further uptake by the reticuloendothelial system increases stores (ferritin), but&#xD;
      distribution and transfer to the bone marrow is blocked. Consequently, despite normal or even&#xD;
      increased body iron stores (with normal ferritin levels), these are artifactual, and a state&#xD;
      of 'functional iron deficiency' exists. This is commonly seen in renal and cardiac disease&#xD;
      and increasingly recognised as a cause for anaemia in the surgical patient. Importantly, IV&#xD;
      iron has been shown to overcome this functional deficiency and correct anaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV iron therapy is effective in treating anaemia in medical (heart failure, kidney disease),&#xD;
      post-partum, and preoperative settings (orthopaedic surgery, colon cancer resection,&#xD;
      hysterectomy, hip/knee joint replacement. Earlier IV iron preparations using high molecular&#xD;
      weight dextran were associated with anaphylaxis due to pre-formed antibodies, but newer&#xD;
      preparations are safer, enabling delivery of a full treatment dose in 15 mins, so iron can be&#xD;
      administered safely and quickly in outpatients. It is now readily available in Australia and&#xD;
      is PBS-listed. This gives patients the equivalent dose of 12 months of tablets in only 15&#xD;
      mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency is very common in patients having coronary artery surgery. It is highly&#xD;
      plausible that anaemia correction will improve patient outcome following cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.However, some data suggest that free iron mediates free radical production associated&#xD;
      with organ damage or infection in surgery and this balance between effective anaemia&#xD;
      correction and potential risk needs further research. A definitive large trial is needed to&#xD;
      determine if IV iron safely, effectively, and promptly corrects preoperative anaemia, and&#xD;
      thus reduces risk in cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators undertook a Cochrane review of iron therapy to treat anaemia in adults&#xD;
      including 4,745 participants in 21 trials. This found a trend for better haemoglobin levels&#xD;
      with IV iron (MD 0.50 g/dL, 95% CI 0.73-0.27; six studies, N=769) but with considerable,&#xD;
      unexplained heterogeneity. Differences in the proportion of participants requiring&#xD;
      transfusion were imprecise (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66-1.06; 8 studies, N=1,315). Thus the current&#xD;
      evidence base is sparse; few randomised trials have been done and these were too small -&#xD;
      there remains considerable equipoise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of the literature on anaemia and iron therapy in cardiac surgery, which included 4&#xD;
      small trials of IV iron. Overall, half of all cardiac surgery patients were anaemic before&#xD;
      surgery. Preoperative anaemia was found to be independently associated with higher mortality&#xD;
      and blood transfusion rate, as well as longer ICU and hospital stay. As also shown by others,&#xD;
      preoperative haematocrit was a powerful independent predictor of mortality, renal failure and&#xD;
      deep sternal wound infection. In adjusted analyses each 5 point decrease in preoperative&#xD;
      haematocrit was associated with an 8% increased risk of death (OR, 1.08; p&lt;0.0003), a 22%&#xD;
      increased risk of postoperative renal failure (OR, 1.22; p&lt;0.0001), and a 10% increased risk&#xD;
      of deep sternal wound infection (OR, 1.10; p&lt;0.01). There is a need for a well-designed,&#xD;
      pragmatic trial to assess the role of preoperative anaemia treatment using IV iron in&#xD;
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
