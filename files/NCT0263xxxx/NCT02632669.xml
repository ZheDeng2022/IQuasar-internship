    <textblock>
      This clinical study will evaluate side effects, quality of life and cancer control in&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer diagnosed on only one side of the prostate gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of unilateral prostate cancer will be made by means of a prostate transperineal&#xD;
      template biopsy (TTB) and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with low dose rate brachytherapy, using permanent iodine seed&#xD;
      implants.Treatment will be limited to the side of the gland where the cancer has been&#xD;
      diagnosed and is therefore called &quot;focal&quot; brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate brachytherapy is usually applied to the whole prostate gland. After whole gland&#xD;
      prostate brachytherapy urinary, bowel and sexual function may be affected. In this focal&#xD;
      approach, the side effects will be evaluated by means of patient questionnaires.These will be&#xD;
      repeated at various intervals after treatment.The results will be compared to the same&#xD;
      questionnaires responded by patients who have undergone whole gland brachytherapy.Therefore&#xD;
      an assessment can be made whether focal therapy produces fewer side effects than whole gland&#xD;
      brachytherapy.The observation period will last for two years after treatment. A biopsy and&#xD;
      mpMRI will be repeated after two years to evaluate prostate cancer control.&#xD;

      This is a pilot Stage IIS study to evaluate the feasibility of performing a larger&#xD;
      multicentre trial.The HAPpy study is a prospective development study offering hemi ablative&#xD;
      LDR brachytherapy to 34 men with histologically proven low or intermediate risk localised&#xD;
      prostate adenocarcinoma which affects a single lobe of the prostate.The data obtained from&#xD;
      these 34 patients will be compared to matched patients from a retrospective cohort of whole&#xD;
      gland brachytherapy patients treated in the same institution.Precise mapping and&#xD;
      characterisation of the disease will be established using mp-MRI (T2-weighted and&#xD;
      DCE(gadolinium)) imaging and transperineal template biopsy (TTB). Only the lobes with disease&#xD;
      (left or right half of the gland) will be treated provided that the contralateral side is&#xD;
      free of disease. Patients will be followed for two years post treatment at which time a&#xD;
      further mp-MRI and TTB will confirm disease control outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focal therapy for prostate cancer is a new idea and is considered an experimental treatment&#xD;
      which needs to be evaluated within carefully conducted clinical trials . Rather than&#xD;
      investigating focal therapy in a strict sense where only known areas of disease are treated,&#xD;
      a more conservative approach needs to be taken until more information can be obtained&#xD;
      regarding the outcomes of changing treatment techniques. Hemi-ablative focal therapy is&#xD;
      considered to be a low-risk treatment and investigations into the performance of the&#xD;
      technique should provide a pathway for future investigations of less conservative&#xD;
      methodologies. Hemi-ablative focal therapy treats half of the prostate gland with a treatment&#xD;
      margin, effectively treating at least 50% of the whole gland with a prescription dose. In&#xD;
      theory, this should lessen the side effects associated with radical treatment while still&#xD;
      maintaining disease control.This type of treatment is only suitable for patients with&#xD;
      unilateral disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An international group of experts was established to form a consensus on how to design and&#xD;
      conduct an LDR focal brachytherapy program for clinical trials. The group's findings were&#xD;
      published by Langley et al and a dosimetric modelling study by Al Qaisieh et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focal hemi gland brachytherapy will be delivered by means of an adaptation of same real-time&#xD;
      planning technique (denominated 4D Brachytherapy) used to deliver whole gland LDR prostate&#xD;
      brachytherapy. Stranded iodine 125 sources are implanted on the periphery of the prostate&#xD;
      gland and loose iodine 125 sources are implanted within the central volume of the gland.&#xD;
      Because all planning and dosimetry are done in real-time, radiotherapy physics will be able&#xD;
      to adhere to the strict planning protocols required for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment planning: For standard whole-gland treatment, the whole prostate gland is&#xD;
      delineated to form the Planning Target Volume (PTV) and the V100 is planned such that it&#xD;
      covers the entire PTV plus a 0.5cm margin. For hemi-ablative focal treatments, the prostate&#xD;
      will be divided into half and a new HTV (called the HemiTreatment Volume) is outlined on the&#xD;
      side of the prostate determined to have clinically significant disease. A treatment margin of&#xD;
      0.5cm is considered around the HTV, which is similar when planning whole-gland treatment. In&#xD;
      this way, &gt;95% of the HTV is aimed to receive 100% of the prescription dose (V100). The V150&#xD;
      is situated in a semi-horseshoe shape in order to spare the urethra from high doses of&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose parameters to critical organs are as follows:-&#xD;
&#xD;
      HEMI PROSTATE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescription Dose 145Gy V100 = &gt;95% V150 = 50-60% D90 = 140 - 160 Gy&#xD;
&#xD;
      URETHRA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      V150 &lt;15%&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECTUM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      D0.1cc &lt;200 Gy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial design follows recommendations published by the Balliol Collaboration under the&#xD;
      Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term follow-up (IDEAL) model for a surgical&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample Size- Pilot Study There are no published results available and this technique has&#xD;
           not been trialed to determine its effectiveness in disease control and quality of life&#xD;
           outcomes. As such, a preliminary study is necessary to determine efficacy and&#xD;
           feasibility before a large, multi-centre trial can be performed where a significant&#xD;
           number of patients can be recruited for appropriate statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The trial site currently treats ~300 patients per year for whole-gland brachytherapy. Of&#xD;
           these 300 patients, ~25% present with unilateral disease that is low and intermediate&#xD;
           risk. Recruitment will be over 18 months, in which time 100 patients should be eligible&#xD;
           for the HAPpy trial. We anticipate a 25% drop-out rate after mp- MRI and template&#xD;
           prostate mapping (TPM) biopsy results and a further 25% drop-out due to refusal to&#xD;
           participate. This means that ~50 patients should be available for recruitment into the&#xD;
           study over an 18 month period. In order to assess a decrease in side-effects (based on&#xD;
           quality of life (QoL)) data of at least 10%, 34 patients will be required for the study.&#xD;
           This is comparing two independent groups (prospective hemi group versus retrospective&#xD;
           whole-gland group) when using α = 5%, β = 10%, and σ = 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data collection The main research co-ordinator is a qualified and experienced data&#xD;
           manager. Data will be collected in both paper and electronic form and the data will be&#xD;
           stored in one place and backed up twice on two different servers. Data will be held&#xD;
           according to the Data Protection Act 1998 and pseudo anonymised as necessary. Each&#xD;
           participant will be given a study number and this will be used on all of their study&#xD;
           records. The patient number will be known to the chief investigator, the research&#xD;
           co-ordinator, and the research radiographer or nurse assigned to the study. Data will be&#xD;
           kept in a secure manner in the research offices with access to named individuals from&#xD;
           the study group only. The paper records will be kept for a minimum of 10 years after the&#xD;
           end of the study. A research radiographer or nurse will be appointed at the time of&#xD;
           trial commencement to ensure that the Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaires are completed&#xD;
           at each follow-up visit as required by the trial protocol. The research radiographer or&#xD;
           nurse is also responsible for ensuring that each patient in the trial has appropriate&#xD;
           appointments set up for each treatment, scanning (mp-MRI, biopsy), and follow-up visit&#xD;
           and the necessary information is collected at each visit under the protocol. All clinic&#xD;
           visit information including questionnaires, scans, biopsy results, and blood results&#xD;
           will be kept in study records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analysis Thirty-four patients will be examined in the HAPpy trial and with this small&#xD;
           sample number, non-parametric analysis of the data will be the most suitable. Patients&#xD;
           will be paired or matched according to their tumour staging and pathology, age, and&#xD;
           baseline scores. The Mann-Whitney U test, the Wilcoxon test, as well as tests for&#xD;
           normality (if appropriate) of the data will be performed to determine if there are&#xD;
           differences in the trial groups. Analysis of variance will be performed if the data is&#xD;
           appropriate to use in this manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data to be collected:- IPSS + QoL questionnaire = Numerical scores, time-points IIEF-5&#xD;
           QoL questionnaire = Numerical scores, time-points EORTC-QLQ-PR25 bowel symptoms&#xD;
           questionnaire = Numerical scores, time-points Dosimetry Values for PTV and HTV =&#xD;
           Numerical V100, V150, D90 = Numerical Dose to the Urethra (V150) = Numerical Dose to the&#xD;
           Rectum (D0.1cc) = Numerical Pathology review of biopsies (all) Standard reporting,&#xD;
           qualitative, ranked mm of core invaded = Numerical Biopsy % core invaded = Numerical&#xD;
           Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) = Numerical, time-points EN2 = Numerical, time-points&#xD;
           Gleason Score= Numerical Staging = Standard reporting, qualitative, ranked&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcomes will be reported as estimates with 95% confidence intervals using appropriate&#xD;
           methods based on the type of data. For patient reported outcomes with available baseline&#xD;
           measurements, a comparison will be made with baseline values using paired analyses.&#xD;
           Logistic regression will be used to investigate associations with potential risk factors&#xD;
           for histological failure, considering PSA and EN2, Gleason score, cancer core length&#xD;
           involvement (mm and %), number and % of positive biopsies for any cancer on TTB, stage&#xD;
           and risk group. Sensitivity and specificity (with 95% confidence intervals) will be&#xD;
           estimated in considering the use of standard PSA kinetics and thresholds for identifying&#xD;
           clinically significant cancer. Scores from the quality of life questionnaires will be&#xD;
           used in multivariable cross-sectional and longitudinal regression analysis comparing the&#xD;
           treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dosimetric evaluation to the PTV, HTV, and structures (urethra, rectum,bladder) will be&#xD;
           performed (ultrasound real-time planning and post-operative CT). The dosimetry will be&#xD;
           correlated with QoL information and disease control outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Results from the TTB will be compared with the mp-MRI scans to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
           using mp-MRI for diagnosis of disease. Disease modelling in three dimensions may be&#xD;
           performed if a suitable physicist can be found to perform such an analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           EN2 and PSA evaluation over time will be examined using regression analysis and compared&#xD;
           between the two trial arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Biopsy and mp-MRI results at 2-years (disease control outcomes) will be compared with&#xD;
           pre-treatment biopsy and mp-MRI data and correlated with QoL information and dosimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thirty-four patients will be examined in the HAPpy trial and with this small sample&#xD;
           number, non-parametric analysis of the data will be the most suitable. Patients will be&#xD;
           paired or matched according to their tumour staging and pathology, age, and baseline&#xD;
           scores. The Mann-Whitney U test, the Wilcoxon test, as well as tests for normality (if&#xD;
           appropriate) of the data will be performed on the data to determine if there are&#xD;
           differences in the trial groups. Analysis of variance will be performed if the data is&#xD;
           appropriate to use in this manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reporting of Results The data will be analysed and submitted for peer reviewed journals&#xD;
           for publication as full manuscripts. Abstracts to conferences will also be submitted for&#xD;
           poster or oral presentation. An interim analysis at 12 months using histological and&#xD;
           imaging data will be performed once sufficient data are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and reporting of results will follow the guidelines outlined in CONSORT and&#xD;
      STROBE for clinical trials.&#xD;
