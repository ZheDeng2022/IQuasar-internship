  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      80% of palliative care cancer patients suffer from severe pain. The management of these pain&#xD;
      improves the quality of life of these patients. The management of opioid pain refractory to&#xD;
      date remains a difficulty for caregivers. Hypophysectomy performed to try to control&#xD;
      hormone-dependent neoplasia also help relieve pain associated with lesions secondary cancer.&#xD;
      The surgical hypophysialis radio Gamma Knife ® was recently performed on a small number of&#xD;
      patients. She would have the advantage of reducing the risk of complications compared to&#xD;
      other techniques and achieve similar analgesic effect on diffuse, or mixed nociceptive pain&#xD;
      associated with metastases on average in 2 days and would reduce or stop opiates most often&#xD;
      responsible for side effects impairing the quality of life. The objective of this clinical&#xD;
      trial, multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled is to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      surgical hypophysialis radio for patients in palliative situations with refractory cancer&#xD;
      pain in opioid level III. The type of pain &quot;cancer pain&quot; was done in order to optimize the&#xD;
      recruitment and homogenization of the study population: patients cared for in palliative care&#xD;
      units are mostly patients cancer (70-80%). This study is therefore part of a palliative&#xD;
      setting and the results of this test can be extrapolated to other populations of palliative&#xD;
      patients with refractory pain.&#xD;
