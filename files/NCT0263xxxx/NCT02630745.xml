      The aim of the study is to conduct a prospective randomized clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of immediate and delayed surgical periodontal therapy after non-surgical endodontic&#xD;
      treatment on periodontal healing of the concurrent endodontic -periodontal lesion with&#xD;
      communication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observations based upon review articles and case reports has suggested, if the root canal&#xD;
      system is infected, endodontic treatment should be commenced prior to any periodontal therapy&#xD;
      in order to remove the intra canal infection before any cementum is removed in case of&#xD;
      concurrent endodontic-periodontic lesions without communication. This avoids several&#xD;
      complications and provides a more favourable environment for periodontal repair. Treatment&#xD;
      results of endodontic therapy should be evaluated in 2-3 months and only then periodontal&#xD;
      treatment should be considered. But review articles states that teeth that have concurrent&#xD;
      endodontic and periodontal diseases that communicate with each other will require&#xD;
      comprehensive treatment with both endodontic and periodontal management. Ideally both&#xD;
      infections should be removed before the root canal filling and any final restorations are&#xD;
      provided. Completion of the root canal filling should be delayed until the periodontal&#xD;
      prognosis has been reassessed and determined following initial, and often further,&#xD;
      periodontal treatment. Though Infected root canal systems and periodontal pockets have&#xD;
      similar microbiological flora, there are more microbes and more species of spirochetes in&#xD;
      periodontal pockets than in infected root canal systems, and the microflora in infected root&#xD;
      canals of teeth that have concurrent endodontic and periodontal diseases is more complex than&#xD;
      in teeth with infection confined to the periapical region. So the outcome of endodontic&#xD;
      treatment may be affected if the root canal filling is placed while there is still a&#xD;
      periodontal infection present that communicates with the root canal system since&#xD;
      cross-seeding through the apical or lateral foramina is possible. An In-vitro study on human&#xD;
      extracted teeth states that despite thorough cleaning and disinfection of the root canal&#xD;
      system during endodontic treatment, bacteria from the periodontal lesion may re-invade the&#xD;
      root canal system since root canal fillings do not seal canals completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the above findings are based on microbiological,histological,case-reports,retrospective&#xD;
      and in-vitro studies.The timing of periodontal treatment in concurrent endodontic&#xD;
      -periodontal lesions with communication still remains a issue of debate.No prospective human&#xD;
      clinical trial(randomized) has been conducted till date to ascertain whether surgical&#xD;
      periodontal treatment should be given immediately after completion of non-surgical endodontic&#xD;
      treatment or 2-3 months after completion of non-surgical endodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the aim of our study is to conduct a prospective randomized clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of immediate and delayed surgical periodontal therapy after non-surgical&#xD;
      endodontic treatment for the management of concurrent endodontic -periodontal lesion with&#xD;
      communication.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY Patients were randomly allocated to group1 and group 2. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted as follows:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Presurgical therapy:- which will be including&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Oral hygiene instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Full mouth supragingival and subgingival scaling and root planning with ultrasonic&#xD;
                scaler, hand scaler and curettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Conventional root canal therapy will be initiated in both the groups before&#xD;
                definite periodontal surgical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Surgical therapy:- In group 1 periodontal surgical procedure in the form of open flap&#xD;
           debridement will be performed immediately after obturation of the root canal system In&#xD;
           group 2 periodontal surgical procedure in the form of open flap debridement will be&#xD;
           performed 3 months after obturation of the root canal system Prior to surgery, a probing&#xD;
           stent will be fabricated for every patient,relative to which attachment loss will be&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL PARAMETERS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Full mouth indices to be recorded at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bleeding on probing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Probing Pocket depth&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Attachment loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Site specific indices&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Plaque index&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gingival index&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relative Probing Pocket depth&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relative attachment loss&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bleeding on probing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tooth mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relative gingival marginal level Using periodontal probe at 6 sites (mesial,&#xD;
                distal, median points at buccal and lingual aspects) per tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Customized bite blocks and parallel angle technique will be used to obtain radiographs&#xD;
      Clinical parameters will be recorded at baseline, 3 months and 6 months for Group 1(immediate&#xD;
      surgery) Clinical parameters will be recorded at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 9 months&#xD;
      for Group 2(delayed surgery) PERIODONTAL PROCEDURE This involves supragingival and&#xD;
      subgingival scaling and root planning to be performed with ultrasonic scaler, hand scaler and&#xD;
      curette and will be completed in minimum two sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONVENTIONAL ENDODONTIC PROCEDURE After achieving local anaesthesia, access opening will be&#xD;
      made with the help of round bur. Then the root canal will be thoroughly debrided followed by&#xD;
      copious irrigation and subsequently prepared with the help of endo files. After preparation&#xD;
      of the canal, calcium hydroxide intracanal medicament will be placed with the help of 27&#xD;
      gauge endodontic syringe for 10 days and access cavity will be sealed with suitable sealer.&#xD;
      Obturation will be performed with gutta percha and zinc oxide eugenol based sealer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERIODONTAL SURGICAL PROCEDURE After administration of local anaesthesia, buccal and&#xD;
      lingual/palatal intracrevicular incision will be made and mucoperiosteal flaps will be&#xD;
      reflected including atleast one tooth ahead and another behind the tooth. Meticulous defect&#xD;
      debridement and root planning will be carried out using area specific curettes and scalers&#xD;
      with special effort to remove all the granulation tissue. After instrumentation, the root&#xD;
      surfaces will be washed with saline solution in attempt to remove any remaining detached&#xD;
      fragments from the defect and surgical field. After debridement mucoperiosteal flaps will be&#xD;
      repositioned and secured by using 3-0 non-absorbable black silk surgical suture. The surgical&#xD;
      area will be protected and covered with periodontal dressing and post operative instructions&#xD;
      will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processing of Data Data recorded will be processed by standard statistical analysis.&#xD;
