  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect whole blood and plasma venous and capillary samples&#xD;
      from participants taking aripiprazole, olanzapine, paliperidone, or risperidone for the&#xD;
      development of antipsychotic immunoassays.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 0, multicenter (when more than one hospital work on a medical research study)&#xD;
      study including participants taking aripiprazole, olanzapine, paliperidone or risperidone.&#xD;
      Participants will provide blood samples to be used in development of antipsychotic&#xD;
      immunoassays. At different times, assay development will require venous, capillary, or both&#xD;
      types of blood samples. Overall, at a single study visit, a minimum of approximately 0.1&#xD;
      milliliter (mL) to a maximum of approximately 15 mL of blood will be collected from all&#xD;
      sources. Across all study visits, a maximum of 450 mL of blood will be collected from a&#xD;
      participant. The frequency of collections (study visits) will depend on the needs of assay&#xD;
      development. A particular participant may participate for only 1 sample collection or&#xD;
      multiple sample collections (study visits). This study will continue for an indefinite period&#xD;
      of time. The participant's direct involvement in the study will be continued until the study&#xD;
      is ended, the participant has given 450 mL of blood, or the participant withdraws consent or&#xD;
      is excluded from participation for medical and/or inclusion/exclusion criteria reasons.&#xD;
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
