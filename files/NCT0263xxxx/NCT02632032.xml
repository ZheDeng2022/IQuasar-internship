  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic education is central to the management of diabetes, especially in children and&#xD;
      adolescents. Camps represent an ideal environment for education. During camps, the campers&#xD;
      receive both theoretical and practical information intended to improve their understanding&#xD;
      and self-management of diabetes. The metabolic impact of diabetes camp is little known among&#xD;
      children and adolescents living with type 1 diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa. The aimed of this&#xD;
      study was to assess the changes in glycemic control and insulin doses in a group of children&#xD;
      and adolescents living with type 1 diabetes in Cameroon during and after camp.&#xD;

      Participants and setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators analyzed the data of children and adolescents living with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes in Cameroon who attended the diabetes camp organized in Yaoundé in July 2013&#xD;
      and who came back for follow up at the CDiC clinic of the Yaoundé Central Hospital, 3 and 12&#xD;
      months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Changing Diabetes in Children&quot; (CDiC) project offers logistics and free medical care to&#xD;
      children living with type 1 diabetes in Cameroon, which includes free medical consultations,&#xD;
      insulin, syringes, a glucose meter (Accu Check Active®, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,&#xD;
      Germany) glucose strips, HbA1c monitoring every 3 months, collective therapeutic education&#xD;
      sessions every 3 months and a yearly screening for complications. All children enrolled in&#xD;
      the project have a systematic visit every three months. During this visit, clinical and&#xD;
      biological assessment are done, also adjustment of treatment, therapeutic education and&#xD;
      record of data in the medical record. Many children also consult outside systematic visits to&#xD;
      collect the material for treatment or in case of an emergency related or not with diabetes.&#xD;
      The forms of insulin available in the project are regular insulin (Actrapid®),&#xD;
      intermediate-acting insulin (Insulatard®) and pre-mixed insulin (Mixtard 30®). HbA1c is&#xD;
      assessed by the in2it™ point-of-care system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Deeside, UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CDiC program organizes a 5-day camp for about 50 children twice yearly. Participants are&#xD;
      selected by the health care personnel who follow them, based on the availability of places&#xD;
      and on the proximity to their homes. Children of less than 6 years old, those with an acute&#xD;
      disease and those with incomplete recovery from a previous illness are not allowed to camp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Camp organization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians before inclusion and a&#xD;
      medical insurance was contracted for campers and the camp staff. The camp staff was made of a&#xD;
      pediatric endocrinologist, an adult endocrinologist, 3 general physicians, 4 nurses, a&#xD;
      dietician and a sport coach. The leisure program during the camp included education&#xD;
      workshops, games, sporting activities, a visit to an animal reserve and a dinner in a&#xD;
      restaurant in town. Meals offered to the children attending the camp were prepared following&#xD;
      the instructions of the dietician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocols and insulin doses of each camper were maintained upon arrival. However,&#xD;
      during the camp and before every meal, the dose of insulin to be injected was analyzed and&#xD;
      eventually modified by the physician based on the results of self-monitoring of blood&#xD;
      glucose, the quantity of carbohydrates to be ingested, and the level of physical activity to&#xD;
      be performed. Notwithstanding, the treatment protocols could still be modified for some&#xD;
      camper who were poorly controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of camp, a prescription was done for every campers and an adjustment of doses was&#xD;
      made based on capillary glucose. Capillary glucose was measured six times a day (Before and 2&#xD;
      hours after the 3 main daily meals), and as needed (Before and after an intense physical&#xD;
      activity, and in case of a symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia). Finally, all information on&#xD;
      each camper (injected insulin doses, capillary blood glucose, HbA1c, weight and eventual&#xD;
      malaise) were recorded in a self-monitoring booklet by the camper always under supervision of&#xD;
      a camp staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-camp data collection Campers were later on routinely followed at the CDiC clinic of the&#xD;
      Yaoundé Central Hospital. Of the 46 patients who attended the camp, only 32 who came for&#xD;
      follow up 3 and 12 months later were included in further analyses. Data on age, gender,&#xD;
      duration of diabetes, duration of follow up in the CDiC project, weight, insulin regimen and&#xD;
      insulin doses at the beginning, at 3 and 12 months after camp, HbA1c at the beginning, at 3&#xD;
      and at 12 months after camp, and the daily number hypoglycemic episodes during camp were&#xD;
      collected. Good glycemic control was defined as HbA1c &lt;7.5% and hypoglycemia as capillary&#xD;
      glucose &lt; 70mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 12&#xD;
      (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL USA). Results are presented as mean and standard deviation or median&#xD;
      [interquartile range] for continuous variables and as count (percentage) for discrete&#xD;
      variables. Proportions were compared by the Z test for two proportions, means by repeated&#xD;
      measure ANOVA, paired t test or independent t test where appropriate and medians by the&#xD;
      Wilcoxon rank sum test. Where necessary continuous variables were categorized using the&#xD;
      median as cutoff. A p-value &lt; 0.05 was used to characterize statistically significant&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations Prior to enrolment in the CDiC project, a written informed consent&#xD;
      form was signed by the parent or guardian authorizing the CDiC project in Cameroon to use the&#xD;
      data obtained for research. A written informed consent was also obtained from parents or&#xD;
      guardians before enrolment in camp. The CDiC project has also received approval from the&#xD;
      National Ethics Committee of Cameroon (Autorisation N 271/CNE/SE/2011) to carry out research&#xD;
      from data obtained in the project.&#xD;
