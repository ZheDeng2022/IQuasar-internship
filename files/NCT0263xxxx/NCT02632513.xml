      The aim of this study was to compare the success after endodontic treatment performed with or&#xD;
      without continuous ultrasonic irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      70 Mandibular molars with diagnosis of pulpal necrosis and with periapical radiolucency were&#xD;
      randomly assigned into two treatment groups- continuous ultrasonic irrigation (CUI) and&#xD;
      syringe irrigation (SI). Standard nonsurgical endodontic treatment was performed on both&#xD;
      groups under rubber dam isolation with 0.02 taper ISO stainless steel hand files using step&#xD;
      back technique. In both groups, 5 ml of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite was used as irrigant after&#xD;
      each instrument. After root canal instrumentation, canals were irrigated with 5 ml of 17%&#xD;
      EDTA solution for 1 minute. In SI group, canals were flushed with 15ml of 5.25% sodium&#xD;
      hypochlorite using a 27 gauge needle while final irrigant was delivered using a continuous&#xD;
      ultrasonic irrigation device in CUI group. An inter-appointment dressing of calcium hydroxide&#xD;
      was given and patient was recalled after one week and canals were obturated with the Gutta&#xD;
      Percha. Immediate postoperative radiograph was then taken, followed by radiographs at 3, 6, 9&#xD;
      and 12 months.&#xD;

      Title: Effect of passive ultrasonic irrigation on success of primary endodontic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well established that apical periodontitis is caused due to microbial invasion of root&#xD;
      canal space. It is an inflammatory disease process comprising host responses to infection of&#xD;
      the root canal system of the affected tooth. So, it becomes important to render the root&#xD;
      canals free of microorganisms and pathological debris to treat apical periodontitis.&#xD;
      Mechanical instrumentation plays an important role in removing microorganisms from the root&#xD;
      canal system but it is incapable of rendering canal completely free of bacteria. The&#xD;
      intricacies of the root canal system such as fins, isthmi, apical ramifications hinder its&#xD;
      complete debridement as these areas are inaccessible to mechanical instrumentation. These&#xD;
      complexities continue to harbour bacteria, necrotic tissue and debris and results in&#xD;
      persistent periapical inflammation. Thus adjunctive use of root canal irrigant becomes&#xD;
      important. Mechanical cleaning of root canals aided by antimicrobial irrigation, thus, are&#xD;
      two key elements that help in reducing the bacterial load of root canal and treating apical&#xD;
      periodontitis. Irrigation forms an integral part of chemomechanical preparation by&#xD;
      facilitating the removal of bacteria, debris and necrotic tissue, especially from areas&#xD;
      beyond the reach of root canal instruments. Sodium hypochlorite is recommended as the main&#xD;
      irrigant during root canal treatment because of its antimicrobial efficacy as well as its&#xD;
      tissue-dissolving capacity but its effectiveness in root canal depends on the irrigant's&#xD;
      penetration along the full length of the canal and on irrigant exchange. Although&#xD;
      conventional syringe delivery is a well accepted technique of irrigation but it delivers&#xD;
      solutions no more than 0-1.1 mm beyond the needle tip thereby limiting irrigant penetration.&#xD;
      In addition air entrapment at apical third produces a vapor lock effect, thus impeding the&#xD;
      flow of irrigant into the apical region and adequate debridement of the canal system.16&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that root canals still have detectable levels of cultivable&#xD;
      bacteria following chemomechanical procedures with sodium hypochlorite as an irrigant.&#xD;
      Consequently, different irrigant agitation techniques have been proposed to increase cleaning&#xD;
      efficacy, mechanically and chemically, by enhancing the irrigation dynamics. One such&#xD;
      technique is ultrasonic activation of root canal irrigant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive ultrasonic irrigation was first described by Weller et al.The files are designed to&#xD;
      oscillate at ultrasonic frequencies of 25-30kHz and operate in a transverse vibration,&#xD;
      setting up a characteristic pattern of nodes and antinodes along their length. It enhances&#xD;
      irrigant canal wall interaction by transmitting acoustic energy from an oscillating&#xD;
      instrument to the irrigant, causing acoustic microstreaming and transient cavitation.&#xD;
      Generally for ultrasonic activation of irrigation solution a syringe is used to inject the&#xD;
      irrigant into the root canal, after which the irrigant is activated passively by an&#xD;
      ultrasonically oscillating instrument. Nascent chlorine, which is the active component&#xD;
      responsible for tissue dissolving and antimicrobial action of hypochlorite, is consumed&#xD;
      rapidly in such a case. Further, the amount of irrigant that is activated is small, thereby,&#xD;
      limiting its debridement efficacy. It has, therefore, been suggested that irrigant delivery&#xD;
      methods that provide continuous replenishment of root canal irrigant may be more efficient.&#xD;
      Recently, ultrasonic devices have been introduced that provide continuous irrigant delivery&#xD;
      along with ultrasonic activation. In these devices irrigating solution moves into the needle&#xD;
      through a syringe attached to the luer-lock connection on the needle and is then activated&#xD;
      and delivered into the root canal. The main advantages of this technique are the continuous&#xD;
      replenishment of the solution and the irrigating solution is delivered from the needle in an&#xD;
      activated state, avoiding the need to insert the needle into the apical third of the root&#xD;
      canal. Studies have shown that the 1minute of continuous ultrasonic irrigation after hand or&#xD;
      rotary instrumentation resulted in significantly cleaner canals and isthmi in the mesial&#xD;
      roots of mandibular molars. Carver et al showed that the addition of 1 minute of continuous&#xD;
      ultrasonic irrigation significantly reduced bacterial-positive cultures. Another study&#xD;
      reported that while continuous ultrasonic irrigation was as effective as intermittent&#xD;
      ultrasonic irrigation in the placement of irrigant in the apical part of canal, it led to&#xD;
      improved irrigant penetration in lateral canals. In vitro studies comparing continuous&#xD;
      ultrasonic irrigation with syringe irrigation in the removal of debris have reported&#xD;
      continuous ultrasonic irrigation to be more effective in debris removal from apical third and&#xD;
      narrow isthmuses. Curtis et al found that continuous ultrasonic irrigation resulted in&#xD;
      significantly less debris present in root canals at 1 and 3 mm from the working length as&#xD;
      compared to conventional needle irrigation.A recent study by Layton et al reported that&#xD;
      continuous ultrasonic irrigation generates high fluid velocity and shear stress in apical&#xD;
      third resulting in enhanced reduction of strictly adherent bacterial biofilm as compared to&#xD;
      intermittent ultrasonic irrigation and syringe irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether these parameters translate into better clinical outcome remains to be seen. However,&#xD;
      to the best of our knowledge, there is no study assessing the effect of irrigant activation&#xD;
      using continuous ultrasonic device on success of endodontic treatment. This randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial was therefore designed to evaluate and compare the success of endodontic&#xD;
      treatment after the use of continuous ultrasonic irrigation and syringe irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The research project was carried out in the Department of Conservative Dentistry&#xD;
      and Endodontics, Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak (Haryana). Protocol of&#xD;
      the study was approved by the institutional ethical committee (PGIDS/IEC/2014/120), Rohtak,&#xD;
      India and it followed the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki declaration 1975, as revised in&#xD;
      2000. The study was conducted from May 2014 to May 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population comprised of patients requiring endodontic treatment following the&#xD;
      diagnosis of pulpal necrosis with chronic apical periodontitis in mature mandibular molar.&#xD;
      All such patients were examined for establishing their eligibility for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Pulp Vitality Pulp vitality status was evaluated with the help of electric pulp&#xD;
      testing, cold testing and clinical evaluation after access opening. If the patient did not&#xD;
      respond to electric and thermal test, and no bleeding was observed on access cavity&#xD;
      preparation, the subject was included in study provided other inclusion criteria were also&#xD;
      met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic examination All periapical radiographs were exposed with a 70 kVp machine&#xD;
      (Confident, Blue X Imaging S.r.l Via Idiomi 1/8-33 Assago, Italy) using Rinn paralleling&#xD;
      device (Dentsply Ltd., Weybridge, Surrey, United Kingdom); and processed manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data gathering Once eligibility was confirmed, the study was explained to the patient and&#xD;
      written consent to participate in the study was taken. All the diagnostic, intra operative&#xD;
      and post operative findings were recorded on a proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization The patient was randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups:&#xD;
      continuous ultrasonic irrigation (CUI) and syringe irrigation (SI), based on the use of&#xD;
      irrigation protocol utilized during chemomechanical preparation. Subjects were assigned to&#xD;
      either CUI or syringe irrigation group using an equal proportion allocation ratio. Envelopes&#xD;
      that contained concealed assignment codes were assigned sequentially to eligible patients.&#xD;
      Both the patient and the operator were blinded of the treatment protocol until completion of&#xD;
      chemomechanical preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Procedure The endodontic treatment was completed in two visits. First Visit Local&#xD;
      anaesthesia was administered (2% lidocaine with 1:80000 epinephrine) for patient comfort. The&#xD;
      tooth was then isolated with rubber dam. Caries was excavated using round bur in high speed&#xD;
      handpiece with copious irrigation and access to the pulp chamber was made. Working length&#xD;
      (WL) was obtained with the help of electronic apex locator (Root ZX) using #10 and #15 K file&#xD;
      and was confirmed radiographically. The canals were enlarged to a size three sizes larger&#xD;
      than the first apical binding file at the working length with 0.02 taper ISO stainless steel&#xD;
      hand files, followed by step-back technique with each successively larger file placed 0.5 mm&#xD;
      coronal to the previous one. Canal patency was maintained by passing a #10 stainless steel&#xD;
      file 0.5 to 1.0 mm beyond the working length. In both the groups, the canals were irrigated&#xD;
      with 5 mL of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (Hyposol; Prevest Denpro Limited, Jammu,&#xD;
      India) solution after every change of instrument using a 27 gauge needle. After shaping, the&#xD;
      canals were irrigated with 5 mL 17% EDTA (Prevest Denpro Limited, Jammu, India) for 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post instrumentation irrigation: In continuous ultrasonic irrigation group, Proultra&#xD;
      PiezoFlow (Dentsply Tulsa Dental Specialties, Tulsa,OK) was used for the activation of the&#xD;
      irrigating solution according to manufacturer's recommendations. The needle was operated&#xD;
      using Satelec P5 Piezoelectric Ultrasonic Unit (Acteon, Mount Laurel, NJ) at power setting of&#xD;
      5.The stopper on the PiezoFlow needle was set 1 mm short of binding in the canals, but no&#xD;
      more than 75% of the WL. A syringe containing 15 mL of 5.25% NaOCl was attached to the&#xD;
      Piezoflow activation needle and the inactive needle was inserted in the canal till&#xD;
      premeasured depth, and irrigant flow was started before activation. During activation, the&#xD;
      needle was moved up and down passively in the canal, while maintaining the insertion depth to&#xD;
      the stopper setting. The irrigation was accomplished in 1 minute per canal at a flow rate of&#xD;
      15 mL/min. In the syringe irrigation group, canals were flushed with 15 ml of 5.25% NaOCl&#xD;
      using 27 gauge syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After final irrigation, the canals were dried with sterile absorbent points and filled with&#xD;
      calcium hydroxide paste ( Roth International Ltd, Chicago, IL) using a lentulospiral. The&#xD;
      tooth was then temporarily restored with Intermediate Restorative Material (Dentsply Ltd,&#xD;
      Weybridge, UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second Visit In the second visit, patient returned with completed pain chart and handed it&#xD;
      back to the operator. The intracanal dressing was removed with H- files and copious&#xD;
      irrigation with 5.25% NaOCl. The master apical Gutta Percha cones were then verified. Canals&#xD;
      were obturated with the GuttaPercha and Zinc Oxide- Eugenol based sealer in lateral&#xD;
      condensation. After obturation, the access cavity was restored permanently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An immediate post-operative radiograph was then taken using preset exposure parameters with&#xD;
      Rinn paralleling device; and processed manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Follow up clinical and radiographic examination were carried out every 3 months,&#xD;
      until 12 months after the procedure.&#xD;
