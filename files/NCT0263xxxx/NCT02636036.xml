    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I multicenter, open label, nonrandomized study of enadenotucirev administered&#xD;
      in combination with nivolumab in subjects with metastatic or advanced epithelial tumors (with&#xD;
      focus on CRC, SCCHN, escalation phase), not responding to standard therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To characterise the safety and tolerability of enadenotucirev administered in combination&#xD;
      with nivolumab in subjects with metastatic or advanced epithelial tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dose escalation phase is conducted in subjects with solid tumors of epithelial origin not&#xD;
      responding to standard therapy to establish the MTD/MFD and optimum dosing schedule of the&#xD;
      enadenotucirev and nivolumab combination treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dose expansion phase will further outline the dose level and schedule of enadenotucirev and&#xD;
      nivolumab combination treatment and investigate signals of efficacy in three cohorts of&#xD;
      subjects with specific epithelial tumour types.&#xD;

             and secondary endpoints of the study, including response rate and safety&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic brain metastases or any leptomeningeal metastasis that is symptomatic&#xD;
             and/or requires treatment. Patients with brain metastases are eligible if these have&#xD;
             been locally treated (surgery, radiotherapy). There must also be no requirement for&#xD;
             immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg/day prednisone equivalent)&#xD;

             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
             or the Medical Monitor, may increase the risk associated with study participation or&#xD;
             study treatment administration, impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol&#xD;
             therapy or interfere with the interpretation of study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to enadenotucirev, nivolumab or their excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other medical or psychological condition that would preclude participation in the&#xD;
             study or compromise ability to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dependence on continuous supplemental oxygen use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of myocardial infarction or significant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular&#xD;
             event in the 12 months before the first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An increased risk due to tumour flare, as assessed by the Investigator (e.g. an&#xD;
             initial increase in tumour size that may lead to intestinal obstruction, obstruction&#xD;
             of the ureter or airway)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Penetrating tumour infiltration of major blood vessels, pericardium, gastrointestinal&#xD;
             tract or other hollow organs that may lead to perforation due to tumour necrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of DVT or pulmonary embolus in the 12 months before the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;

             first dose of study treatment&#xD;
