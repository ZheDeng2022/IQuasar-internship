  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The available data indicate that Ceritinib has substantial anti-tumor activity in patients&#xD;
      with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS1 rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
      This trial will investigate the potential of Ceritinib in patients with advanced&#xD;
      gastrointestinal malignancies with ALK and ROA1 rearrangement, and for whom there is no&#xD;
      available therapeutic option.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II study of ceritinib in adult patients&#xD;
      with ALK- and ROS1 activated colorectal, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic, hepatic, gastric, or&#xD;
      esophageal adenocarcinoma. An estimated 500 patients will be screened for ALK and ROS1 by&#xD;
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) per institutional&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC), and/or ALK/ROS1 by next-generation sequencing (NGS). At least 30&#xD;
      identified patients will be treated with ceritinib per protocol. Treatment with ceritinib&#xD;
      will continue until patient experiences unacceptable toxicity that precludes further&#xD;
      treatment, discontinues treatment at the discretion of the investigator or patient, starts a&#xD;
      new anticancer therapy and/or dies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female patients aged 18 or over that have colorectal adenocarcinoma,&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic, hepatocellular, gastric or esophageal adenocarcinoma that&#xD;
      contain an activated ALK gene due to rearrangement, mutation, amplification, translocation or&#xD;
      other mechanisms. Patients must have been pretreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;

             study drug] to minimize the risk of pregnancy. If the partner is pregnant or&#xD;
             breastfeeding, the subject must use a condom. A condom is required to be used also by&#xD;
             vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 12 weeks after the&#xD;

             serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of the investigational&#xD;
             product. Highly effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.&#xD;
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening) with the appropriate&#xD;
                  post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. For female&#xD;
                  subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner&#xD;
                  for that subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c or b+c):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other&#xD;
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;&#xD;
                  1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault&#xD;
             caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
             In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill&#xD;
             for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior&#xD;
             to screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of&#xD;
             the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered&#xD;
             not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
