    <textblock>
      The POST's public health impact is likely to be substantial because it will improve cancer&#xD;
      survivorship planning, which is currently an important deficiency in cancer care recognized&#xD;
      by the Institute of Medicine and the American College of Surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The POST may have many potential benefits for patients such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. improved long-term health outcomes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. improved psychosocial outcomes and quality of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. smoother transitions back into old and new life roles; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. improved continuity and coordination of care between providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most importantly, the POST's influence may reach beyond the patients it directly serves as it&#xD;
      could help scientists and health care providers understand the potential benefits of cancer&#xD;
      survivorship planning and how to best design and implement survivorship planning when&#xD;
      patients are ending treatment for cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By January 2015, oncology care providers will be expected to craft Survivorship Care Plans&#xD;
      (SCPs) for all individuals ending active treatment for cancer; however, there is a lack of&#xD;
      systematic study of the impact survivorship planning has on patients, providers, or&#xD;
      healthcare systems. The Polaris Oncology Survivorship Transition (POST) program is a&#xD;
      web-based system that incorporates recommendations from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and&#xD;
      American College of Surgeons (ACS) to assist with cancer survivorship planning. It is a&#xD;
      patient-centered approach that integrates input from both the treating oncology team and the&#xD;
      patient. Phase 1 built and iteratively modified (N=25) the POST system and Phase 2 will test&#xD;
      whether the SCPs impact patient and provider outcomes using a single blind, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT). Breast cancer patients (n=230) transitioning out of active treatment&#xD;
      will be recruited and randomly assigned to receive Treatment as Usual (n=115) or the POST&#xD;
      (n=115). All participants will be assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months by a research assistant&#xD;
      blind to baseline status and group assignment. Primary outcomes will include quality of life,&#xD;
      mechanisms of action such as confidence in entering survivorship, and other outcomes such as&#xD;
      (1) depression and anxiety, (2) adherence to medical and behavioral health recommendations,&#xD;
      (3) health care utilization, and (4) patient and provider satisfaction with the POST&#xD;
      system.The POST will innovate the clinical setting through being the first system to produce&#xD;
      computer generated tailored survivorship plans fully reflecting IOM recommendations and the&#xD;
      new ACS 2015 requirements; incorporating information from both the oncology provider and the&#xD;
      patient; featuring readily available &quot;plug in&quot; for two-way electronic health record&#xD;
      integration; providing dynamic, electronic referrals for specialized support services; and&#xD;
      facilitating care coordination between the oncologist and PCP. This study's impact will be&#xD;
      significant. If hypotheses are confirmed, clear scientific evidence will exist for supporting&#xD;
      survivorship care planning into oncology clinical practice. If hypotheses are disconfirmed,&#xD;
      important lessons will guide future directions for care planning, including whether failure&#xD;
      to affect outcomes was due to failure to impact several hypothesized mechanisms of action.&#xD;
