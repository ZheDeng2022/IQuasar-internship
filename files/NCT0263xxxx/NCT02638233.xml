  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic hepatitis C that are under opiate substitution therapy are likely to&#xD;
      have psychiatric comorbidities such as depression; hence an Interferon based therapy is&#xD;
      contraindicated. Additionally many of these patients have a borderline compliance, which&#xD;
      makes it impossible to treat them at specialized hepatological centers. An ideal opportunity&#xD;
      to treat this patients is treatment with DAAs (Direct Acting Antiviral) which can be&#xD;
      administered daily together with the opiate substitution therapy at a low threshold facility.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with active or previous i.v.-drug abuse and patients receiving opiate substitution&#xD;
      therapy (OST) represent a major subgroup of the patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Till&#xD;
      some years ago it was held, that patients with a history of i.v.-drug abuse and patients&#xD;
      receiving OST should not be considered for interferon-based antiviral treatment because of&#xD;
      their poor compliance. However, during the past years it became clear, that patients on OST&#xD;
      who are considered to be stable by their physicians are good candidates for antiviral&#xD;
      therapy. Several studies have shown that SVR (sustained virological response rates) achieved&#xD;
      in these patients are similar to results in patients without a history of i.v. drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroups of patients receiving OST:Patients receiving OST represent a very heterogeneous&#xD;
      population. However, based on empirical observation of the behavior/compliance of each&#xD;
      individual patient they can be assigned to one of the following three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Patients with very good compliance. These patients do not take drugs anymore and&#xD;
      demonstrate a very good compliance. If anti HCV therapy is indicated, these patients can be&#xD;
      referred to and treated at a hepatologic Center (i.e. hospital). Such patients have been&#xD;
      included in various phase III trials of new direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Patients with a very poor compliance. These patients do not keep appointments&#xD;
      (regardless whether it is at a low threshold facility or at a hospital). Due to their lack of&#xD;
      compliance antiviral therapy of these patients is not feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Patients with a borderline compliance. These patients do come to a low threshold&#xD;
      facility on a daily basis where they get OST under direct observation of a physician or a&#xD;
      nurse. These patients are reluctant to go to specialized hepatitis centers (high inhibition&#xD;
      threshold) and hence cannot be treated there. However, anti-HCV treatment can be applied&#xD;
      together with OST under direct observation of a physician or a nurse at the low threshold&#xD;
      facilities. The &quot;Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien&quot; a &quot;low threshold facility&quot; (LTF): The&#xD;
      &quot;Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien&quot; is a facility that offers medical care to patients with active&#xD;
      or former i.v. drug abuse (= (ex-)PWIDs). The medical team at these low-threshold facilities&#xD;
      (=LTFs) includes general practitioners, specialists in internal medicine, psychiatrists and&#xD;
      nurses. In contrast to hospitals (hepatologic centers in Austria with outpatient clinics in a&#xD;
      large hospital), where there is a relatively high &quot;psychological&quot; inhibition threshold for&#xD;
      PWIDs with CHC, the LTFs are located in &quot;normal&quot; houses. The setting is such that the&#xD;
      &quot;psychological&quot; inhibition threshold for PWIDs to go there is low. At the LTFs (ex-)PWIDs can&#xD;
      obtain OST on a daily basis under direct observation of a physician or a nurse. Hence, the&#xD;
      patients have a high motivation to come to these facilities daily (to avoid withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms - they do not have a similar incentive/interest/motivation to go to a hospital on a&#xD;
      regular basis). The direct observed OST prevents potential selling of medication on the black&#xD;
      market. Anti-HCV treatment at the &quot;Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien&quot;:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univ.-Prof. Dr. Michael Gschwantler, an experienced hepatologist is cooperating with the&#xD;
      &quot;Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien&quot; (=LTF). He visits the facility at least once a week (and&#xD;
      immediately in the case of any serious problem) and takes care of the patients with regards&#xD;
      to hepatitis/liver diseases. Prof. Gschwantler does this voluntarily and unsalaried. He&#xD;
      performs routine laboratory and sonographic evaluation of the liver directly at the LTF.&#xD;
      Prof. Gschwantler has already treated a small number of eligible &quot;group 3 patients&quot; (patients&#xD;
      with borderline compliance as described before) with interferon-based treatment directly at&#xD;
      the LTF (patients didn't need to go to a hospital). However, beside compliance issues&#xD;
      contraindications against interferon (e.g. due to depression) prevent many (ex-)PWIDs from&#xD;
      being treated at the moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this non-interventional study patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1, will be&#xD;
      treated with Harvoni® (Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir). Harvoni® has been approved for treatment of&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C. For treatment-naïve patients with genotype 1 infection without liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis the recommended duration of treatment is 8 weeks. In this non-interventional study&#xD;
      treatment with Harvoni® will be performed exactly according to the label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug will kindly be provided by Gilead.&#xD;
