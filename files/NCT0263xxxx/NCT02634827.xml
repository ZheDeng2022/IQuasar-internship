    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well midostaurin and decitabine work in treating older&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia and FLT3 mutations. Midostaurin and&#xD;
      decitabine may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the complete response rate for elderly patients with FLT3 mutated acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML) using midostaurin and decitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the 1-year overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine overall response rates in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine&#xD;
      the complete response duration in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the safety and toxicity of this regimen based on National Cancer Institute (NCI)&#xD;
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the prognostic and predictive factors (FLT3 internal tandem duplication [ITD]&#xD;
      versus [vs] tyrosine kinase domain [TKD] mutation) for patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore genetic targets for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-5 and midostaurin orally&#xD;
      (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 8-21 of courses 1 and 2, and on days 1-28 of each subsequent&#xD;
      course. Patients failing to achieve complete response (CR)/complete response with incomplete&#xD;
      recovery (CRi)/partial response (PR)/morphologic leukemia-free state by end of course 2&#xD;
      receive midostaurin PO BID on days 1-28. Patients achieving CR/CRi/PR/morphologic&#xD;
      leukemia-free state by end of course 8 may continue on current regimen. Patients failing to&#xD;
      achieve a CR/CRi/PR/ morphologic leukemia-free state in bone marrow blasts by end of course 8&#xD;
      go to event monitoring. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 18 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

    <measure>FLT3 Mutation by ITD vs. TKD vs. Both, Assessed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Western Blot, and Flow Cytometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 1 of course 9</time_frame>
    <description>Prognostic and predictive factors including age and FLT3 mutation by ITD vs. TKD vs. both will be assessed. These factors will be summarized and used to help characterize the types of patients accrued to this trial. In addition, differences in the distributions of these risk factors by clinical outcome will be explored (CR/CRi vs. not, OS and disease-free survival). Nonparametric quantitative comparisons by group will be made as appropriate (Fisher's exact or Wilcoxon rank sum). Kaplan-Meier methods and log rank statistics will be used to compare between groups for time to- event measures.</description>

    <description>MRD status will be correlated with response using Fisher's exact test. In addition, the relationship between MRD status (positive vs. negative) and disease-free survival will be evaluated using landmark analyses.</description>

        <description>Prognostic and predictive factors including age and FLT3 mutation by ITD vs. TKD vs. both will be assessed. These factors will be summarized and used to help characterize the types of patients accrued to this trial. In addition, differences in the distributions of these risk factors by clinical outcome will be explored (CR/CRi vs. not, OS and disease-free survival). Nonparametric quantitative comparisons by group will be made as appropriate (Fisher's exact or Wilcoxon rank sum). Kaplan-Meier methods and log rank statistics will be used to compare between groups for time to- event measures.</description>
