  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young men who have sex with men (MSM) in low- and middle-income countries often do not seek&#xD;
      out HIV testing, are unaware of their HIV-positive status, and do not receive early medical&#xD;
      care, compromising their health and contributing to downstream disease incidence. This&#xD;
      situation is of great concern in post-socialist countries of Eastern Europe, where stigma&#xD;
      about HIV/AIDS and same-sex behavior are great, HIV epidemics are still increasing, and the&#xD;
      health needs of young MSM are rarely acknowledged or addressed. The planned research will be&#xD;
      conducted in Sofia, Bulgaria, where MSM account for nearly half of HIV infections. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted in two phases.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an initial qualitative phase, the investigators will conduct in-depth interviews with MSM&#xD;
      ages 16 to 20 and other key informants to gain an understanding of factors related to HIV&#xD;
      testing. The project's second phase is a trial of a network intervention to increase regular&#xD;
      HIV testing and care linkage among young MSM. The investigators' prior studies in Bulgaria&#xD;
      have shown that young MSM are clustered with other young MSM in social networks. The&#xD;
      intervention trial will recruit 54 small social networks of MSM, each consisting of a young&#xD;
      MSM &quot;seed&quot; between age 16 and 20 and also all close MSM friends surrounding the seed. All&#xD;
      participants will complete baseline measures assessing recent HIV testing practices and&#xD;
      testing history; attitudes, intentions, perceived norms, barriers, and understanding about&#xD;
      HIV testing and medical care; sexual risk practices; and substance use. All participants will&#xD;
      receive HIV risk reduction counseling. Networks will then be randomized to comparison and&#xD;
      intervention conditions. Influence leaders of each experimental condition network will be&#xD;
      identified, and network leaders will together attend a 5-session intervention, which will&#xD;
      train, guide, and engage leaders to deliver theory-based, personally-tailored advice and&#xD;
      counseling to their network members to correct misconceptions about HIV testing and care;&#xD;
      strengthen friends' norms, attitudes, intentions, and perceived benefits of regular testing;&#xD;
      and address barriers to testing. All members of intervention and comparison condition&#xD;
      networks will be re-assessed at 6- and 12-month followup to determine the intervention's&#xD;
      effects on HIV testing, regular testing, and testing- and care-related scale measures.&#xD;
      Participants diagnosed with HIV infection at any point will be linked to medical care.&#xD;
