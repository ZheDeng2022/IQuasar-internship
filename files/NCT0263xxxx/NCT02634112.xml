      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this National Registry is to identify the incidence and to analyse the&#xD;
      risk factors for anastomotic leakage in rectal cancer surgery From the operational point of&#xD;
      view, the aim of this Registry is to systematize the collection of information on the&#xD;
      different surgical services. This Registry claims to have National audit functions, allowing&#xD;
      thus the knowledge of the procedures performed at each center that could enable the&#xD;
      establishment of the best standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the real incidence of anastomotic leakage according to the different locations&#xD;
      and techniques: uniform definition of anastomotic leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the preoperative risk factors of anastomotic leakage: PATIENT FACTOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyse the variability in the practice of rectal anastomosis: SURGEON FACTOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyse the influence of different stapling devices in rectal anastomosis: INSTRUMENTAL&#xD;
      FACTOR To know the current treatment of anastomotic leakage and the associated morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To create and validate an anastomotic leakage predictive Score.&#xD;

      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Registry of the surgical procedure performed in patients undergoing elective&#xD;
      surgery for rectal cancer, resected with curative intent, with anastomosis, with or without&#xD;
      protective ileostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included pre-operatively, through a website access to the study database.&#xD;
      This inclusion could be done until the day before surgery. Participating sites must include&#xD;
      all patients undergoing rectal cancer consecutively during the study duration (approximately&#xD;
      1 year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected until day 30 after patientÂ´s discharge. No further follow-up is&#xD;
      planned, except for those established by clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to be an extensive and comprehensive registry of all patients meeting&#xD;
      inclusion criteria for a period of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated number of centers and patients is not fixed a priori; will depend on the&#xD;
      dissemination of the Registry between the members of the Spanish Association of Surgeons and&#xD;
      the commitment and involvement of the involved investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated number of centers and patients is not fixed a priori; will depend on the&#xD;
      dissemination of the Registry between the members of the Spanish Association of Surgeons and&#xD;
      the commitment and involvement of the involved investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Spanish surgeons, members or not of the Spanish Association of Surgeons, will be invited&#xD;
      to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimum requirements for all participants will be established, being the most important the&#xD;
      commitment with the Registry (quality of information and regular updates).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other criterion that will be considered in the selection of the participating sites is to&#xD;
      have a sufficient volume of patients that enables the collection of information, and to&#xD;
      present a high history of rectal cancer surgeries per year. The existence of a Coloproctology&#xD;
      Unit and publications in the area will be also evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be recorded in an electronic Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will contains the following variables, between others:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification data of the responsible physician Administrative data of the procedure Patient&#xD;
      demographic data Preoperative data Intraoperative data Postoperative data Final follow-up (30&#xD;
      days after surgery) The information collected will be always a reflect of clinical practice&#xD;
      at each site, as one of the results that will be analyzed are the differences in the practice&#xD;
      from site to site.&#xD;
