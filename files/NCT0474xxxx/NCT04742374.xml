  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CIDP, a rare disorder affecting young adults, causes gradual weakness of the limbs, areflexia&#xD;
      and impaired sensory function. New CIDP phenotypes without antibodies but with modified cell&#xD;
      profiles have been described. Treatments include corticotherapy, IVIg and plasmapheresis but&#xD;
      the latter's action mechanisms remain unclear. Plasmapheresis supposedly removes toxic agents&#xD;
      like antibodies from plasma but it is uncertain whether it has an immune-modulating effect.&#xD;
      Also, the refining mechanisms of the two main plasmapheresis techniques - single plasma&#xD;
      exchange and double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) - are different and unclear. This study&#xD;
      aims to compare the evolution of peripheral lymphocyte profiles in patients with CIDP&#xD;
      according to their treatment (single centrifugation plasmapheresis or DFPP) to better grasp&#xD;
      the action mechanisms of both techniques.&#xD;
