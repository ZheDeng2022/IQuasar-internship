  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether using noninvasive methods to study the&#xD;
      appearance of lesions can improve diagnostic accuracy before a biopsy is required and help&#xD;
      guide treatment planning. The database created to store these images is called an Image&#xD;
      Repository, and it will be used to support clinical practice, teaching and training, and&#xD;
      future research.The High-resolution OCT (Apollo Medical Optics) device ApolloVue® S100 Image&#xD;
      System (medical device Class II) can provide both cross-sectional and en-face images with&#xD;
      cellular information.&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Participants with muco-cutaneous lesions</arm_group_label>
    <description>Participants will have muco-cutaneous lesions for non-invasive evaluation (including normal skin or mucosa and benign lesions) and will be identified by their physicians or fellows during routine clinical care.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Diagnostic Test</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Dermoscopic imaging</intervention_name>
    <description>The skin lesion will be imaged before application of alcohol (spray/wipe) and after application of alcohol (spray/wipe). The dermatoscope/camera with dermoscopy imaging capabilities, including but not limited to VEOS® SLR (Canfield Scientific, Inc.), will be placed on/near the area(s) of interest. Images will be captured in polarized and/or nonpolarized modes and contact and/or non-contact modes.</description>

    <intervention_name>3-dimensional total body photography</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will stand in the center of an imaging station consisting of 92 high-resolution cameras. Image capture by all cameras will occur simultaneously, (approx. 3 milliseconds). Within a few minutes, specialized software will process and assemble the images into a 3D avatar - a digital model of the patient's skin - showing all his or her lesions.</description>

        For this study, we anticipate to recruit ~5000 participants over a period of 7 years. Of&#xD;
        this, ~4000 will be patients with a muco-cutaneous lesion and ~1000 will be volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients in the Dermatology, Clinical Immunology Services, Pediatrics, Bone Marrow&#xD;
        Transplant, Dental, and Radiation Oncology departments who have a muco-cutaneous&#xD;
        lesion/process amenable to imaging with one or more of the available noninvasive devices&#xD;
        will be offered the opportunity to participate in the study. In addition to patients and&#xD;
        volunteers, MSK clinicians will be recruited to the study via clinician verbal informed&#xD;
        consent.&#xD;
