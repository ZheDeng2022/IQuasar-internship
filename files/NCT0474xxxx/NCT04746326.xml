  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The right colon diverticula, unlike those in the left colon, contain all layers of the colon&#xD;
      and is called the true diverticulum. Perforation is observed less frequently due to its full&#xD;
      thickness. Conservative treatment can be applied unless complications such as abscess&#xD;
      formation and free perforation occur. Unlike the left, right colon diverticulitis has low&#xD;
      complications and can be treated conservatively. The differential diagnosis of right colon&#xD;
      diverticulitis should be kept in mind in order to prevent unnecessary surgeries. Surgical&#xD;
      treatment is inevitable in cases such as recurrent diverticulitis, generalized peritonitis,&#xD;
      and suspected malignancy.&#xD;

      The right colon diverticula, unlike those in the left colon, contain all layers of the colon&#xD;
      and is called the true diverticulum. Perforation is observed less frequently due to its full&#xD;
      thickness. Conservative treatment can be applied unless complications such as abscess&#xD;
      formation and free perforation occur. Here, we aimed to discuss the results of conservative&#xD;
      and surgical treatment for right colon diverticulitis in the light of the literature. 150&#xD;
      patients treated for colon diverticulitis between 2015-2020 were retrospectively screened.&#xD;
      Right colon diverticulitis detected incidentally, missing data, and left colon diverticulitis&#xD;
      were excluded from the study. Data of a total of 26 patients were accessed. Unlike the left,&#xD;
      right colon diverticulitis has low complications and can be treated conservatively. The&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of right colon diverticulitis should be kept in mind in order to&#xD;
      prevent unnecessary surgeries. Surgical treatment is inevitable in cases such as recurrent&#xD;
      diverticulitis, generalized peritonitis, and suspected malignancy&#xD;
