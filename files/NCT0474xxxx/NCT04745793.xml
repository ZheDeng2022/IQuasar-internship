      Iatrogenic injuries to the parathyroid glands during thyroid surgery or to the recurrent&#xD;
      laryngeal nerve (RLN) do still occur, requiring often specialized management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been demonstrated that the parathyroid gland shows a significant&#xD;
      autofluorescence. Using a commercially available Near-InfraRed (NIR) camera (Fluobeam®,&#xD;
      Fluoptics©, France), the parathyroid glands can be clearly visualized by contrast-free&#xD;
      fluorescence imaging. However it lacks real-time quantification of the fluorescence&#xD;
      intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hyperspectral imaging (HSI), which is a technology that combines a spectrometer to a&#xD;
      camera system, examines the optical properties of a large area in a wavelength range from NIR&#xD;
      to visual light (VIS). It provides spatial information real time, in a contact-free,&#xD;
      non-ionizing manner. The HSI technology would add the spatial information, thus enormously&#xD;
      enhancing the intraoperative performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed study is to identify the spectral features of the important neck&#xD;
      target structures, in particular the parathyroid glands, using an appropriate deep learning&#xD;
      algorithm, to perform an automated parathyroid recognition. Additionally, this study proposes&#xD;
      to compare the detection rate of the hyperspectral based parathyroid recognition with the&#xD;
      already existing NIR autofluorescence based recognition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The major challenge in thyroid and parathyroid procedures, is the safe identification of the&#xD;
      recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) and the localization of the parathyroid glands (to be&#xD;
      preserved or to be selectively removed). Iatrogenic injuries to the parathyroid glands during&#xD;
      thyroid surgery (resulting in transient or permanent hypocalcemia) or to the RLN (resulting&#xD;
      in hoarseness, dysphonia, dyspnea) do still occur, requiring often specialized management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of incidental parathyroidectomies, in specialized endocrine centers, is around&#xD;
      16%. In these cases, it is more likely to observe clinical relevant hypocalcemia than after&#xD;
      planned parathyroidectomy for hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, there is a critical need for an&#xD;
      intra-operative method enabling a precise, real-time parathyroid identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been demonstrated that the parathyroid gland shows a significant&#xD;
      autofluorescence, which is caused by the optical properties of a still unknown intrinsic&#xD;
      fluorophore. When the gland is excited by a light source with a wavelength ranging from&#xD;
      750-785 nm, it emits a fluorescence peak around 820 nm. Taking advantage of this property,&#xD;
      Falco et al., using a commercially available NIR camera (Fluobeam®, Fluoptics©, France),&#xD;
      could clearly visualize the parathyroid glands by contrast-free fluorescence imaging and&#xD;
      could easily discriminate them from the thyroid and the surrounding tissue. The drawback with&#xD;
      this autofluorescence-based imaging is that it lacks real-time quantification of the&#xD;
      fluorescence intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hyperspectral imaging (HSI), which is a technology that combines a spectrometer to a&#xD;
      camera system, examines the optical properties of a large area in a wavelength range from&#xD;
      near infrared (NIR) to visual light (VIS). It provides diagnostic information about the&#xD;
      tissue physiology, composition and perfusion. The fact that the HSI produces pictures, thus&#xD;
      providing spatial information real time, in a contact-free, non-ionizing manner, makes it&#xD;
      potentially a very valuable tool for the intraoperative use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSI has exhibited its great potential in the medical field especially in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      various neoplasia (e.g. of the cervix, breast, colon, brain), in the detection of perfusion&#xD;
      pattern in patients with peripheral arterial disease and in the area of wound diagnostic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As previously shown, it is possible to discriminate the thyroid from the parathyroid glands&#xD;
      according to the spectral characteristics, but the HSI technology would add the spatial&#xD;
      information, thus enormously enhancing the intraoperative performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with the University of Leipzig, Germany, the investigators performed a&#xD;
      clinical pilot trial on 8 patients, which showed promising results. Hyperspectral images&#xD;
      during benign endocrine surgery procedures were able to demonstrate that thyroid and&#xD;
      parathyroid have specific hyperspectral signatures. Furthermore, the parathyroid glands&#xD;
      showed usually less oxygenated than the thyroid. A discrimination of the parathyroid glands&#xD;
      based on these characteristics is proven to be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed study is to identify the spectral features of the important neck&#xD;
      target structures, in particular the parathyroid glands, using an appropriate deep learning&#xD;
      algorithm, to perform an automated parathyroid recognition. Additionally, this study proposes&#xD;
      to compare the detection rate of the hyperspectral based parathyroid recognition with the&#xD;
      already existing NIR autofluorescence based recognition.&#xD;
