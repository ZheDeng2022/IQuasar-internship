      Research Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized Control Trial This is a randomized control trial comparing the&#xD;
      usefulness of impedance cardiography (ICG) directed therapy in treating severe range&#xD;
      hypertension (systolic BP &gt;160 OR diastolic BP &gt;110) in patients greater than 20 weeks&#xD;
      gestation. All patients in the study will receive standard of care medication within the&#xD;
      suggested timeframe by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG). All patients&#xD;
      will receive a hemodynamic assessment prior to receiving and after receiving medications. The&#xD;
      treatment patients will receive either labetalol or nifedipine therapy for hypertension based&#xD;
      on their hemodynamic parameters. The control group will receive medication based on provider&#xD;
      preference (which is the usual plan of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting to Labor and Delivery at Cabell Huntington Hospital being treated for&#xD;
      severe range blood pressures. Consent will be obtained prior to randomization to standard&#xD;
      care or ICG directed care. Patient age range will be from age 15 to approximately 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interval assessment will be performed after 20 patients have been assessed. The goal is&#xD;
      for a total enrollment of 150 patients, 75 to the ICG directed treatment group and 75 to the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient presents to Labor and Delivery at Cabell Huntington Hospital and consents to the&#xD;
      study, she will be randomized to either the ICG directed therapy group or provider preference&#xD;
      group. Patients from each group will receive a non-invasive hemodynamic assessment via the&#xD;
      NICaS system. The NICaS system uses impedance cardiography which provides a reliable&#xD;
      assessment of cardiovascular, respiratory, and fluid parameters. The vasodilator nifedipine&#xD;
      will be initiated for increased systemic vascular resistance. Elevated cardiac output will be&#xD;
      treated with beta blockade via IV labetalol. ACOG recommends either of these medications as&#xD;
      first line therapy for elevated blood pressure, and offers no guidance on which medication&#xD;
      should be used first. All patients who are being treated will receive the standard of care&#xD;
      treatment, however the ICG group will receive therapy based on their hemodynamic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Analysis The control group will be compared to the ICG directed treatment group.&#xD;
