  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability in the UK. There are few treatment options that&#xD;
      improve long-term disability outcomes after stroke. Animal studies indicate that aerobic&#xD;
      exercise training can improve brain repair and reduce disability after stroke. However, in&#xD;
      clinical practice it is difficult for stroke survivors to undertake aerobic exercise due to&#xD;
      lower-limb disability and a lack of accessible exercise equipment. This study will assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of implementing a 5-day aerobic exercise training intervention, beginning in the&#xD;
      acute phase of stroke (1-7 days post-stroke), using a power-assisted exercise bike.&#xD;
      Feasibility outcome measures: recruitment rate (30 participants recruited within 18 months),&#xD;
      completeness of data (&gt;80% of planned measurements recorded) and the safety (&lt;10 adverse&#xD;
      events related to the intervention) and acceptability (&gt;3/5 comfort scale) of the&#xD;
      intervention. We will also investigate the acute effects of aerobic exercise on cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow velocity using transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and brain-derived neurotrophic&#xD;
      factor (serum and plasma).&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical studies indicate that aerobic exercise training can enhance brain repair and&#xD;
      reduce disability when initiated early (1-7 days) after stroke. However, in the real-world&#xD;
      clinical setting, most acute stroke patients have a lower-limb disability which makes it&#xD;
      difficult to engage in aerobic exercise. Power-assisted exercise bikes can detect lower-limb&#xD;
      motor deficits and compensate with motorised assistance. The primary aim of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of implementing a 5-day power-assisted aerobic exercise training&#xD;
      programme, initiated in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke (1-7 days post-stroke). Key&#xD;
      feasibility outcomes related to the intervention include safety (&lt;10 adverse events related&#xD;
      to the intervention) and acceptability (&gt;3/5 comfort scale). The secondary aim is to assess&#xD;
      the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT), with a focus on study&#xD;
      procedures including recruitment (30 participants recruited within 18 months) and&#xD;
      completeness of data (≥80% of planned measurements recorded), and identification of a&#xD;
      suitable primary outcome measure for a large-scale RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with acute ischaemic stroke admitted to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital (Sheffield,&#xD;
      England) will be recruited to this study. After eligible individuals provide informed&#xD;
      consent, a web-based permuted block randomisation procedure will be used to allocate&#xD;
      participants into one of two study arms: 1) usual care; or 2) aerobic exercise training plus&#xD;
      usual care. Participants will be stratified using the National Institutes of Health Stroke&#xD;
      Scale (NIHSS): mild to moderate (0-15) and moderate to severe (&gt;15) measured after&#xD;
      reperfusion therapy or at a similar timepoint if not eligible for reperfusion therapy.&#xD;
      Accounting for a predicted attrition rate of 20%, the target sample size is 30 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bedside power-assisted exercise bike will be used to enable patients to undertake aerobic&#xD;
      exercise whilst remaining in their bed, even if they have a lower-limb disability. The&#xD;
      aerobic exercise programme will consist of five exercise sessions, each including a graduated&#xD;
      warm-up, a conditioning phase, and a graduated cooldown. The conditioning phase will be an&#xD;
      interval training format, with five-minute low- to moderate-intensity intervals interspersed&#xD;
      with one-minute rest periods. The number of five-minute conditioning bouts will increase by&#xD;
      one bout per session. The first session will contain two bouts (total = 10 mins), and the&#xD;
      fifth session will contain six bouts (total = 30 mins). The rationale for this progressive&#xD;
      design was developed with input from researchers, healthcare practitioners and people&#xD;
      affected by stroke. Briefly, it was considered that starting with 30 minutes of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise in the first session may be too difficult for some patients due to fatigue, whereas&#xD;
      a gradual progression in exercise duration would be more tolerable. In addition, the interval&#xD;
      training design was chosen to reduce exercise-induced fatigue, and thereby increase the total&#xD;
      duration of aerobic exercise completed per session. Participants will cycle at a steady&#xD;
      self-selected cadence, and exercise intensity will be guided by the Borg rating of perceived&#xD;
      exertion (RPE) scale. During the conditioning intervals, participants will be asked to the&#xD;
      cycle at an intensity equivalent to 'somewhat hard' (RPE:13/20). Heart rate, peripheral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation, brachial blood pressure, and symptoms will be monitored throughout each&#xD;
      exercise session. In the fourth or fifth exercise session, exercise-induced changes in&#xD;
      respiratory gases, cerebral blood flow velocity and blood-borne brain-derived neurotrophic&#xD;
      factor will be assessed. Established clinical exercise physiology guidelines will be followed&#xD;
      with regards to exercise contraindications and termination criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to the control group will receive usual care according to guidance&#xD;
      from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Royal College of&#xD;
      Physicians. Briefly, it is recommended that patients undertake at least 45 minutes of each&#xD;
      appropriate therapy per day (physiotherapy, occupational therapy and or speech and language&#xD;
      therapy) for five days per week. Patients should be mobilised (out-of-bed sitting, standing&#xD;
      or walking) within the first 48 hours of stroke onset, or if physically capable, as soon as&#xD;
      possible post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      7-14 days after enrolling in the study, a convenience sample of participants (n=8 per study&#xD;
      arm) will be interviewed to gain insight into participants' experiences participating in the&#xD;
      study activities (e.g. intervention and or assessments). Repeat interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      with the same individuals three months later with a focus on their post-hospital&#xD;
      rehabilitation experiences. In addition, a small convenience sample (n=3-5) of clinical staff&#xD;
      members will be interviewed to understand their opinions about the intervention and overall&#xD;
      study procedures.&#xD;
