  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether receiving the pneumococcal 13-valent&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine (PCV13) before and after CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy will optimize&#xD;
      cellular and humoral immunity to pneumococcus.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-institution study to investigate if pneumococcal vaccination&#xD;
      before and after CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy elicits cellular and humoral immunity to&#xD;
      pneumococcus in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell lymphomas. All the participants&#xD;
      will receive the same treatment. Immunoglobulins (IgG) against pneumococcal serotypes not&#xD;
      included in the vaccine will be served as an internal control. Treatment includes the same&#xD;
      dose (0.5ml) of PCV13 one time prior to apheresis followed by two times after CAR T cell&#xD;
      therapy&#xD;

    <description>This is a personalized therapeutic approach that entails removal of T cells from patient's peripheral blood, genetic modification, activation and expansion in vitro to retarget cells against CD19 protein on the surface of B cells, and infusion of the genetically engineered cells back into the patient. CD19 is a surface protein that is expressed on B cells starting from early pre-B cells to mature fully differentiated B cells. Therefore, CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy can effectively treat refractory B cell lymphomas.</description>
