    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, 2-part Phase I study to assess the PK, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      capivasertib as monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel in Chinese participants with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumours&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Phase I study is designed to assess the PK, safety and tolerability of single-dose and&#xD;
      multiple-dose capivasertib as monotherapy (Part A) and in combination with paclitaxel (Part&#xD;
      B) in approximately 16 Chinese participants with advanced solid tumours and to detect any&#xD;
      differences in the PK profile between Chinese and Caucasian participants due to ethnicity.&#xD;
      Descriptive summary will be conducted on the PK analysis set and safety analysis set.The&#xD;
      evaluation of capivasertib PK data will be based on the PK analysis set.The assessment on&#xD;
      safety and tolerability will be based on the safety analysis set.&#xD;
