    <textblock>
      An open label multi center study to assess the safety and efficacy of BST-236 as single agent&#xD;
      in adult patients unfit for standard therapy with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or higher-risk&#xD;
      (HR) Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) who fail to respond or relapsed following first line&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 20 adult patients with relapsed and/or refractory AML and approximately 20&#xD;
      adult patients with relapsed and/or refractory HR MDS, will be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with 1-2 induction courses and 2-4 maintenance courses. All patients&#xD;
      will be followed for 1 year in the study and additional 1 year post study follow-up.&#xD;
