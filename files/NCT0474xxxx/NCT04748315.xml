      The purpose of this study will be to inestigate the recovery kinetics on performance,&#xD;
      neuromuscular fatigue and muscle microtaruma that will occur after two speed-endurance&#xD;
      maintenance training protocols in elite male soccer players. Also, this study will determine&#xD;
      the comparison between two different speed endurance maintenance protocols in neuromuscular&#xD;
      fatigue, muscle microtrauma indicators and performance factors. The training protocols will&#xD;
      be differentiated in training work to rest ratio. The firts training protocol trial will&#xD;
      comprise the work to rest ratio (1:1) and the other trial will comprise the work to rest&#xD;
      ratio 1:3.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Speed endurance maintenance training is utilized in order to improve the repeated sprint and&#xD;
      high speed running ability of soccer players during a soccer match. Also, speed endurance&#xD;
      maintenance training includes soccer drills which stimulate high speed and powerful actions&#xD;
      such as changes of directions, accelerations and decelerations. However these actions are&#xD;
      associated with eccentric component and it is known that eccentric exercises induces muscle&#xD;
      damage microtrauma. Thus, the aim of this study will be to investigate the recovery kinetics&#xD;
      on performance, neuromuscular fatigue and muscle microtrauma that will occur after two&#xD;
      speed-endurance maintenance training protocols in elite male soccer players. The speed&#xD;
      endurance maintenance training (SEMT) sessions will be differentiated in training volume and&#xD;
      specifically in the work to rest period. Specifically, a randomized three-trial, cross-over,&#xD;
      repeated measures design will be applied. Elite male soccer players (aged 18-35 years) will&#xD;
      participate in the present study. Also, it is considered necessary that the participants will&#xD;
      not suffer from any musculoskeletal injuries that will limit their ability to perform the&#xD;
      SEMT sessions. Also the participants will not be smokers and will not consume alcohol and&#xD;
      ergogenic nutritional supplements before and during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase all participants will sign an informed consent form after they will be&#xD;
      informed about all benefits and risks of this study and they will sign a recent historical of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injury or illness form. Subsequently, fasting blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      by venipuncture using a disposable needle (10-gauge) in order to estimate muscle damage&#xD;
      concentration markers (CK), blood lactate and inflammation markers (WBC). After, delayed&#xD;
      onset muscle soreness (DOMS) in the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE) of both limbs, body&#xD;
      weight (BW), height and body composition (DXA method) will be measured in the lab. Completing&#xD;
      the first phase, participants will be instructed by a dietitian how to record a 7 days diet&#xD;
      recalls estimating that the energy intake during the trials will be the same. The counter&#xD;
      movement jump (CMJ) will be measured 24 hour after (second phase) on a force platform using&#xD;
      two force platforms at 1000 Hz, with each foot in parallel on the two platforms providing a&#xD;
      separate yet time-synchronized measurement of the data for each leg. During the CMJ will be&#xD;
      measured the jump height (cm), the ground reaction force (N), the peak and mean power (W/kg),&#xD;
      the vertical stiffness (Kvert, N/m/kg) and the peak rate of force development (RFD, N/s),&#xD;
      while at the same time will be evaluated the change in peak and mean normalized EMG during&#xD;
      the eccentric and concentric phases of the counter movement jump, for the vastus lateralis&#xD;
      (VL), biceps femoris (BF), gastrocnemius (GAS), and gluteus maximus (GM) muscles.&#xD;
      Electromyography data will be collected wirelessly at 2.000 Hz using a Myon MA-320 EMG&#xD;
      system. The peak eccentric and concentric isokinetic torque of the knee flexors and&#xD;
      extensors, in both limbs will be evaluated on an isokinetic dynamometer at 60°/sec. Also, the&#xD;
      isometric peak torque of the knee extensors will be evaluated at 65o in both limbs. Also the&#xD;
      fatigue rate during maximal voluntary isometric contraction will be estimated through the&#xD;
      percent drop of peak torque between the first and the last three seconds of a 10-secong&#xD;
      maximal isometric contraction. Also, the speed of 10m and 30m will be measured using light&#xD;
      cells Chronojump system. The repeated sprint ability (RSA) (5x30m) will be measure using&#xD;
      light cells Chronojump with 25 seconds rest in-between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The soccer agility drill with a ball will be measured using light cells Chronojump in order&#xD;
      to evaluate the soccer technical skills, 24 hour after. Finally, Open-circuit spirometry will&#xD;
      be utilized for assessment of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) using an automated online&#xD;
      pulmonary gas exchange system via breath-by-breath analysis during a graded exercise testing&#xD;
      on a treadmill. The ability to recover after repeated intense exercise will be evaluated&#xD;
      through the YO-YO Intermittent Recovery test level 2 and YO-YO Intermittent Endurance test&#xD;
      level 2. 96 hours after, the participants are going to perform one of the two speed endurance&#xD;
      maintenance training session randomly in the field. The SEMT(1:1) session will include 1 set,&#xD;
      6 repetitions per set and the work to rest ratio will be 1:1. The SEMT(1:3) session will&#xD;
      iclude 1 set, 6 repetitions per set and the work to rest ratio will be 1:3. During the&#xD;
      sessions will be assessed the change in Heart rate using a heart rate monitor and the field&#xD;
      activity will be recorded using a global positiong system (GPS). The blood lactate will be&#xD;
      evaluated immediately after each session. The DOMS indicator in the knee flexors (KF) and&#xD;
      extensors (KE) of both limbs will be evaluated immediately after, 1h, 2h, 3h, 24h, 48h, and&#xD;
      72 hours after each session. The isometric peak torque of the knee extensors will be&#xD;
      evaluated at 65° in limbs, post and at 1h, 2h and 3h, hours after each session. Also the&#xD;
      fatigue rate during maximal voluntary isometric contraction will be estimated through the&#xD;
      percent drop of peak torque between the first and the last three seconds of a 10-secong&#xD;
      maximal isometric contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected at 24h, 48h, and 72 hours after sessions. The counter&#xD;
      movement jump (CMJ) will be measured immediately after the session, at 1h, 2h, 3h, at 24h,&#xD;
      48h and 72 hours after session on a force platform using two force platforms at 1000 Hz, with&#xD;
      each foot in parallel on the two platforms providing a separate yet time-synchronized&#xD;
      measurement of the data for each leg. During the CMJ will be measured the jump height (cm),&#xD;
      the ground reaction force (N), the peak and mean power (W/kg), the vertical stiffness (Kvert,&#xD;
      N/m/kg) and the peak rate of force development (RFD, N/s), while at the same time will be&#xD;
      evaluated the change in peak and mean normalized EMG during the eccentric and concentric&#xD;
      phases of the counter movement jump, for the vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF),&#xD;
      gastrocnemius (GAS), and gluteus maximus (GM) muscles. Electromyography data will be&#xD;
      collected wirelessly at 2.000 Hz using a Myon MA-320 EMG system. Also, the speed of 10m and&#xD;
      30m will be measured using light cells Chronojump system immediately after, at 24h, 48h and&#xD;
      72 hours after session. Finally the RSA test will be measured at 24h, 48h and 72 hours after&#xD;
      sessions. Α 2 - week washout period will be adapted among trials. After, the participants&#xD;
      will perform the process until they complete the trials.&#xD;
