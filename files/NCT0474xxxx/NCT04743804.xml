  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of ravulizumab compared to placebo in&#xD;
      adult participants with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) associated with a trigger.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive either ravulizumab plus best supportive care or&#xD;
      placebo plus best supportive care. The treatment period is 26 weeks followed by a 26-week&#xD;
      off-treatment follow-up period.&#xD;
