  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      500 students at the age of 14-16 years will be randomized to one intervention arm or one&#xD;
      control arm in a 1:1 ratio. Participants of both groups receive a fitness tracker to count&#xD;
      the amount of their steps taken. The participants of the intervention arm will commit&#xD;
      themselves to a personal goal of steps taken by means of a commitment contract. Achievement&#xD;
      of the goal will be rewarded with financial incentives to fulfill the requirements of proper&#xD;
      reward medium, according to the Induced Value Theory (Smith, 1976).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the intervention will be 1 year; incentives are provided for 6 months, the&#xD;
      remaining 6 months are the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that intensified motivational strategies like the provision of commitment&#xD;
      contracts and nudges are effective in increasing the number of steps taken per month compared&#xD;
      to a control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      500 adolescents age 14 to 16 years visiting schools throughout Tyrol, Austria will be&#xD;
      randomized to one intervention arm or a control arm on a class-wise level in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
      Participants will be invited by the Department of Education in Tyrol and schools will be&#xD;
      contacted directly. At the baseline examination cardiovascular risk profiles (including&#xD;
      laboratory analysis; anthropometry; a standardized medical interview; and blood pressure,&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance and pulse-wave velocity measurements) are determined and results are&#xD;
      communicated in an individual discussion of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, participants of both groups receive a fitness tracker to count the amount of&#xD;
      their steps taken. The participants of the intervention arm will commit themselves to a&#xD;
      personal goal of steps taken by means of a commitment contract. Achievement of the goal will&#xD;
      be rewarded with financial incentives to fulfill the requirements of proper reward medium,&#xD;
      according to the Induced Value Theory (Smith, 1976) and nudges (reminders) will be provided&#xD;
      to increase motivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the intervention will be 1 year; incentives are provided for 6 months, the&#xD;
      remaining 6 months are the follow-up period. After 1 year a follow-up examination will be&#xD;
      conducted. Economic experiments on time and risk preferences are furthermore carried out at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that intensified motivational strategies like the provision of commitment&#xD;
      contracts and nudges are effective in increasing the number of steps taken per month compared&#xD;
      to a control group.&#xD;
