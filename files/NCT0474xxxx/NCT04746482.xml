  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cases refractory to initial root canal therapy in which a decision is made to perform&#xD;
      nonsurgical retreatment, the patient has the right to know the prognosis of the proposed&#xD;
      treatment and clinicians must be able to provide this information based on the best available&#xD;
      data. The literature answered this question when the treatment was performed in multiple&#xD;
      visits; however, little information exists when single visit root canal retreatment was&#xD;
      performed. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to assess the clinical and radiographic&#xD;
      outcome of root canal retreatment performed in single visits in endodontic clinics of Dubai&#xD;
      Health Authority (DHA).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to assess the clinical and radiographic outcome of root canal&#xD;
      retreatment performed in single visits in endodontic clinics of Dubai Health Authority (DHA).&#xD;
      This is a retrospective study where patients' treatment data will be collected and outcome&#xD;
      criteria will be applied blindly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample in this retrospective study will be selected from those patients who have&#xD;
      undergone single visit endodontic retreatment at the DHA Endodontics clinics from January&#xD;
      2018, through December 2019. The teeth under investigation will be tracked in the database&#xD;
      starting from completion of retreatment for at least 6 months, and the percentages of teeth&#xD;
      that were retained or underwent additional procedures such as apical surgery or extraction&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical and radiographic assessment at baseline and at recall documented in clinical&#xD;
      notes, and all data will be collected using a standardized proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of the existing root canal fillings and the status of the periapical tissues will&#xD;
      be determined according to the PAI by 2 calibrated independent observers using the periapical&#xD;
      radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Periapical index (PAI) The index is a radiographic method of interpretation that consists&#xD;
      of 5 categories, numbered 1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Quality of root canal filling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three criteria were used to assess the quality of the existing root canal fillings as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of root canal filling: root filling ending ≤2 mm from the radiographic apex, root&#xD;
      filling ending &gt;2 mm from the radiographic apex, or root filling at the radiographic apex&#xD;
      (flush).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Density of root canal filling: the presence or absence of voids in the root filling or&#xD;
      between the root filling and root canal walls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taper of the root canal filling: consistent taper from the orifice to the apex or no&#xD;
      consistent taper from the orifice to the apex&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preoperative diagnosis is determined based on clinical and radiographic findings using&#xD;
      the American Association of Endodontists Consensus Conference-recommended diagnostic&#xD;
      terminology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retreatment Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endodontic retreatment of all cases was conducted in a single visit by endodontic specialists&#xD;
      according to the contemporary standards of endodontic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only those patients with at least 6 months of clinical and radiographic follow-up were&#xD;
      included. When patients returned for recalls, one or multiple (in mutirooted teeth)&#xD;
      periapical radiographs were taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recall appointments included a radiographic and clinical examination of the treated tooth.&#xD;
      The examination was documented and included any signs or symptoms, the presence of a sinus&#xD;
      tract, sensitivity to percussion and palpation, swelling, periodontal pockets, or a history&#xD;
      of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periapical radiographs will be evaluated by 2 examiners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment outcomes will be classified into 3 categories according to the following&#xD;
      definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healed: Functional, asymptomatic teeth with no or minimal radiographic periradicular pathosis&#xD;
      (radiolucency) Nonhealed: Nonfunctional, symptomatic teeth with or without radiographic&#xD;
      periradicular pathosis or asymptomatic teeth with unchanged, new, or enlarged radiographic&#xD;
      periradicular pathosis (radiolucency) Healing: Teeth that are asymptomatic and functional&#xD;
      with a decreased size of radiographic periradicular pathosis (radiolucency) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collecting data into a recording sheet:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' treatment data will be collected continuously for at least 6 months in the&#xD;
      database, and outcome criteria will applied blindly. The teeth will be tracked in the&#xD;
      database during the entire period.&#xD;
