  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of hemp-based&#xD;
      Cannabidiol (CBD) topical products (e.g., lotions, creams, patches) that contain low levels&#xD;
      of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 5 topical cannabinoid products will be examined in this study. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 5 discrete stages, one for each product. In each stage, participants (N=20),&#xD;
      will be randomized to 1 of 2 double-blind drug conditions that entail the use of: 1) a&#xD;
      topical product that contains CBD and a low amount of THC (N=15), or 2) a placebo topical&#xD;
      product that does not contain cannabinoids (N=5), but which contains similar non-cannabinoid&#xD;
      ingredients to the active product. Thus, overall 100 participants will complete the study (75&#xD;
      active, 25 placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in each stage will complete a three-phase outpatient protocol that will last a&#xD;
      total of 17 days. Phase 1 (Day 1) will be an acute laboratory dosing session (approximately 7&#xD;
      hours in duration). Phase 2 (Days 2-10) will be an outpatient dosing period, during which&#xD;
      participants will continue to use participants' assigned product twice daily (morning and&#xD;
      evening) in participants' own environment. During Phase 2, participants will visit the&#xD;
      laboratory for brief study sessions on Days 2, 3, 7, and 10. Phase 3, will consist of a final&#xD;
      follow-up visit on Day 17, after a 1-week drug washout. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      assessments (subjective and cognitive effects) will be assessed during each phase.&#xD;
