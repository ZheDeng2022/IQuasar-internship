  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted on human subjects and is observational, prospective and&#xD;
      uncontrolled, defined as a category 3 according to the Jard√© Law (RIPH3). It is a national&#xD;
      and multicentric study. Enrolled patients are Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) patients who receive the&#xD;
      DBLG1 System (CE marked medical device) to be treated. Patients have their regular visits&#xD;
      with their own clinician. No change from their usual care must and will be done, including&#xD;
      trainings and treatment. At the end of the study, patients will keep their system for their&#xD;
      usual care and will continue having usual follow-up visits with their clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data related to their glycemia, complications and quality of life will be collected for 1&#xD;
      year from the beginning of their treatment. A comparison with data collected during the 2&#xD;
      weeks of run-in period, prior to the activation of loop mode, is planned. In case the run-in&#xD;
      phase lasts longer than 2 weeks, data collected from the two last weeks only will be kept for&#xD;
      analysis and comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is completed when all patients have their &quot;end of study&quot; file completed in the&#xD;
      electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to address the specific requirements from National Commission for the&#xD;
      Evaluation of Medical Devices and Health Technologies (CNEDiMTS) and to complete data&#xD;
      obtained up to now, with a larger cohort and in real life settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to increase variability in the profiles of patients included and to be as&#xD;
      representative as possible of all eligible patients, 20 centers will participate in the&#xD;
      study, both private and public, with a mix of university and regional centers and 348&#xD;
      patients will be included consecutively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion period lasts 6 months and each patient will be included in the study for a&#xD;
      period of 2 weeks of run-in and 1 year of treatment. An inclusion period of 6 months is&#xD;
      enough according to investigation site data and estimation of inclusion over 6 months&#xD;
      (detailed in part Healthcare professional and investigation centers recruitment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is observational. Patients included follow their usual medical care and will only&#xD;
      be asked for the specific need of the study to answer two questionnaires (at the beginning&#xD;
      and at the end of the study) and give their HbA1c results performed in their current medical&#xD;
      follow-up. As it is a post-registration study, medical devices are provided to patients on&#xD;
      medical prescription by healthcare providers, which have signed a distribution agreement with&#xD;
      and have been trained by Diabeloop. Patients have their system for 4 a maximum of 4 years&#xD;
      (life duration of the medical device (DBLG1 System)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients follow-up visits are not mandatory and no frequency is imposed. Investigators,&#xD;
      according to their habits, have follow-up visits corresponding to what they usually propose&#xD;
      to patients having a new treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the whole study and apart from scheduled visits (inclusion, beginning of run-in,&#xD;
      beginning of treatment , enf of study), each patient may contact his/her clinician&#xD;
      investigator in case of issue he/she judges as serious, for questions, etc. In that case, the&#xD;
      clinician may program a visit with the patient and deal with adverse events. Phone calls are&#xD;
      recorded in Case Report Form (CRF), as well as on-site visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: with Yourloops; investigators may follow the state of their patients, regarding the&#xD;
      time in range, mean glycemia value etc. Based on this, they may require a visit at their&#xD;
      convenience with the patient in order to change parameters of the system, discuss adverse&#xD;
      events, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives are the following To evaluate improvement in blood glucose control with use of&#xD;
      DBLG1 System after one year in real life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate details of glycemic control improvement, safety and adverse events due to the&#xD;
      DBLG1 System, evolution of quality of life after one year in real life and healthcare&#xD;
      professional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints Improvement of the time in glycemic range 70 - 180 mg/dL, in percentage, on&#xD;
      24hours and nighttime.&#xD;

      nighttime Time in hyperglycemia (above 180 mg/dL, 250 mg/dL and 300 mg/dL) - on 24hours and&#xD;

      Deviation (SD) and Coefficient of variation (CV) of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)&#xD;

      diabetic-specific quality of life Quantification of the healthcare professional support&#xD;
      required&#xD;
&#xD;
      An descriptive interim analysis will be made on the first 100 enrolled patients after 6&#xD;
      months of use of the DBLG1.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  patients total daily dose required must be less than 90 units (U);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients accepting to be treated with 100 U/mL rapid-acting insulin analog&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients having a HbA1c ‚â• 8% despite of the use of a pump for at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients performing glucose self-monitoring several times ( ‚â• 4) a day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patient accepting the technology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients agreeing to use the system with activated loop mode during at least 75% of&#xD;
             the&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  total time of use, this will be analyzed after 1 year of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients must be affiliated to any kind of social security&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients receiving a total daily dose of insulin lower than 8 U;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients suffering from a serious illness or having a treatment that might&#xD;
             significantly impair diabetes physiology (iSGLT2, steroids, metformin), i.e.&#xD;
             glucose-insulin interactions, that might interfere with the medical device (for&#xD;
             example treatment by steroids with variable dosage during the study period);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients having severe uncorrected problems of hearing and/or visual acuity preventing&#xD;
             proper use of DBLG1 System;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients unable to understand and perform all of the instructions regarding the&#xD;

             fields and heat could damage the components of the Dexcom G6, which may cause it to&#xD;
             display inaccurate sensor glucose readings (readings) or may prevent alerts. Without&#xD;
             G6 readings or alarm/alert notifications, patients might be exposed to severe low or&#xD;
             high glucose events;&#xD;

             professional;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients willing to use any insulin that is not 100 U/mL rapid-acting insulin analog&#xD;
             with the system (for example regular insulin; long-acting insulin analog; 200 U/mL&#xD;
