      Effectiveness of office based vergence/accommodative therapy for the treatment of&#xD;
      intermittent exotropia is investigated through a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) To evaluate the short-term effectiveness of office based vergence/accommodative therapy&#xD;
      (OBVAT) for improving control of intermittent exotropia compared to observation alone; ii) To&#xD;
      evaluate the long-term effectiveness of OBVAT for improving control of intermittent exotropia&#xD;
      compared to observation alone; iii) To determine the natural history of intermittent&#xD;
      exotropia among patients aged 6 to &lt; 18 years who have baseline near stereoacuity of 400 arc&#xD;
      sec or better using the Preschool Randot stereotest&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. 6 to &lt;18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Distance exodeviation between 10 and 30 prism diopters (PD) measured by prism and&#xD;
             alternate cover test (PACT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Near deviation not exceeding the distance deviation by &gt;10PD by PACT (i.e.,&#xD;
             convergence insufficiency type intermittent exotropia excluded)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Control of deviation meeting all the following criteria based on the office control&#xD;
             score scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
             4.1 Intermittent or constant exotropia at distance (mean of 3 baseline assessments of&#xD;
             distance control ≥ Grade 2)# 4.2 Intermittent exotropia or exophoria at near (at least&#xD;
             1 of 3 assessments of near control at the baseline visit Grade 0-4) or orthophoria&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Stereoacuity: near stereoacuity of 400 arcsec or better by the Preschool Randot&#xD;
             stereotest&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Cycloplegic subjective refraction spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error between&#xD;
             -6.00 diopters (D)and +3.50 D inclusive in either eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must be wearing the updated refractive correction (spectacles) for at least 2 weeks if&#xD;
             refractive error (based on cycloplegic subjective refraction performed within 6&#xD;
             months) meets any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             7.1 Myopia &gt;-0.50 D spherical equivalent in either eye 7.2 Anisometropia &gt;1.00 D&#xD;
             spherical equivalent 7.3 Astigmatism in either eye &gt;1.50 D&#xD;

             difference 8.2 Astigmatism cylinder must be within 0.25 D of full correction and axis&#xD;
             must be within 5 degree 8.3 For hyperopia and myopia, the spherical component can be&#xD;
             reduced by investigator discretion provided reduction is symmetrical and results in&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. No prior office-based vision therapy for any reason&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. No prior strabismus surgery or botulinum injection, intraocular surgery, or refractive&#xD;
