      Several barriers prevent the remission of HIV infection: low level viremia, HIV latency in&#xD;
      the genome of host infected immune cells and persistent immune activation. Targeting immune&#xD;
      activation and viral latency, represent the two intimately intricate goals to be envisaged&#xD;
      for purging the reservoir, in the perspective of HIV cure. There is an urgent to develop and&#xD;
      to test drugs targeting HIV latency, HIV residual replication and immune activation, alone or&#xD;
      in synergistic combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose in this study to test agents with a potential effect on HIV latency by combining&#xD;
      classical agents and newly discovered agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pitié-Salpêtrière virology group has identified some new diaminopiperidine based&#xD;
      compounds that have some antilatency properties through an activation of transcription.&#xD;
      Compounds of this new class will be tested in combination with classical agents (HDAC&#xD;
      inhibitors, HMT inhibitors, inducers of P-TEFb release, PKC agonists, DNMT inhibitors) and&#xD;
      less toxic compounds from classical categories for which Carine Van Lint (University of&#xD;
      Brussels) has obtained preliminary HIV reactivation data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the experimentations will be conducted in J-Lat cells and in ex- vivo CD4 cells sampled&#xD;
      in patients from the Pitié-Salpêtrière HIV cohort.&#xD;

      Despite its major benefits, cART implies mandatory lifespan treatment, toxicity, high costs&#xD;
      and the inability to restore full-health, thus urging the need to find a cure strategy and to&#xD;
      revisit our approach to HIV therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV eradication is currently not achievable with standard cART due to the persistence of HIV&#xD;
      reservoir maintained through low-level viremia, immune activation despite plasma viral&#xD;
      suppression and HIV latency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possibility to achieve HIV eradication has been limited, at least in part, by the&#xD;
      existence of latently infected cellular reservoirs. The major known cellular reservoir is&#xD;
      established in quiescent memory CD4+ T cells, providing an extremely long-lived set of cells&#xD;
      in which the virus can remain transcriptionally silen. Reactivation of latent viruses&#xD;
      followed by the killing of the infected cells has been proposed as a possible strategy&#xD;
      (''shock and kill'') to purge the latent reservoir. None of them have been currently really&#xD;
      successful. Innovative strategies to target HIV reservoir are needed. In parallel to clinical&#xD;
      interventions, there is a need to screen in vitro and ex vivo the best anti-latency and&#xD;
      anti-immune activation candidates, thus defining the optimal strategy targeting the&#xD;
      reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research on the control of HIV latency and potential reactivation have been hindered by the&#xD;
      small numbers of latently infected cells in vivo and the absence of known phenotypic markers&#xD;
      to distinguish those cells from uninfected cells. In this setting, cell-line models of&#xD;
      latency have been very useful due to their genetic and experimental tractability. Major&#xD;
      conceptual leaps have been facilitated by the use of latently infected T cell lines,&#xD;
      including the ability to conduct genetic screens. On the other hand, latently infected cell&#xD;
      lines are limited by their cycling nature and inherent mutations in growth controls, and the&#xD;
      clonal nature of the virus integration sites. Such transformed cell lines lack the ability to&#xD;
      differentiate and naturally oscillate between phases of quiescence and active proliferation&#xD;
      in response to biological signals. Because of these limitations, several laboratories have&#xD;
      recently developed primary cellular models of HIV-1 latency that capitalize on specific&#xD;
      aspects of the T cell reservoir, found in vivo. These newer models allow easily and rapidly&#xD;
      to study proposed virological and cellular mechanisms of latency and to evaluate novel small&#xD;
      molecule compounds for induction of viral reactivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One particular complex issue is the diversity of latency models and the many differences&#xD;
      among them. Disparities relate to: the T-cell subsets represented; the cellular signaling&#xD;
      pathways capable of driving viral reactivation; and the genetic composition of the viruses&#xD;
      employed, ranging from wild-type to functional deletion of multiple genes. Additional&#xD;
      differences reside in the experimental approaches taken to establish latent infection in&#xD;
      these primary cell models, which involve either infection of activated cycling cells later&#xD;
      allowed to return to a resting state, or direct infection of quiescent cells. Because of such&#xD;
      system variables, screening efforts in specific cell models with identified drug candidates&#xD;
      for ''anti-latency'' therapy often fail to reactivate HIV uniformly across the different&#xD;
      models. Therefore, the activity of a drug candidate, varies from one cellular model, to&#xD;
      another one or in cells from infected patients, tested ex-vivo. The current situation in this&#xD;
      research field represents a critical knowledge gap that is adversely affecting our ability to&#xD;
      identify promising treatment compounds and their associated molecular mechanisms and is&#xD;
      hindering the advancement of drug testing into relevant animal models and ultimately, human&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study, induction of viral reactivation across several cell models was assessed&#xD;
      using a selected common panel of stimuli known to function by distinct and defined mechanisms&#xD;
      of action. The panel included 13 treatments that modulate T cell processes such as T-cell&#xD;
      receptor engagement, protein kinase C (PKC) activation, calcium influx, cytokine signaling,&#xD;
      histone deacetylation, and release of P-TEFb from the HEXIM/7SK RNP complex. This last study&#xD;
      was designed to answer the following questions: 1) are certain models of latency biased&#xD;
      towards or against particular cell signaling pathways? 2) can stimuli that work uniformly in&#xD;
      multiple models be identified? 3) can a central uniting theme or a single signaling pathway&#xD;
      be responsible for control of viral latency? and 4) can a model or limited group of models&#xD;
      predict experimental drug activity in authentic latently infected cells from patients? The&#xD;
      results indicate that no single in vitro cell model alone is able to capture accurately the&#xD;
      ex vivo response characteristics of latently infected T cells from patients. Most cell models&#xD;
      demonstrated that sensitivity to HIV reactivation was skewed towards or against specific drug&#xD;
      classes. Protein kinase C agonists and PHA reactivated latent HIV uniformly across models,&#xD;
      although in most other drug classes did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From these observations, it is obvious that single agents will not be enough potent to induce&#xD;
      an efficient stimulation of HIV transcription and latency disruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose in the Eravir study to test several agents in combinations including classical&#xD;
      agents and new classes of agents recently discovered in our institutions in their capacity to&#xD;
      reactivate HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All experimentations will be conducted in J-Lat cells and in ex vivo CD4 cells sampled in HIV&#xD;
      patients with a fully suppressed viremia on antiretroviral treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team of Pitié-Salpêtrière has identified some new compounds diaminopiperidine based that&#xD;
      have some properties that could disturb latency of HIV allowing an activation of&#xD;
      transcription. Compounds of this family will be tested in combination with classical agents&#xD;
      such as HDAC inhibitors, HMT inhibitors, inducers of P-TEFb release, PKC agonists, DNMT&#xD;
      inhibitors and also with compounds from these categories but less toxic for which Carine Van&#xD;
      Lint's lab (University of Brussels) has obtained preliminary HIV reactivation data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the tests will be conducted in J-Lat cells and in ex vivo CD4 cells sampled in patients&#xD;
      of Pitié-salpêtrière Hospital (Paris) and of Saint-Pierre Hospital (Bruxells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also frozen viable PBMC-samples will be dispatched from Belgium and France to the Spanish&#xD;
      partner in order to test immune-activation and inflammation parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question will evaluate whether these above mentioned combination are capable to&#xD;
      reactivate HIV from cellular models and ex vivo in patient cells.&#xD;
