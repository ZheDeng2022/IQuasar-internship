    <textblock>
      Background Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is characterized by intense pain and loss of&#xD;
      function, and associated with motor, trophic, sudomotor, and/or vasomotor changes of the&#xD;
      affected extremity. CRPS of the upper extremity is seen frequently in our electrodiagnostic,&#xD;
      neurology, and musculoskeletal clinics and occurs in up to one-third of patients who have&#xD;
      undergone common surgical procedures, such as carpal tunnel release or release of Dupuytren's&#xD;
      contracture. To date, there is a limited understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of&#xD;
      CRPS. As a consequence, few effective treatment options are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral nerve blocks have proven to be successful in reducing pain for several&#xD;
      musculoskeletal and neurologic conditions. These blocks could be an opportunity for blocking&#xD;
      somatic and autonomic sensory fibers that are thought to contribute to CRPS. In a small&#xD;
      exploratory study, we found that peripheral nerve blocks in the upper extremity&#xD;
      (suprascapular and median nerves) resulted in a 56% and 37% pain reduction in the shoulder&#xD;
      and hand two weeks after injection, respectively, and were well-tolerated in patients with&#xD;
      CRPS. While this was highly encouraging, large randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs)&#xD;
      are necessary to demonstrate effectiveness and safety of nerve blocks for this population&#xD;
      before this treatment is accepted into clinical practice. This proposal aims to demonstrate&#xD;
      the feasibility of performing such a RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To evaluate the feasibility of performing a placebo-controlled RCT assessing the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of peripheral nerve blocks (suprascapular, median, and ulnar nerves) for&#xD;
      reducing pain in patients with CRPS. This is a phase IV feasibility study that will test the&#xD;
      critical elements necessary for performing a RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods We will recruit participants (≥18 years old) from The Ottawa Hospital, Bruyère&#xD;
      Continuing Care (Elisabeth Bruyère Hospital, St-Vincent Hospital), and Providence Care&#xD;
      Hospital (Kingston, ON), meeting the well-established clinical Budapest criteria for upper&#xD;
      extremity CRPS and having a visual analog scale (VAS) pain score of at least 40 mm (to avoid&#xD;
      flooring effect). Participants will be block-randomized by the Ottawa Methods Centre to&#xD;
      receive injections of either A) intervention (suprascapular, median, and ulnar nerves) with&#xD;
      bupivacaine and triamcinolone acetonide, or B) placebo (saline). All participants will&#xD;
      receive standard care for CRPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility outcomes will focus on crucial methodologic aspects for the future RCT,&#xD;
      including: (1) level of recruitment, (2) rate of acceptance from eligible patients to the&#xD;
      randomization procedure, (3) blinding efficacy, (4) degree of patient retention, (5) rate of&#xD;
      data completion, and (6) rate of adverse events for both the placebo and intervention groups.&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be evaluated within 1 hour, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months&#xD;
      post-injection.&#xD;

    <description>Saline is a buffer solution commonly used in biological research. It is a water-based salt solution containing disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride and, in some formulations, potassium chloride and potassium dihydrogen phosphate. The buffer helps to maintain a constant pH. The osmolarity and ion concentrations of the solutions match those of the human body.</description>
