  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a severe and life-threatening condition, often affecting&#xD;
      the kidneys and brain. It can occur on the background of various clinical conditions.&#xD;
      Dysregulation of the alternative pathway of complement may be the etiological factor and this&#xD;
      type of TMA is classified, according to the current nomenclature, as primary atypical&#xD;
      hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Half the patients with primary atypical HUS present with&#xD;
      rare variants in complement genes, although coexisting conditions are often needed for the&#xD;
      TMA to become manifest. In patients with secondary atypical HUS, certain coexisting&#xD;
      conditions appear to drive the disease and treatment should target the underlying condition&#xD;
      to remit the TMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the investigators demonstrated, by using a novel in-house developed functional&#xD;
      endothelial cell-based test, that complement dysregulation and overactivation is the dominant&#xD;
      cause of disease and its sequelae in a subset of patients with secondary atypical HUS, having&#xD;
      impact on treatment and prognosis. The investigators did first prove this concept in patients&#xD;
      presenting with TMA and hypertensive emergency. A prospective study is needed to further&#xD;
      corroborate these findings along the spectrum of TMA. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      their functional endothelial cell-based test, the so-called &quot;HMEC&quot; test, can better&#xD;
      categorizes the TMA into different groups with potential therapeutic and prognostic&#xD;
      implications. Thus, paving the road to the ultimate goal of precision medicine.&#xD;
