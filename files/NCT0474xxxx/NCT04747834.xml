  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the use of&#xD;
      low-energy segment removal with a micro-interventional irrigation/aspiration port (MICOR-304)&#xD;
      to evacuate the lens prior to intraocular lens insertion in subjects undergoing routine&#xD;
      cataract surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 100 eyes at up to 5 investigational sites will be enrolled in one of the two cohorts of&#xD;
      this clinical investigation - up to 50 eyes in Cohort 1 and up to 50 eyes in Cohort 2. Only&#xD;
      one eye per subject will be enrolled into the study. This is multicenter, multi-cohort,&#xD;
      prospective clinical study designed to provide longitudinal, observational, non-comparative&#xD;
      clinical outcome data for mechanical non-phacoemulsification lens extraction using low-energy&#xD;
      segment removal with a micro-interventional irrigation/aspiration port (MICOR-304) to&#xD;
      evacuate the lens prior to intraocular lens insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet the inclusion and exclusion will be asked to enroll in the study. The&#xD;
      investigator or designee will explain the study purpose, procedures and responsibilities to&#xD;
      the potential participant and provide sufficient opportunity to ask questions, while allowing&#xD;
      adequate time for consideration of the information provided. Upon participant confirmation of&#xD;
      interest, written informed consent will be obtained and the subject will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. One copy of the informed consent document (ICD) will be retained with the subject's&#xD;
      medical records and one copy will be provided to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be stratified into two Cohorts. Cohort 1 is comprised of eyes with&#xD;
      mild-to- moderate cataracts only (Grade 1 to 2). Cohort 2 is comprised of eyes with moderate&#xD;
      to more dense cataracts only (Grade 2+ to 3+).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be seen at the screening visit, intraoperative visit, and at post-operative&#xD;
      days 1, 7, and 30.&#xD;

    <description>Total lens removal time is defined in two phases:&#xD;
The beginning time starts when the surgeon enters the eye with the MICOR-304 to start the lens removal process and completing when the surgeon finishes the nucleus lens removal with the MICOR-304 before changing over to irrigation and aspiration.&#xD;
o The second phase of lens removal time is the irrigation and aspiration stage for cortex removal which starts when the irrigation and aspiration tip enters the eye and completion time is when the cortex is removed.&#xD;
The total lens removal time as defined above is recorded in minutes and seconds.</description>

    <description>The MICOR-304 offers a mechanical approach to lens fragmentation and aspiration which provides an alternative to phacoemulsification with no cavitation, no thermogenic energy in the eye, which can eliminate generation of heat inside the eye while maintaining the same minimally invasive surgical approach through a small clear-cornea 2.5 mm incision.</description>
