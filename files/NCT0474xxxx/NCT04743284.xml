  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MS is characterized by clinical symptoms caused by lesions of the brain, spinal cord, or&#xD;
      optic nerves that can affect balance, gait, and risk of falls. 50-80% of patients with MS&#xD;
      have different levels of balance-related pathological findings. In addition, the imbalance is&#xD;
      one of the most complained about findings by MS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance and postural control disorders are the most common signs in patients with cerebellar&#xD;
      tract damage. Many patients have reported problems with balance and gait causing serious&#xD;
      disability. Therefore, disorders of balance and postural control in patients with MS are&#xD;
      associated with difficulty in standing and performing functional activities. Effective&#xD;
      quantitative methods are needed to assess postural imbalance to help clinicians assess the&#xD;
      progression of this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current literature suggests that home tele-rehabilitation and tele-medicine practices may be&#xD;
      an alternative method effective enough to be equivalent to face-to-face physiotherapy&#xD;
      treatments for patients with Ms. The advantages of Tele-medicine over normal care include&#xD;
      increased social support, participant engagement, quality of care, cost-effectiveness, access&#xD;
      to services (due to lack of transportation), and reducing the burden on healthcare&#xD;
      professionals to make services easier to deploy. In cases such as Pandemic conditions, where&#xD;
      face-to-face service is disrupted in clinics, tele-rehabilitation can be applied as a&#xD;
      suitable alternative treatment method accessible to patients. The effectiveness of&#xD;
      Tele-rehabilitation raises the question of whether tele-evaluation is as effective and&#xD;
      accurate as in the clinic. Studies examining the effectiveness of Tele-assesment are still&#xD;
      insufficient. The study is planned to address this deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the results of MS patients by applying valid and reliable&#xD;
      methods used in balance assessment with face-to-face and online access methods, thereby&#xD;
      investigating the effectiveness of balance assessment through online access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis in this study is that the results of the balance assessment with online access&#xD;
      in MS patients will be consistent with the results of the balance assessment conducted&#xD;
      face-to-face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Tele-assessments of balance do not give the same results as face-to-face balance&#xD;
      assessments in MS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Tele-assessments of balance do not give the same results as face-to-face balance&#xD;
      assessments in MS patients.&#xD;

      Voluntary patients who have been diagnosed with MS will be included in the study. Signed&#xD;
      voluntary consent will be obtained from participants. Participants will be divided into two&#xD;
      groups. Tele-assessment will be applied to one group first, and face-to-face assessment will&#xD;
      be applied to the other group first.&#xD;

    <measure>Berg Balance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 3rd day</time_frame>
    <description>It is a scale containing 14 instructions and a score of 0-4 is given by observing the patient's performance for each instruction. 0 points are given in cases where the patient cannot perform the activity at all, while 4 points are given when the patient completes the activity independently. The highest score is 56 and 0-20 points indicate balance disorder, 21-40 points indicate an acceptable balance, 41-56 points indicate the presence of a good balance. It takes between 10 and 20 minutes to complete the scale.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic Gait Index</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 3rd day</time_frame>
    <description>The scale measures mobility function and dynamic balance. The eight tasks of this scale include walking, walking with head turns, turning, walking over objects, walking around objects, and climbing up stairs. The performance is rated on a 4-point scale.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 3rd day</time_frame>
    <description>The test is a measure of dynamic balance. It requires individuals to get up from a chair, walk 3 feet, turn and sit. The time from the moment the individual lifts the pelvis from the chair until he or she returns with the pelvis in the chair is recorded in seconds.</description>
