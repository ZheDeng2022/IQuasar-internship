      Moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity is known to reduce the risk of hypertensive&#xD;
      disorders of pregnancy and other adverse pregnancy outcomes that increase future maternal&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk (2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee, 2018;&#xD;
      Davenport et al., 2018), yet less than 25% of pregnant women meet public health physical&#xD;
      activity guidelines (Hesketh &amp; Evenson, 2016). More than 95% of the 24-hour day is spent in&#xD;
      sedentary behavior, sleep, or light-intensity activity; however, the impacts of these lower&#xD;
      intensity activities on adverse pregnancy outcomes are unknown. This multi-site observational&#xD;
      cohort study (N=500) will leverage state-of-the-art, 24-hour behavior assessment in each&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy and examine associations with adverse pregnancy outcomes to inform&#xD;
      guidelines and future interventions designed to improve women's pregnancy and long-term&#xD;
      cardiovascular health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to use state-of-the-art monitors to objectively measure the&#xD;
      24-hour behavioral cycle (sedentary behavior, sleep, and physical activity) in each trimester&#xD;
      of pregnancy, and to examine associations of these behaviors with hypertensive disorders of&#xD;
      pregnancy and other adverse pregnancy outcomes linked with future cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD) risk. For this, 500 women in early pregnancy will be recruited to take part in a&#xD;
      multi-site (Universities of Iowa and Pittsburgh) cohort study. Women will wear two&#xD;
      state-of-the-art devices for seven days in each trimester of pregnancy to assess sedentary&#xD;
      behavior and physical activity (activPAL micro 3) as well as sleep (ActiWatch Spectrum Plus).&#xD;
      Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and other adverse outcomes will be obtained through&#xD;
      medical chart abstraction. This project will inform guidelines on optimal 24-hour behavioral&#xD;
      patterns in pregnancy, as well as lay the foundation for future studies testing behavioral&#xD;
      interventions in pregnancy to achieve optimal outcomes and improve women's long-term&#xD;
      cardiovascular health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Examine associations of sedentary behavior patterns with hypertensive disorders of&#xD;
      pregnancy. Hypothesis: Women with a consistently high sedentary behavior pattern across&#xD;
      trimesters will have higher incidence of gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, after&#xD;
      adjustment for MVPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Examine associations of sleep patterns with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Women with short sleep duration or poor sleep quality patterns across trimesters&#xD;
      will have higher incidence of gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, after adjustment for&#xD;
      MVPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3: Determine optimal 24-hour behavioral patterns during pregnancy to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Hypothesis: Statistically reallocating time in sedentary&#xD;
      behavior for LPA or MVPA, but not sleep (among adequate duration sleepers), will be&#xD;
      associated with lower incidence of gestational hypertension/preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Pregnancy is a critical period for future cardiovascular health where unmasked&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors contribute to the development of maternal CVD later&#xD;
      in life (Catov, 2015). The American Heart Association (AHA) now recognizes adverse pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes, including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia as key risk factors for CVD&#xD;
      (Mosca et al., 2011). CVD remains the leading cause of mortality among women in the United&#xD;
      States, accounting for one-third of all deaths (Benjamin et al., 2018). Stagnant CVD rates in&#xD;
      young women are a particular public health problem. While overall CVD mortality rates have&#xD;
      decreased over the last 20 years, mortality rates in women younger than 55 years have&#xD;
      plateaued (Benjamin et al., 2018; Wilmot, O'Flaherty, Capewell, Ford, &amp; Vaccarino, 2015). In&#xD;
      order to reduce the burden of CVD, it is essential to focus on populations who are more&#xD;
      likely to develop CVD risk factors, including women of reproductive age. Identifying&#xD;
      modifiable behavioral factors that are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes could help&#xD;
      prevent these conditions and the long-term risk they bring to women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on guidelines, women during pregnancy should generally 'move more and sit less'&#xD;
      throughout the day (2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee, 2018). While there&#xD;
      is currently insufficient evidence to define specific quantitative targets for limiting&#xD;
      sedentary behavior in the general population or pregnant women, the 2018 Physical Activity&#xD;
      Guidelines Advisory Committee highlighted sedentary behavior and pregnancy as two key topics&#xD;
      in need of further research. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)&#xD;
      also does not have sedentary behavior guidelines during pregnancy, although growing evidence&#xD;
      suggests prescribed bed rest may actually increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes,&#xD;
      rather than decreasing risk as previously thought (Matenchuk et al., 2019). Guidelines also&#xD;
      suggest that pregnant women should sleep 7 to 9 hours per night on a regular basis (Watson et&#xD;
      al., 2015). Yet, uncertainty remains about the health effects of short or long sleep duration&#xD;
      during pregnancy, as well as how sleep quality influences pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 1, the proposed research will inform quantitative guidelines for sedentary behavior&#xD;
      patterns and the development of cardiovascular risk during pregnancy. Aim 2 will address&#xD;
      existing gaps by evaluating objectively-measured sleep quantity and quality to understand&#xD;
      nuances in sleep across pregnancy and implications for health outcomes. As established&#xD;
      guidelines recommend pregnant women get 150 minutes of aerobic MVPA per week or approximately&#xD;
      20-30 minutes per day, this is not the focus of the current study. However, MVPA is an&#xD;
      important component of the 24-hour behavioral cycle and must be assessed to understand which&#xD;
      24-hour behavioral patterns are most associated with optimal cardiovascular health during&#xD;
      pregnancy, as proposed in Aim 3. Our primary outcome of interest is hypertensive disorders&#xD;
      that develop during pregnancy (gestational hypertension and preeclampsia) given the high and&#xD;
      rising prevalence of these conditions, strong association with future maternal CVD, and&#xD;
      promising pilot data indicating that sedentary behavior may be associated with these&#xD;
      conditions, even after adjustment for MVPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examining the dynamic interplay of sedentary behavior, sleep, and physical activity&#xD;
      (conceptualized as a 24-hour behavioral cycle) is critical to determine optimal patterns for&#xD;
      pregnancy health. Given that there is a finite amount of time in a day, increasing time in&#xD;
      one behavior requires decreasing time in another behavior. The effects of sedentary behavior,&#xD;
      sleep, and physical activity on health outcomes are not only dependent on each behavior, but&#xD;
      also on the behavior that they displace (Mekary, Willett, Hu, &amp; Ding, 2009). While these&#xD;
      behaviors are often studied in isolation, this new paradigm considers the importance of&#xD;
      examining the combined role of sedentary behavior, sleep, and physical activity on health&#xD;
      outcomes (Buman et al., 2014). Emerging statistical methods to test hypotheses within finite&#xD;
      time constraints will allow us to better understand the full 24-hour behavioral cycle and how&#xD;
      these activity domains can be coupled and leveraged for health promotion and disease&#xD;
      prevention. This study will address a critical gap in knowledge by examining how the 24-hour&#xD;
      behavioral cycle is related to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy or other adverse outcomes&#xD;
      that increase CVD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, preventing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and other adverse outcomes is a&#xD;
      potentially potent public health approach to reduce the burden of CVD in women. In the&#xD;
      context of increasing incidence and limited treatment options, there is a critical need to&#xD;
      identify novel, modifiable intervention targets that could prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes&#xD;
      and improve women's cardiovascular health.&#xD;
