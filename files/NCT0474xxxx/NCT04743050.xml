  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (EFAs) have a significant impact on human health, even&#xD;
      before birth. Their supplementation is recommended at all ages, especially in people with&#xD;
      cardiolovascular risks. The most valuable proven action of EFAs is the improvement of the&#xD;
      lipid profile (including increase in HDL, the so-called &quot;good cholesterol&quot; and lowering LDL,&#xD;
      the so-called &quot;bad cholesterol&quot;), preventing the development of atherosclerosis, strokes and&#xD;
      heart attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We distinguish three fractions of EFAs: EPA, DHA and ALA. The best known are EPA and DHA, but&#xD;
      in recent years the interest in ALA fraction has increased, as it is the only fraction that&#xD;
      has pronounced anti-inflammatory properties, but also only ALA is not produced by the human&#xD;
      body and must be supplied with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that the supplementation of the ALA fraction is as important as the&#xD;
      supplementation of the well-known and recommended EPA and DHA fractions, moreover it also&#xD;
      brings unique benefits. The aim of the study is to demonstrate the benefits of EFAs in the&#xD;
      prevention of cardiovascular diseases in the group of adults. In the project, we also want to&#xD;
      compare the benefits of supplementing various fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each volunteer will be randomly assigned to one of 4 groups. Group No. 1 will be a group&#xD;
      without the supplementation of essential fatty acids (EFAs), group No. 2 will receive&#xD;
      supplementation with pure ALA fraction, group No. 3 will receive supplementation with EPA and&#xD;
      DHA fractions, and group No. 4 will receive supplementation with all fractions, i.e. ALA, EPA&#xD;
      and DHA. All persons from groups 1-4 will be examined three times: at the beginning, after&#xD;
      three months and after six months (at the end of the project). The tests will include: blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements, non-invasive measurements of body mass and composition, and laboratory&#xD;
      tests: CRP, fasting glucose, lipid profile, and blood count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both preparations for acid supplementation and tests are completely free for participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study is voluntary and is not associated with any health risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supplementation of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (EFAs) in patients is recommended by&#xD;
      cardiological, diabetic, hypertensive and gynecological societies. The project aims to&#xD;
      demonstrate the benefits of following these recommendations in the prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases in the adult group. Most of the research focuses only on EPA and DHA&#xD;
      fractions, while in view of the publications on the health-promoting properties of the ALA&#xD;
      fraction, which is the only one that is only exogenous and has clear anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties, in the project we also want to compare the benefits of supplementation of esters&#xD;
      of individual EFA fractions. We intend to conduct a clinical trial with a control sample and&#xD;
      3 study groups randomly assigned to each group. The groups will consist of 50 people, which&#xD;
      means that the research project will involve 200 people in total. The control group will be a&#xD;
      group without EFA supplementation, the first experimental group will receive supplementation&#xD;
      with pure ALA fraction of EFAs esters, the second experimental group will receive&#xD;
      supplementation of the EPA and DHA fraction of EFAs esters, and the third experimental group&#xD;
      will receive supplementation of the ALA, EPA and DHA fraction of EFAs esters. All&#xD;
      participants will have laboratory tests marking: CRP, fasting glucose, lipid profile, total&#xD;
      blood count, and additional tests, which will include blood pressure measurements and&#xD;
      measurements of body mass and composition on a specialized body composition analyzer (InBody&#xD;
      270). All the above-mentioned tests will be performed at the time of joining the research&#xD;
      program, after 3 months (in the middle of the research program) and after 6 months (at the&#xD;
      end of the research program).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine whether the supplementation of the ALA fraction esters&#xD;
      of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids is as important as the supplementation of their EPA&#xD;
      and DHA fraction esters, and whether it brings additional unique benefits related to its&#xD;
      pronounced anti-inflammatory properties. This comparison is particularly important in the&#xD;
      group of adults, as early and effective intervention may contribute to improving health,&#xD;
      quality of life, increasing life expectancy and reducing treatment costs, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases as lifestyle diseases are one of the most common in the world and concern younger&#xD;
      and younger people. The project's feasibility is assessed positively as the project has&#xD;
      significant scientific potential. The discussed topic is up-to-date and the size of the&#xD;
      studied group guarantees reliable results and gathering such a group remains possible. The&#xD;
      importance of using EFAs in medicine is constantly increasing, and research using them gives&#xD;
      promising results.&#xD;
