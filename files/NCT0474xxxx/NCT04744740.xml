      This research will assess the ability of nightly objective sleep scheduling and sleep heart&#xD;
      rate data to predict variation in suicidal ideation in U.S. military veterans identified as&#xD;
      high-risk according to actuarial and/or clinical indicators. These data will be recorded&#xD;
      using one of two low-cost, commercial, zero-burden, mattress actigraphic systems that enable&#xD;
      remote, centralized, data access. Participants will be veterans accrued both from the REACH&#xD;
      VET and local high-risk lists, a process involving collaboration with the Suicide Prevention&#xD;
      Coordinator at the VA Palo Alto HCS. In order to minimize burden, participants will be&#xD;
      screened by telephone, consented by mail and telephone, administered a brief admission&#xD;
      psychometric interview by telephone, and mailed a sleep sensor system and instructions for&#xD;
      its installation in their home. Once sleep data collection has commenced, a trained&#xD;
      interviewer will contact the participant by telephone weekly and administer the&#xD;
      Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Data collection will continue for three months. The&#xD;
      study targets a sample of 40 veterans. Longitudinal mixed effects modeling will be employed&#xD;
      to determine whether changes in sleep scheduling and sleep heart rate predict changes in&#xD;
      suicidal ideation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Suicide is a devastating event that occurs at a very low base rate, rendering detection of&#xD;
      acute suicide risk one of the signal challenges in behavioral science. Advancement in the&#xD;
      detection of imminent risk requires new modalities of intensive, longitudinal data collection&#xD;
      that are both acceptable and scalable. Recent developments in commercial, actigraphic sleep&#xD;
      recording systems have opened a new avenue of approach to this challenge, enabling the&#xD;
      automated collection and daily review of sleep scheduling and sleep heart rate (HR), both of&#xD;
      which have demonstrated associations with suicidality in prior studies. Our team, comprising&#xD;
      Drs. Steven Woodward (Director of the Sleep and Psychophysiology Laboratory of the National&#xD;
      Center for PTSD), Rebecca Bernert (Director of the Suicide Prevention Center, Stanford&#xD;
      University School of Medicine), Christina Khan (Director of the Thrive Clinic, Stanford&#xD;
      University School of Medicine), and Wilfred Pigeon (Director of the Center of Excellence in&#xD;
      Suicide Prevention, Department of Veterans Affairs) will pursue the following Aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: To assess, in U.S. military veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD), whether sleep schedule variability and sleep heart rate, recorded in the home for one&#xD;
      month using a low-cost, zero-burden, actigraphic sleep measurement system, can distinguish&#xD;
      those who are at elevated actuarial risk for suicide from those who are not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: To assess, in U.S. military veterans diagnosed with PTSD, whether elevated sleep&#xD;
      schedule variability and elevated sleep heart rates can predict increased suicidal ideation&#xD;
      over a clinically-relevant surveillance period of two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposal is founded on observational and epidemiological studies supporting associations&#xD;
      between sleep disturbance, basal heart rate and suicidality, including important&#xD;
      contributions from Co-Is Bernert and Pigeon (1-12). Also supportive of the proposal are new&#xD;
      observations from a sample of 71 U.S. Military veterans with deployment-related PTSD studied&#xD;
      by the PI during inpatient PTSD treatment. In this sample, after adjusting for depressed mood&#xD;
      and body mass index (BMI), sleep heart rate was 3.8 BPM higher in those endorsing current&#xD;
      ideation and a history of attempts than in those denying both. The investigators also&#xD;
      describe in detail below a supportive case observed in Dr. Woodward's laboratory which, to&#xD;
      our knowledge, represents the first extended acquisition of sleep behavior prior to a serious&#xD;
      suicide attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposal leverages the PI's expertise in zero-burden, mattress-actigraphic sleep&#xD;
      recording originally motivated by the observation that PTSD patients rarely manifest sleep&#xD;
      disturbances in the laboratory. The aforementioned data were obtained employing a&#xD;
      high-accuracy, non-commercial, mattress actigraphic system developed by the PI (13-15), which&#xD;
      was found acceptable to &gt; 95% of the 900+ veteran PTSD inpatients with whom it has been used&#xD;
      at the Trauma Recovery Program (TRP) at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System (~40,000 nights&#xD;
      of recording). The proposed study will employ a low-cost, commercially-available alternative,&#xD;
      the Sleepace RestOn, that can be mailed and user-installed. This system is also zero-burden&#xD;
      as there is nothing to put on, take off, charge, or upload. In our pilot work, it has proven&#xD;
      acceptable to veteran outpatients at high risk for suicide. Moreover, though its connection&#xD;
      to a tablet computer, this system provides daily, web-based access to the raw actigraphic&#xD;
      data enabling the direct verification of data quality and the application of custom&#xD;
      algorithms to extract movement, heart rate, and respiratory amplitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 will attempt to replicate and extend the aforementioned observations made in PTSD&#xD;
      inpatients with and without suicidal ideation and histories of attempts in PTSD outpatients&#xD;
      studied in the home. Aim 2 will attempt to replicate and extend Co-I Bernert's study&#xD;
      demonstrating, in high-risk young adults, that weekly changes in sleep schedule variability&#xD;
      predict weekly changes in suicidal ideation (1). Bernert's study period will be extended from&#xD;
      three weeks to two months, and sleep heart rate will be included as a predictor. Suicide&#xD;
      symptoms will be assessed weekly by telephone using the Depression Symptom Index - Suicide&#xD;
      Severity (DSI-SS; 16), a brief, psychometrically-sound measure of suicide ideation intensity&#xD;
      yielding a score from 0 to 12 (17). Mixed effects modeling (18) will be employed, and with&#xD;
      respect to Aim 2, the temporal precedence of changes in sleep to changes in suicidal ideation&#xD;
      intensity will be tested in order confirm that sleep changes meet criteria for true&#xD;
      risk-factors (19). An established partnership with VA Suicide Prevention Coordinators (SPCs)&#xD;
      will facilitate recruitment from the actuarial REACH VET list (20) and local hospital&#xD;
      high-risk list while maximizing participant safety. An exploratory aim will estimate the&#xD;
      contribution of certain participant factors likely to impact sleep scheduling or its&#xD;
      measurement, in-bed media consumption, hypnotic medication, CPAP use, and alcohol/substance&#xD;
      use. In the case of a positive study outcome, a multi-site R01 will be proposed including&#xD;
      centralized data collection and review at the VA Center of Excellence for Suicide Prevention&#xD;
      in Canandaigua, NY, under the direction of Co-I Pigeon, implementation science and health&#xD;
      economic aims developed in collaboration with Co-I Marshall, and exploratory integration into&#xD;
      the REACH VET algorithm.&#xD;
