  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the induction is to decrease stress response of endotracheal intubation. It is&#xD;
      also important to keep hemodynamics stable during and after the induction period. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that topical anesthesia can provide excellent superior supraglottic and&#xD;
      subglottic local anesthetic effects and can significantly reduce the dosage of intravenous&#xD;
      anesthetics. Therefore, it is significant to explore whether the combination of topical&#xD;
      anesthesia and intravenous anesthetics could decrease the stress response of endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation and keep hemodynamics stable during and after the induction period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The routine anesthesia induction strategy for cardiac surgery is to decrease stress response&#xD;
      during endotracheal intubation by using large doses of opioids. However, high doses of&#xD;
      opioids often leads to persistent and recurrent hypotension in patients from the anesthesia&#xD;
      induction period to the beginning of the surgery. Patients scheduled to accept cardiac&#xD;
      surgery often have severe concomitant disease. Hemodynamic fluctuation might lead to&#xD;
      disastrous events. Anesthesia induction for such patients should not only provide adequate&#xD;
      depth of anesthesia to decrease the stress response of endotracheal intubation, but also make&#xD;
      hemodynamics stable after tracheal intubation.&#xD;
