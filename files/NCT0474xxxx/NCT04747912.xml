  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will add an anti-cancer drug (called inotuzumab ozogamicin also known as&#xD;
      &quot;InO&quot;) to treatment for participants with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive&#xD;
      (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Doctors leading this study hope to learn if adding&#xD;
      InO to standard induction treatment for Ph+ ALL will lead to quicker, complete molecular&#xD;
      remission (where the disease is not detectable even with very sensitive testing techniques).&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to gather information regarding the effectiveness of InO in&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed Ph+ ALL patients that have not yet received treatment.&#xD;

    <description>All participants in this arm will receive the same first round of treatment as part of induction/consolidation therapy. This treatment will use inotuzumab ozogamicin combined with anti-cancer drugs. The additional treatment that participants receive after this first round of treatment will vary based on the participant's response to induction therapy. This phase of treatment will last for 60 days. All participants in this arm will receive the following treatment:&#xD;
Treatment Course I (Induction Phase, 28 days):&#xD;
Dasatinib 140mg daily continuous&#xD;
Dexamethasone 10mg/m^2 PO or IV Days 1-7 and Day 15-Day 22&#xD;
InO 0.8mg/m2 Day 8; 0.5mg/m2 D15, 0.5mg/m2 Day 22&#xD;
Intrathecal methotrexate 15mg Day 1, Day 28&#xD;
Treatment Course II (Consolidation Phase, 28 days):&#xD;
Dasatinib 140mg daily continuous&#xD;
InO: If in CR/CRi 0.5mg/m2 Day 1, Day 8, Day 15; If not in CR/CRi 0.8mg/m2 on Day 1, 0.5mg/m2 Day 8 and Day 15&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Treatment Arm - Interim/Maintenance Phase - Participants in CMR</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This study arm is for participants who no longer show any detectable signs of BCR-ABL1 (a cancer-causing gene) in response to the previous phase of induction/consolidation treatment (also known as being in &quot;complete molecular remission&quot; or CMR). Participants in this arm will receive 3 courses of interim/maintenance treatment using dasatinib combined with other anti-cancer drugs. Inotuzumab ozogamicin will be added during the fourth course of treatment. These treatments will be given in 28-day and 84-day cycles.&#xD;
If the participant achieves complete molecular remission (no signs of BCR-ABL gene) after 60 days (or more) of treatment, then the treating physician may take the participant off the study for allogenic stem cell transplantation surgery.&#xD;
If the participant does not undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation after achieving complete molecular remission, they will complete 3 additional courses of maintenance treatment.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Treatment Arm - Interim/Maintenance Phase - Participants Not in CMR</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This study arm is for participants whose cancer responded to induction/consolidation treatment, but still shows detectable signs of BCR-ABL1 (a cancer-causing gene), so they are not in complete molecular remission. Participants in this arm will receive 3 courses of treatment using ponatinib combined with other anti-cancer drugs. Inotuzumab ozogamicin will be added during the 4th treatment course. These treatments will be given in 28-day and 84-day cycles.&#xD;
If the participant achieves complete molecular remission (no signs of BCR-ABL gene) after 60 days (or more) of treatment, the treating physician may take the participant off the study for allogenic stem cell transplantation surgery.&#xD;
If the participant does not undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation after achieving complete molecular remission (CMR), they will complete 3 additional courses of maintenance treatment.&#xD;
If the participant doesn't achieve CMR after 4th treatment course, they will be removed from the study.</description>

    <description>A procedure in which a patient receives healthy blood-forming cells (stem cells) from a donor to replace their own stem cells that have been destroyed by treatment with radiation or high doses of chemotherapy. In an allogeneic stem cell transplant, the healthy stem cells may come from the blood or bone marrow of a related donor who is not an identical twin of the patient or from an unrelated donor who is genetically similar to the patient. An allogeneic stem cell transplant is most often used to treat blood cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, and certain types of blood or immune system disorders.</description>
