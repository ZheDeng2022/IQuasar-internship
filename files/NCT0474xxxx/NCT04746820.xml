  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a single-center prospective pilot study. Hypothesis: Results of cerebral&#xD;
      fNIRS examination in unconscious patients with severe hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke in the&#xD;
      NICU are congruent with the results of SSEP and AEP. Hence, making it a potential prognostic&#xD;
      tool for unconscious NICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fNIRS will be compared to evoked potentials in an experimental group consisting of&#xD;
      unconscious neuro-intensive care patients and in a control group consisting of healthy,&#xD;
      conscious subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare fNIRS with evoked potentials there are two test phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The cerebral response to a somatosensory stimulus (peripheral nerve stimulation) is&#xD;
           measured by fNIRS and SSEP&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The cerebral response to an auditory stimulus is measured by fNIRS and AEP&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid biases the following has to be considered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The timing of the measurements plays an important role. A time difference between&#xD;
           compared measurements can influence the outcome significantly due to deterioration or&#xD;
           recovery of the neuronal network during the time gap. Therefore, fNIRS and evoked&#xD;
           potentials will be measured simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the compared measurement methods are conducted by the same researcher the possibility&#xD;
           of bias is high. Hence, two different researcher will conduct each one measurement&#xD;
           without knowing the results of each other during the measurement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke are great causes of morbidity and mortality in Europe&#xD;
      and worldwide. Although prevention and therapy strategies, have been successfully improved&#xD;
      during the past decades, the global stroke burden - measured in disability adjusted life&#xD;
      years (DALY) - is still great.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the improvements of intensive care treatments and neurosurgical procedures have&#xD;
      lowered mortality rates, but simultaneously have increased survivors with severe disorder of&#xD;
      consciousness (DoC) or persistent disabilities. As a result, an early prognosis in&#xD;
      unconscious patients suffering from severe stroke in the neuro-intensive care unit (NICU)&#xD;
      becomes more important for the clinician. An early reliable prognosis enables the clinician&#xD;
      to empower the surrogates of an unconscious patient to make choices consistent with his&#xD;
      preferences. It improves also overall patient management in the NICU and helps to identify an&#xD;
      appropriate rehabilitation care. Since clinical assessment of comatose Patients is limited,&#xD;
      other examinations are needed to enhance the reliability of a prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evoked potentials, especially somatosensory and auditory evoked potentials (SSEP and AEP) are&#xD;
      well established prognostic tools in unconscious NICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantage of evoked potentials over clinical assessments such as the Glasgow coma score&#xD;
      (GCS) or laboratory values are that they are not influenced by intensive care interventions,&#xD;
      and have a higher interrater reliability. They are also resistant to metabolic changes or&#xD;
      sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography (EEG) is another established prognostic tool in comatose patients.&#xD;
      However, both, evoked potential and EEG are highly vulnerable to artefacts and expensive due&#xD;
      to high workforce requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising strictly non-invasive, bedside&#xD;
      examination. It is based on the finding that infrared light is absorbed by oxygenated and&#xD;
      deoxygenated haemoglobin. Brain activation can be measured with fNIRS due to an increase of&#xD;
      oxygenated haemoglobin and decrease of deoxygenated haemoglobin. Different studies show that&#xD;
      brain activation as a response to peripheral somatosensory and auditory stimulation as it is&#xD;
      conducted in SSEP and AEP can be detected by fNIRS. Recent studies investigated also the use&#xD;
      of fNIRS in unconscious patients. However, it is unknown whether and how the brain activation&#xD;
      measured by fNIRS due to sensory stimulation correlates to the measurements of evoked&#xD;
      potentials in unconscious patients and if it has any prognostic value in unconscious&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigator aims to compare fNIRS with SSEP and AEP in unconscious&#xD;
      neuro-intensive care patients suffering from severe hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke and in a&#xD;
      control group with healthy conscious subjects. Hence, making it a potential prognostic tool&#xD;
      for unconscious NICU patients.&#xD;
