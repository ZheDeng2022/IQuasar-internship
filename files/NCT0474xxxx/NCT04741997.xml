        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of melanoma. Any primary or unknown origin is&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Melanoma must have a BRAFV600 mutation (using a CLIA-validated assay), either stage&#xD;
             III (B/C/D) or Stage IV (AJCC 8th edition).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate laboratory parameters as well:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a. Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  b. Platelets ≥ 75 × 109/L;&#xD;

          -  c. AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 × ULN; in participants with liver metastases ≤ 5 × ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  d. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN and &lt; 2 mg/dL; OR total bilirubin &gt;1.5 × ULN with&#xD;
             indirect bilirubin &lt; 1.5 × ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  e. Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 × ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants of childbearing potential as described in protocol, must have a&#xD;
             negative serum or urine β-HCG test result. Female participants of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must agree to use methods of contraception that are highly effective or&#xD;
             acceptable, as described in Section 4.3.1. Participants must agree to not use hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives, as encorafenib can result in decreased concentration and loss of&#xD;
             efficacy. Male participants must agree to use methods of contraception that are highly&#xD;
             effective or acceptable per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may have received prior therapy with BRAF and/or a MEK inhibitor if it&#xD;
             was completed at least 6 months prior to study enrollment. Patients who had prior&#xD;
             disease progression while on BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy are not eligible. (Progression&#xD;
             after stopping treatment is permitted.) Participants may have received prior therapy&#xD;
             an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have had adverse events related to encorafenib and/or&#xD;
             binimetinib specifically, that required discontinuation of one or both drugs due to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had major surgery or radiotherapy ≤ 14 days prior to start of&#xD;
             study treatment or who have not recovered from side effects of such procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing to avoid consuming grapefruit, pomegranates, star fruits,&#xD;
             Seville oranges or products containing the juice during the study while they are&#xD;
             taking encorafenib/binimetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled or symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis that are&#xD;
             not stable, require steroids, are potentially life-threatening or have required&#xD;
             radiation within 28 days prior to starting study drug. Patients with previously&#xD;
             treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (e.g.,without&#xD;
             evidence of progression by radiographic imaging for at least 28 days before the first&#xD;
             dose of study treatment and neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired cardiovascular function as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a. Congestive heart failure requiring treatment (New York Heart Association Grade ≥&#xD;

             supraventricular tachycardia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  c. Baseline QTcF interval ≥ 500 ms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of retinal vein occlusion (RVO)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of a prohibited medication (including herbal medications, supplements, or&#xD;
             foods), as described in protocol, or use of a prohibited medication ≤ 1 week prior to&#xD;
             the start of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment&#xD;
             (in the opinion of the treating physician) does not have the potential to interfere&#xD;
             with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for&#xD;
             this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection are eligible&#xD;
             providing they are on effective anti-retroviral therapy and have undetectable viral&#xD;
             load at their most recent viral load test and within 90 days prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a known history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been&#xD;
             treated and cured. Participants with HCV infection who are currently on treatment must&#xD;
