      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the use of large screen during colonoscopy&#xD;
      will increase adenoma detection rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common cancer in the world. Recently in Hong Kong it has&#xD;
      surpassed lung cancer to be the most common cancer. Hence it is essential not only to have&#xD;
      up-to-date surgical and oncological treatment but also a need an effective preventative&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past few decades, removal of pre-malignant colonic lesions such as adenomas have been&#xD;
      shown to prevent development of colorectal cancers. Colonoscopy is currently the only&#xD;
      technique which can perform both detection and treatment during the same procedure. However,&#xD;
      concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of colonoscopy in the prevention of CRC&#xD;
      after several studies reported unexpected high incidence rates of interval carcinomas (IC),&#xD;
      especially in the proximal colon. Most ICs are suspected to arise from missed colon lesions&#xD;
      during colonoscopy. Factors concerning missed colonic lesions are multifactorial such as&#xD;
      adequate bowel preparation, skill level of endoscopists, the number of endoscopy staff in the&#xD;
      room as &quot;eyes&quot; to help with polyp detection and withdrawal time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a pilot study in our endoscopy unit, we believe the size of the screen projecting&#xD;
      the endoscopic image may have a positive influence on adenoma detection. Therefore, we feel&#xD;
      that a well-designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trial may help to confirm&#xD;
      this.&#xD;
