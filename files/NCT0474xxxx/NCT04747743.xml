      Pharmacists may also logistically serve as ideal health-care destinations to implement and&#xD;
      deliver prevention, early intervention, and referral of oral health services to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of potentially preventable oral conditions including tooth decay, gum disease, and&#xD;
      oral cancer. Interprofessional teamwork between pharmacist and dentistry may help to&#xD;
      encourage pharmacists to take a more active role in promoting oral health. By providing&#xD;
      information and assistance for self-care and the use of over the counter (OTC) products for&#xD;
      minor problems on oral health, it can provide better patient care in the Malaysian&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle relaxants (SMR) are a diverse group of medications that are not chemically&#xD;
      related like other drug classes and work through a variety of mechanisms. The term &quot;muscle&#xD;
      relaxant&quot; is used to refer to two major therapeutic groups: neuromuscular blockers and&#xD;
      spasmolytic. Some of them are working mainly through the central nervous system; they have&#xD;
      many adverse effects such as sedation and dizziness that may limit their use.&#xD;
