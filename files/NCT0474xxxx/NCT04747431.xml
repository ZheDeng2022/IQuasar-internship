  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PBFT02 is a gene therapy for frontotemporal dementia intended to deliver a functional copy of&#xD;
      the GRN gene to the brain. This study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      this treatment in patients with frontotemporal dementia and mutations in the progranulin gene&#xD;
      (FTD-GRN).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PBFT02 is an adeno-associated viral vector serotype 1 carrying GRN, the gene encoding for&#xD;
      human progranulin, formulated as a solution for injection into the cisterna magna. This is a&#xD;
      global interventional, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study of PBFT02&#xD;
      delivered as a one-time dose administered into the cisterna magna to patients with FTD-GRN.&#xD;
      Subjects aged ≥ 35 and ≤ 75 years with early stage symptomatic FTD-GRN may be enrolled into&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two dose levels of PBFT02 will be studied in patients with FTD-GRN. The study will&#xD;
      sequentially enroll 2 cohorts. An optional third dose level cohort may be enrolled based on&#xD;
      the results of the first two cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a 2-year study with a 3-year safety extension.&#xD;
