  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how the use of antidepressant, physical therapy, and combination of&#xD;
      both affects pain, function, and depression outcomes in chronic low back pain patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20 million Americans are affected by chronic low back pain and negative&#xD;
      affective states such as depression and anxiety. These negative states have all been&#xD;
      associated with higher pain intensity, lower pain tolerance, greater use of pain medication,&#xD;
      poor pain treatment responses, and higher levels of psychiatric comorbidity among low back&#xD;
      pain patients. To improve these outcomes for those who suffer from low back pain, it is&#xD;
      important to implement multiple methods with a focus in treating negative affect for pain&#xD;
      management rather than using opioids alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antidepressant (AD) and fear avoidance-based physical therapy (EFAR) have individually shown&#xD;
      to be promising methods for pain management. In this study, AD, EFAR, and the combination&#xD;
      therapy of the two treatments will be explored and implemented to investigate their&#xD;
      effectiveness in improving pain, function, depression, and anxiety. The key innovation is&#xD;
      testing a new and effective multimodal treatment that can help manage pain, as well as&#xD;
      address negative affect.&#xD;

    <description>The antidepressant treatment utilizes antidepressant medication to improve pain, function, and depression outcomes.&#xD;
The Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF) will be used to assess adequacy of any prior antidepressant medication treatment and to assist the decision regarding which antidepressant to start.

&#xD;
          -  Non-ambulatory status&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or the intent to become pregnant during the study. Women of childbearing&#xD;
