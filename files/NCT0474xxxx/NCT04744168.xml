      Brief Summary Short description of the protocol intended for the lay public. Include a brief&#xD;
      statement of the study hypothesis. (Limit: 5000 characters)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Example: The purpose of this study is to determine whether prednisone, methotrexate, and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide are effective in the treatment of rapidly progressive hearing loss in both&#xD;
      ears due to autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED). The first purpose of this randomized study&#xD;
      is to determine if five points of acupuncture : 4GI, 6RP, 34VB, 36E, 3F could improve the&#xD;
      bishop score for prolonged pregnancies and decrease the rate of maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol of our study consists of proposing to the pregnant women one or two acupuncture&#xD;
      sessions the term's day and three days later. Once the consent is signed, women are randomly&#xD;
      included in the experimental or placebo arm. In the experimental arm, midwives puncture five&#xD;
      points : 4GI, 6 RP, 34VB, 36E, 3F on each side while in the placebo arm, they puncture just&#xD;
      one point : 16 HM on each side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maturation's rate between the two groups will be compared by a Fisher's exact test and&#xD;
      analyzed in function parity (nulliparous or multiparous) and number of sessions (one or two)&#xD;
      with a model of univariate and multivariate logistic regression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In maternity hospital center Corbeil-Essonnes, pregnant women have two monitoring&#xD;
      consultations at term and three days later if they don't deliver between the two. At 41 weeks&#xD;
      of amenorrhea and five days, women are convened in maternity for induction labour. Midwife&#xD;
      determined Bishop's score with a vaginal exam to choose between a cervix's maturation (if&#xD;
      bishop's score &lt;5) or an induction of labour by oxytocin (if bishop's score&gt;5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol of study consists of proposing to the pregnant women one or two acupuncture&#xD;
      sessions the term's day and three days later. Once the consent is signed, women are randomly&#xD;
      included in the experimental or placebo arm. In the experimental arm, midwives puncture five&#xD;
      points : 4GI, 6 RP, 34VB, 36E, 3F on each side while in the placebo arm, they puncture just&#xD;
      one point : 16 HM on each side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each consultation, the midwife collects the bishop's score to compare the average of it&#xD;
      between the two arms and evaluate the rate of maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maturation's rate between the two groups will be compared by a Fisher's exact test and&#xD;
      analyzed in function parity (nulliparous or multiparous) and number of sessions (one or two)&#xD;
      with a model of univariate and multivariate logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the average duration of induction labour will analyze, duration of labour and&#xD;
      delivery route between the two arms.&#xD;
