      STUDY DESIGN This prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II maintenance study&#xD;
      is evaluating the efficacy of UV1-olaparib-durvalumab combination as maintenance therapy&#xD;
      after platinum combination therapy for BRCAwt patients with relapsed ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of total subjects to be included in the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      160 patients will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized into one of the three treatment arms, (A:B:C), in a 1:1:2&#xD;
      randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A (olaparib): 46 subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B (olaparib plus durvalumab): 46 subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm C (olaparib plus durvalumab plus UV1): 92 subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are stratified according to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HRD status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous use of PARP inhibitor (yes/no)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To compare the preliminary efficacy of maintenance treatment with olaparib (arm A) to that&#xD;
      of olaparib plus durvalumab and UV1 (arm C)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the preliminary efficacy of maintenance treatment with olaparib plus&#xD;
           durvalumab (arm B) to that of olaparib plus durvalumab and UV1 (arm C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the preliminary efficacy of maintenance treatment with olaparib plus&#xD;
           durvalumab to that of olaparib plus durvalumab and UV1 according to stratification&#xD;
           factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) in treatment arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate safety in treatment arms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe genetic, molecular, and immunological mechanisms in blood and tumor of&#xD;
           maintenance treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the efficacy of maintenance treatment in the molecular subgroups based on&#xD;
           homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status.&#xD;

&#xD;
         24. Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including&#xD;

             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase&#xD;
