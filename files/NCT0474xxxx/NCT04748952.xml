    <textblock>
      A prospective observational clinical study guided by the guidelines of Strengthening the&#xD;
      Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STORBE) in 2014, that conducted to assess&#xD;
      amount of ridge expansion obtained by using Dansah burs with simultaneous implant placement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 30 implants will be installed in osteotomy sites prepared by Densah burs&#xD;
      (osseodensification preparation technique) for patients with horizontal bone deficiency based&#xD;
      on radiographic findings (CBCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alveolar ridge width will be measured intraoperatively before and after osteotomy site&#xD;
      preparation to assess the amount of ridge expansion. Implant stability will be measured&#xD;
      immediately after implant installation and 16 weeks later.&#xD;

    <description>Osseodensification is a non-excavating implant site preparation technique. It creates a densified layer of surrounding bone through compaction autografting while simultaneously plastically expanding the bony ridge at the same time facilitating for placement of large diameter implants and also avoiding fenestration and dehiscence defects. The autografting occurs along the entire length of the osteotomy through a hydrodynamic process with the use of irrigation. The result is a consistently cylindrical and densified osteotomy.</description>

&#xD;
          1. Healthy adult patients (≥ 18 years) with American Society of Anesthesiologist physical&#xD;
             status classification level I (ASA I), of either gender, having single or multiple&#xD;
             missing teeth in the maxilla and/or mandible with alveolar ridge width of 3-6 mm&#xD;

          2. Patients should have ≥ 2 mm of trabecular bone core and ≥ 1/1 trabecular to cortical&#xD;
             bone ratio to achieve a predictable expansion according to manufacture instruction in&#xD;
             ridge expansion protocol provided by Versah©.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Adequate vertical bone height of the alveolar ridge for placement of a minimum length&#xD;
             of 8 mm dental implant length based on preoperative OPG or CBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who were willing to comply with the study and were available for follow-up&#xD;
             visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - 1. Patients with high bone density (more than 850 HU which corresponds to D1 and D2&#xD;
        according to Misch classification(16)) are not suitable for osseodensification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient with severe buccal plate undercut or concavity. 3. Active infection or&#xD;
