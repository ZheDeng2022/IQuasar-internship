    <description>In the first 3-patient cohort, the dose of BS HH 002.SA will be 0.2 mg/m2/day. Enrollment to the next higher dose cohort will be initiated only if none of the 3 patients exhibits a DLT in the first 28-day cycle. Dose escalation will proceed according to a modified Fibonacci scheme, eg, increments of 100%, 100%, 66%, and 33% and the dose of BS-HH-002.SA will be 0.4, 0.8, 1.3, 1.7 mg/m2/day.&#xD;
The dose will be administered subcutaneously once daily on Days 1 through 6 and on Days 10 through 15 of a 28 day cycle.</description>

    <description>The Dose Escalation Part is a 3+3 design dose escalation study to determine the MTD of BS HH 002.SA in up to approximately 30 patients with the protocol AML indication or high risk MDS. Cohorts of 3 patients will be sequentially assigned to receive BS HH 002.SA at escalating DLs following the standard 3+3 dose escalation design, with 3 to 6 patients at each DL.&#xD;
Cohort Expansion Part: Following determination of the MTD, the study will continue at the MTD and/or a lower DL</description>

                  candidate for current therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. High risk or very high risk MDS, as evaluated according to the IPSS R, who are&#xD;
                  resistant or intolerant to standard treatment and not candidates for&#xD;
                  transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must be willing to participate in the study and have the ability to&#xD;
             understand and adhere to study visit schedule and other protocol procedures. They&#xD;
             should be able to comprehend and willing to sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women of childbearing potential must have two negative pregnancy tests during&#xD;
             Screening, the second within 24 hours prior to the first administration of study drug,&#xD;
             and must agree to use highly effective physician-approved contraception from Screening&#xD;
             to 90 days following the last study drug administration. For the purposes of this&#xD;
             study, women with tubal ligations are considered to be of childbearing potential but&#xD;
             women who are surgically sterile (hysterectomy) or post menopausal ≥2 years are not&#xD;
             considered to be of childbearing potential Note: Post-menopausal is defined as aged&#xD;
             more than 50 years and amenorrhea for at least 12 months following cessation of all&#xD;
             exogenous hormonal treatment. Women with irreversible surgical sterilization by&#xD;
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy, but not tubal&#xD;
             ligation, are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Male subjects must be surgically sterile. If male subjects are able to father&#xD;
             children, they must use a highly effective physician-approved birth control method&#xD;
             from Screening, during the study, and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
             The study physician will inform the subject which birth control methods are&#xD;
             acceptable. Vasectomy and sexual abstinence are the recommended birth control methods&#xD;
             Note: Female partners of male subjects should not become pregnant during the course of&#xD;
             the study as the effects of the study drug on an unborn child and on a breast-fed baby&#xD;
             are not known. Male participants will not be allowed to take part in this study if&#xD;
             their female partner is trying to become pregnant. If female partner does become&#xD;
             pregnant while male partner is taking part in the study, male participants should&#xD;
             immediately inform the study physician. The female partner will be asked to sign a&#xD;
             Pregnant Partner Data Release Form.&#xD;
