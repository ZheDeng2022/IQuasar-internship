  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of labor induction has been steadily increasing over the last years, both worldwide&#xD;
      and in Norway. Norwegian women are hospitalized when prostaglandins are used to induce labor.&#xD;
      In Denmark, a neighboring country to Norway, women have been offered outpatient induction of&#xD;
      labor using oral misoprostol for several years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate if outpatient induction of labor is&#xD;
      beneficial in a Norwegian setting. This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the clinical outcomes and feasibility of inducing in an outpatient&#xD;
           setting compared to an inpatient setting in Norway&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore low-risk nulliparous women's experiences of labor induction in inpatient and&#xD;
           outpatient settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized prospective pilot- and feasibility study, collecting data from&#xD;
      electronical records. In addition, the study participants are invited to write a diary during&#xD;
      the labor induction process and a questionnaire six weeks postpartum. Eligible patients&#xD;
      include low-risk nulliparous women induced with low-dose oral misoprostol.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The labor induction rate in Norway has increased from 10,5 % in 2000 to 26,1 % in 2019. This&#xD;
      represents an important shift in the obstetric care, making labor induction one of the most&#xD;
      common obstetrical interventions. The increase alters the population being induced, as it now&#xD;
      includes more low-risk births compared to 20 years ago. The low risk labor inductions might&#xD;
      not require the same repeated cardiotocography and inpatient care before onset of active&#xD;
      labor as complicated pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2017, a 25 μg misoprostol tablet for oral administration was approved for labor induction&#xD;
      in the Nordic countries. Oral administration is user friendly, and low-dose orally&#xD;
      administrated misoprostol is considered to have a favorable safety profile compared to many&#xD;
      other induction methods, with low risk of hyperstimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the widespread knowledge of the importance of women´s labor experience for her future&#xD;
      health, this aspect is rarely thoroughly explored in the vast number of studies on labor&#xD;
      induction. For outpatient labor induction to work, it must be an alternative women find&#xD;
      beneficial, as well as clinicians and the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate if outpatient induction of labor is&#xD;
      beneficial in a Norwegian setting. This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A. To investigate the clinical outcomes and feasibility of inducing in an outpatient&#xD;
      setting compared to an inpatient setting in Norway Study B. To explore low-risk nulliparous&#xD;
      women's experiences of labor induction in inpatient and outpatient settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A is a prospective non-randomized multicenter pilot- and feasibility study. Data are&#xD;
      collected from the patient's electronical records. Study B is a mixed methods cross-sectional&#xD;
      diary study, collecting data from the participants diaries and questionnaire and their&#xD;
      electronical records. Both studies include the same participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both the inpatient and outpatient regime, the women are induced with 25 μg misoprostol&#xD;
      tablets administrated orally every two hours. Some of the women will be induced using a&#xD;
      balloon catheter before misoprostol. In the inpatient regime, cardiotocography (CTG) will be&#xD;
      performed according to standard protocol; every 4-6 hours or on indication. In the outpatient&#xD;
      protocol, a CTG will be carried out before and after the administration of the first&#xD;
      misoprostol. If the CTG is normal and the woman has no contractions, the woman can go home,&#xD;
      provided a normal ultrasound scan from the last three weeks. An appointment will be set up no&#xD;
      later than 24 hours later for a new CTG and assessment of the induction process and the&#xD;
      health of the woman and fetus. If the woman goes home after this consultation, she will&#xD;
      return no later than 24 hours later for inpatient labor induction if the labor does not&#xD;
      start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women choosing the outpatient protocol will receive oral and written information about what&#xD;
      they should be aware of and when to contact the maternity ward. They are welcome to contact&#xD;
      the maternity ward at any time to seek advice from a midwife with experience in labor&#xD;
      induction.&#xD;
