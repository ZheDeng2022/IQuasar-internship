    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this prospective randomized controlled trial is to compare pain and&#xD;
      functional outcomes between two surgical modalities for irreparable rotator cuff tears as&#xD;
      measured by the pain visual analog scale (VAS), simple shoulder test (SST), American Shoulder&#xD;
      and Elbow Surgery shoulder score (ASES), and Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement&#xD;
      Information System (PROMIS) 29 score at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-operatively.&#xD;
      The two surgical modalities of interest are partial rotator cuff repair alone and partial&#xD;
      rotator cuff repair with superior capsule reconstruction (SCR). The secondary objective of&#xD;
      this study is determine the failure rate of partial repair alone vs. partial repair with SCR&#xD;
      via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 12 months post-operatively. The information gained&#xD;
      from this investigation will be useful to discern if SCR provides any benefit to patients&#xD;
      with irreparable rotator cuff tears. The investigators hypothesize that there is no&#xD;
      statistically significant difference in pain and functional outcomes between partial rotator&#xD;
      cuff repair alone versus partial rotator cuff repair with SCR. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the failure rate will be significantly higher in patients undergoing partial&#xD;
      rotator cuff repair with SCR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff injury is a commonly encountered problem within the United States. In most&#xD;
      cases, surgical repair can reduce pain and restore baseline functional status. However, in&#xD;
      the case of an irreparable rotator cuff tear, management becomes more challenging as these&#xD;
      injuries tend to be larger in size, are inelastic secondary to tendon retraction, and exhibit&#xD;
      fatty infiltration and rotator cuff atrophy1. A multitude of surgical approaches for an&#xD;
      irreparable rotator cuff tear have been described in the literature, including partial repair&#xD;
      alone, partial repair with superior capsular reconstruction (SCR), arthroscopic debridement,&#xD;
      graft interposition, balloon spacer arthroplasty, tendon transfers, and reverse total&#xD;
      shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA)2. In younger patients, the traditional approach to managing&#xD;
      these injuries involved partial rotator cuff repair with subacromial decompression and&#xD;
      debridement with the hopes of providing the patient with some restoration of function and&#xD;
      pain relief3,4. Clinical studies have demonstrated that partial repair can lead to an&#xD;
      improvement in pain and function in the early post-operative period; long-term outcomes&#xD;
      following this procedure were less reliable3. In addition, a high rate of failure has been&#xD;
      associated with partial rotator cuff repair alone. Partial repair with SCR is a relatively&#xD;
      new surgical procedure that has become an increasingly popular treatment modality in recent&#xD;
      years because of early promising biomechanical and functional outcomes5,6. However, there&#xD;
      have been no prospective randomized assessments of SCR. Therefore, the long-term outcomes of&#xD;
      SCR compared to the standard of care, namely partial rotator cuff repair, are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multi-center, prospective randomized controlled trial. Prior to enrollment,&#xD;
      patients will be screened for inclusion criteria. Participants who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria and are suspected to have an irreparable rotator cuff tear will be randomized into&#xD;
      one of the two treatment arms prior to surgery. Group 1 will receive partial rotator cuff&#xD;
      repair alone while group 2 will receive partial rotator cuff repair with SCR. All patients&#xD;
      with suspected irreparable rotator cuff tears will be consented in clinic. There is the&#xD;
      potential situation where the surgeon believed that the rotator cuff tear was irreparable&#xD;
      based on clinical and radiographic evidence but was able to completely repair the tear&#xD;
      intraoperatively. Based on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) principle, these select&#xD;
      patients will be dropped from the study and will no longer be followed for research purposes.&#xD;
      Randomization will occur with a stratified randomization excel spreadsheet. Each group will&#xD;
      be followed post-operatively for 24 months. The primary objective of this study is to compare&#xD;
      pain and functional outcomes between the two treatment arms. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      assess the failure rate between the two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients with a strongly suspected irreparable rotator cuff tear will be identified&#xD;
           in the clinics of the treating physicians and be screened for inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
           criteria. The consent form will be reviewed in depth with the patients by an&#xD;
           IRB-approved member of the study team, and all questions will be answered prior to&#xD;
           enrollment in the study. Patients will be asked if they need additional time to review&#xD;
           the consent, and no coercion will occur throughout the consent process. Although&#xD;
           patients will be consented at this clinic visit, they will be informed that there is a&#xD;
           possibility that they will ultimately be excluded from the study because an irreparable&#xD;
           rotator cuff tear can only be confirmed intraoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the initial pre-operative clinic visit, patient demographics will be collected and&#xD;
           the pain and functional status of patients will be assessed using VAS, SST, ASES, and&#xD;
           PROMIS-29 scores. It should take approximately 15 minutes to complete these surveys in&#xD;
           clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients requiring medical clearance to ensure their health is optimized for surgery&#xD;
           will do so. After receiving medical clearance (if needed), the patients will undergo&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients will be randomized prior to surgery into one of two possible treatment arms as&#xD;
           described above. Stratified randomization will be performed with Microsoft Excel. If a&#xD;
           patient, who was suspected to have an irreparable rotator cuff tear based on clinical&#xD;
           and radiographic findings, is amenable to a complete rotator cuff tear, they will be&#xD;
           dropped from the study and no longer followed for research purposes. This is based on&#xD;
           the mITT principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. On the day of surgery, the patient will receive either a partial rotator cuff repair&#xD;
           alone or a partial rotator cuff repair with SCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Intraoperative data will be collected. For both groups, the investigators will assess if&#xD;
           the following were performed during the procedure: subacromial decompression, biceps&#xD;
           tenotomy vs. tenodesis, marginal convergence, single vs. double-row repair, and repair&#xD;
           of the subscapularis muscle. For the SCR group, the size (mm2) and width (mm) of the&#xD;
           acellular dermal allograft will be recorded. Finally, any complications that occur&#xD;
           intraoperatively will be recorded for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. After discharge from the surgery center, both groups of patients will be given identical&#xD;
           pain medication regimens, post-operative restrictions, and clinical follow-up schedule.&#xD;
           They will be instructed to follow-up in clinic at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months&#xD;
           post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. At each post-operative appointment, the patients will again be administered the VAS,&#xD;
           SST, ASES, and PROMIS-29 questionnaires. Complications will be assessed at each visit.&#xD;
           In addition, at the 12-month follow-up appointment, each patient in both groups will be&#xD;
           given a prescription for an MRI of the operative shoulder to assess for failure of the&#xD;
           repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Key variables for analysis will be found within the electronic medical record, and in&#xD;
           questionnaires administered at clinic appointments. They include: age at time of&#xD;
           surgery, sex, height, weight, hand dominance, laterality of surgery, mechanism of&#xD;
           injury, and surgical complications (e.g., infection, failure of repair).&#xD;
