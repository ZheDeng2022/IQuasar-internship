  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single&#xD;
      ascending intravenous doses of ASP1128 in healthy adult male and female subjects and multiple&#xD;
      ascending intravenous doses of ASP1128 in healthy adult male and female subjects and healthy&#xD;
      elderly male and female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics and the effect on the QT interval using&#xD;
      Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) in these subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After a screening period of up to 28 days prior to study drug administration, eligible&#xD;
      participants will be residential for a single period of 5 days/4 nights in Part 1: single&#xD;
      ascending dose, and 11 days/10 nights in Part 2 multiple ascending dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is composed of 6 parallel cohorts (cohorts 1.1 to 1.6) and up to 2 optional cohorts&#xD;
      (cohorts 1.7 and 1.8) of 8 healthy adult male and female subjects in each cohort. If the data&#xD;
      from cohorts 1.1 to 1.6 are not sufficient to characterize safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, up to 2 optional cohorts (cohorts 1.7 and 1.8) may be added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is composed of 4 parallel cohorts (cohorts 2.1 to 2.4) and 1 optional cohort (cohort&#xD;
      2.5) of 12 healthy adult male and female subjects in each cohort and 1 cohort (cohort 2.6) of&#xD;
      12 healthy elderly male and female subjects. Dosing of the elderly cohort (cohort 2.6) will&#xD;
      commence after having established the safety and tolerability of the corresponding dose&#xD;
      tested in cohorts 2.1 to 2.5. If the data from cohorts 2.1 to 2.4 are not sufficient to&#xD;
      characterize safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics, 1 optional cohort (cohort 2.5) may be&#xD;
      added.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to Day 16</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product.&#xD;
In order to identify any events that may be associated with study procedures and could lead to a change in the conduct of the study, AEs will be collected even if the subject has not received study drug treatment.</description>
