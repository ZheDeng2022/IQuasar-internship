    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT)90 Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SALT score is a global severity score that captures percentage of hair loss by dividing the scalp into 4 quadrants (left side, right side, top and back quadrant) with assigned percent of scalp surface area (SSA) in each quadrant. After indicating the percent of loss per quadrant the value is multiplied by the percent (%) of hair for each section (18% sides, 40% top, and 24% back) and the values are summed to generate the total percentage of scalp hair loss or SALT score. The range in score is from 0-100 reflecting the percent hair loss on the scalp (0=no hair loss and 100= total hair loss). SALT90 is defined as 90% or more regrowth compared with baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Weeks 24 and 38</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with TEAEs will be reported. An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. TEAEs are defined as AEs with onset or worsening on or after date of first dose of study treatment.</description>

A SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving SALT50 Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants achieving SALT50 response will be reported. The SALT score is a global severity score that captures percentage of hair loss by dividing the scalp into 4 quadrants (left side, right side, top and back quadrant) with assigned percent of SSA in each quadrant. After indicating the percent of loss per quadrant the value is multiplied by the percent of hair for each section (18% sides, 40% top, and 24% back) and the values are summed to generate the total percentage of scalp hair loss or SALT score. The range in score is from 0-100 reflecting the percent hair loss on the scalp (0=no hair loss and 100= total hair loss). SALT50 is defined as 50% or more regrowth from baseline.</description>

          -  Participant has a physician confirmed diagnosis of moderate to severe Alopecia Areata&#xD;
             (AA) (greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 50 percent [%] scalp involvement) as measured&#xD;
             using the severity of Alopecia tool (SALT) score; or participant has &gt;=95% loss of&#xD;
             scalp hair for enrollment as alopecia totalis (AT) or alopecia universalis (AU)&#xD;
             subtypes at the time of screening and baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current episode of hair loss is greater than (&gt;) 6 months (without evidence of&#xD;
             spontaneous terminal hair regrowth within 6 months at the time of screening and&#xD;
             baseline), but less than or equal to (&lt;=8) years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically stable on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs,&#xD;
             and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at either screening or Week 0. Any&#xD;

             gastrointestinal, endocrine (except stable thyroid diseases), neurologic, hematologic,&#xD;
             rheumatologic, psychiatric disorders, or metabolic disturbances&#xD;

          -  Currently has a malignancy or has a history of malignancy (with the exceptions of&#xD;
             participants having adequately treated and cured basal or squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
             the skin, or cervical carcinoma in situ occurring more than 5 years prior to&#xD;
             randomization)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to JNJ-64304500 or its excipients&#xD;
