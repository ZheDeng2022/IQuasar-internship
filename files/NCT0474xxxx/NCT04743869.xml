  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients at the age of 50 or older presenting with thoracolumbar fractures including segments&#xD;
      TH 6-L5 and A3/A4 fractures according to the AO Spine fracture classification after the acute&#xD;
      trauma and planned surgery within 3 weeks following trauma will be asked to participate in a&#xD;
      randomized trial in which they will receive either Calciumphosphate (CaP) or&#xD;
      Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as part of a standardized treatment approach. Regardless of the&#xD;
      group patients are randomized to, all participating patients undergo the same surgical&#xD;
      procedure except for the preparation and administration of bone cement. The study&#xD;
      participation period for each patient is 1 year from the date of the surgery and includes 4&#xD;
      defined time points that include follow-up clinical visits for imaging and progress checks at&#xD;
      6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after surgery. At each follow-up visit, a&#xD;
      combination of questionnaires and radiological imaging will be performed to assess general&#xD;
      health status, disability level and pain control, as well as objective results of the&#xD;
      surgery. The main outcome measure will be the loss of correction rate that will be measured&#xD;
      through the bi-segmental COBB angle presented in the CT-scan.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Patients and study nurse will be blinded to treatment allocation; however, surgeons cannot be blinded due to different techniques of bone cement application. A centralized and automated internet-based randomization system will ensure concealed randomization of study participants. Participants will be the unit of randomization. Randomization will be carried out with randomizer.at and will occur prior to the surgical procedure.</masking_description>

    <description>The percentage loss of the vertebral body height will be calculated by dividing the height of the fractured vertebra by the average height of the cephalad and caudad vertebrae and then subtracting this number from 100%. Measurements will be taken from CT scans.</description>

    <description>The occurence of the complication rates, in particular cement extravasation and temporary fall in blood pressure, will be compared between the two groups for each time point using the Student´s t-test for independent samples. In addition, a paired Student´s t-test will be performed within each group in order to evaluate the differences in means of the secondary endpoints measured at the defined timepoints.</description>

    <description>As a reference device KYPHON® ActivOs™10 Bone Cement with hydroxyapatite (Medtronic) for treatment of vertebral compression fractures will be used. It is a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement containing hydroxyapatite (HA) for use in the treatment of patients with vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) who are undergoing minimally invasive surgery with KYPHON® Balloon Kyphoplasty. This bone substitute has already been approved and is in use in the patients at the age of 50 or older.</description>
