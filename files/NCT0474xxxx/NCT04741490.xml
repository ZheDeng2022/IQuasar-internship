    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated, single-arm, single-center, exploratory clinical study.The&#xD;
      study population consisted of patients with R0 resection of esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma who had not received radiation therapy.The purpose of this study was to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of carrelizumab combined with radiotherapy in the adjuvant treatment&#xD;
      of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after surgery.About 20 subjects are planned to be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study.Drug regimen: Patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      received radiotherapy combined with carrilizumab adjuvant therapy for 6 cycles 1-3 months&#xD;
      after R0 resection.&#xD;
