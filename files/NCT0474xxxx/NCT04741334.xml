    <textblock>
      Approximately 20% of MHI patients presenting in PS take antiplatelet agents and 10% take oral&#xD;
      anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aim is to evaluate the prevalence of cerebral hemorrhage in patients arriving in ED&#xD;
      with an MHI. Furthermore, we aim to establish whether the intake of antiplatelet and&#xD;
      anticoagulants may represent a risk factor for the onset of cerebral hemorrhage and&#xD;
      mortality. A prospective observational study that will include all patients who will refer to&#xD;
      the Emergency Department of the Gemelli Polyclinic for an MHI for 2 years. Patients will be&#xD;
      divided into four groups based on the use or less of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents.&#xD;
      We will compare the groups to assess the possible increased risk of complications in patients&#xD;
      under treatment and between the various drugs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Mild head injury (MHI) is one of the leading causes of access to the emergency room.&#xD;
      Approximately 20% of MHI patients presenting in PS with mild brain injury take antiplatelet&#xD;
      agents and 10% take oral anticoagulant therapy. The data available to characterize the risk&#xD;
      of adverse events in patients with MHI using DOAC are few and of poor quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aim is to evaluate the prevalence of cerebral hemorrhage in patients arriving in ED&#xD;
      with an MHI. Furthermore, we aim to establish whether the intake of antiplatelet and&#xD;
      anticoagulants may represent a risk factor for the onset of cerebral hemorrhage and&#xD;
      mortality. A prospective observational study that will include all patients who will refer to&#xD;
      the Emergency Department of the Gemelli Polyclinic for an MHI for 2 years. Patients will be&#xD;
      divided into four groups based on recruitment or less of anticoagulants and antiplatelet&#xD;
      agents. We will then determine for each group the prevalence of cerebral hemorrhage,&#xD;
      hospitalization, neurosurgical intervention, and mortality at different follow-up times. We&#xD;
      will compare the groups to assess the possible increased risk in patients under treatment and&#xD;
      between the various drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that in head trauma the use of dicumarol anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents is&#xD;
      associated with a greater risk of cerebral bleeding compared to DOACs. We also expect that&#xD;
      patients taking DOAC have a greater risk of bleeding than patients not undergoing any type of&#xD;
      antiplatelet/anticoagulant treatment.&#xD;

        We enrolled all patients over 18 years of age presenting at the ED of the Fondazione&#xD;
        Policlinico Gemelli of Rome, who will refer to minor head trauma (GCS&gt; 13) and who will&#xD;
        give consent to participate in the study For all enrolled patients, we will collect blood&#xD;
        chemistry tests, with particular reference to coagulation parameters, history of known risk&#xD;
        factors present at the time of trauma, data on risk factors present at the physical&#xD;
        examination, data relating to head CT scans performed during ED stay, data relating to drug&#xD;
        therapy taken and finally data relating to hospitalization and surgery. Finally, the data&#xD;
        of a possible one-month check-up visit will be collected. The follow-up visit will be&#xD;
        recommended according to guidelines to a subgroup of these patients. The telephone number&#xD;
        for an interview one month after the visit to the PS will be collected to evaluate the&#xD;
        clinical outcome ar 30 days.&#xD;
