    <measure>No major adverse events within 30 days after surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after operation</time_frame>
    <description>Major adverse events within 30 days after operation refer to all-cause death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, respiratory failure, liver failure, renal failure, intestinal necrosis, paraplegia, and amputation within 30 days after operation. Among them, renal failure refers to long-lasting dialysis, kidney transplantation, or other fatal results. Intestinal necrosis is intestinal ischemia that requires bowel resection or other fatal consequences. Severe lower limb ischemia refers to new severe limp or resting pain after surgery.</description>

             informed consent form signed by the patient him/herself or his or her legal&#xD;
             representative, and willing to complete follow-up visits as required under the&#xD;
             protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosed as chronic Stanford type B aortic dissection;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Maximum diameter of the rupture is between 2mm and 20mm;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Important branch vessels will not be covered after rupture closure;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Aortic endovascular treatment can be performed with appropriate arterial access.&#xD;
