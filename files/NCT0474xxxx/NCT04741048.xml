    <textblock>
      The purpose of the feasibility study is to investigate hearing performance (audiometry and&#xD;
      speech perception) using the CI624 in a group of adults (n=15) with low-frequency residual&#xD;
      hearing who meet inclusion criteria.&#xD;

          3. Pure-tone average (PTA) (0.5k, 1k, 2k Hz) &gt; 30 dB HL in the contralateral ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. CNC word recognition scores (mean of two lists) ≤ 60% in the ear to be implanted and ≤&#xD;
             80% in the contralateral ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. English spoken as a primary language.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Individuals older than 70 years at the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Duration of severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss &gt; 20 years per self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Onset of sensorineural hearing loss, for the purpose of this study, prior to 5&#xD;
             years-of-age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ossification or any other cochlear anomaly that might prevent complete insertion of&#xD;
             the electrode array.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Conductive overlay of 15 dB or greater at two or more frequencies, in the range of 250&#xD;
             through 1000 Hz in the ear to be implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Hearing loss of neural or central origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Diagnosis of Auditory Neuropathy.&#xD;

             determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Unrealistic expectations on the part of the subject, regarding the possible benefits,&#xD;
             risks, and limitations that are inherent to the device and/or procedure, as determined&#xD;
             by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Additional handicaps that would prevent or restrict participation in the audiological&#xD;
             evaluations as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements of the clinical investigation as&#xD;
