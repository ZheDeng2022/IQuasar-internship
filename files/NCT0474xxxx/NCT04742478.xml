    <textblock>
      Rotablation with or without other calcium debulking therapies is a safe adjunctive procedure&#xD;
      for patients with severe coronary calcification requiring Percutaneous Coronary Intervention&#xD;
      (PCI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational multicenter cohort study of all patients with calcified&#xD;
      coronary lesions undergoing RA in participating centres across Asia. Patients will be&#xD;
      required to provide informed consent for data collection, including follow-up data and&#xD;
      uploading of data on a web-based data collection platform (deidentified). Operators/&#xD;
      institution coordinators will fill up hardcopy or electronic (web-based) forms including&#xD;
      patient's baseline demographics, co-morbidities, clinical data, laboratory test results,&#xD;
      echocardiography results, coronary angiography findings with subsequent interventions&#xD;
      performed as well as follow-up clinical and laboratory results. Note that while detailed data&#xD;
      for individual patients will only be collected if there is informed consent, data from each&#xD;
      institution will also be collected for aggregate data regarding procedural volume (eg. total&#xD;
      cases with debulking therapy and specifically for ROTABLATORTM). This will give a sense of&#xD;
      representativeness of data collected. This screening data will also include the following&#xD;
      fields: age, gender, ethnicity, comorbidities, target vessel, prior revascularization&#xD;
      (PCI/CABG), clinical presentation, procedural urgency, angiographic procedural details (RA&#xD;
      and PCI) and in-hospital complication and mortality. The use of this retrospective data will&#xD;
      require appropriate approval and will only utilize anonymized data. Only in-hospital data&#xD;
      will be obtained and no follow up data is required from these controls. Should these data not&#xD;
      be available in any of the participating sites, a minimum baseline demographics, procedural&#xD;
      and inpatient outcome data with reasons for non-participation in registry should be provided&#xD;
      for records purposes. This shall be accepted as a limitation of the study. Sub-site analysis&#xD;
      may be performed in centres with availability of all data in this group of patients to&#xD;
      address generalisability of the data collected.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Rotational Atherectomy</intervention_name>
    <description>Rotational atherectomy (RA) has been the most used atherectomy modality since its first inception in1988. RA uses high speed rotation (140,000 - 180,000 rpm) to ablate inelastic plaque, resulting in debris averaging 5µm in size24. The main focus of RA in the era of DES stent has been on plaque modification rather that plaque debulking with more papers showing improved PCI success rates.</description>
