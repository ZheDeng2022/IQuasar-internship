  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter non-interventional observational study conducted with a single hand arm&#xD;
      to collect real-world data. In this study, commercially available acalabrutinib will be used&#xD;
      as prescribed treatment for CLL as per the treating physician's best clinical judgement. No&#xD;
      additional procedures besides those already used in the routine clinical practice will be&#xD;
      applied to the patients. Treatment assignment will be done according to the current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi-center collaborative effort in 15 centers selected from regions within Russia will&#xD;
      help capture more patients into the database, rather than limiting the data to a single&#xD;
      institution. This will be critical for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increasing database sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reducing bias (single institution bias)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increasing result's generalizability to the whole Russian population Being an&#xD;
           observational study, only data available from routine clinical practice and standard of&#xD;
           care (SoC), in line with national and international laws and regulations, will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated according to prescribing information, with visit frequency and&#xD;
      assessments performed according to routine medical practice and SoC. Only data corresponding&#xD;
      to these visits and assessments will be collected as part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for the study will be transcribed and entered into an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF)&#xD;
      from the patient's medical records. The site investigator will be responsible for ensuring&#xD;
      that all required data is collected and entered into the eCRF with the involvement of&#xD;
      clinical research organization&#xD;
