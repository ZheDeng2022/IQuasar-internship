  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture is recognized as one of the most serious consequences of osteoporosis, less than&#xD;
      half regain pre-fracture independence. 95% of all hip fractures in older adults are due to&#xD;
      falls. Thus, reducing fall risk while restoring function post-hip fracture is critical. Many&#xD;
      with fall-related hip fractures have cognitive impairment; cognitive impairment increases the&#xD;
      risk of falls. The purpose of this 6-month proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      is to assess the efficacy of the home-based Otago Exercise Program (OEP) compared with usual&#xD;
      care in reducing fall risk among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and a&#xD;
      fall-related hip fracture.&#xD;

      Hip fracture is recognized as one of the most serious consequences of osteoporosis, less than&#xD;
      half regain pre-fracture independence. 95% of all hip fractures in older adults are due to&#xD;
      falls. Thus, reducing fall risk while restoring function post-hip fracture is critical. Many&#xD;
      with fall-related hip fractures have cognitive impairment and they are less likely to regain&#xD;
      pre-fracture level of function than those without cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment&#xD;
      also increase falls risk. It is currently unknown whether exercise is efficacious in reducing&#xD;
      fall risk and promoting function among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and&#xD;
      a fall-related hip fracture. The purpose of this 6-month proof-of-concept RCT is to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of the home-based Otago Exercise Program (OEP) compared with usual care in&#xD;
      reducing fall risk among community-dwelling older adults with MCI and a fall-related hip&#xD;
      fracture.&#xD;
