  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies in women globally, with ~1.4 million new&#xD;
      cases diagnosed annually Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality among women worldwide. While diabetes/insulin-resistance and breast&#xD;
      cancer are distinct diseases, insulin-signaling plays a central role in both illnesses.&#xD;
      Insulin activates key cancer processes including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),&#xD;
      tissue inﬂammation, motility, and angiogenesis. There are key opportunities to impact and&#xD;
      prevent hyperinsulinemia during breast cancer prevention, surgical assessment, and&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Given the high prevalence of undiagnosed pre-diabetes and diabetes in the&#xD;
      United States and worldwide, preoperative screening to identify such patients prior to&#xD;
      surgical intervention is warranted. While it is not standard of care to test for&#xD;
      insulin-resistance during the course of breast cancer screening and treatment, it is standard&#xD;
      of care to screen and test high risk women for insulin-resistance as part of whole woman&#xD;
      care. Given the important role insulin signaling plays in driving signaling pathways that&#xD;
      promote aggressive cancer biology, more attention should be paid by cancer physicians to&#xD;
      screening and treating insulin resistance. Several studies have reinforced a link between&#xD;
      breast cancer risk and diabetes. Moreover, metformin significantly reduces breast cancer&#xD;
      risk, compared to patients who are not using metformin and is independent of diabetes status.&#xD;
      As metformin has an association with decreased breast cancer recurrence, as well as&#xD;
      potentially improved survival, disparities in insulin resistance between black and white&#xD;
      women with breast cancer is important to investigate. It is hypothesized that metformin&#xD;
      decreases the development of resistance in breast cancer cells, thereby allowing current&#xD;
      chemotherapy agents to work synergistically with metformin. Our objective is to elucidate&#xD;
      whether or not metformin is efficacious in improving insulin resistance in black and white&#xD;
      women with breast cancer and if racial disparities in breast cancer prognosis can be&#xD;
      partially explained by differences in pre-diagnosis insulin resistance which are improved&#xD;
      with metformin therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Even as cancer research has led to more advanced, targeted cancer treatments than ever&#xD;
      before, not all patients are able to reap the benefits of these efforts, as demonstrated by&#xD;
      their persistently worse survival outcomes, lack of accrual onto clinical trials, and lower&#xD;
      rates of genetic testing. According to the American Cancer Society, black patients have the&#xD;
      highest death rates and shortest duration of survival of any racial or ethnic group in the&#xD;
      U.S. for most cancers. Black individuals with cancer are 25% more likely to die of their&#xD;
      disease than white patients. Although persisting across tumor types, this disparity is&#xD;
      particularly evident among black women, whose population-based breast cancer mortality rate&#xD;
      is higher than white women. Compared with white women, black women have a 42% higher breast&#xD;
      cancer mortality rate and twofold higher incidence of biologically aggressive triple-negative&#xD;
      disease. Additionally, the American Cancer Society reported that black women are&#xD;
      significantly more likely to die of breast cancer than white women, a disparity that has&#xD;
      increased over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For decades, researchers attributed higher mortality rates to socioeconomic factors such as&#xD;
      inadequate health insurance, fewer years of education and lower income. However, research now&#xD;
      supports the hypothesis that tumor biologic differences among black women could have a&#xD;
      greater impact on response to treatment and outcomes. Some disparities are a function of&#xD;
      environmental stressors influenced by race that affect biology. Body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
      obesity, and rates of diabetes are higher for African Americans. Obesity is associated with a&#xD;
      35% to 40% increased risk of breast cancer recurrence and death and therefore poorer survival&#xD;
      outcomes. This association is most clearly established for estrogen receptor-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer, with the relationship in triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor&#xD;
      2-overexpressing subtypes less well established. A range of biologic mechanisms that may&#xD;
      underlie this association has been identified. In an early meta-analysis evaluating BMI and&#xD;
      breast cancer risk, the authors found that every 5 kg/m2 increase of BMI was associated with&#xD;
      12% increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The inflammatory and endocrine&#xD;
      effects of obesity, a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), have been proposed as&#xD;
      central mechanisms explaining associations between diabetes and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately ~ 10% of all cancers in women are attributable at least in part to obesity,&#xD;
      with certain tumor types exhibiting an even stronger relationship between excess weight and&#xD;
      cancer risk. Among these are breast and colon cancer, in which obesity promotes tumor&#xD;
      appearance, progression, and metastasis in rodent models and in human patients. Obesity is&#xD;
      associated with elevated insulin levels and increased insulin resistance. Insulin, a member&#xD;
      of a family of growth factors that includes insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF-II,&#xD;
      exerts mitogenic effects on normal and malignant breast epithelial cells, acting via insulin&#xD;
      and IGF-I receptors. Insulin resistance could lead to compensatory hyperinsulinemia, which&#xD;
      enhances the cross-binding of insulin to the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptors&#xD;
      expressed on breast epithelial cells. Moreover, hyperinsulinemia may also accelerate the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of breast cancer by stimulation of hepatic IGF-1 synthesis and inhibition the&#xD;
      hepatic expression of IGF-1 receptors, leading to an increased circulating IGF-1 level.&#xD;
      Interfering with insulin signaling may slow tumor growth while activation of the insulin&#xD;
      receptor may promote tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperinsulinemia, which occurs as a consequence of lipid-induced insulin resistance and may&#xD;
      also hasten its progression, is one of many putative links that may explain the association&#xD;
      between obesity and cancer. Insulin promotes tumor cell division in vitro and plasma insulin&#xD;
      concentrations are independently correlated with an increased risk and accelerated&#xD;
      progression of both breast and colon cancer. High levels of fasting insulin identify women&#xD;
      with poor outcomes in whom more effective treatment strategies should be explored. Black&#xD;
      women are twice as likely to have prediabetes and type 2 diabetes as white women; improved&#xD;
      monitoring of blood sugar and insulin levels to identify women with prediabetes could provide&#xD;
      opportunities for reduction of the incidence of ER-negative breast cancer. A 12-week to&#xD;
      18-week course of chemotherapy appears to statistically significantly increase metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome (MetS) and related anthropometrics, biomarkers of glucose metabolism, and&#xD;
      inflammation in patients with early-stage breast cancer with no preexisting MetS. Lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions such as diet and exercise may be preventive approaches for use during&#xD;
      chemotherapy to reduce the onset of MetS in patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies occurring in females. Weight loss&#xD;
      and lifestyle interventions, as well as metformin and other obesity-targeted therapies, are&#xD;
      promising avenues that require further study in women with breast cancer. The oral&#xD;
      insulin-sensitizing drug metformin is a first line therapeutic in the management of T2DM.&#xD;
      Metformin is a biguanide agent that reduces hepatic glucose production, increases hepatic&#xD;
      fatty acid oxidation, reduces inflammation, and improves peripheral insulin sensitivity These&#xD;
      activities reduce circulating glucose and insulin levels, although the exact mechanisms by&#xD;
      which metformin achieves these effects are not well understood. In prior clinical studies&#xD;
      elevated insulin levels were associated with poorer outcomes in patients with breast cancer;&#xD;
      the use of metformin in women with early-stage breast cancer has been shown to reduce insulin&#xD;
      levels. Metformin may affect breast cancer proliferation depending on a woman's insulin&#xD;
      resistance, with decreased proliferation occurring in women with an increased homeostasis&#xD;
      model assessment index (more insulin resistant). The rate of pathologic complete response was&#xD;
      three time higher in women receiving neoadjuvant treatment for early-stage breast cancer plus&#xD;
      metformin than in those women receiving neoadjuvant therapy without metformin.. Metformin has&#xD;
      also been shown to have antiproliferative activity in vitro against multiple cancer cells&#xD;
      lines. An early meta-analysis performed on T2DM patients taking metformin with cancer&#xD;
      reported a 31% reduction in the incidence of new cancers including pancreas, colorectal,&#xD;
      breast, and lung. Recent meta-analyses confirm that individuals with T2DM who also have lung,&#xD;
      colorectal, and liver cancer derive significant survival benefits regarding clinical outcomes&#xD;
      if also on metformin. Patients with breast cancer benefited from metformin treatment in terms&#xD;
      of all cause survival (overall survival or chance of remaining alive after diagnosis). Data&#xD;
      from previously conducted studies has shown metformin decreased the incidence of cancer and&#xD;
      cancer-related deaths in patients with diabetes. Cellular glucose metabolism is linked&#xD;
      tightly with the proliferation and development of breast cancer. Several studies suggested&#xD;
      that metformin reduces the incidence of breast cancer in T2DM patients. Cancer cells show&#xD;
      enhanced glucose uptake and metabolism and prefer glycolysis over OXPHOS, which is called the&#xD;
      &quot;Warburg effect.&quot; The noted specialty of metformin is to decrease glucose levels, thereby&#xD;
      limiting the availability of energy for cancer cells. Metformin was also shown to decrease&#xD;
      FAS expression, an essential component of the fatty acid synthesis pathway, thus affecting&#xD;
      the survival of cancer cells. Metformin affects AMP-activated protein kinase, which effects&#xD;
      mitochondrial energy generation and may deprive malignant, inefficient cells of energy and&#xD;
      therefore reduce their potential growth rate. Although some of the observations [with&#xD;
      metformin] imply not just [preventing] a progression of cancer but an incidence of cancer,&#xD;
      which might suggest broader effects than merely energy deprivation. In parallel with that&#xD;
      data, there are experimental findings that support a direct effect of metformin on specific&#xD;
      pathways that mediate or promote cancer. It's been shown in both animal models and cell lines&#xD;
      that metformin can inhibit some of the key steps that are important for tumors to grow, such&#xD;
      as promotion of cell growth, motility, invasion, and migration. These findings provide us&#xD;
      with new insight in the use of metformin combined with other drugs to treat tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiologic studies suggest that metformin use may be associated with both reduced cancer&#xD;
      incidence and mortality. In a study, Tesneg and colleagues analyzed data from 493,704 men and&#xD;
      502,139 women without colon cancer covered by national health insurance from 2003 to 2005,&#xD;
      assessing whether metformin use had a protective effect. Although patients with diabetes had&#xD;
      a higher risk for developing colon cancer, patients assigned metformin had a 27% reduced&#xD;
      risk, according to researchers. Comparing patients with diabetes for less than 1 year,&#xD;
      between 1 and 2 years, and at least 3 years with patients without diabetes, adjusted RRs were&#xD;
      1.308 (95% CI, 1.02-1.679), 1.087 (95% CI, 0.9-1.313) and 1.185 (95% CI, 1.055-1.33),&#xD;
      respectively. The duration of metformin use showed an inverse trend, according to&#xD;
      researchers, with an RR of 0.643 (95% CI, 0.49-0.845) in users for at least 3 years vs.&#xD;
      nonusers. A few mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain what may be happening. The most&#xD;
      prominent theory is the idea that metformin activates a specific protein kinase, which down&#xD;
      regulates the mTOR signaling pathway, which is important for tumor cell metabolism. More&#xD;
      broadly, there is some evidence that insulin itself - and insulin-related pathways - may&#xD;
      promote cancers. There is the thought that metformin does modulate insulin and sensitizes&#xD;
      cells to insulin, and that may also have something to do with its effects. Our objective is&#xD;
      to elucidate whether or not metformin is efficacious in improving insulin resistance in black&#xD;
      and white women with breast cancer and if racial disparities in breast cancer prognosis can&#xD;
      be partially explained by differences in pre-diagnosis insulin resistance which are improved&#xD;
      with metformin therapy.&#xD;
