  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major burn injuries are serious traumas that cause physical and psychological problems. The&#xD;
      acute period that begins with admission to the hospital is followed by a rehabilitation&#xD;
      period that lasts for months or even years. The main goal in the acute care of the patient in&#xD;
      hospital is to discharge the patient from the hospital as soon as possible, with the least&#xD;
      morbidity, functional and cosmetic loss. The care of the patient in rehabilitation period&#xD;
      continues at home, and the home care is provided by informal caregivers. Due to the&#xD;
      physiological and psychological changes occurring in the patient with burns, the informal&#xD;
      caregiver has important duties such as; helping with or doing feeding, wound care, personal&#xD;
      care, organizing household chores, providing economic, medical and psychological support. So&#xD;
      that, informal caregivers may experience lack of information and anxiety. Nurses should&#xD;
      include the informal caregivers in discharge education to meet the information requirement of&#xD;
      them, to prepare them for home care and to reduce anxiety of home care. The basis of&#xD;
      discharge education is to help individual to cope with the problems related to the disease&#xD;
      and to maintain individual care. Nurses, who play a key role in discharge education, have&#xD;
      been keeping up with the change over the years and trying to maintain the effectiveness of&#xD;
      education by various methods. The educational environment enriched with different&#xD;
      technological tools and materials used in the field of education makes it easier to provide a&#xD;
      change of behavior in the desired direction in the learner. A controlled and safe simulation&#xD;
      environment ensures patient safety at all times, while ensuring that training is tailored&#xD;
      specifically to the needs of the trained. Simulation gives caregivers an opportunity to&#xD;
      manage stressful medical events in a risk-free environment, which allows healthcare providers&#xD;
      to be involved in and manage the family's traditional education when it comes to caring and&#xD;
      teaching families. When the literature on increasing the preparedness of the caregivers for&#xD;
      care, and thus reducing the burden of care, no studies evaluating the simulation-based&#xD;
      training for informal caregivers were found. This study was needed with the idea that&#xD;
      simulation-based training, which is provided with a high fidelity of moulage, will help the&#xD;
      caregiver to understand the burn care easily, to be ready for care and therefore to reduce&#xD;
      the burden of care.&#xD;

      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed as a randomised controlled study with the control group in order to&#xD;
      determine the effect of simulation-based training applied to the caregivers of burn patients&#xD;
      on their preparedness for care and caregiving burden. The research will be conducted in the&#xD;
      Burn Unit of Hacettepe University Adult Hospital and Burn Center of Gulhane Training and&#xD;
      Research Hospital. The population of the research includes caregivers of adult patients&#xD;
      admitted to Hacettepe University Adult Hospital Burn Unit and Burn Center of Gulhane Training&#xD;
      and Research Hospital after 02.02.2021 and have treatment in inpatient or outpatient clinics.&#xD;
      Since there is no similar research in the literature, sample size was not calculated. At the&#xD;
      end of the study, power analysis will be done to evaluate the adequacy of the sample size. In&#xD;
      the study, participants in the intervention group and control group will be assigned by block&#xD;
      randomization method and each block will consist of 4 caregivers and 6 blocks will be formed.&#xD;
      The data sheets of the research are Caregivers Information Form, Preparedness for Caregiving&#xD;
      Scale, Caregiving Burden Scale and Post-Discharge Assessment Form for Burn patients. In&#xD;
      addition, the Questionnaire for the Burn patients will be used to obtain information about&#xD;
      the burn patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive only the standard discharge education. Simulation based&#xD;
      education will be performed after the standard discharge training with the intervention&#xD;
      group. The preparedness of caregivers before and after both training will be assessed. The&#xD;
      burden of caregiving will be assessed during the first and third months of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test the understandability of standard discharge training, training will be&#xD;
      provided to 3 patient relatives. The presentation of the training will be organized according&#xD;
      to the feedback received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the pre-application of the simulation scenario in the laboratory environment 3 times,&#xD;
      the necessary changes will be made on the scenario and the final version will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools will be applied on the both group, unrecognized questions and&#xD;
      corrections will be made on missing items. Individuals participating in these preliminary&#xD;
      studies will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percentage, mean, standard deviation will be used in the evaluation of the data. Chi-square,&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test, independent paired T-test and Mann-Whitney U test will be used for&#xD;
      comparison between groups and within groups. p &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
