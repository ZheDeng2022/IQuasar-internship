      One-year follow-up prospective observational study involving male and female patients (over&#xD;
      18-years-old) with unilateral or bilateral knee osteoarthritis treated with intraarticular&#xD;
      injection of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) treatment. Clinical, biological and radiological&#xD;
      data before the treatment and 1-month, 6-month and a year after are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis supports that SVF treatment enhance functionality and quality of&#xD;
      live, relieves pain and improves magnetic resonance images of joint cartilage in patients&#xD;
      with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;

      The research consists on one-year follow-up prospective observational study. It involves male&#xD;
      and female patients (over 18-years-old) with unilateral or bilateral knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      treated with intraarticular injection of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) treatment developed&#xD;
      by Cellab Laboratory (Celstem®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess pain efficacy with SVF treatment for knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      patients. To assess pain, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondarily, the study aims to determine the differences pre-post treatment with SVF of the&#xD;
      secondary outcomes measures: functionality, quality of life and disability. Is is used KOOS&#xD;
      scale, Short Form-36 questionnaire (SF-36) and World Health Organization Disability&#xD;
      Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) to assess such measures, respectively. It also aims to&#xD;
      describe and evaluate the regeneration of joint cartilage of each individual by systematic&#xD;
      comparison of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and one year after SVF treatment,&#xD;
      measured by Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) scale.&#xD;
      Moreover, specific sociodemographic and clinical factors that can predict or influence the&#xD;
      therapeutic effects and its correlation to biological data (cellularity, immunophenotype,&#xD;
      colony formation potency and sterility) will be identified. Adverse events or side effects&#xD;
      related to the treatment will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both primary and secondary outcome measures are evaluated prior to treatment, at 1-month,&#xD;
      6-months and one year after treatment except for the assessment of disability and the&#xD;
      radiological features of the articular cartilage, which are performed only before and one&#xD;
      year after. The radiological assessment according to MOCART classification is performed by a&#xD;
      radiologist. This specialised physician is not aware of patients evolution in order to obtain&#xD;
      minimize subjective bias. In addition, SVF product biological data, such as the amount of&#xD;
      sample of extracted adipose tissue, effective dose, cellularity, immunophenotype, potency&#xD;
      sample colonies and sterility, are collected to better describe the product and to be able to&#xD;
      correlate the clinical effect with biological features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Nostra Senyora de&#xD;
      Meritxell Hospital on September 20th, 2018. It is expected to last 4 years, from 2018 to&#xD;
      2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is determined using the Sample Size Calculator GRANMO (Version 7.12. April&#xD;
      2012). A random sample of 77 individuals affected of knee osteoarthritis is expected to be&#xD;
      sufficient to estimate, with 95% confidence and accuracy of +/- 5 percentage units, a&#xD;
      population percentage that is expected to be around 5% in the study population (population of&#xD;
      the regions of Andorra and Catalonia). A required replacement rate of 5% is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once treatment indication is been performed and accepted by the patient, patients who meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria (see Eligible Criteria) sign the informed consent. Personal data&#xD;
      transfer consent to medical team is also signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can be withdrawn if they do not complete the questionnaires in pre-established time&#xD;
      and form or if its tracking is lost. Withdrawal of the patient does not represent any&#xD;
      prejudice to the patient in the control of his disease or in its treat by the medical team or&#xD;
      the Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For clinical data collection, patient's medical history and physical examination, are&#xD;
      collected by the principal investigator (PI) or collaborators in every follow-up medical&#xD;
      visits. For a better patient compliance with the study protocol, a web platform has been&#xD;
      developed (https://www.cellab.com/escalas-de-dolor). It has been designed by PI aided by an&#xD;
      external computer team. It allows the virtual patient performance of functional scales all&#xD;
      along the study protocol. This tool dumps all data entered by patients into an Excel&#xD;
      database, which can be exported for statistical analysis by PI. In addition, the platform&#xD;
      warns every time a patient is supposed to fill the questionnaires or even when they do not&#xD;
      comply in time and / or form established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite being an observational study, the object under study is a specific treatment of&#xD;
      regenerative medicine: SVF treatment developed by Cellab Laboratory (Celstem®). The main&#xD;
      feature of this treatment is that it raises the importance of this study is that the product&#xD;
      used is made following strict guidelines manufacturing that ensure its reproducibility,&#xD;
      quality and safety. It is approved by the Andorra Government authorities for its application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that the procedure for obtaining, preparing and applying Celstem® it is&#xD;
      always performed by the same professionals: a plastic surgeon, biotechnologist and a physical&#xD;
      medicine and rehabilitation physician (who appears to be the PI), respectively, in order to&#xD;
      avoid interpersonal biases in the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining Celstem® requires abdominal fat liposuction. It is performed by a plastic surgeon&#xD;
      underneath sedation and local anesthesia in an operating room, under the supervision of a&#xD;
      anesthetist. The amount adipose tissue extracted varies according to availability in each&#xD;
      patient, with a minimum extraction of 200ml. The extracted tissue is immediately transported&#xD;
      (within 1 hour) to Cellab Laboratory in standardized refrigeration conditions. A traceability&#xD;
      certificate is filled to ensure its conservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product's preparation is carried out exclusively in a laboratory cleanroom, following&#xD;
      American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) standards conditions of hygiene and biological&#xD;
      safety. It requires an exhaustive washing of the fat extracted with saline solution in order&#xD;
      to remove both residues of blood or lidocaine and adrenaline used in the extraction process.&#xD;
      Then the fat is concentrated and mixed with the enzymatic digestion solution (consisting of&#xD;
      collagenase at 0.75 mg / mL). It is all incubated at 37 °C and stirred for 30-40 minutes.&#xD;
      When this process is finished, collagenase is inactivated through human albumin and then&#xD;
      again thoroughly washed with saline solution to remove the remnants of undigested fat and&#xD;
      collagenase. A concentrated cell suspension in a reduced volume is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once ready, the product returns at the clinic, again under proper refrigeration conditions&#xD;
      and with the certificate of traceability correctly complimented to ensure its proper&#xD;
      conservation. The application of the treatment is carried out on the same day of the&#xD;
      extraction, in some point within 6 hours after the extraction. Under sterility measures,&#xD;
      intraarticular infiltration of SVF treatment (Celstem®) is performed at affected knee or&#xD;
      knees. Previous synovial fluid aspiration is performed, if required. Once the procedure is&#xD;
      completed, rehabilitation recommendations and clinical follow-up information is provided.&#xD;
