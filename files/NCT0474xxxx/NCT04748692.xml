  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary results of a pilot study in The Bergman Clinic Naarden (NL) show that a local&#xD;
      exercise therapy group may decrease pain by 30% on the visual analogue scale (VAS) after 6&#xD;
      weeks. A reduction of 50% on the VAS was realized in a spinal manual therapy group.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of local exercise therapy&#xD;
      versus spinal manual therapy in patients with PFPS after 6 weeks of intervention and at 6&#xD;
      weeks of follow-up. To the knowledge of the authors, the clinical effectiveness of spinal&#xD;
      manual manipulations on pain, function and strength has not been investigated in the medium&#xD;
      term.&#xD;

      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local exercise therapy group will focus on strengthening knee and hip muscles three times&#xD;
      a week for 6 weeks. Once a week, patients will train with the support of a physiotherapist.&#xD;
      The physiotherapist gradually increases the intensity of the exercises improving muscle&#xD;
      endurance. The exercises will be supplemented with mobilisations of the patellofemoral joint.&#xD;
      Twice a week, patients train at home following a prescribed exercise program writing down&#xD;
      their work-out in an exercise journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spinal manual therapy group will be treated one a week for 6 weeks. Before the first&#xD;
      intervention an experienced manual therapist performed a clinical examination of the lower&#xD;
      back, SIJ, hip and knee. Anatomical maps showing innervation areas of spinal nerve roots will&#xD;
      be used to explain the regional interdependence model in the treatment of anterior knee pain.&#xD;
      Manual therapy treatment will include manipulations of the thoracolumbar (T12-L3) region or&#xD;
      SIJ as well as hip joint. Manipulation will be conducted if a restriction of range of motion&#xD;
      will be found in any of the regions. Patients will also be asked to do home exercises&#xD;
      focusing on mobilizing the thoracolumbar region and to write down their performance in an&#xD;
      exercise journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation of the patients to their treatment group will be concealed from the researcher&#xD;
      that assesses the outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures The following baseline characteristics will be self-reported: age (in&#xD;
      years), weight (in kg), height (in cm), duration of symptoms (in months), weekly&#xD;
      participation in sport (yes/no), previously receiving exercise therapy treatment for the knee&#xD;
      (yes/no). Patellofemoral chondral lesions will be graded using the Kellgren and Lawrence&#xD;
      system for classification of osteoarthritis (grade 0 = definite absence of X-ray changes of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, grade 1 = doubtful joint space narrowing and possible osteophytic lipping,&#xD;
      grade 2 = definite osteophytes and possible joint space narrowing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee pain, functionality and force will be measured using validated measurement instruments.&#xD;
      Pain and functionality will be our primary outcomes. Maximum, minimum and current pain&#xD;
      intensity will be indicated on a 0-100 mm VAS line. Functionality will be measured using the&#xD;
      Dutch version of the anterior knee pain scale (AKPS). The AKPS questionnaire consists of 13&#xD;
      items assessing subjective symptoms and functional limitations totalling a maximum score of&#xD;
      100. Our secondary outcome, maximum voluntary peak force (MVPF) of the quadriceps, will be&#xD;
      measured using a Biodex system 3 isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Inc.,&#xD;
      Shirley, NY, USA). This system has shown sufficient reliability and validity for position,&#xD;
      torque and velocity measurements in clinical and research settings. Patients will be assessed&#xD;
      before intervention (=baseline), at 6 weeks (=immediately after the last intervention) and at&#xD;
      12 weeks (=6 weeks after the last intervention).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a randomized controlled trial with a follow-up of 6 weeks. Patients with PFPS will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups using an online computer-based pseudo-random number generator on which the numbers were generated by use of a complex algorithm (seeded by the computer's clock). The flow diagram of the progress through the phases of the parallel randomised trial of both intervention groups (that is, enrolment, allocation, follow-up, and data analysis) follows the PRISMA statement.</intervention_model_description>
