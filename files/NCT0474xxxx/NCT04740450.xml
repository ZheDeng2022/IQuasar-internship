    <textblock>
      Removal of impacted lower third molar is considered as the most common surgical procedure&#xD;
      carried out in the oral and maxillofacial Clinics. The surgical removal of the impacted&#xD;
      mandibular third molar is usually associated with pain, swelling and inability to open the&#xD;
      mouth. Those symptoms reach the maximum intensity between the third to fifth hours&#xD;
      postoperatively for the pain and 24 to 48 hours postoperatively for the swelling and then,&#xD;
      they gradually diminished until the 7th day postoperatively&#xD;

      Removal of impacted lower third molar is considered as the most common surgical procedure&#xD;
      carried out in the oral and maxillofacial Clinics. The surgical removal of the impacted&#xD;
      mandibular third molar is usually associated with pain, swelling and inability to open the&#xD;
      mouth. Those symptoms reach the maximum intensity between the third to fifth hours&#xD;

      they gradually diminished until the 7th day postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinesio taping (KT), also termed ''elastic therapeutic bandage,'' is a popular technique used&#xD;
      for the management of postoperative lymphedema after maxillofacial surgery. KT is an elastic&#xD;
      therapeutic tape invented by Dr Kase in the 1970s. KT originated from sports medicine and is&#xD;
      primarily used to support damaged soft tissues (muscles and joints), helping to reduce pain.&#xD;
      KT is considered to regulate the blood and lymph flow and also to remove the congestion of&#xD;
      lymphatic fluid or hemorrhage and, thus, has achieved popularity in the control of&#xD;
      lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies had evaluate the KT technique in reducing the morbidity after surgical removal&#xD;
      of third molar. There is a lack of adequate evidence regarding effects of KT techniques&#xD;
      versus placebo and the effectiveness of KT with that of other methods and medical agents.&#xD;

    <description>Facial swelling was assessed by a three-line measurement method using a flexible plastic tape measure. The corresponding lines were tragus-alanasi (Tr-An; from the most posterior point of the tragus to the most lateral point of the ala nasi), tragus-commissure (Tr-Co; from the most posterior point of the tragus to the most lateral point of the lip commissure), and tragus-pogonion (Tr-Po; from the most posterior point of the tragus to the pogonion) distances. These measurements were performed with the patient sitting at 90° straight position with physiologic rest position of the mandible.</description>
