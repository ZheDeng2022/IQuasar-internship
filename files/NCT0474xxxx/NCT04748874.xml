    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to investigate if immediate single&#xD;
      blastocyst transfer (in the first menstrual cycle following oocyte retrieval) is non-inferior&#xD;
      to standard postponed single blastocyst transfer (in the second or subsequent menstrual cycle&#xD;
      following oocyte retrieval) in modified natural cycle frozen-thawed embryo transfer (mNC-FET)&#xD;
      in terms of live birth rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter randomized non-blinded controlled trial with the purpose of&#xD;
      investigating if immediate mNC-FET is non-inferior to standard postponed mNC-FET in terms of&#xD;
      live birth rate and other obstetric- and neonatal outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several fertility clinics in Denmark will participate in the recruitment of patients. All&#xD;
      clinics perform standardized treatments according to the public health care system in&#xD;
      Denmark. Patient enrolment is expected to begin in February 2021 and continue until December&#xD;
      2024.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of 464 patients undergoing mNC-FET after a fresh IVF/ICSI&#xD;
      cycle that did not result in a viable pregnancy, or after a freeze-all cycle. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be recruited if they fulfil the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Patients will be randomized 1:1 by simple randomization to one of the following&#xD;
      study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Immediate mNC-FET In the Immediate arm, patients will undergo mNC-FET in the menstrual&#xD;
      cycle immediately following oocyte retrieval with failed fresh embryo transfer or freeze-all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Postponed mNC-FET In the Postponed arm, mNC-FET is performed at least one full menstrual&#xD;
      cycle after the fresh embryo transfer or freeze-all cycle, which means that the first FET&#xD;
      following the fresh cycle is not started until the second menstrual bleeding or later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who did not conceive after fresh embryo transfer, or patients undergoing a&#xD;
      freeze-all cycle, will be invited to participate in the study if they have at least one&#xD;
      vitrified blastocyst with embryo quality of minimum 3BB according to the Gardner score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient related data and blood samples will be collected at baseline, day of ovulation&#xD;
      trigger, day of blastocyst transfer and day of pregnancy testing for all participants.&#xD;
      Patients enrolled at Rigshospitalet will have additional blood samples collected in the&#xD;
      early- and mid-luteal phase. LH, FSH, progesterone and estradiol will be measured at all&#xD;
      time-points. Blood used for these consecutive analyses will be destroyed immediately as a&#xD;
      part of the daily laboratory routine. Additional blood samples will be collected and kept in&#xD;
      a biobank at Rigshospitalet if patients agree. Patients are asked to sign a separate informed&#xD;
      consent form for storage of blood samples in a biobank for future research projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life questionnaires will be collected at baseline and in the mid-luteal phase. If&#xD;
      the woman has a partner, her or she will be asked to fill out quality of life questionnaires&#xD;
      at the same time-points (requires separate informed consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transvaginal ultrasound scans (TVUS) will be performed at baseline (cycle day 2-5) and on the&#xD;
      day of ovulation trigger. Ovulation trigger by hCG (6500 IU) is administered when the&#xD;
      dominant follicle reaches 17-18 mm. Single blastocyst warming and ultrasound guided transfer&#xD;
      is performed 6 days after hCG trigger. If the patient conceives, a transvaginal scan will be&#xD;
      performed at 7-8 weeks of gestation in order to assess viability and crown-rump length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare ovarian morphology of the first cycle immediately following oocyte retrieval to&#xD;
      the standard postponed cycle, a number of parameters, including ovarian volume and size and&#xD;
      appearance of follicular structures &gt;10 mm, will be assessed with 2- and 3D TVUS at baseline&#xD;
      and the day of hCG-trigger. 2D scans will be performed for all participants. 3D scans will be&#xD;
      performed on a subgroup of participants at the same time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of pregnancy and delivery, data will be collected from the patient's medical records&#xD;
      as well as the new-born child's birth records for registration of obstetric and neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes. The custodians will be asked permission to access the upcoming child's journal for&#xD;
      the purpose of gathering information about the birth and health of the child within the first&#xD;
      year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be transferred to an online eCRF; REDCap. The REDCap database has a complete audit&#xD;
      trail and is based on anonymous subject identification numbers used in the trial. Data are&#xD;
      backed up daily and stored on a server located in a locked facility in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a non-inferiority trial. A non-inferiority margin of 10% is&#xD;
      considered clinically relevant. We expect a LBR of 25% per randomized study participant after&#xD;
      postponed single blastocyst transfer in mNC-FET, which is considered the standard treatment.&#xD;
      If there is truly no difference between the standard- and intervention treatment 464&#xD;
      participants (n=232 in each group) are required to be 80% sure that the upper limit of a&#xD;
      one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) (or equivalently a 90% two-sided CI) will exclude a&#xD;
      difference in favour of the standard group of more than 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As primary outcome, difference in LBR will be evaluated by means of risk difference with&#xD;
      one-sided 95% CI. Non-inferiority will be concluded if the CI excludes a difference of more&#xD;
      than 10% in favour of the standard treatment in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol&#xD;
      (PP) analyses. Difference in LBR per-transfer will be assessed as a secondary outcome by risk&#xD;
      difference with 95% CI. Rate of positive hCG, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage and cancelled&#xD;
      cycles will be assessed by risk differences with 95% CI in PP, ITT and per-transfer analyses&#xD;
      as outlined for LBR. Mean day of ovulation and mean levels of hormones will be compared with&#xD;
      T-test. Hormone levels known to have a skewed distribution will be log-transformed prior to&#xD;
      analysis. Number of ovarian follicular structures &gt;10 mm will be assessed with a&#xD;
      chi-squared-test in a PP analysis. Time-to-pregnancy and live-birth per delivery will be&#xD;
      compared in Kaplan-Meier plots and using log-rank test. Rates of pregnancy-related&#xD;
      complications and adverse neonatal outcomes per delivery will be assessed using Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test. Data on quality of life and psychosocial status will be obtained in a validated&#xD;
      self-reported survey expressed by Likert based 5-scale items and compared by non-parametric&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U-tests. Statistical analyses will be performed using R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numbers and reasons for drop-out and cancellation will be tabulated for the two treatment&#xD;
      groups and descriptive tables will be compiled for comparison of characteristics of&#xD;
      drop-outs, cancelled cycles and completers within and between the groups. We anticipate a&#xD;
      drop-out rate of at most 5% and a cancellation rate of at most 5%. In case of a differential&#xD;
      or larger than expected drop-out or cancellation rate, potential biases will be discussed&#xD;
      along with any discrepancies between the results of the PP, ITT and per-transfer analyses and&#xD;
      conclusions will be drawn accordingly.&#xD;
