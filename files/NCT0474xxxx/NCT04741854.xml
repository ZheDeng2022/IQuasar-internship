  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will take between 1-2 months (with first patient first visit to last patient last&#xD;
      visit). Each participant will use the supplied PAP device and mask for a period of up to 14&#xD;
      nights. Participants will complete a series of questionnaires. The study will collect data to&#xD;
      support the development of an advance leak detection technology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigation device is designed to collect leak patterns which will be analysed to&#xD;
      develop an advanced leak detection technology to help users/patients to troubleshhot therapy&#xD;
      issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multi-centre, multiphase, single arm study. The study will be conducted in the&#xD;
      home environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Recruitment will be done via phone calls/ SMS messages/ emails. Participants will&#xD;
      be explained the details of the trial and those who wish to take part will be invited to&#xD;
      ResMed for the first study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 Participants will provide written informed consent. If eligible, baseline participant&#xD;
      demographics will be collected. Participants will be shown the investigation equipment. If&#xD;
      the participant is happy to proceed, the therapy and comfort settings of the trial PAP device&#xD;
      will be set-up to match their current PAP device and a mask similar to the participant's&#xD;
      current mask will be provided to take home and be use in place of their own equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 After completing 7 days of the trial participants will return to the ResMed. The&#xD;
      researcher will review the questionnaire and data quality with the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 may not be performed or completed via digital platform. For Phase 2 of this study.&#xD;
      Visit 2 may not be completed as confidence in the system set up is achieved via Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing another 7 days of the trial, participants will return to the ResMed. The&#xD;
      participant will return all trial equipment researcher. The participants' questionnaire&#xD;
      responses and data will be reviewed. This concludes the participation in the study.&#xD;
