  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to examine the adaptive response to recreational soccer, conducted&#xD;
      as small-sided games, and the effect of supplementing with either protein or carbohydrate&#xD;
      after each training session in 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred fifty one middle-aged women and men were randomized into a group ingesting&#xD;
      protein or carbohydrate beverages immediately after recreational soccer and prior to bedtime&#xD;
      on training days or a control group maintained their normal activities. Training was&#xD;
      performed 2.1 times per week for 10 weeks.&#xD;

      We hypothesized that recreational soccer training followed by protein supplementation would&#xD;
      have superior beneficial effects on body composition and health compared to recreational&#xD;
      soccer training followed by carbohydrate supplementation. The aim of the present study was to&#xD;
      examine the effects of ingesting beverages rich in either protein or carbohydrate during a&#xD;
      10-week recreational soccer training period on the adaptive response of lean body mass&#xD;
      (primary outcome parameter), fat mass, bone mass density, fitness and health related blood&#xD;
      markers in untrained women and men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three-hundred-twenty-nine middle-aged men and women were enrolled. One-hundred-fifty-one meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria and were randomized to two soccer training groups with supplementation&#xD;
      of either protein enriched (PG) or carbohydrate enriched (CG) beverages. Prior to the&#xD;
      intervention period forty-four of these subjects (18 women and 26 men) completed testing&#xD;
      before and after a 10-week period (CON).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a double-blinded experiment. All subjects in the training groups were offered&#xD;
      three training sessions per week. Average attendance were 2.1 sessions per week in both PG&#xD;
      and CG. Each session lasted around 1 h and was initiated with low to moderate intensity&#xD;
      warming for 10 min followed by small-sided (4v4 up to 7v7) soccer matches with a duration of&#xD;
      five min separated by 1-2 min of recovery. The subjects in PG and CG ingested a drink of 250&#xD;
      ml immediately after completion of training sessions and again in the evening before bedtime.&#xD;
      Subjects in PG ingested per serving a protein enriched milk-based beverage containing in&#xD;
      total 750 KJ, 21.0 g protein (milk protein), 15.0 g carbohydrate, 4.5 g fat. Subjects in CG&#xD;
      ingested per serving an isocaloric carbohydrate-rich beverage containing in total 750 KJ, 0 g&#xD;
      protein, 0 g fat and 49.2 g carbohydrate (2:1 ratio of maltodextrin: fructose). Before the&#xD;
      intervention, the participants completed a weighed dietary record on three consecutive days,&#xD;
      including one weekend day. During week five or six in INT, a weighed dietary record was&#xD;
      performed on four consecutive days including one weekend day and at least one training day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after INT, the subjects carried out a performance test battery consisting of a&#xD;
      standing long jump, an agility t-test and the Yo-Yo intermittent endurance test level 1&#xD;
      (Yo-Yo IE1) on a grass field. Prior to testing, the subjects refrained from severe physical&#xD;
      activity for at least 48 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within five days before and after the start of INT, the subjects arrived to the laboratory&#xD;
      after an overnight fasting. Fasting blood samples were drawn from the antecubital vein and&#xD;
      analysed for marker of health such as blood glucose and cholesterol. Body composition,&#xD;
      including lean body mass (LBM), total fat mass (FM), regional fat mass, bone mineral content&#xD;
      (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD), was assessed by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)&#xD;
