      Protocol Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase 1, first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, single-dose, parallel-group, 3-arm study&#xD;
      comparing the pharmacokinetic, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity profiles of AVT04, EU&#xD;
      approved Stelara®, and US-licensed Stelara® in healthy adult subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first-in-human randomized, double-blind study to compare AVT04 with EU-approved Stelara and&#xD;
      US-licensed Stelara as a single-dose subcutaneous injection in healthy adult subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alvotech (hereafter, the Sponsor) is developing AVT04 globally as a proposed biosimilar to&#xD;
      the reference product Stelara (ustekinumab) for subcutaneous (SC) use. This is a&#xD;
      first-in-human (FIH) clinical study with AVT04. The study aims to demonstrate pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) similarity of the proposed biosimilar test product AVT04 and the reference products EU&#xD;
      approved Stelara and US-licensed Stelara, in addition to evaluating the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of AVT04, when administered as a single 45 mg/0.5 mL SC dose.&#xD;

      Overall Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a FIH, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 3-arm, parallel-group&#xD;
      study of AVT04 compared with EU-approved and US-licensed Stelara when administered as a&#xD;
      single 45 mg/0.5 mL SC injection in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undertake a Screening visit between Day -28 and Day -1 to determine their&#xD;
      eligibility in the study. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be admitted to the&#xD;
      study site on the day prior to dosing (Day -1), during which their continued eligibility will&#xD;
      be assessed up to Day 1 prior to dosing. On Day 1, eligible subjects will be randomized and&#xD;
      will receive a single dose of one of the following: AVT04, US licensed Stelara, or EU&#xD;
      approved Stelara.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A staggered sentinel dosing strategy will be implemented as a safety measure, with equal&#xD;
      numbers of subjects randomized to each treatment: Sentinel Group 1 (n = 3 subjects [1 per&#xD;
      group]), Sentinel Group 2 (n = 6 subjects [2 per group]), and Sentinel Group 3 (n = 9&#xD;
      subjects [3 per group]). Following investigational product (IP) administration, there will be&#xD;
      at least 72 hours of close observation and safety monitoring by the Principal Investigator&#xD;
      (PI) for each subject and between sentinel groups (ie, 72 hours should have elapsed following&#xD;
      IP administration for the last subject in each sentinel group). Provided there are no&#xD;
      significant safety or tolerability concerns (or events that meet the study stopping criteria)&#xD;
      in the previous sentinel group following a safety review and discussion between the PI,&#xD;
      Medical Monitor, and Sponsor, the next sentinel group of subjects will be randomized and&#xD;
      dosed. Once the IP dose is deemed to be safe and well tolerated in all 3 sentinel groups, the&#xD;
      remaining subjects (n = 276 subjects [92 subjects per group]) will be randomized and dosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel subjects will remain confined to the study site from Day -1 to Day 4 (72 hours&#xD;
      postdose); all remaining subjects will be confined to the study site from Day -1 up to Day 2&#xD;
      (24 hours postdose). Following dosing, PK, safety, tolerability, and other assessments will&#xD;
      be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments. Subjects will return to the study site&#xD;
      on an outpatient basis daily up to Day 12, then once a week from Day 15 to Day 64, followed&#xD;
      by once every 2 weeks up to Day 78, and finally on Day 92 for the End-of-Study (EOS) visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 294 healthy subjects (98 per group) are planned to be enrolled at multiple&#xD;
      study sites in New Zealand and Australia. Efforts will be made to include at least 10% of&#xD;
      subjects (30 subjects, approximately 10 per group) who are of Japanese origin or ethnicity&#xD;
      (defined as a second-generation Japanese person living abroad or born in Japan; and both&#xD;
      parents and grandparents are of Japanese origin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 45 subjects (15 per group) are planned to be included in the exploratory ex-vivo&#xD;
      biomarker sub study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Groups and Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single 45 mg/0.5 mL&#xD;
      SC dose of ustekinumab as AVT04 (test product) or US licensed Stelara or EU approved Stelara&#xD;
      (reference products) on Day 1. Randomization will be stratified by ethnicity and body weight&#xD;
      at Day -1 as follows: Japanese, non Japanese ≤80 kg, and non-Japanese &gt;80 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration per subject will be approximately 17 weeks. The study will consist of a 4&#xD;
      week Screening period, a 13-week treatment period and assessment period, and an EOS visit on&#xD;
      Day 92.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Stopping Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If either of the following scenarios occur, study enrollment and dosing will be halted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If &gt;2 subjects experience a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (defined as an&#xD;
           adverse event [AE] that is serious, unexpected, and considered related to the IP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the Sponsor or Investigator considers there to be an unfavorable benefit-risk ratio&#xD;
           based on emerging safety data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If following consultation between the PI, Medical Monitor, and Sponsor, it is considered&#xD;
      appropriate to restart study drug administration in the remaining subjects, justification&#xD;
      will be submitted to the Health and Disability Ethics Committee/Human Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee for restarting the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
                  Surgically sterile (documented hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy, as confirmed by review of the subject's medical records,&#xD;
                  medical examination, or medical history interview), or Postmenopausal (defined as&#xD;

                  to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or&#xD;
                  hormonal replacement therapy [HRT]. However, in the absence of 12 months of&#xD;
                  amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient). Female subjects on HRT and&#xD;
                  whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of the non estrogen&#xD;
                  hormonal highly effective contraception methods (Appendix 3) from Screening&#xD;
                  (signing the ICF) until at least 13 weeks after IP administration if they wish to&#xD;
                  continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to&#xD;
                  allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Is a WOCBP who agrees to use a highly effective method of contraception (Appendix&#xD;
                  3) consistently and correctly from Screening (signing the ICF) until at least 13&#xD;
                  weeks after IP administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Nonsterilized male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential are&#xD;
             eligible to participate if they agree to ONE of the following from Screening (signing&#xD;
             the ICF) until at least 13 weeks after IP administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Are abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred&#xD;
                  lifestyle (abstinent on a long-term and persistent basis) and agree to remain&#xD;
                  abstinent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Agree to use a male condom and have their partner use of a contraceptive method&#xD;
                  with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year as described in Appendix 3 when having&#xD;
                  penile-vaginal intercourse with a WOCBP who is not currently pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Male subjects with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain&#xD;
                  abstinent from penile vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each&#xD;
                  episode of penile penetration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. In addition, male subjects must refrain from donating sperm from Screening (signing&#xD;
             the ICF) until at least 13 weeks after IP administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply at any time&#xD;
        starting from Screening up to Day 1 prior to IP administration:&#xD;
