  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label study evaluating the safety, clinical pharmacology and clinical&#xD;
      activity of TNB-585, a PSMA x CD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody, in subjects with&#xD;
      metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have received 2 or more prior lines&#xD;
      of therapy. The study consists of 2 parts, a monotherapy dose escalation (Arm A) and a&#xD;
      monotherapy dose expansion (Arm B). Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended&#xD;
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) is identified in Arm A, Arm B will be initiated to further characterize&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the MTD/RP2D dose of TNB-585&#xD;
      monotherapy in subjects with mCRPC.&#xD;
