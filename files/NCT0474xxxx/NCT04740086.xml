  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Complex perianal fistulas pose a challenge to surgeons since the fistulous tract&#xD;
      must be eliminated without impairing continence. Biological sealants have emerged as an&#xD;
      effective alternative for maintaining the integrity of the anal sphincter. The investigators&#xD;
      aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of calcium alginate hydrogel injections into the&#xD;
      tract as treatment for complex cryptoglandular fistulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A prospective, single-center, case series of this novel technique was conducted in a&#xD;
      level 3 hospital, including patients diagnosed with trans-sphincteric perianal fistulas and&#xD;
      treated with a calcium alginate hydrogel sealant. A strict follow-up was performed by an&#xD;
      independent surgeon at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The main outcome measures were feasibility,&#xD;
      safety (number of adverse events) and efficacy of the treatment.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Calcium alginate hydrogel</intervention_name>
    <description>The external and internal fistulous orifice and fistulous tract were explored without applying any product, including hydrogen peroxide or povidone-iodine.&#xD;
The seton was removed and FT cannulation was performed using a needle for cleaning with a gauze impregnated with saline.&#xD;
Calcium chloride was applied through the EFO until it exits through the IFO, and then the IFO was obturated.&#xD;
Alginate was applied, and the pressure at the IFO was stopped, until the alginate solution partial exits through the IFO.&#xD;
The IFO was closed with a 3/0 braided resorbable suture.&#xD;
The EFO was removed with an electric scalpel and closed with a 3/0 braided resorbable suture.</description>
