  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonfermenting Gram-Negative Bacilli (NFGNB) are aerobic, non-motile, non-lactose fermenting,&#xD;
      oxidase-negative, catalase-positive coccobacilli that pose a serious threat to critically ill&#xD;
      patients. Primarily Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), are NFGNB&#xD;
      which are potential multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens that are related to&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). In Nonfermenting Gram-Negative Bacilli (NFGNB)&#xD;
      infections, which are potential multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens, pathogenesis is&#xD;
      determined not only by bacterial virulence factors but more importantly by the interaction&#xD;
      between bacteria and the host immune system. Thanks to their direct immunomodulatory&#xD;
      properties, lipoproteins and lipids bind and neutralise toxic bacterial substances. During&#xD;
      the acute phase response and inflammation, HDL presents significant structural and functional&#xD;
      changes. This study was planned to evaluate the relationship between the changes of the serum&#xD;
      lipid metabolism and other inflammation markers with the antimicrobial resistance status and&#xD;
      the results in NFGNB VAP patients. Also, we aimed to investigate whether there is a&#xD;
      difference in the clinical characteristics of the patients depending on the resistance&#xD;
      profile of NFGNB.&#xD;

      This prospective study was performed in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients. They were&#xD;
      intubated endotracheally and received mechanical ventilation (MV) treatment for at least 48&#xD;
      hours in Konya Numune Hospital ICU, which has 42 surgery and medicine beds. The study was&#xD;
      conducted between May 2019 and December 2020 and approved by the Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      Necmettin Erbakan University Medical School. Informed consents were obtained from the&#xD;
      patients who participated in the study or from their relatives. The characteristics of the&#xD;
      patients and the sequential changes of the inflammatory response including the lipid profile&#xD;
      were recorded.&#xD;
