      Brain stimulation is a means to potentially remediate symptoms in a range of neurological and&#xD;
      psychiatric diseases, however, precise targeting of stimulation is necessary to ensure&#xD;
      efficacy. The proposed project will use recent advances in functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging to delineate distributed brain networks within individuals, and use these network&#xD;
      maps to guide selection of intracranial electrodes for stimulation during an episodic memory&#xD;
      task. The resulting data will refine the current understanding of the neural systems involved&#xD;
      in episodic memory, and provide a proof-of-principle for the use of individual-level network&#xD;
      mapping to guide brain stimulation, which could have important implications for brain&#xD;
      stimulation therapies for a range of mental health disorders.&#xD;

      Research Statement SIGNIFICANCE Memory impairments are common to several neurological and&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and depression, and these impose a heavy&#xD;
      burden on patients, families and society (Dickerson and Eichenbaum, 2007). Novel treatment&#xD;
      and diagnostic strategies are needed, and these may arise from a deeper understanding of the&#xD;
      brain basis of episodic memory (Tulving, 1983).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group-averaged neuroimaging studies have revealed that a distributed network, known as the&#xD;
      'default network' (DN), increases activity during the recollection of past events (Buckner et&#xD;
      al. 2008). This network occupies regions including posteromedial cortex (PMC), posterior&#xD;
      parietal cortex (PPC), and the medial temporal lobe (MTL), as well as lateral temporal and&#xD;
      lateral and medial prefrontal cortices. Building on recent advances in functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI; Poldrack et al., 2015; Laumann et al., 2015), recent evidence has&#xD;
      shown that when functional anatomy is defined in individuals, the DN comprises at least two&#xD;
      juxtaposed networks, named DN-A and DN-B for convenience (Figure 1). This finding forces us&#xD;
      to reconsider the role of the DN in episodic processes (see also: Dastjerdi et al., 2011;&#xD;
      Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010). Here we propose experiments to deepen our understanding of these&#xD;
      networks using a multimodal approach that provides high spatiotemporal resolution and&#xD;
      whole-brain network definition. We will combine within-individual fMRI mapping with&#xD;
      intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) and electrical brain stimulation (EBS). We will&#xD;
      directly record local field potentials from precisely mapped network regions, and apply&#xD;
      electrical stimulation with millimeter precision. This will provide novel information&#xD;
      regarding episodic memory in two domains that cannot be gathered by fMRI alone: i)&#xD;
      characterizing fast temporal dynamics of network recruitment during episodic recollection,&#xD;
      and ii) establishing causal interactions between brain regions during recollection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INNOVATION Methodologically, this project will provide proof of principle that precision fMRI&#xD;
      mapping can be performed in a clinical population and successfully combined with invasive&#xD;
      recordings and stimulation. Theoretical innovation will be obtained through a deeper&#xD;
      understanding of the task-response dynamics, coupling, and causal relationships between&#xD;
      regions of distributed networks, including how neural engagement changes during memory&#xD;
      recollection. Finally, this proposal provides translational innovation by directly testing&#xD;
      whether precision-fMRI guided intracranial stimulation can be used modulate memory&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPROACH General methods: Participants in the proposed experiments will be neurosurgical&#xD;
      patients with presumed focal epilepsy that are to undergo implantation with intracranial&#xD;
      electrodes for localizing seizure foci. The proposal will be carried out at the Northwestern&#xD;
      University Feinberg School of Medicine. Patients scheduled for intracranial seizure&#xD;
      monitoring will be invited to enroll in the study and will undergo 1 to 4 sessions of fMRI&#xD;
      prior to surgical implantation of electrodes. After surgery, patients are typically monitored&#xD;
      for ~7 days in the Northwestern Memorial Hospital Comprehensive Epilepsy Centre (CEC), during&#xD;
      which they will be invited to participate in the proposed experiments. All subjects must&#xD;
      provide informed consent before participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: A minimum of 40-50 patients are expected to be monitored at the CEC over the next&#xD;
      3 years. Electrode locations are determined by the clinical needs of the patient. 60-70% of&#xD;
      patients are typically implanted with dense coverage of the medial temporal lobes achieved&#xD;
      through depth electrodes with trajectories that allow sampling of lateral temporal cortices.&#xD;
      A small number of electrodes are also typically implanted in posterior cingulate, lateral&#xD;
      inferior parietal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Due to the distributed nature of the&#xD;
      networks under investigation, which contain regions in multiple cortical zones, it is likely&#xD;
      that we will have coverage over relevant brain regions in many cases. Some patients are also&#xD;
      likely to be implanted with broader cortical coverage using subdural grids. Preliminary&#xD;
      results have shown that even when a patient is implanted only with depth electrodes, which&#xD;
      are not placed on the cortical surface but penetrate into the brain, coverage of different&#xD;
      candidate network regions was often achieved along the electrode trajectory. With&#xD;
      conservative estimates, 20-30 subjects will be good candidates for the project aims outlined&#xD;
      below. Given the high signal-to-noise ratio of iEEG (usually a 200-300% task-evoked increase&#xD;
      in signal from baseline; Parvizi and Kastner, 2017), reliable effects can typically be found&#xD;
      within individuals. All proposed analyses will be carried out within individuals, hence&#xD;
      multiple subjects are required to generalize the findings, not increase statistical power.&#xD;
      Therefore, a small number of subjects (as low as n = 12) would be sufficient (e.g. Braga and&#xD;
      Buckner, 2017; Foster et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroimaging acquisition: MR scans will be collected in 1-4 sessions from each patient.&#xD;
      Preliminary data has shown that in this clinical population 2-3 MRI sessions are desirable to&#xD;
      allow exclusion of non-compliant runs (e.g. those containing excess head motion). We will&#xD;
      collect 6-8 runs of fMRI data per session, resulting in between 42 - 224 mins of fMRI data&#xD;
      per patient. This will allow robust and reliable estimates of network topography. Subject&#xD;
      sleepiness will be monitored through an in-scanner eye-tracking camera. Compliance may be&#xD;
      improved by allowing patients to watch movies inside the scanner when needed, with pilot&#xD;
      analyses showing comparable maps are obtained using movie and visual fixation task data.&#xD;
      Hence both tasks will be administered to improve compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Network definition within individuals: Networks will be defined within individuals using two&#xD;
      methods to ensure robustness. MRI preprocessing will be performed using a custom pipeline&#xD;
      'iProc' that optimizes within-subject alignment and minimizes blurring. Individual seed&#xD;
      regions will be hand-selected and correlation maps will be thresholded at r &gt; 0.2 to remove&#xD;
      regions of low certainty. The networks of interest, DN-A and DN-B, will be targeted and&#xD;
      identified using the expected anatomical distribution of each network (described in detail in&#xD;
      Braga and Buckner, 2017). Once candidate seed regions are selected, definition of networks&#xD;
      will be performed again in each individual using data-driven clustering, which reduces&#xD;
      potential experimenter bias. Networks from the clustering analysis that most closely match up&#xD;
      with the networks defined by hand will be selected and labelled as DN-A and DN-B. Network&#xD;
      maps will be used to label electrode contacts (each 'electrode' can have multiple 'contacts'&#xD;
      along its shaft or grid) by their approximate location within or near each network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrode localization: Electrode locations will be determined using a computerized&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scan. Estimates of the center of each contact in CT space will be obtained&#xD;
      using BioImage Suite. The CT image will be registered to the anatomical T1 image (containing&#xD;
      brain tissue locations) using a linear transform, allowing coordinates of each contact to be&#xD;
      projected to the T1 space. Preliminary data has shown that the inter-rater error in this&#xD;
      localization process is typically ~1mm. A 2-mm radius sphere will be generated centered on&#xD;
      each contact coordinate to approximate the sampling volume of each contact, which is extended&#xD;
      due to tissue conductance. Contacts that are predominantly sampling white matter will be&#xD;
      removed by excluding contacts whose sphere does not overlap with the gray matter ribbon&#xD;
      (estimated using FreeSurfer). The overlap between spheres and gray matter will be used for&#xD;
      surface-based and volume-based functional connectivity (FC) analyses. FC maps will be created&#xD;
      for each contact, and the resulting maps will be visualized. If a contact fails to produce a&#xD;
      FC map with distant regions of high correlation (indicating that the contact is sampling a&#xD;
      distributed network), the contact will be excluded. If the contact's FC map resembles DN-A&#xD;
      and DN-B, as defined using the clustering and manually defined seed-based analyses, this&#xD;
      contact will be labelled as sampling DN-A and DN-B and included for further analysis. Two&#xD;
      nearby electrodes, one situated in DN-A and one in DN-B, will be selected a priori in two&#xD;
      different cortical zones (e.g. PMC vs. PPC, based on coverage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      iEEG processing: All contacts within the epileptic zone or corrupted by external noise will&#xD;
      be removed from further analysis. Raw signals will be notch filtered at 60, 120 and 180 Hz to&#xD;
      remove electrical noise and harmonics. Notch-filtered signals will be re-referenced by&#xD;
      subtracting the common average, after removal of pathogenic or spiky signals, as well as&#xD;
      those presenting as clear outliers in power spectra plots. Data will be bandpass filtered to&#xD;
      extract amplitude and phase information at different frequency bands. The high-frequency&#xD;
      broadband (HFB; 70-140 Hz) signal is an important surrogate for local neuronal population&#xD;
      activity and corresponds to low-frequency correlations of the blood oxygenation-level&#xD;
      dependent signal (Logothetis et al., 2001). HFB band-limited power will be calculated and&#xD;
      low-pass filtered at &lt;0.1 Hz. Pair-wise correlations in HFB power will be used to estimate&#xD;
      functional connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct cortical stimulation: Risks associated with the research stimulation protocol are&#xD;
      considered incremental and are further reduced by carrying out the stimulation under&#xD;
      supervision of a clinical researcher, when patients are on antiepileptic medication, and&#xD;
      keeping stimulation to within safety limits. Low frequency (1 Hz) single pulse stimulation&#xD;
      will be applied to regions of DN-A and DN-B to map cortico-cortical evoked potentials&#xD;
      (CCEPs). This will be used to estimate the strength, as well as provide data on the&#xD;
      directionality of connections between regions. In a departure from original plans, based on&#xD;
      recent findings (Hermiller et al. 2019), theta-burst stimulation (gamma-band stimulation&#xD;
      applied intermittently at theta frequencies) will be applied to regions of DN-A regions in&#xD;
      lateral temporal, posteromedial and prefrontal cortices during a recollection task to test if&#xD;
      stimulation of distant DN-A regions can lead to improvements in hippocampus-mediated episodic&#xD;
      memory recollection. Currents will be administered at a threshold below that which causes&#xD;
      after-discharges (usually around 6-8 mA).&#xD;

        Participants will be inpatients of the Northwestern Memorial Hospital Comprehensive&#xD;
        Epilepsy Center undergoing intracranial electroencephalography for presurgical planning as&#xD;
        part of their routine care for epilepsy. Participants will be recruited to participate in&#xD;
        the study if their epilepsy monitoring procedures will include placement of recording&#xD;
        electrodes at locations of interest to our study, which include the medial temporal lobe,&#xD;
        frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and temporal cortex. The decision regarding where to place&#xD;
        electrodes is made for purely clinical purposes and we recruit patients with locations that&#xD;
        are relevant to our research question as a convenience sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will exclude children under the age of 18 years as brain development is still occurring&#xD;
        in children under the age of 18 years relative to adults. Furthermore, children rarely&#xD;
        receive iEEG for epilepsy and therefore would not be available to recruit into the study.&#xD;
        Special populations listed below will not participate in this study. Excluded populations&#xD;
        include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adults legally unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Individuals who are not yet adults (children below the age of 18)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prisoners To help determine eligibility for the MRI portion of the study, a safety&#xD;
             questionnaire will be administered by research staff prior to receiving an MRI.&#xD;
             Answers to these questions are used to determine whether subjects meet any of the&#xD;
             exclusionary criteria listed next. Exclusions for MRI include standard MRI&#xD;
             contraindications, including claustrophobia, metal implants or fragments in the body,&#xD;
             and actual or potential pregnancy.&#xD;
