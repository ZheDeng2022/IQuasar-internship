      Background: Patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) are at risk of hemorrhagic&#xD;
      transformation (HT) after intravenous thrombolysis. Although there is a risk assessment model&#xD;
      for hemorrhagic transformation after thrombolysis, there is no evidence of clinical&#xD;
      application in the population of Guangdong Province. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To verify the clinical application effect of the existing risk assessment model for&#xD;
      hemorrhage transformation after thrombolysis in the local population; to improve the existing&#xD;
      prediction model and verify the predictive value of HT after intravenous thrombolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: (1) Continuously collect AIS patients who received intravenous thrombolysis in our&#xD;
      hospital from January 2014 to December 2020 to verify the clinical application effects of&#xD;
      three existing models (HAT, SIT-sICH, THRIVE) on bleeding transformation. Collect baseline&#xD;
      and bleeding transformation information within 7 days after thrombolysis, and use ROC curve,&#xD;
      calibration curve, sensitivity and specificity to evaluate the prediction effect. A logistic&#xD;
      regression model was used to construct an improved HT prediction model based on the AIC&#xD;
      principle; (2) Continuous collection of AIS patients who received intravenous thrombolysis in&#xD;
      two local hospitals from January 2021 to December 2022 for internal and external&#xD;
      verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: (1) Evaluate the clinical application value of the existing prediction&#xD;
      model in local AIS patients with intravenous thrombolysis; (2) Develop a modified risk&#xD;
      assessment model suitable for hemorrhage transformation after intravenous thrombolysis in AIS&#xD;
      patients in Guangdong area, and evaluate the risk early Provide guarantee for clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;

      This study has two main parts. The first part is to verify and optimize the clinical&#xD;
      application effect of the existing prediction model. The clinical data of the acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke intravenous thrombolytic population is collected retrospectively, mainly including&#xD;
      baseline indicators and 7 days after thrombolysis Internal bleeding, based on the existing&#xD;
      prediction models (HAT, SIT-sICH, THRIVE), calculate the prediction probability, and compare&#xD;
      it with the actual bleeding situation, evaluate the clinical application effect of the&#xD;
      prediction model, use ROC curve, calibration curve, sensitivity and Evaluation of indicators&#xD;
      such as specificity. Using retrospective data, using multivariate logistic regression to&#xD;
      analyze the predictive value of baseline clinical indicators, screening risk factors, and&#xD;
      optimizing the HAT, SIT-sICH, and THRIVE prediction models. The logistic regression model is&#xD;
      used to construct an improved HT prediction model based on the AIC principle; the method of&#xD;
      model comparison is used to combine the clinical significance of the indicators to complete&#xD;
      the construction of the prediction model. The second part is to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      application effect of the improved prediction model, and prospectively collect clinical data&#xD;
      of AIS patients undergoing intravenous thrombolysis in Shenzhen Second People's Hospital,&#xD;
      Shenzhen Longhua District People's Hospital, including general demographic data and&#xD;
      laboratory tests Baseline indicators such as imaging examinations, bleeding within 7 days&#xD;
      after thrombolysis, etc., were used to verify the improved HT prediction model using ROC&#xD;
      curve, calibration curve, sensitivity and specificity, and external verification was&#xD;
      performed to evaluate the prediction effect of the model.&#xD;
