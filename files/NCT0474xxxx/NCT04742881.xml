      To improve post-operative recovery, the concept of Low Impact Laparoscopy was developed in&#xD;
      colo-rectal surgery with associating low-pressure pneumoperitoneum and microlaparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery. A phase III double-blind, prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-centric trial&#xD;
      is designed in the aim to assess the impact of low-pressure pneumoperitoneum with&#xD;
      microlaparoscopic instruments on post-operative pain at 24 hours without taking opioids. It&#xD;
      is compared with low-pressure laparoscopy with classical laparoscopic instruments in patients&#xD;
      undergoing colorectal surgeries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopy is the gold standard in colorectal surgery with many benefits in term of&#xD;
      morbidity, post-operative pain and analgesic consumption. However the pneumoperitoneum&#xD;
      created for the laparoscopy has several negatives impact and limits (specific pain following&#xD;
      abdominal distension, visibility, physiological repercussion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve recovery after colorectal laparoscopic surgery it was realized a first study&#xD;
      (PAROS) which showed that low-pressure laparoscopic colectomy for benign or malign disease&#xD;
      was feasible and safe with shorter length of stay and decrease post-operative pain with&#xD;
      reduction of analgesic consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimally invasive technics like microlaparoscopic surgery, developed last years had also an&#xD;
      impact by decreasing post operative pain. The Low Impact Laparoscopy concept was developed in&#xD;
      colo-rectal surgery with the association of low-pressure pneumoperitoneum and&#xD;
      microlaparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the impact of low-pressure pneumoperitoneum with&#xD;
      microlaparoscopic instruments on post-operative pain without taking opioids, compared with&#xD;
      low-pressure laparoscopy with classical laparoscopic instruments in patients undergoing&#xD;
      colorectal surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of this study is a phase III double-blind, prospective, randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      multi-centric trial. The primary endpoint is the rate of patients with postoperative pain&#xD;
      defined 24h after the end of the intervention by visual analog scale (VAS) ≤ 3 without taking&#xD;
      opioids (analgesics level II or III). Secondary outcomes are operating time, conversion rate&#xD;
      in normal pressure laparoscopy or in laparotomy, morbidity at 3 months, quality of&#xD;
      oncological surgery, length of stay, impact of microlaparoscopic instruments of aesthetic&#xD;
      appearance at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point will be assessed at 24h after the end of the surgery by a blind nurse&#xD;
      evaluating the pain intensity. After discharge of the hospital, patients will be followed&#xD;
      with postoperative consultation at 1 month and 3 month.&#xD;

    <description>Health related quality of life will be assessed using the Short Form EQ-5D-5L Health Survey questionnaire. The EQ-5D-5L is a generic health status measurement instrument. It is made up of 5 questions and a visual scale. A question for each of the following aspects: mobility, the ability to wash and dress, daily activities, discomfort and pain, anxiety as well as a score for the patient's perception of the quality of life. The questionnaire is administered the day before the surgery and 1 month and 3 months after the surgery.</description>
