  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to determine whether a diagnostic strategy including early coronary computed&#xD;
      tomographic angiography in intermediate-risk patients presenting to the Emergency Department&#xD;
      with chest pain reduces the composite endpoint of death, readmission because of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction or unstable angina requiring revascularization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting to the ED with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of ACS, without&#xD;
      acute MI but with an intermediate risk (HEART-score &gt;3) will after written informed consent&#xD;
      be randomized to either a strategy with an initial CCTA or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to strategy including early CCTA will receive standard care according to&#xD;
      responsible physician and perform a CCTA as soon as possible (in most cases within 24 hours,&#xD;
      but at least within 7 days).The result will be presented to the responsible physician who&#xD;
      will plan further care of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to a strategy not including early CCTA will receive further care&#xD;
      (including examinations) according to responsible physician but not include early CCTA. These&#xD;
      patients will often undergo a non-invasive functional test, such as Exercise-ECG, stress&#xD;
      echocardiography or nuclear imaging according to local routines, but not always.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients should receive optimal prevention according to current guidelines. The&#xD;
      responsible physician will be encouraged to initiate secondary prevention measures if&#xD;
      examinations show signs of CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is composite of death, readmission because of MI or unstable angina&#xD;
      requiring revascularization at 3 years.&#xD;

    <description>Patients randomized to strategy including early CCTA will receive standard care according to responsible physician and referred to a CCTA as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours, but not later than within 7 days. Local scanning protocols can be used on ≥64-slice multi-detector CT scanners able to perform ECG-gated coronary angiography.&#xD;
The coronary angiography will be classified as normal (or near normal) or as having atherosclerosis (CAD). The report will also classify each vessel (left main, prox LAD, mid or distal LAD, LCX and RCA regarding degree of stenosis (no stenosis, 0-49%, ≥50%, or not possible to estimate because of calcification or technical reason).&#xD;
The result will be presented to the responsible physician as soon as possible and who will plan further care of the patients.</description>

Regardless of diagnostic strategy, the responsible physician is encouraged to initiate secondary prevention measures if the investigations indicate signs of CAD, including medication with aspirin and statins.</description>
