      The purpose of this study is to investigate how pain resilience (as a personality&#xD;
      characteristic or a strength) moderate the efficacy of treatment for patients with migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the current study is to explore the moderation effect of pain&#xD;
      resilience between initial pain and the treatment outcome of the holistic healthcare&#xD;
      programs. The investigators hypothesize that participants with higher level of pain&#xD;
      resilience will show more improvements in the quality of life, less disability (assessed with&#xD;
      the Migraine Disability Assessment Test, MIDAS), less frequency and lower severity of pain,&#xD;
      and higher heart-rate variability after training. A secondary finding that can be obtained&#xD;
      through the study is the comparison between the enhancement of heart rate variability in&#xD;
      participants receiving different kinds of non-pharmacological therapies.&#xD;

      Introduction：A multi-national research that included data from Taiwan found that chronic&#xD;
      headache is one of the top two disorders (alongside with chronic low back pain) with the most&#xD;
      patients having longest years of living with disabilities through year 1999 to 2017. It does&#xD;
      not only impact a sufferer's ability to work, but also limit one's participation in a variety&#xD;
      of daily housework, leisure activities, etc. Quality of life is also impacted. According to a&#xD;
      systematic review on behavioral interventions for migraine, cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) is one of the most common non-pharmacological practices implemented and studied. CBT&#xD;
      has been found to be effective in reducing the intensity and frequency of headache, compared&#xD;
      to waitlist controls. Another commonly discussed non-pharmacological treatment for migraine&#xD;
      is exercise therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In regard to the controversial findings from therapeutic clinical trials, the unsolved puzzle&#xD;
      is: why do some show improvements while the others remained unchanged or worse? It is found&#xD;
      that psychological resilience for pain can be a determining factor in task persistence&#xD;
      despite the interruption of pain. Pain resilience specifically refers to the cognitive and&#xD;
      behavioral aspects of an individual when one is trying to deal with pain. In a study&#xD;
      investigating negative pain beliefs (i.e. fear avoidance and pain catastrophizing) and pain&#xD;
      outcomes (functional and movement aspects), pain resilience was found to moderate the&#xD;
      relationship between pain beliefs and pain outcomes. The authors found that only in&#xD;
      individuals with low level of pain resilience was the negative pain beliefs related to&#xD;
      greater movement-relate pain. Since pain resilience is such an important capacity/ dynamic&#xD;
      process in coping with chronic pain, the current study aims at investigating how pain&#xD;
      resilience can be a moderating factor determining the outcome of pain management in patients&#xD;
      with migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives：The primary objective of the current study is to explore the moderation effect of&#xD;
      pain resilience between initial pain and the treatment outcome of the holistic healthcare&#xD;
      programs. The investigators hypothesize that participants with higher level of pain&#xD;
      resilience will show more improvements in the quality of life, less disability (assessed with&#xD;
      MIDAS), less frequency and lower severity of pain, and higher heart-rate variability after&#xD;
      training. A secondary finding that can be obtained through the study is the comparison&#xD;
      between the enhancement of heart rate variability in participants receiving different kinds&#xD;
      of non-pharmacological therapies.&#xD;
