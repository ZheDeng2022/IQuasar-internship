  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to be a prospective registry of patients undergoing any kind of stone&#xD;
      treatment that have a pre-operative CT available. This imaging will be used to measure the&#xD;
      stone burden in three different ways: in a single dimension (cumulative stone diameter), in&#xD;
      two dimensions (surface area) and in three dimensions (volume).The primary purpose is to&#xD;
      identify what way of measuring stone burden is most predictive of outcomes after stone&#xD;
      treatment such as stone free status, operative time and complications.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current EAU and AUA guidelines still base the recommendations for stone treatment on&#xD;
      cumulative stone diameter, a linear measurement of the stone burden. Multiple nomograms&#xD;
      rather use the stone burden's surface area to predict post-operative outcomes. More recently,&#xD;
      volume has been prposed as the most accurate measure of stone burden and the variable to be&#xD;
      reported in stone treatment literature. Although inuitively a three dimensional evaluation is&#xD;
      most likely the most accurate representation of the stone burden to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several reports however have compared different ways of measuring stone burden and could not&#xD;
      confidently identify volume as the most accurate predictor of surgical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study, we aim to prospectively collect data on a large group of patients that have&#xD;
      a pre-operative CT scan available. This imaging will be used to assess the stone burden in&#xD;
      different ways, linear, two dimensional and three dimensional. Both procedural and&#xD;
      post-operative data will be collected to identify which of the measurements is most accurate&#xD;
      in predicting outcomes such as stone free status, operative time and complications such as&#xD;
      bleeding. Patients can be included regardless of the procedure that is proposed to treat the&#xD;
      stone. After inclusion and after having undergone the procedure, at least one post-operative&#xD;
      assessment is necessary to be able to evaluate the pre-operative variables against&#xD;
      post-operative outcomes.&#xD;
