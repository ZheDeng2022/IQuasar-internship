  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Half of the women have a once-in-a-lifetime episode of cystitis. Recurrence occurs in about&#xD;
      20% to 30% of patients, and half of these patients will have more than 4 episodes per year,&#xD;
      defining recurrent cystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical assessment sometimes brings to light favourable factors; variables in pre- or&#xD;
      post-menopause; but in the majority of cases, no explanatory cause can solve the problem and&#xD;
      some authors refer to resignation as a classic reaction to this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      several countries have already opted for alternative treatments (Nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs, phytotherapy, diuresis treatment), especially since the pressure of&#xD;
      antibiotic selection is at the root of the dramatic spread of bacterial resistances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing interest in the potential of complementary medicine to assist in this&#xD;
      care. Products based on cranberries, for example, have been particularly studied and a 2012&#xD;
      Cochrane review concluded that there is a benefit with an estimated risk reduction of between&#xD;
      10 and 20%. Another &quot;alternative&quot; approach is the use of Chinese medicinal herbs. These herbs&#xD;
      have been used for more than 2000 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of phyto-aromatherapy treatment implies a global management of patients&#xD;
      with recurrent cystitis. Initially, it involves a curative phase as soon as the first&#xD;
      symptoms of the attack appear, thanks to a mixture of antibacterial essential oils. In a&#xD;
      second phase, it integrates a preventive phase over several months thanks to an association&#xD;
      of medicinal plants whose effects in this field have been proven in vitro and in vivo,&#xD;
      allowing to rebalance a &quot;terrain&quot; associating anxiety, hypersensitivity to pain, a terrain&#xD;
      willingly associated with the irritable bowel syndrome in these patients. While having few&#xD;
      side effects, the plants will act, in the long term, at different levels: directly on the&#xD;
      cause of the disease thanks to their antiseptic, antiadhesive and diuretic activities, but&#xD;
      also by reducing the symptoms thanks to their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antispasmodic and&#xD;
      anxiolytic activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that patients with recurrent cystitis can be improved by a&#xD;
      two-phase, multi-plant, phyto-aromatherapy treatment combining several plants: the treatment&#xD;
      of attacks, by aromatherapy, and a prophylactic treatment, by phytotherapy. In the absence of&#xD;
      any such studies published in the literature, investigators propose a non-randomised&#xD;
      prospective monocentric interventional pilot study on 15 patients with proof of concept and&#xD;
      feasibility.&#xD;

A score of 1 means not at all satisfied and 10 means very satisfied. As well as their ability to manage their symptoms. Three analogue scales will also be used to assess the impact of the protocol on patients' sexuality (including anxiety and comfort in relation to intercourse, when appropriate)</description>
