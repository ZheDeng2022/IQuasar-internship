  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate whether the approach of direct transitioning to&#xD;
      lemborexant (LEM) is supported for insomnia patients who are unsatisfied with current&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transition from Following 4 regimens of interest will be investigated; Z-Drug monotherapy,&#xD;
      suvorexant (SUV) monotherapy, SUV and benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRA) combination&#xD;
      therapy, and ramelteon (RMT) and BZRA combination therapy. Patients with insomnia who have&#xD;
      been treated with one of the regimens but do not have treatment satisfaction will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a comprehensive indicator of patient satisfaction including treatment efficacy and safety,&#xD;
      the proportion of patients with successful transitioning will be evaluated at 2 weeks after&#xD;
      transitioning; thus important initial response after transitioning will be evaluated as a&#xD;
      primary endpoint. In addition, as a secondary purpose, the treatment continuation, efficacy&#xD;
      and tolerability, and the treatment impression for insomnia (Patient Global Impression of&#xD;
      Insomnia) for 14 weeks after transitioning will be assessed.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with successful LEM treatment at the end of the first treatment phase to the patients who started the first treatment phase. Evaluation is performed for each treatment group.&#xD;
Successful LEM treatment at the end of the first treatment phase is primarily defined as follows;&#xD;
Patients who wish to continue LEM treatment at the end of the first treatment phase and actually move on to the maintenance phase&#xD;
Patients who wish to continue LEM treatment at the end of the first treatment phase but do not move to the maintenance phase with a reason not related to the efficacy or safety of LEM treatment (e.g., relocation, clinic transfer, or a burden of site visit expenses)</description>
