  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that early measurable residual disease (MRD)-guided pre-emptive&#xD;
      therapy with decitabine + cedazaridine (DEC-C) will decrease the risk of progression in&#xD;
      post-transplant myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients with persistent mutations (molecular&#xD;
      MRD). To detect molecular MRD, the investigators will perform ultra-deep, error-corrected&#xD;
      panel-based sequencing (MyeloSeq-HD) at Day 30 in post-transplant MDS patients. The&#xD;
      investigators will treat patients with detectable molecular MRD with DEC-C to determine if&#xD;
      pre-emptive, MRD-guided therapy with DEC-C decreases relapse rates and improves&#xD;
      progression-free survival.&#xD;

    <description>Bone marrow biopsy &amp; MyeloSeq-HD will be obtained on Day 30 post-transplant. MRD positivity is defined as the presence of at least one somatically acquired mutation detected prior to transplant that persists at Day 30 post-transplant with a variant allele frequency of ≥ 0.5%. MRD-positive patients will receive up to 5 cycles of DEC-C prior to the Day 180 bone marrow evaluation. If the Day 180 MyeloSeq-HD shows that MRD is still detectable in the opinion of the MGI board-certified molecular pathologist but below 0.5% and patient has tolerated initial treatment without toxicity, the patient may continue treatment. If it shows a lack of MRD, the patient will be moved to the post-treatment surveillance arm. If it shows any mutation detection prior to transplant that persists with a variant allele frequency of ≥ 0.5%VAF, the patient will receive up to an additional 6 cycles of DEC-C.&#xD;

             classification (2016 revision) who have received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell&#xD;
             transplant. Any stem cell source, conditioning regimen, and immunosuppression regimen&#xD;
             as determined by the treating physician, per institutional guidelines, is permitted.&#xD;
             Patients may have received any therapy, or no therapy, prior to transplant.&#xD;

          -  At least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have undergone gene panel testing prior to the start of transplant conditioning&#xD;
             and must have at least one somatically acquired mutation that is interrogated by the&#xD;

             germline/inherited myeloid predisposition gene in that patient, this variant cannot&#xD;
             and will not be used as evidence of MRD positivity. If the pre-transplant gene panel&#xD;
             testing is a next-generation sequencing panel other than the MyeloSeq platform, the&#xD;
             outside report will be reviewed by the PI and the molecular pathologists at the&#xD;
             McDonnell Genome Institute to ensure eligibility.&#xD;
