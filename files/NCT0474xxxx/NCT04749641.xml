  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs), which diffusely occupy the pons of brainstem, are&#xD;
      the deadliest primary brain cancer in children. Biopsy for pathology plus radiotherapy&#xD;
      remains the current standard-of-care treatment that is minimal effective. Thus, the median&#xD;
      overall survival after diagnosis is just 10 months. Recent studies have identified a lysine&#xD;
      27-to-methionine (K27M) somatic mutation at histone H3 variant (H3.3), as a feature mutation&#xD;
      in DIPGs. Several preclinical studies have already demonstrated H3.3-K27M as a promising&#xD;
      target for immunotherapy. The researched vaccine is a cancer-treatment vaccine containing an&#xD;
      H3.3-K27M targeted neoantigen peptide, that can be taken up by antigen-presenting cells&#xD;
      (APCs). APCs can present the peptide with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)&#xD;
      molecules on cell surface, thereby activating neoantigen-specific T cells and triggering&#xD;
      corresponding cytotoxic T cell immune responses to eliminate H3.3-K27M-expressing DIPG cells.&#xD;
      The main goal of this study is investigating the safety and preliminary efficacy of the&#xD;
      vaccine in treating newly-diagnosed DIPGs when the vaccine is administered in combination&#xD;
      with the standard-of-care treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The researched vaccine, containing H3.3-K27M-targeting neoantigen peptides and poly ICLC, will be administered through subcutaneous injection into DIPG patients after they complete surgical/stereotactic biopsy and conformal radiotherapy. The day of first vaccine injection is defined as D1 (day 1), and then the injections will be administered on D3, D15, Day 29, Day 57, Day 85 and one injection every 8 weeks thereafter. In order to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the vaccine, a &quot;6+3&quot; dose escalation design is applied. There are three doses for the vaccine. Dose 1: 0.5mg peptide + Poly ICLC; Dose 2: 1mg peptide + Poly ICLC; Dose 3: 2mg peptide + Poly ICLC.</description>
