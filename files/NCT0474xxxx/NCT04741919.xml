      Basic Study Design: Prospective, randomized, single-center, single-blinded study to compare&#xD;
      dysphotopsias and pain recollection immediately 2 weeks, and 3 months after LPI in PACS&#xD;
      patients who have a clear indication for bilateral LPI. Our null hypothesis is that there is&#xD;
      no difference in dysphotopsia or pain levels by LPI position. Our alternate hypothesis is&#xD;
      that there are more dysphotopsias superiorly and more pain temporally.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to describe the difference in the incidence of dysphotopsias and&#xD;
      sensation of pain both immediately, 2 weeks and 3 months after superior or temporal LPI. The&#xD;
      main primary outcome variable will be the presence of dysphotopsias and the recollection of&#xD;
      pain graded by a standardized pain scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratified Block Randomization: 200 patients will be recruited from participating centre. For&#xD;
      each patient, the order of the eye to be treated as well as the position of the LPI superior&#xD;
      or temporal will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Patients included in the study will be patients referred for a glaucoma evaluation&#xD;
      or in follow up at Sunnybrook Science Center who are diagnosed as PACS and have therefore an&#xD;
      indication for bilateral LPIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: All patients eligible will be examined by the principal investigator,&#xD;
      including a slit lamp assessment of the anterior segment, gonioscopy of the angle and&#xD;
      stereoscopic optic nerve examination with a 78 Diopters lens. Intraocular pressure (IOP) will&#xD;
      be measured with applanation tonometry. Patients will be assessed with a macular and optic&#xD;
      nerve OCT to rule out glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only bilateral PACS patients will be included. One randomly selected eye will receive&#xD;
      superior LPI while contralateral eye temporal LPI. At the 2 week and 3 month follow up visits&#xD;
      patients will be asked about dysphotopsias in one or both eyes and their recollection of pain&#xD;
      will be graded. Other distractors will be included in the questionnaire such as increased&#xD;
      tearing sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser peripheral iridotomy will be performed using neo-dynium:yttrium:aluminium-garnet laser&#xD;
      after pretreatment with 2% pilocarpine and brimonidine 0.15%. Superior LPIs will be placed&#xD;
      between the 11- and 1-o'clock positions such that they were covered completely by the upper&#xD;
      eyelid; nasal/temporal LPIs will be placed between the 2- and 4-o'clock positions or the 8-&#xD;
      and 10-o'clock positions such that they were completely clear of the lid margin. Preference&#xD;
      will be given to iris crypts, avoiding iris vessels when possible. Laser peripheral&#xD;
      iridotomies will be performed in both eyes during the same visit and will be confirmed to be&#xD;
      patent after the procedure. Intraoperative data collected will include initial per-shot laser&#xD;
      energy in milli joules, number of laser shots, and total laser energy in millijoules. All the&#xD;
      patients will be treated with fluorometholone 0.1% eye drops QID for 5 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: Laser treatment specifications will be noted for the amount in LPI&#xD;
      positioning, number of applications, and amount of energy used. Other relevant patient&#xD;
      information will also be noted such as best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refractive error,&#xD;
      IOP and presence of lens opacities along with the patients gender, age and ethnicity. These&#xD;
      patients will be scheduled for follow up examination and IOP measurement at 2 weeks and 3&#xD;
      months after LPI procedure. On follow up a questionnaire will be given to patients assessing&#xD;
      pain recollection and presence of dysphotopsias. Lid coverage of the LPI will also be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target sample size of 200 participants was selected to provide 80% power on an estimated&#xD;
      incidence of 10.7% incidence of dysphotopsias after superior LPI versus 2.4% after temporal&#xD;
      LPI with a 2-sided error at Î± = .05. This was based on the study published by Vera et&#xD;
      al,.2014. The sample size allows for a 15% loss to follow-up and a 10% crossover between&#xD;
      randomization groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Group differences in baseline variables will be evaluated using Student t test&#xD;
      for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. P values of less&#xD;
      than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Patients will be identified on initial or follow up visits at Sunnybrook Health&#xD;
      Center. The ophthalmologists will identify potential subjects and the study coordinator will&#xD;
      explain the nature of the study and invite them to participate. An Information and Consent&#xD;
      Form will be signed by the patient previous to the enrollment in the study.&#xD;
