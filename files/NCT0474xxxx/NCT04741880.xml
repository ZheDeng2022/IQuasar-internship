  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of intravenous lidocaine in continuous infusion in the perioperative period is&#xD;
      associated with a reduction in postoperative pain scores, opioid use, incidence of nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, among other favorable outcomes. However, this therapeutic intervention has not yet&#xD;
      been adequately evaluated by clinical trials when associated with regional anesthesia. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to evaluate whether the use of intravenous lidocaine in continuous&#xD;
      infusion during spinal anesthesia with isobaric bupivacaine alters the time to regression of&#xD;
      sensory block in patients undergoing surgical procedures for the treatment of bone and&#xD;
      connective tissue tumor surgeries. This will be a triple-blind randomized trial. The sample&#xD;
      size estimated was 66 patients. The study will include all patients who meet the&#xD;
      pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria, choose to participate, and agree with the&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form. The main anesthetic technique will be spinal anesthesia with 13 mg of&#xD;
      isobaric bupivacaine. Patients will be allocated in two groups in a blindly after&#xD;
      randomization: Group S (lidocaine 0.75mg.kg-1 in bolus followed by infusion of saline&#xD;
      solution) and Group L (lidocaine 1.5 mg.kg-1 followed by continuous infusion of lidocaine&#xD;
      solution at 2 mg.kg-1.h-1). The primary outcome will be the time to T12 regression of the&#xD;
      sensory block. Will also be evaluated: time to regression of the motor block, most rostral&#xD;
      dermatome achieved by the sensory block, time to two-segment regression oh the sensory block,&#xD;
      propofol dose in the operating room, postoperative pain score at rest, pain at movement&#xD;
      score, quality of recovery, use of opioids in the postoperative period, nausea or vomiting,&#xD;
      dizziness, shivering, arrhythmias, hypotension, urinary retention, and length of stay. The&#xD;
      records will be assigned to the RedCap database. The data will be extracted without&#xD;
      identification of the allocation groups for the R software and the groups will be revealed to&#xD;
      the researcher after the end of the statistical analysis to write the summary of the results.&#xD;
      The results will be submitted to scientific journals afterward.&#xD;

      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: The time to T12 regression of the sensory block after administration of isobaric&#xD;
      bupivacaine is EQUAL with or without the use of intravenous lidocaine in continuous infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: The time to T12 regression of the sensory block after administration of isobaric&#xD;
      bupivacaine is DIFFERENT depending on the use or not of intravenous lidocaine in continuous&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a randomized, controlled, triple blind clinical trial (patient, assistant team /&#xD;
      investigator, and data collection/analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients should undergo an outpatient preoperative evaluation with an anesthesiologist.&#xD;
      At that moment, eligibility for the study will be evaluated and the informed consent form&#xD;
      will be presented. The preoperative form will also be completed by the investigator of the&#xD;
      study who includes the patient of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will undergo continuous 5 leads electrocardiographic, automated&#xD;
      noninvasive blood pressure and capnography monitoring initiated at the entrance to the&#xD;
      operating room. Peripheral venous access will also be obtained. After certification of&#xD;
      monitoring and venous access the patient will be positioned in lateral decubitus with the&#xD;
      side to be performed the surgery (or the side of higher major surgical trauma in case of&#xD;
      bilateral procedures) superiorly (e.g. surgery with right side of the body the puncture will&#xD;
      be performed in left lateral decubitus) and then will be initiated the infusion the solutions&#xD;
      present in the syringe and in the bag sent by the Division of Pharmacy of the hospital unit&#xD;
      according to the protocol. Immediately after the initiation of continuous infusion of the&#xD;
      solution the anesthesiologist will begin preparation for performing subarachnoid puncture&#xD;
      with a Quinke needle between 22 and 27 Gauge (preferably 26 Gauge) between spaces L4-L5 and&#xD;
      L2-L3 (preferably L3-L4) depending on the assessment of the anesthesiologist responsible for&#xD;
      the predicted difficulty for the block and the risk of post-dural puncture headache.&#xD;
      Conscious sedation with propofol in continuous infusion and local anesthesia with 1%&#xD;
      lidocaine solution up to 100 mg will also be initiated. It will be administered in the&#xD;
      subarachnoid space 13mg (2.6 ml of solution) of isobaric bupivacaine at 0.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a multimodal and antiemetic analgesia regimen, the following will be administered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dexamethasone 4mg in the operating room;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ondansetron 4mg in the operating room and in case of postoperative nausea or vomiting;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dipyrone 20mg.kg-1 every 4 hours or paracetamol 500mg every 4 hours (in case of dipyrone&#xD;
           allergy) started before regional anesthesia and kept until discharge;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tenoxicam 40mg in the OR and 20 mg on the first postoperative day, unless&#xD;
           contraindicated by the assistant team;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tramadol 50mg up to every 4 hours or morphine 4 mg up to every 10 minutes in case of&#xD;
           pain assessed by verbal numerical scale greater than or equal to 4 (0-10) or according&#xD;
           to evaluation of the assistant team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the block, evaluations of the extension of sensory and motor block will be performed at&#xD;
      minutes 5, 10, 15 and then every 15 minutes as presented in the data collection form . The&#xD;
      sensory block will be evaluated by pinprick sequentially from the most caudal to the most&#xD;
      cephalic level, at the midclavicular line, on the opposite side of the surgical procedure (or&#xD;
      on the side of minor surgical trauma in case of bilateral procedures) and will be computed as&#xD;
      the level of blockade the point at which the patient reports sensitivity similar to reference&#xD;
      point (homolateral shoulder) will be computed. Motor block will be initially evaluated for&#xD;
      ankle flexion, followed by knee elevation and finally leg elevation with knees extended, and&#xD;
      the level of motor block will be recorded according to the modified Bromage scale on the&#xD;
      opposite side of the surgical procedure (or on the side of lower surgical trauma in case of&#xD;
      bilateral procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be released for the surgical procedure as soon as he reaches motor block&#xD;
      evidenced by a modified Bromage scale equal to 2. During the procedure, only sensory block&#xD;
      will be observed so that there is no interference with the surgical procedure. After the end&#xD;
      of the procedure, each 15 minutes evaluations of sensory and motor block will be performed.&#xD;
      Supplementary sensory and motor status evaluations may be performed in addition to the&#xD;
      evaluations every 15 minutes at the discretion of the assistant team. After the end of the&#xD;
      surgery. Sensory block and motor block will be evaluated concomitantly until the primary&#xD;
      outcome (regression of sensory block up T12 dermatome), regression of motor block to modified&#xD;
      Bromage 1 and regression of two dermatomes of the sensory block (secondary outcomes) are&#xD;
      achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be continuously evaluated in the post-anesthetic recovery room until at&#xD;
      least the second postoperative hour and until the primary outcome. Twenty-four hours after&#xD;
      the end of the procedure, the patient will be reevaluated at the ward, or by phone contact in&#xD;
      case of discharge, and the study information and questionnaires will be computed as described&#xD;
      in the data collection form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bolus and infusion of the solution referring to the allocated group will be made:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After monitoring and obtaining venous access&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to the initiation of continuous propofol infusion and spinal puncture&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group L (Lidocaine):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine bolus 1.5 mg.kg-1 intravenous before the onset of lidocaine infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine 2mg.kg-1.h-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group S (saline solution):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine bolus 0.75 mg.kg-1 intravenous before the onset of saline infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group L will be sent a 20 ml syringe of 2% lidocaine and 200 ml of lidocaine solution at&#xD;
      8mg.ml-1 (80ml of 2% lidocaine associated with 120ml 0.9% sodium chloride) Group S will be&#xD;
      sent a 20 ml syringe of 1% lidocaine and 200 ml of saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A syringe with 20 ml of solution and a bag with 200 ml of solution indistinguishable between&#xD;
      the groups, with the identification of the patient by label prepared specifically for the&#xD;
      study will be prepared by the Pharmacy personal. The bag and the solution will be sealed in a&#xD;
      waterproof and opaque envelope and sent to the Operating Theatre (OT). The envelope will be&#xD;
      stored in the refrigerator of the sector between 3º C and 8º C until the patient is sent to&#xD;
      the operating room, when the drugs will be sent to the operating room. At the time designated&#xD;
      for the start of the intervention, a bolus of 0.075 ml.kg-1 of the syringe solution, followed&#xD;
      by 0.25 ml.kg-1.h-1 in the infusion pump of the solution in the bag will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous infusion of lidocaine (group L) or saline solution (group S) will be maintained&#xD;
      until the sensory block regresses to the T12 level, until the regression of 2 dermatomes of&#xD;
      the sensory block and until the motor block reaches the score on the modified Bromage scale&#xD;
      1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infusion will be interrupted and the masking will be broken in case of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  severe neurological disorders (e.g. seizure, respiratory depression);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiac (e.g. atrioventricular block greater than second degree, bradycardia with HR&#xD;
           less than 40 bpm not responsive to atropine, refractory hypotension);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  other unforeseen clinical changes that pose a risk to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infusion will be maintained until the end of anesthesia and masking in case of need for&#xD;
      conversion to general anesthesia (e.g., insufficient block, psychomotor agitation) and the&#xD;
      patient will be (1) censored for the outcomes related to the extension of the blockade and&#xD;
      (2) will continue contributing to the other outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables evaluated in the study will be collected preoperatively, at the operating room,&#xD;
      at the PACU, in the first 24 postoperative hours, and in 30 days and recorded in the RedCap&#xD;
      database. All data collected in the study is available at the data collection sheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records numbers and names will be included in the data collection but will not be&#xD;
      imputed in RedCap. Therefore, the participants' data will not be revealed at the time of data&#xD;
      extraction and analysis, preserving the anonymity of the research individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data extracted from RedCap will be analyzed in software R. The groups will be separated&#xD;
      by intervention group, but the researcher responsible for the analysis will only have access&#xD;
      to the groups after the end of the analysis of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be presented as mean and standard deviation or median and&#xD;
      interquartile range depending on their distribution. To check the comparability between the&#xD;
      groups and study, the basal covariates will be presented by intervention group. Bivariate&#xD;
      statistical tests will be performed bicaudal chi-squared test, t-test, nonparametric&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test and log rank test depending on the characteristics of the variable. In the&#xD;
      outcome &quot;most rostral dermatome achieved by sensory block&quot; each dermatome will be numbered&#xD;
      for statistical analysis from S5 to C6 according to the following examples: S5=1, S4=2, S3=3,&#xD;
      C8=23, C7=24 and C6=25 and will be analyzed according to its distribution. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be presented graphically by the Kaplan Meier curve. The value of α was set at&#xD;
      0.05. For the primary outcome, the p-value will be analyzed without adjustment for multiple&#xD;
      tests. Secondary outcomes will be evaluated without adjustment for multiple comparisons&#xD;
      because it is an exploratory analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculation was performed with the software R, package 'WMWssp', command&#xD;
      'WMWssp'. Based on previous studies, the mean time for regression was estimated at 120&#xD;
      minutes standard deviation for sensory block regression after subarachnoid anesthesia with&#xD;
      bupivacaine in 20 minutes. Adopting the α value of 0.05, the power of 80%, and a 10% drop out&#xD;
      rate, the estimated sample size to demonstrate the difference of 15 minutes in the primary&#xD;
      outcome was 66 patients (R software input: 'WMWssp(round(rnorm(1000000, 120, 20)),&#xD;
      rnorm(1000000, 135, 20), alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8, t = 1/2, simulation = FALSE, nsim =&#xD;
      10^4)').&#xD;
