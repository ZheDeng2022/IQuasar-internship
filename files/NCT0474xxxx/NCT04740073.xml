  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is unknown how progressive physiological change in muscle and tendon contributes to loss&#xD;
      of functional ability in patients undergoing total knee replacement between referral to&#xD;
      surgery, and during post-surgery recovery. This study will use ultrasound and&#xD;
      neurophysiological measures to evaluate progressive alterations of tissue to understand&#xD;
      functional decline in men and women prior to and following knee replacement surgery. A group&#xD;
      of healthy controls not undergoing knee replacement will also be studied to contrast changes&#xD;
      in the patient group to normal changes over time. It is hypothesized that from the point of&#xD;
      referral to surgery, patients will exhibit reductions in muscle and tendon size (atrophy) and&#xD;
      reflex excitability that will be greater in the surgical compared with non-surgical leg, and&#xD;
      these changes will precede observable losses in functional measures and strength. Secondly,&#xD;
      it is hypothesized that following total knee replacement, muscle and tendon size, reflex&#xD;
      activity, strength and functional measures will increase to a level below the pre-surgery&#xD;
      values.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis leads to degeneration of the articulating surfaces of the femur and tibia,&#xD;
      with the end-stage intervention being replacement of these articulating surfaces using a&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgical procedure. For patients undergoing TKA, there is a&#xD;
      significant decline in functional abilities throughout the waiting period from surgical&#xD;
      referral to the surgery date. Following the surgery, there is an improvement in function of&#xD;
      these patients, but they do not reach the same functional level as healthy individuals who&#xD;
      have not undergone TKA. To objectively measure functional abilities, various tests of&#xD;
      strength, mobility and balance can be assessed. To date, no study has been conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate how these objective measures of functional ability change throughout the pre-surgery&#xD;
      waiting period and how this compares to levels following surgery. To gain a further&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms behind these changes in function, physiological measures of&#xD;
      muscle and tendon can be employed using electrical testing and ultrasound imaging. By&#xD;
      evaluating changes in physiology alongside changes in function in TKA patients and healthy&#xD;
      controls, we can gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying observable changes&#xD;
      in function of patients undergoing TKA and how this compares to normal physiological changes&#xD;
      in healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing total knee replacement will visit the laboratory on 5 separate testing&#xD;
      occasions (1, immediately following referral for TKA; 2, midpoint between referral and&#xD;
      surgery; 3, 2 weeks prior to surgery; 4, 6 weeks post-surgery; 5, 6 months post-surgery. At&#xD;
      each testing session participants will begin by filling out questionnaires related to overall&#xD;
      functional ability. They will then perform functional tests of the upper and lower body to&#xD;
      gain measures of limb-dependent functional ability. Following functional measures, resting&#xD;
      measures of muscle and tendon surrounding the knee and quadriceps muscle group will be&#xD;
      obtained using a combination of ultrasound imaging and measurements at the skin surface.&#xD;
      Participants will then be equipped will surface electromyography (sEMG) electrodes on the&#xD;
      muscles composing the quadriceps and hamstrings muscle groups to measure muscle activity&#xD;
      during the subsequent measures. Muscle reflex activity will be assessed through sub-maximal&#xD;
      and maximal electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve via carbon stimulation electrodes&#xD;
      placed on the skin surface. Participants will then perform three maximal voluntary&#xD;
      contractions (MVC) requiring them to extend their leg as hard as possible against the force&#xD;
      transducer. Stimulation will be applied prior to, during and following the MVCs to assess the&#xD;
      level of muscle activation. From the MVCs, sub-maximal tracking tasks of 5,10,25,50 and 75%&#xD;
      MVC will be established. Using the force displayed on a screen in front of the participants,&#xD;
      they will be required to produce contractions up to these force levels and maintain the force&#xD;
      level for 5 second in order to quantify force steadiness. During these sub-maximal tracking&#xD;
      tasks, the ultrasound probe will be placed on the junction between the quadriceps muscle and&#xD;
      tendon to record tendon elongation for quantification of tendon mechanical properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These procedures will be preformed for the surgical leg of 30 patients undergoing TKA to&#xD;
      compare inter-leg differences across time points, and 30 healthy control participants not&#xD;
      undergoing TKA who are age-and sex-matched to the patient group will also perform these&#xD;
      measures on their non-dominant leg using the same spacing between testing sessions. Measures&#xD;
      will be compared between the surgical of patients and the non-dominant leg of healthy&#xD;
      controls to evaluate differences over time in the patient group and how this compares to&#xD;
      normal changes in a healthy population over the same period of time. This study will try and&#xD;
      determine what measures of physiological change prior to surgery best predict optimization of&#xD;
      patient function and improvement following surgery.&#xD;
