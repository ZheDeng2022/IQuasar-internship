  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of birth defects, with an incidence of&#xD;
      0.8%. Since the 1980s, France has been a pioneer in neonatal CHD surgery (Pr. Fontan, Pr.&#xD;
      Lecomte, Pr. Serraf, etc.), in prenatal diagnosis, and in interventional cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually, first children operated for complex CHD have reached adulthood and a new&#xD;
      epidemiology of CHD is emerging. Currently, one of the public health challenges is the need&#xD;
      to maintain appropriate follow-up and to avoid disruption of care during the transition from&#xD;
      adolescence to adulthood. Thus, the national health authorities (DGOS) recently certified a&#xD;
      national network of expert centers for complex CHD (M3C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, under the leadership of the French Society of Cardiology, the sub-specialty of&#xD;
      Pediatric and Congenital Cardiology has been recognized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, while North American and North European countries have published their updated data&#xD;
      on the main indicators of CHD morbidity and mortality, no study has reported epidemiology of&#xD;
      CHD in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, available data are approximate, estimating that 200,000 children and 250,000&#xD;
      adults would be living in France with a CHD. Nevertheless, no information is available on&#xD;
      hospitalizations, type of CHD, their follow-up, possible disruption in care, and morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in patients with CHD in France. This epidemiological study will use the&#xD;
      national health insurance hospital database to answer these questions.&#xD;

      Retrospective epidemiological study based on the national health insurance hospital database&#xD;
      from 2010 to 2020 (10 years):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the prevalence of patients with CHD hospitalized in France over 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: asess over the same period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall mortality rate according to the CHD classification and the geographic area&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall morbidity rate, according to the CHD classification and the geographic area&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall cardiac surgery-related mortality rate (cardiac surgery and other surgery),&#xD;
           according to the CHD classification (adjusted for the severity of the CHD and the&#xD;
           surgical procedure) and to geographic area&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall cardiac catheter-related mortality rate, according to the CHD classification&#xD;
           (adjusted for the severity of the CHD and the catheterization procedure) and to&#xD;
           geographic area&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CHD follow-up within and outside the national M3C network&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periods of loss of cardiological follow-up (within or outside the M3C network, in&#xD;
           hospital or in town)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obstetrical data for women (parity, pregnancy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The existence of a prenatal diagnosis (yes / no and the term of pregnancy at the time of&#xD;
           diagnosis of CHD)&#xD;
