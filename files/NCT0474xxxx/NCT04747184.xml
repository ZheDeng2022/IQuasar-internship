  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induced sputum samples were obtained from 27 asthmatic patients and 27 non-asthmatic&#xD;
      subjects. Sequencing of the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene using Illumina MiSeq was performed,&#xD;
      followed by analysis of alpha and beta diversity.&#xD;

      The study was conducted over 10 months, from March to December 2019, with patients recruited&#xD;
      from Al Bashir public hospital,A convenient sample of 54 participants were approached (27&#xD;
      asthmatic patients and 27 healthy subjects). All the asthmatic patients were recruited from&#xD;
      an outpatient clinic at Al Bashir hospital. Study participants were informed about the nature&#xD;
      of the study and were included only after obtaining their consent verbally and voluntary.&#xD;
      Sociodemographic characteristics were collected from all study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimens were collected according to the CDC guidelines for collecting respiratory diseases'&#xD;
      samples. All participants were asked to expectorate a sputum sample in special sterile tubes&#xD;
      indicated for sputum collection. Particular care was taken to avoid contamination of the&#xD;
      sputum sample with the saliva and post-nasal drip by asking the participants to rinse their&#xD;
      mouth with sterile water before inducing the sputum sample. Then the expectorated sputum&#xD;
      specimen was immediately homogenized and stored in the deep freezer (-80°C) for DNA&#xD;
      extraction for microbial gene sequencing and sequence analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      located in Amman, the capital city of Jordan. DNA extraction and 16S rRNA sequencing DNA&#xD;
      extraction using QIAamp® DNA mini kit (QIAGEN) was done under aseptic techniques in the&#xD;
      sterile room for all samples according to the manufacturer instructions. The DNA extracts for&#xD;
      the 54 samples collected (27 from asthmatic patients and 27 from healthy subjects) were&#xD;
      stored at -80° C in a sterile Eppendorf tubes until they were sent to the Molecular Research&#xD;
      (MR DNA) Lab (Molecular Research LP, Shallowater, TX, USA) for sequencing. Briefly, PCR&#xD;
      amplification of the 16s rRNA gene and its subsequent sequencing was done using Illumina. The&#xD;
      16s rRNA gene V4 variable region PCR primers ill27Fmod (AGRGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG) /ill519Rmod&#xD;
      (GTNTTACNGCGGCKGCTG) with barcode on the forward primer were used in 30 cycles using the&#xD;
      HotStarTaq Plus Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, USA). After amplification, PCR products were checked&#xD;
      in 2% agarose gel to determine the success of amplification and the relative intensity of&#xD;
      bands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pooled and purified PCR product was then used to prepare the Illumina DNA library.&#xD;
      Sequencing was performed on a MiSeq following the manufacturer's guidelines. Sequence data&#xD;
      were processed using the MR DNA analysis pipeline (MR DNA, Shallowater, TX, USA). In summary,&#xD;
      the sequences were joined, depleted of barcodes then sequences &lt;150bp removed, sequences with&#xD;
      ambiguous base calls were removed. Sequences were denoised, Operational taxonomic units&#xD;
      (OTUs) generated and chimeras removed. The OTUs were defined by clustering at 3% divergence&#xD;
      (97% similarity). Final OTUs were taxonomically classified using BLASTn against a curated&#xD;
      database derived from RDPII and NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, http://rdp.cme.msu.edu). For&#xD;
      alpha diversity index, namely, Shannon index H, it was carried out in &quot;Past Program&quot; for data&#xD;
      analysis version 4.02, after filtering out the reading with relative abundance of &lt;1%.&#xD;
      Shannon index varies from 0 for communities with only a single taxon to high values for&#xD;
      communities with many taxa (DeJong, 1975).&#xD;
