  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine if combining consolidative radiation therapy (RT) using a&#xD;
      hypofractionated regimen (hfRT) (2 fractions) for boosting the residual primary lung cancer&#xD;
      with adjuvant anti-PD-L1 therapy concurrently is safe and will provide better tumor control&#xD;
      locoregionally and distantly than either modality alone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For safety reasons, consolidative hfRT will start from 6.5Gy x 2 fractions and dose escalate&#xD;
      to 10Gy x 2 fractions in a 3+3 design. Consolidative hfRT will be delivered one to two months&#xD;
      after finishing definitive chemoradiation therapy (dCRT) and concurrently with adjuvant&#xD;
      anti-PD-L1 therapy using durvalumab in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the final determined consolidative hfRT dose level, a total of thirty-two subjects with&#xD;
      pathologically documented stage III NSCLC treated with dCRT will be enrolled for data&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments will occur every 3 months during durvalumab therapy for the first two&#xD;
      years, then every 4-6 months after 2 years from study registration until confirmed disease&#xD;
      progression or death. Primary endpoints include the safety of boost hfRT and concurrent&#xD;
      anti-PD-L1 therapy adjuvantly following dCRT, and the 12-month progression-free survival to&#xD;
      compare with historical results.&#xD;
