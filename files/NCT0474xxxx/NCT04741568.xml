      A recent Diabetes UK Position Statement identified several key gaps in the evidence base that&#xD;
      might improve mental wellbeing for people with diabetes; one of which was supporting people&#xD;
      with diabetes and eating disorders. There is evidence indicating that disordered eating may&#xD;
      be more prevalent in children and young people (CYP). Additionally, there is mounting&#xD;
      supporting evidence for family-based treatments in both anorexia and bulimia. This study&#xD;
      proposes to develop a psycho-education intervention for parents of CYP with Type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      (T1D), which will include a one-day workshop with online, downloadable content, and to assess&#xD;
      the feasibility of this intervention. Parents will be asked to complete questionnaires about&#xD;
      eating habits, diabetes management (both behaviour and knowledge) and wellbeing at three&#xD;
      time-points (baseline, one-month and three-months postintervention). Children will also be&#xD;
      asked to complete measures on diabetes eating problems at the same time intervals. Parents&#xD;
      randomised to the intervention arm will be invited to take part in a semi-structured&#xD;
      interview and all parents will be invited to feedback on their participation. It is&#xD;
      hypothesised that a psycho-education intervention aimed at parents will help prevent&#xD;
      disordered eating in CYP with T1D and improve parental wellbeing.&#xD;

      A recent Diabetes UK Position Statement identified several key gaps in the evidence base that&#xD;
      might help improve mental wellbeing for people with diabetes, one of which was supporting&#xD;
      people with diabetes and eating disorders. The position statement recommends focusing on&#xD;
      people in general, citing studies which observe that 30% of women with T1D omit insulin to&#xD;
      control their weight. However, there is evidence indicating that disordered eating may be&#xD;
      more prevalent in CYP. A recent meta-analysis found that clinical eating disorders (i.e.&#xD;
      anorexia and bulimia) and maladaptive eating and dieting practices (fasting, binge eating,&#xD;
      self-induced vomiting, abuse of laxatives, diet pills or other medications including&#xD;
      intentional insulin omission - diabulimia) were more prevalent in CYP with T1D (7.0% and&#xD;
      39.3% respectively) than those without T1D (2.7% and 32.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of T1D places an inherent focus on dietary intake, specifically carbohydrate&#xD;
      counting, physical activity, regular blood sugar monitoring and correct and timely&#xD;
      administration of insulin based on these factors. Many high carbohydrate foods can be&#xD;
      perceived as 'bad' for blood glucose levels and are subsequently avoided or prohibited within&#xD;
      families. This can lead to tensions between CYP and their parents, where CYP may be chastised&#xD;
      for eating particular foods or for eating 'forbidden' foods in secret. Additionally,&#xD;
      treatment and avoidance of hypoglycaemic episodes can add further complexities to a CYP with&#xD;
      T1D's relationship with food, as they may overeat during hypos or save restricted or&#xD;
      forbidden foods for hypo treatment. Some CYP may also be discouraged from participating in&#xD;
      sport activities due to concerns about a potential hypoglycaemic event. Additionally,&#xD;
      depending on age and pre-diagnosis symptoms of T1D, some CYP may also have experienced&#xD;
      significant weight loss pre-diagnosis that was quickly regained upon starting insulin&#xD;
      treatment; this may provide evidence to CYP that insulin causes them to gain unwanted body&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst systematic reviews and meta-analyses exist on the prevalence of eating problems and&#xD;
      diabetes as well as associations between eating problems and glycaemic control, the focus of&#xD;
      interventions for CYP with T1D has been on the improvement of psychological distress and&#xD;
      long-term glycaemic control. Although some interventions included in these reviews have&#xD;
      focused on family therapy, they did not explicitly target disordered eating and none were&#xD;
      based in the UK. More recently published parenting interventions also do not address&#xD;
      disordered eating. Therefore, due to this paucity of evidence for existing interventions, the&#xD;
      evidence-base for interventions for clinical eating disorders not specific to T1D is reviewed&#xD;
      instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for focusing on interventions aimed at parents is that parents are more&#xD;
      responsive to psychological interventions than their offspring. Furthermore, studies have&#xD;
      highlighted the protective influence of parents for CYP with clinical eating disorders with&#xD;
      family-based treatments playing a key role in supporting CYP in their recovery. Families are&#xD;
      a resource in the treatment of eating disorders in CYP and there is mounting evidence that&#xD;
      supports family-based treatments in both anorexia and bulimia. Mobilisation of the family&#xD;
      system as a resource and an emphasis on promoting specific change early on in treatment in&#xD;
      eating disorder-related behaviours have been found to be key elements. The involvement of&#xD;
      parents is a key recommendation in the NICE guidelines for eating disorders. Additionally,&#xD;
      the Access and Waiting Times Standard for CYP with eating disorders emphasises the necessity&#xD;
      of rapid and effective treatment for CYP, along with their families and carers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent-focused psychoeducation groups can be a useful tool to support early change in the&#xD;
      treatment of eating disorders. A parent-focused psychoeducation group has been developed at a&#xD;
      specialist CYP Eating Disorder service with the aim of offering treatment within a timely&#xD;
      manner that promoted early change. The programme is based on key principles from the&#xD;
      parenting programme literature and the evidence base for the treatment of eating disorders.&#xD;
      Emerging evidence from this group indicated significant positive effects and highlighted that&#xD;
      parents benefitted most from the information about managing their CYP's eating disorder and&#xD;
      meeting other parents. Another recent evaluation found the group to be an effective source of&#xD;
      support for parents, improved their confidence and knowledge in managing their child's eating&#xD;
      disorder and their ability to manage their child's adherence to meal plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is evident that the involvement of parents could be crucial to facilitate&#xD;
      recovery in CYP with eating disorders. Less specific to eating disorders, a recent review of&#xD;
      parental interventions to prevent body dissatisfaction or eating disorders in CYP also found&#xD;
      encouraging results.&#xD;
