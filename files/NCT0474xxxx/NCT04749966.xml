  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergency Service teams operate in some of the most challenging workplaces and experience&#xD;
      higher rates of mental ill health than the general population. Effective interventions are&#xD;
      required to enhance wellbeing, but as a first step it is crucial to understand the context&#xD;
      through which to develop these initiatives. This preliminary study will test the feasibility&#xD;
      of implementing a larger study to map the relationship between physical responses associated&#xD;
      with levels of stress (heart rate variability) and personal, social and organisational&#xD;
      factors that mediate these responses. In doing so, it is hoped to provide an insight into&#xD;
      factors that shape emergency staff members' response to stress to help develop and&#xD;
      personalise wellbeing initiatives.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team is proposing a large study in the Essex Emergency Services to map the&#xD;
      relationship between physiological indicators of stress and subjective mediators and, in&#xD;
      doing, provide insight into factors that shape a staff members' response to stress, which&#xD;
      could help to develop and personalise wellbeing initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, before undertaking a large study it is proposed to establish operational&#xD;
      feasibility. This feasibility study will enrol ten shift-working staff from each of three&#xD;
      emergency services (Essex Police, Essex County Fire and Rescue Service and East of England&#xD;
      Ambulance Service Trust). Over a 3-day period, we will evaluate participants' physiological&#xD;
      response to stressors by measuring HRV (using Firstbeat Bodyguard 2 beat-to-beat heart rate&#xD;
      monitor). During the same period, participants will keep a personal online journal of events&#xD;
      during the day. As part of the lifestyle assessment, data from the heart rate monitor and&#xD;
      journal will be analysed and participants will receive a Summary Report including information&#xD;
      on their body's reaction to stress and how this may be managed. Following the lifestyle&#xD;
      assessment, the research team will facilitate semi-structured interviews; they will use&#xD;
      participants' lifestyle assessment Summary Reports to inform appropriate questions. The team&#xD;
      will discuss subjective experiences with participants as well as their overall experience&#xD;
      with the data collection process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the feasibility study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate feasibility of undertaking a larger definitive study in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Willingness and eligibility of emergency services' staff to take part in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recruitment timeframe&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participant adherence to lifestyle assessment protocols (including wearing a heart&#xD;
                rate monitor and completing an online journal over a 3-day period)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proportion of participants in whom an interview is arranged and completed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Feasibility of other operational aspects not included above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Undertake an initial evaluation of physiological indicators and subjective mediators of&#xD;
           stress and identify any i) associations between them and ii) patterns that emerge&#xD;
           between individual participants.&#xD;
