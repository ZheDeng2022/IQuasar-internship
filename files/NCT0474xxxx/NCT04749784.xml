         10. Regular medication and/or supplementation and/or treatment (including any natural&#xD;

                  blockers, amiodarone, estrogen, anabolic steroids), unless it is long term and&#xD;
                  stabilised (contraceptives are allowed in case of a stable continuous intake&#xD;
                  before and during the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  that could influence gastrointestinal functions (e.g. laxatives, opioids,&#xD;
                  anticholinergics etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  any other, which could interfere with the results of the study or the safety of&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Women of childbearing potential: pregnancy or nursing&#xD;
