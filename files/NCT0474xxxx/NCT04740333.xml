  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis is one of the most common reasons for admission to intensive care units (ICU)&#xD;
      worldwide. About 30% of all patients admitted to intensive care suffer from sepsis (1).&#xD;
      Sepsis causes an extreme physiological stress response, with significant changes in&#xD;
      metabolism and disruption in glucose regulation. Disorder of glucose regulation can lead to&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and glucose variability (2). All of these conditions are&#xD;
      associated with increased mortality (3). In critically-ill patients, the glucose threshold&#xD;
      from which damage may be caused remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia often occurs in critically-ill patients suffering from sepsis, even in those&#xD;
      who were not diabetic before, for several reasons. Sepsis causes massive activation of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory mediators which enhances the activity of counter-regulatory hormones,&#xD;
      including cortisol, glucagon and catecholamines. Those hormones increase both hepatic&#xD;
      gluconeogenesis and peripheral resistance to insulin (4). Some of the detrimental effects of&#xD;
      hyperglycemia in septic patients are mediated via hyperglycemia-induced blood hypercoagulable&#xD;
      state, decrease of vascular endothelial responsiveness and disrupted process of phagocytosis&#xD;
      and chemotaxis of white blood cells, especially neutrophils (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is widely accepted that disordered blood glucose regulation increases mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity, as well as hospital admission times and associated financial expenses (2,6). Blood&#xD;
      glucose level at ICU admission was found to be a poor prognostic factor at various studies on&#xD;
      different ICU patient populations (7-9). For example, in ICU patients admitted due to acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock and need for urgent cardiac catheterization, high&#xD;
      blood glucose levels at admission, even in non-diabetic patients, were associated with both&#xD;
      increased in- hospital and long-term mortality (7). Among patients admitted due to acute&#xD;
      heart failure, high admission glucose levels (above 200 mg / dL), in both diabetic and&#xD;
      non-diabetic patients, were associated with higher mortality from cardio-vascular etiologies&#xD;
      within one year of admission (8). Among non-diabetic patients admitted to the hospital due to&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction, admission glucose levels above 180 mg / dL were associated with&#xD;
      a significant increase in all-causes in-hospital mortality (9). However, there is currently&#xD;
      insufficient information regarding the prognostic impact of high admission glucose levels of&#xD;
      non-diabetic septic patients admitted to the ICU (10).&#xD;

&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome: To study the correlation between high blood glucose levels (above 180 mg / dL)&#xD;
      upon ICU admission of non-diabetic patients with sepsis, and 28-day mortality, compared to&#xD;
      ICU admitted septic patients with normal blood glucose levels upon admission (less than 180&#xD;
      mg / dL and above 70 mg / dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: To study the correlation between high blood glucose levels (above 180 mg&#xD;
      / dL) upon ICU admission of non-diabetic patients with sepsis, and morbidity parameters, such&#xD;
      as ventilation days, vasopressor and inotropic support, need for dialysis, need for&#xD;
      tracheostomy, APACHE-2 score and admission lactate level compared to ICU admitted septic&#xD;
      patients with normal blood glucose levels upon admission (less than 180 mg / dL and above 70&#xD;
      mg / dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Cohort retrospective study. Study population: Non-diabetic patients aged 18-99&#xD;
      who were admitted to the ICU between 1.1.2014 and 30.1.2020 due to sepsis or septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups: Group A - Patients with admission blood glucose level lower than 180 mg / dL&#xD;
      (but higher than 70 mg / dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B- Patients with admission blood glucose level higher than 180 mg / dL. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria: 1. Patients admitted to the ICU between 1.1.2014-30.1.2020. 2. Diagnosis of sepsis&#xD;
      or septic shock upon admission. 3. Age over 18 years. 4. No previous diagnosis of diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. Exclusion criteria: 1. Patients with prior diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. 2.&#xD;
      Admission hypoglycemia (blood glucose levels below 70 mg / dL). 3. Patients who were given&#xD;
      insulin or intravenous glucose before the first ICU blood glucose measured level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Observational data collection format from hospital files and computerized&#xD;
      systems (Chameleon system and iMDsoft software).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected: age, gender, ICU and hospital admission times, source of infection,&#xD;
      ventilation days, pressor or inotropic support, 28-day mortality, past medical history&#xD;
      including regular medications, APACHE-2 score, admission lactate level, need for dialysis and&#xD;
      need for tracheostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group size: 1000 patients. Statistical analysis: All the parameters will be&#xD;
      statistically examined by a qualified statistician depending on the type of data. We will use&#xD;
      the Chi square test to analyze the individual data and the Mann-Whitney test to analyze the&#xD;
      continuous data.&#xD;
