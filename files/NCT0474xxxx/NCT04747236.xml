  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the combination treatment of romidepsin and&#xD;
      oral azacytidine is safe and effective in patients with Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL).&#xD;
      This study will compare the experimental combination treatment of romidepsin and oral&#xD;
      azacytidine to single agent drugs already determined effective in patients with PTCL. For the&#xD;
      purposes of this study, the single agent drugs already used to treat lymphoma are called&#xD;
      investigator's choice (IC), meaning the investigator will choose which one of these drugs to&#xD;
      administer. The IC drug options include romidepsin, belinostat, pralatrexate or gemcitabine&#xD;
      given alone. Funding Source: FDA OOPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) is a rare and heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      (NHL) originating from mature (or post-thymic or 'peripheral') T- lymphocytes and NK cells.&#xD;
      They are considered very aggressive and are often resistant to conventional chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study employs a stratified randomization with equal allocation within strata of patients&#xD;
      to receive oral 5-azacytidine (AZA) plus romidepsin (ROMI) versus pre-specified investigator&#xD;
      choice (ROMI, belinostat, pralatrexate or gemcitabine), for the treatment of relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory (R/R) PTCL. The dose and schedule of AZA/ROMI has been determined from a phase I&#xD;
      clinical trial of the combination. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) among patients receiving the combination compared to single&#xD;
      agent of choice.&#xD;
