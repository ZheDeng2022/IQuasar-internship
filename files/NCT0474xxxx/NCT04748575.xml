  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease that results in hyperglycaemia. This study&#xD;
      aimed to identify whether the anthocyanins contained in acai berries can mitigate&#xD;
      postprandial glycaemia in healthy adults when consumed in conjunction with carbohydrate.&#xD;
      Study design was double blind randomised crossover with glycaemic levels assessed via&#xD;
      capillary blood samples taken at baseline and over a 2 hour post-prandial period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a group of chronic metabolic disorders, characterised by&#xD;
      insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, that results in hyperglycaemia. In the UK&#xD;
      an estimated 4.3m people live with T2DM, and it is a major cause of kidney failure, heart&#xD;
      attacks, stroke, blindness and lower limb amputation. The primary digestive enzymes that&#xD;
      affect carbohydrate digestion and hence postprandial glycaemic levels have been identified as&#xD;
      α-amylase and α-glucosidase. Inhibition of these enzymes therefore reduces the rate of&#xD;
      glucose absorption and is the principle behind T2DM medications such as acarbose, miglitol&#xD;
      and voglibose. Whilst acai berries have been found to be rich in α-amylase and α-glucosidase,&#xD;
      no research has been conducted on healthy adults to ascertain whether the consumption of acai&#xD;
      berries in conjunction with carbohydrate mitigates the rise in postprandial glycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 participants were recruited for a double blind randomised crossover study where&#xD;
      participants consumed smoothies containing either acai or placebo after 10 hours of fasting.&#xD;
      Capillary blood samples were taken at baseline then at 30 minutes intervals until 2 hours&#xD;
      after consumption. The study included data for sex (female/male), age (years), weight (kg),&#xD;
      height (cm), body mass index (kg/m2) and blood glucose (mmol/l). All data collection,&#xD;
      smoothies preparation, smoothies consumption and blood sampling procedures were completed at&#xD;
      St Mary's University during the period November-December 2020. Statistical analysis was&#xD;
      conducted on the data for postprandial glycaemic response to ascertain whether the&#xD;
      consumption of acai mitigated the glycaemic response relative to the placebo.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Smoothies were prepared by the Laboratory Technician and blinded from the participant and investigator. Acai and placebo smoothies were matched nutritionally including for carbohydrate, total sugars, protein, fat and fibre. Additionally, the smoothies were matched for colour, taste and temperature and were served in opaque containers.</masking_description>
