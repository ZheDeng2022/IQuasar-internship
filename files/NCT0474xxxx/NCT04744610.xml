  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is widely used for the female infertility workup. Many studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated that the use of oil-soluble contrast medium (OSCM) ethiodized oil for HSG&#xD;
      surgery can improve pregnancy rates. However,The 24-hour delayed radiographs of OSCM HSG also&#xD;
      brought some inconvenience to the patients , for example, patients need to make two trips to&#xD;
      the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to compare OSCM HSGs using 4-hour and 24-hour delayed&#xD;
      radiographs in terms of diagnosing tubal patency and identifying the presence of pelvic&#xD;
      adhesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, open label, self - controlled study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infertile patients scheduled for an OSCM HSG&#xD;
