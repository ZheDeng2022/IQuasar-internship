  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized phase II clinical trial investigating&#xD;
      whether flibanserin promotes sexual interest in men with prostate cancer who are receiving&#xD;
      androgen suppression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 40,000 men with prostate cancer in the United States will begin androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy (ADT) each year. ADT is an important part of treatment, because it&#xD;
      improves survival for men with metastatic or high-risk localized disease, and reduces rates&#xD;
      of biochemical progression for men with intermediate-risk localized disease who receive&#xD;
      radiation. The most common ADT agents modulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone to suppress the&#xD;
      downstream testosterone production, resulting in testosterone levels similar to those&#xD;
      observed following surgical castration (&lt;20 ng/dL). Since male sexual interest is highly&#xD;
      correlated with serum testosterone levels, loss of sexual interest is nearly universal among&#xD;
      men who receive ADT.Sexual dysfunction is the most common complaint among men with prostate&#xD;
      cancer and contributes to lower overall quality of life (QoL) experienced by men receiving&#xD;
      ADT. Furthermore, the loss of sexual interest experienced during ADT is highly distressing&#xD;
      for men with prostate cancer and their partners, which contributes additional psychological&#xD;
      morbidity in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flibanserin is approved for treatment of female hypoactive sexual desire disorder, and the&#xD;
      safety profile of 100mg daily flibanserin is well described in premenopausal women.The safety&#xD;
      profile of flibanserin in healthy men has been assessed in multiple phase I clinical trials,&#xD;
      but has not been evaluated among men receiving ADT for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase II randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to&#xD;
      provide an initial estimate of the efficacy of flibanserin to promote sexual interest in men&#xD;
      with prostate cancer receiving androgen suppression therapy and to confirm the safety&#xD;
      profile. This study will take place at a single academic comprehensive cancer center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following confirmation of eligibility, participants who are enrolled in this study are&#xD;
      randomized to receive daily flibanserin 100mg or placebo for a 12-week period.&#xD;
