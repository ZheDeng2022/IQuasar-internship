      The aim of this paper was to investigate and compare the effects of two iso-energetic&#xD;
      hypo-caloric ketogenic hyper-ketonemic and non-ketogenic low carbohydrate high fat high&#xD;
      cholesterol diets on body-composition, muscle strength and hormonal profile in experienced&#xD;
      resistance-trained middle-aged men. Twenty non-competitive experienced resistance-trained&#xD;
      middle-aged men were on the supervised calorie maintenance western diet and&#xD;
      resistance-training regimen for 4 weeks and then divided into ketogenic and non-ketogenic&#xD;
      groups for 8 weeks period. Keto bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate) levels were measured weekly,&#xD;
      testosterone and insulin biweekly, strength and body-composition monthly, lipid profile and&#xD;
      blood sugar level at the beginning and at the end of the study.&#xD;

      The primary goal of this research was to investigate and compare the effects of two forms of&#xD;
      hypo-caloric LCHF high cholesterol ketogenic hyper-ketonemic and non-ketogenic diets on&#xD;
      muscle strength and body-composition in the experienced resistance-trained middle-aged&#xD;
      healthy male population, and explore possible advantage of ketogenic state. The secondary&#xD;
      goal was to examine the rate and magnitude of hormonal changes during the 8 weeks dietary&#xD;
      phase and their possible impact on the muscle strength and body-composition. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that calorie intake is the main variable that influences body-compositional&#xD;
      changes regardless of the ketogenic state in similar LCHF dieting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four weeks before the experimental procedure participants undertook a detailed medical&#xD;
      examination and subsequently were familiarized with all testing schedules and new training&#xD;
      facilities in which they continued supervised training sessions, with equalized exercise&#xD;
      selection and order for every muscle group as well as for volume and intensity. Participants&#xD;
      were instructed not to change any of their current eating habits supervised for the total&#xD;
      energy intake set at the calorie maintenance requirement, until the beginning of the LCHF&#xD;
      dietary phase of the experiment. After completing 4 weeks of the familiarization phase, the&#xD;
      subjects were randomized into ketogenic (KG) and non-ketogenic group (NKG). The first group&#xD;
      received LCHF high-cholesterol ketogenic dietary treatment, and the second group received&#xD;
      LCHF high-cholesterol non-ketogenic dietary treatment, with the equally reduced calorie&#xD;
      intake. The experimental dietary phase lasted for 8 weeks without any change in resistance&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood ketones were monitored weekly, hormonal values every 2 weeks, muscle strength and&#xD;
      body-composition every 4 weeks, and basic blood analysis with lipid profile and blood sugar&#xD;
      level at the beginning and at the end of the dietary phase of the study Twenty healthy&#xD;
      non-competitive experienced resistance-trained middle-aged men (Age = 42.7±1.5 years, Body&#xD;
      height = 181.7±4.6 cm, Body mass (BM) = 88.3±5.8 kg), without any recent medical condition,&#xD;
      were selected for this research. Inclusion criteria were more than 5 years of experience with&#xD;
      resistance-training, and a minimum of 2 years of training continuity prior to the study, with&#xD;
      one repetition maximum (1RM) lower limit for bench press at 100% body weight and for squat at&#xD;
      130% bodyweight. In addition, including criteria pertaining to dietary habits, was that no&#xD;
      major change in nutrition regime (prolonged increase or decrease in calories or a&#xD;
      macronutrient percentage change) was taken in the last 6 months prior to the study. No recent&#xD;
      injuries and no medical treatment were mandatory conditions for participation in the study.&#xD;
      After initial consultations, participants were asked to avoid alcohol and training&#xD;
      stimulants. All participants gave written informed consent for study protocol, approved by&#xD;
      the Ethical committee of the Faculty of Sport and Physical Education (IRB: 484-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training was conducted in the same sports facility, supervised by qualified certified&#xD;
      professionals at the same time of the day, with the beginning between 18 h and 19 h, four&#xD;
      times per week on working days. After initial strength testing 4 weeks prior to the dietary&#xD;
      change, subjects training was equalized by the exercise selection, training volume, and&#xD;
      intensity based on their individual 1RM. Every major muscle group was trained twice per week&#xD;
      with free weights and auxiliary cable exercises in the 6 - 12 repetitions range and 60 - 90&#xD;
      seconds between sets and 2 - 3 minutes between exercises. If any of the subjects missed the&#xD;
      training session it was allowed to complete it on another day of the week. Missing training&#xD;
      completely meant disqualification from the study. All participants were instructed not to&#xD;
      perform any additional physical exercise of any type during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the experimental phase, which followed supervised lead-in calorie&#xD;
      maintenance habitual diet phase, weekly LCHF ketogenic and non-ketogenic meal plans were&#xD;
      given to the participants with the additional individual verbal instructions. All supervision&#xD;
      and guidance were carried through on a weekly base by registered dietitian. Collective&#xD;
      supervised attainment of the food supply for every next week was conducted from the same&#xD;
      supermarket brand in 2 locations. Additional individual consultations, if needed, were&#xD;
      provided for all participants at any time point throughout the study, ensuring compliance to&#xD;
      the diet. Every participant was provided with the calibrated kitchen scale (Profi Cook PC-KW&#xD;
      1061) for the duration of the experiment. LCHF diet consisted mainly of meat (beef and veal,&#xD;
      poultry), fish (salmon, sardines, tuna), butter and coconut oil for cooking, fat cheese,&#xD;
      flaxseed and olive oil for salad dressing and green vegetables. Whole eggs were mandatory on&#xD;
      the daily basis insuring intended adequate cholesterol intake. The NKG group obtained their&#xD;
      additional small amount of carbohydrate intake from brown rice. Protein intake was set to be&#xD;
      equal for both experimental groups with differences in CHO and fat content. Macronutrient&#xD;
      ratios for KG and NKG groups were set to 20 %, 5 %, 75 % vs. 20 %, 15 %, 65 % of protein,&#xD;
      carbohydrates and fat, respectively. Caloric intake for experimental phase was set to cover&#xD;
      basal metabolism and sedentary activities (BMR times 1.2) for every participant using the&#xD;
      Mifflin St Jeor equation providing that energy deficit comes primarily from training&#xD;
      activities. Dietary intake was calculated using the Diet Master Pro 14.4 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were monitored weekly to achieve and sustain blood β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)&#xD;
      level of 1 mmol and above in KG and limit it to 0.1 - 0.2 mmol levels in NKG, throughout the&#xD;
      whole duration of the study. If any of the participants were to cross the marked values of&#xD;
      the BHB levels in either direction, evaluation and correction of CHO intake would have been&#xD;
      immediately carried through, and remeasuring was scheduled before the next training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the biochemical testing, except blood ketone values (BHB), were done on Sunday mornings&#xD;
      after a complete day of rest from the last training session on Friday's. Blood samples were&#xD;
      obtained via venipuncture by trained phlebotomists in the morning at 08 h after 12 hours fast&#xD;
      to avoid diurnal variations. Whole blood was collected, transferred into appropriate tubes&#xD;
      for obtaining serum and plasma, and subsequently centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15 min at 4°C.&#xD;
      Resulting serum and plasma were stored at -80°C until analysis which was done on the Roche&#xD;
      Hitachi Cobas c 311 and c 411 (Roche Diagnostics, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) using ECLIA and&#xD;
      Spectrophotometry methods for testing testosterone, insulin, blood lipid levels (Total&#xD;
      cholesterol, High density lipoprotein, Low density lipoprotein, Triglycerides) and blood&#xD;
      glucose levels, while ELISA reader RAYTO RT-2100C (Pioway Medical Lab Equipment, Nanjing,&#xD;
      China) was used for determining free testosterone levels. All hormones were measured in the&#xD;
      same assay in duplicate measurements on the same day to avoid compounded inter-assay&#xD;
      variance. The norm for validity of the measurements was intra-assay variance set to less than&#xD;
      5% for all analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BHB samples were taken from the finger blood sample, using a Precision Xtra™ meter&#xD;
      (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA) and were measured in the late afternoon between 17 h and&#xD;
      18 h, before collective training. This timing was chosen as optimal to avoid possible&#xD;
      misreading due to the morning cortisol and training influence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal strength was determined via 1RM bench press (BP) and squat (SQ) measurements in&#xD;
      accordance with International Powerlifting Federation rules. After performing general&#xD;
      (stationary bicycle) and specific (sets with 50% and 75% of predicted 1RM) warm up, subjects&#xD;
      had up to 5 attempts to achieve 1RM. Every attempt was accompanied by strong verbal&#xD;
      encouragement. All testing was done at the same time of day in which subjects had their&#xD;
      training sessions after two days of rest from the last training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body-composition parameters, lean body mass (LBM) and fat mass (FM) were obtained in the&#xD;
      morning after an overnight fast on empty stomach using an electric scale, bio-impedance&#xD;
      device (In Body 720; Biospace Co., Soul, Korea) using the standardized procedure recommended&#xD;
      by the manufacturer and previous studies. In brief, participants were in a standing position&#xD;
      with hands and feet placed on the electrodes. Testing was done and monitored by qualified&#xD;
      laboratory personnel. Participants were instructed to come without any physical effort prior&#xD;
      to the testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements and testing were done in accordance with Helsinki declaration and rules of&#xD;
      the Ethic Committee of the Faculty of Sport and Physical Education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic descriptive statistic (Mean, SD) was performed, following a visual inspection of&#xD;
      boxplots for identifying outliers. Normality test was performed for confirmation of the&#xD;
      normality of the data. T test was used to identify differences between lead in and&#xD;
      experimental diets. Mixed (split plot) ANOVA was used to determine the time, group, and&#xD;
      treatment x time interactions. When a significant F-value was found, post-hoc with Bonferroni&#xD;
      adjustment was used for multiple comparisons. Data were reported as mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation. The level of significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. The program used for statistical&#xD;
      analysis was SPSS 19 (IBM).&#xD;
