      Study design: This is a prospective, open-label, single-center, and sponsor-initiated&#xD;
      clinical trial. The clinical trial follows the Clinical Investigation Plan, GCP. Objective:&#xD;
      The objective of the clinical trial is to evaluate improving Parkinson's disease motor&#xD;
      features by MR-guided focused ultrasound surgery (Patient who has less effectiveness.).&#xD;

      Endpoint: All PD003J treated subjects will be followed up for 4 months. The primary endpoints&#xD;
      will be safety of unilateral, PD003J subthalamotomy for PD. The endpoint will be determined&#xD;
      from adverse events recorded during the 4 months period for safety. Secondary endpoints will&#xD;
      include changes in MDS-UPDRS, levodopa equivalent medication, Global Impression of Change and&#xD;
      so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint of safety: Incidence and severity of adverse events (AE/AEs) associated with&#xD;
      PD003J treatment of idiopathic PD at 4 months post treatment. Safety will be evaluated&#xD;
      individually for each subject who is treated. An analysis of safety will be performed on all&#xD;
      treated subjects and will be determined by an evaluation of the incidence and severity of&#xD;
      device- and procedure-related complications. In particular, in this study, the incidence of&#xD;
      severe involuntary movements (one-sided ballism) is confirmed. All AEs will be reported and&#xD;
      categorized by investigators as definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely, or unrelated to the&#xD;
      device, subthalamotomy procedure, and/or Parkinson's disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: Secondary endpoints will include both comparison of baseline to 1 week&#xD;
      visit, 2-month visit and baseline to 4-month visit assessments for the following: • MDS-UPDRS&#xD;
      parts I, II, III, and IV • Levodopa equivalent medication usage (milligrams) • Patient and&#xD;
      Physician Global Impression of Change • Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Comfirmation from baseline until 4 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety outcome including incidence and severity of adverse events (AE/AEs) will be assessed at 4 months. The severity of any adverse events that will be reported by patients or that will be observed during the procedure or at 4 months post treatment will be assessed. A complication or worsening of a preexisting clinical condition after the procedure will be considered to be an adverse event regardless of causality.</description>

    <time_frame>Comparison between baseline, 1month, 2 months, and 4 months post treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The main efficacy assessment selects MDS-UPDRS Part I, II, III, and IV III of 11 items related to tremor and movement symptom variability, and difference in score from baseline before surgery to postoperative score. The degree of improvements of 11 items will be evaluated. The primary efficacy outcome will be the difference in the change from baseline to 4 months in the MDS-UPDRS motor score for the more affected body side in the off-medication state. The unabbreviated scale title, the minimum and maximum values, and whether higher scores mean a better or worse outcome will not be established for reporting outcome as efficacy.</description>

    <description>The CGIC rating is made on a 7-point Likert-type scale where change from baseline is rated as marked improvement (1), moderate improvement (2), minimal improvement (3), no change (4), minimal worsening (5), moderate worsening (6), and marked worsening (7). The phisicians will evaluate the change between baseline and 3 evaluation points after treatment. The unabbreviated scale title, the minimum and maximum values, and whether higher scores mean a better or worse outcome will not be established for reporting outcome as efficacy.</description>
