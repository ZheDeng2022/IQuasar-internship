  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Actinic cheilitis is a condition of the lower lip characterized by grayish-white areas of&#xD;
      discoloration and blunting of the demarcation between the cutaneous lip and the mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While many studies have compared treatment options for actinic cheilitis, there is still&#xD;
      significant debate over how to best manage this condition. The chosen treatment regimen must&#xD;
      result in complete remission while also preventing recurrence and malignant transformation.&#xD;
      Current treatment options are vast, including both non-surgical and surgical options. Common&#xD;
      topical therapies include 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, ingenol mebutate and diclofenac. More&#xD;
      recently, photodynamic therapy has been brought forward as a potential treatment modality.&#xD;
      From a surgical perspective, a vermilionectomy is typically the procedure of choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TCA is a popular topical treatment for treat fine rhytides, hyperpigmentation, photodamage,&#xD;
      and premalignant changes, such as actinic keratoses. Despite this, TCA is not commonly used&#xD;
      for actinic changes on the lips. Here, the investigators propose an expansion of the&#xD;
      application of TCA to be used in the treatment of actinic cheilitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a prospective cohort study of all patients with actinic cheilitis&#xD;
      presenting to the study institution, the Queen Elizabeth II Health Science Center in Halifax,&#xD;
      from March 1st 2021- March 1st 2023.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be consented to participate at the time of their initial consultation. They&#xD;
      will fill out the demographics form, a preliminary survey and have the required photographs&#xD;
      taken on that same day. A biopsy will be performed prior to treatment to establish the&#xD;
      histological grade of their actinic cheilitis based on the degree of dysplasia. After the&#xD;
      treatment is received, they will follow-up in 1 month for reassessment. At this point, a&#xD;
      second treatment will be offered if clinical remission has not been achieved. Patients will&#xD;
      continue TCA treatments at 1-month intervals until clinical remission is reached. Once&#xD;
      remission is achieved, they will fill out the post-treatment questionnaire and have their&#xD;
      second set of photos taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final follow-up will occur 6 months post remission. At this point patients will be assessed&#xD;
      for clinical recurrence. A third set of photos will be completed during this appointment.&#xD;

    <description>Identify patient satisfaction before and after TCA treatment using the Skindex 16 survey developed by the University of California. This survey looks at how bothered patients are by a skin condition, with a higher score representing a more severe condition. The survey will be completed before and after treatment and the improvement in the score will be analyzed. There are 16 questions, each with a max score of 6, making the total survey score out of 96 and a minimum score of 0. A higher score indicates a poor quality of life attributed to the described skin condition.</description>
