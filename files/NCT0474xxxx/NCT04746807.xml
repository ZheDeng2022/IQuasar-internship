  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease leading to the demyelination of the&#xD;
      central nervous system. Promoting physical activity has gathered attention as an effective&#xD;
      means to improve health-related quality of life and to mitigate symptoms such as fatigue and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms in individuals suffering from MS. However, persons suffering from MS&#xD;
      often experience difficulties in staying active. A comprehensive understanding of barriers to&#xD;
      staying physical active for persons with MS in Switzerland is currently lacking. Given the&#xD;
      importance of physical activity in the context of MS a detailed understanding of this matter&#xD;
      would be key for future research and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key challenge when studying physical activity in the context of MS is to obtain objective&#xD;
      and accurate measurements that are not prone to reporting bias. While accelerometer-based&#xD;
      measurements hold promise in this regard they are not convenient for routine implementation&#xD;
      in real-world environments. Initial research has identified consumer-grade wearables such as&#xD;
      Fitbits as a promising alternative whereby focusing on the main outcome average step count.&#xD;
      Given the rich detail of activity patterns that can be derived from such devices, research&#xD;
      has so far underutilized the available information that has the potential to provide more&#xD;
      comprehensive insight into this matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The present project aims to determine the common factors in real-life settings&#xD;
      limiting physical activity in persons with MS and the impact of these barriers on physical&#xD;
      activity. Further, the present study aims to provide precedence for future research&#xD;
      investigating physical activity in MS by examining the quality, reliability, internal&#xD;
      consistency, and validity of PA metrics derived from the wide-spread consumer-grade activity&#xD;
      tracker Fitbit in comparison to an accelerometer.&#xD;

    <description>Perceived Barriers to Physical Activity will be assessed by a modified version of the Barriers to Health Promoting Activities for Disabled Persons Scale. The original version of this instrument lists 18 barriers and asks participants to indicate &quot;how much each of these problems [the barriers] keeps you from participating in health-promoting activities.&quot; This scale has been previously modified to measure barriers to physical activity, instead asking participants to indicate &quot;how much each of these problems keeps you from participating in physical activity and exercise&quot;.</description>

More specifically, participants will be asked to answer the following questions:&#xD;
What kind of goals in terms of PA did you pursue this week?&#xD;
What prevented you this week from engaging in physical activities?&#xD;
What facilitated this week engaging in physical activities?&#xD;
What would have been helpful to increase PA?&#xD;
What was your experience with the activity trackers this week?</description>
