  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with SCI are at higher risk of obesity and chronic diseases, such as hypertension,&#xD;
      high cholesterol, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, than the general population.&#xD;
      Researchers currently lack data on factors that influence weight gain among people with SCI.&#xD;
      During this one-year observational study, study staff will enroll 60 individuals with SCI&#xD;
      while they are inpatients at Baylor Scott &amp; White Institute for Rehabilitation (BSWIR). Data&#xD;
      will be collected at 3 time periods (before discharge and 6 and 12 months after discharge) in&#xD;
      order to better understand factors that affect weight gain over the first 12 months following&#xD;
      discharge from inpatient rehabilitation, such as nutritional intake, environmental access,&#xD;
      psychosocial factors, energy requirements and risk factors for metabolic syndrome. These data&#xD;
      will be used to inform future interventions for people with SCI.&#xD;

        Study participants are people who have incurred a spinal cord injury within the previous 18&#xD;
        months prior to study enrollment who have been admitted to inpatient rehabilitation at&#xD;
        Baylor Scott &amp; White Institute for Rehabilitation in Dallas, TX. Participants must have or&#xD;
        be expected to regain enough arm/hand function to feed themselves independently and be&#xD;
        willing and able to complete physical measurements and surveys.&#xD;
