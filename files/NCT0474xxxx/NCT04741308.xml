    <textblock>
      Cancer patients and their primary caregivers are often subjected to considerable&#xD;
      psychological stress. CBT is considered as one of the effective methods to relieve stress.&#xD;
      CBT is effective in alleviating depression and anxiety, but the effect of CBT on cognitive&#xD;
      and immune function in patients with colorectal cancer and their primary caregivers remains&#xD;
      uninvestigated.&#xD;
