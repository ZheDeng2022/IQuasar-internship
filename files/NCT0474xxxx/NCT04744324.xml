      The purpose of this study is to administer intervention based on self-supporting care model&#xD;
      in home environment and to explore the effects of this intervention on stroke patients'&#xD;
      activities of daily living, movement, cognition, nutritional status, and quality of life.&#xD;

      Subjects will be randomized to intervention group and control group. The experiment is&#xD;
      designed as randomized cross-over control trial. The primary outcome included 8 measures:&#xD;
      Barthel Index-based Supplementary Scales, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure,&#xD;
      Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Balance Computerized Adaptive Testing, Mini Mental State&#xD;
      Examination-2nd edition, Mini Nutritional Assessment, Stroke Impact Scale, and Stroke&#xD;
      Self-Efficacy Questionnaire.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel Index -based Supplementary Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index-based Supplementary Scales assesses basic activities of daily living using three scales:actual performance, ability, and self-perceived difficulty. The score ranges the three scales (i.e., actual performance, ability, and self-perceived difficulty)is 0-20, 0-18, and 0-20, respectively. A higher score indicates better basic activities of daily living.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure is to measure occupational performance though three areas: self-care, productivity, and leisure. Patients define important activities and classify them with a score of one to 10. A higher score indicates better occupational performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale is to assess the sensorimotor impairment in individuals who have had stroke. The score ranges is 0 to 226. A higher score indicates better body function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance computerized adaptive testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Balance computerized adaptive testing is to assess balance ability.The score ranges is 0 to 10. A higher score indicates better balance ability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini Mental State Examination-2nd edition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini Mental State Examination-2nd edition is to assess cognitive functions. The score ranges is 0 to 90. A higher score indicates better cognitive functions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini Nutritional Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini Nutritional Assessment is a comprehensive nutritional assessment scale. The score range is 0 to 30 points. The higher the score, the lower the risk of malnutrition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Impact Scale is to assess health-related quality of life: emotion, communication, memory and thinking, and social role function. The score ranges is 59 to 295. A lower score indicates the quality of life less affected by stroke.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire is a self-report scale measuring self-efficacy judgments in specific domains of functioning post stroke. The score ranges is 0 to 130. A higher score indicates better self-efficacy.</description>
