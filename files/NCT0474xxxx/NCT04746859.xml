      The Building on Existing Tools To improvE cancer and chronic disease pRevention and screening&#xD;
      in primary care (BETTER) Program allows patients in primary care to have a dedicated visit&#xD;
      with a prevention practitioner to discuss chronic disease prevention and cancer screening. A&#xD;
      prevention practitioner is a health professional, working in primary care, who has received&#xD;
      additional training to discuss chronic disease prevention and screening and develop health&#xD;
      goals with patients through shared decision-making. Previous studies have shown that this&#xD;
      approach increases the number of prevention and screening actions completed by program&#xD;
      participants. However, maintenance of health behaviour changes is difficult without on-going&#xD;
      support. There is also some evidence that peer-delivered coaching can improve health outcomes&#xD;
      in community settings. As such, the BETTER Women program extends the BETTER program by&#xD;
      focusing on 45 to 60-year-old women and providing time-limited support for health behaviour&#xD;
      change through peer health coaches. Peer health coaches are volunteers - trained in&#xD;
      techniques to support health behaviour change - who support women to achieve their health&#xD;
      goals over a 6-month period. In this study, the investigators will explore whether patients&#xD;
      who participate in the BETTER Women program (the peer health coaching extension) are more&#xD;
      likely to increase the number of prevention and screening actions that they complete after&#xD;
      one year, compared to women who participate in the BETTER program but do not get peer health&#xD;
      coaching until one year later. The investigators will also examine the implementation of the&#xD;
      program to learn about factors that affect various aspects of the success and sustainability&#xD;
      of the program.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the BETTER program has been shown to successfully increase the number of preventive&#xD;
      care and screening actions completed by patient participants after six months, it is known&#xD;
      that it is difficult to maintain new health behaviours in the long-term. Unfortunately, it is&#xD;
      not feasible to fund health professionals to offer repeated follow-up visits over the time&#xD;
      needed to turn initial behaviour changes into long-term habits. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      are building upon the existing BETTER program by adding a peer health coaching extension that&#xD;
      will provide time-limited coaching for patients who want support as they work towards&#xD;
      achieving preventive health goals. This approach takes advantage of growing awareness of the&#xD;
      role of lay health coaches in improving and extending the quality and value of primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a three-site, pragmatic, wait-list-controlled, randomized, Type 1 hybrid&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation trial with blinded outcome collection after 12 months. One site&#xD;
      will be an urban, academic, hospital-based clinic; the second will be a clinic serving a&#xD;
      greater proportion of patients from rural areas; and the third site will be a suburban clinic&#xD;
      with a large South Asian population. Following receipt of the BETTER program (a single visit&#xD;
      with a prevention practitioner), investigators will invite women who are 40-65 years old to&#xD;
      receive behaviour change support for six months from a peer health coach (PHC). PHCs will do&#xD;
      a 24-hr training course, which includes special techniques to support health behaviour&#xD;
      change, before they are matched to a patient. At the suburban site, only South Asian PHCs&#xD;
      will be recruited and this work is being guided by a South Asian Community Advisory Council&#xD;
      made up of members of various community organizations in that region. Patients who enroll in&#xD;
      BETTER Women will be randomized to receive peer health coaching either immediately&#xD;
      (intervention group) or after a 12-month delay (wait-list control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of the program will be assessed by evaluating for each patient, how many of a&#xD;
      set of target chronic disease prevention and screening actions were completed at one year, in&#xD;
      comparison to baseline. Investigators will also assess whether patients achieved the health&#xD;
      goals that they set with their prevention practitioners, physiological markers of health, as&#xD;
      well as habits and behaviours related to diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol use.&#xD;
      These outcomes will be collected via electronic surveys administered at baseline, 3-, 6-, and&#xD;
      12-months post enrollment as well as through extraction of data from the patients' electronic&#xD;
      medical records and BETTER program documents. These outcomes will be compared between the two&#xD;
      groups of patients in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An embedded process evaluation will be conducted during the trial to examine the&#xD;
      implementation of the program. The process evaluation will include collection of program&#xD;
      data, electronic surveys administered to patients as well as qualitative interviews with&#xD;
      intervention group patients, peer health coaches and prevention practitioners. Investigators&#xD;
      will examine how acceptable the program was to patients; whether and why any adaptations were&#xD;
      made; how well the program was utilized; how well the PHCs delivered the intervention (e.g.,&#xD;
      what behaviour change techniques were used); how engaged patients and PHCs were with the&#xD;
      program; and mechanism(s) of action. Ultimately, investigators expect to gain an&#xD;
      understanding of the program's sustainability, acceptability, cost-effectiveness, and factors&#xD;
      that might impact future attempts at spread and scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators expect to see that women in the intervention group (i.e., those who had a PHC)&#xD;
      will complete more preventive and screening actions after one year. Investigators also expect&#xD;
      to see that women in the intervention group will make more progress on achieving health goals&#xD;
      and making lifestyle changes which reduce the risk of chronic diseases and cancers, that the&#xD;
      intervention will increase women's access to resources in their primary care clinics and&#xD;
      community, as well as improve the women's ability to maintain healthy behaviours.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is binary and defined as whether a patient increased the number of completed targeted behaviours from baseline to end of follow-up at 12 months. The targeted behaviours include the status (up to date or out of date) of three cancer screening tests (cervical, breast, colorectal) and the status (meeting evidence-based target or not) of four behavioural determinants for risk of cancer and chronic disease (diet, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity). If a patient meets at least one more target at 12 months than they met at baseline, their outcome will be considered positive.</description>
