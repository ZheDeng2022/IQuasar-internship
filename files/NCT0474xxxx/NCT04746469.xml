  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a part of UCLA Health's continued goal of improving patient care the investigators are&#xD;
      updating our mailing campaign for our FIT Kit colorectal cancer screening that the&#xD;
      investigators administer 2 times per year to include an automated phone call reminder to&#xD;
      patients who are overdue for average-risk colorectal cancer screening and enrolled in a&#xD;
      mailed FIT program. This will help the investigators evaluate if automated phone calls are&#xD;
      effective at improving compliance with CRC screening, in addition to mailed FIT and embedded&#xD;
      electronic health record (EHR) portal messages to patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UCLA Health has a biannual mailed FIT program designed to capture patients overdue for CRC&#xD;
      screening who are average-risk for CRC. With every campaign, the investigators attempt to&#xD;
      improve the return rates for patients receiving the FIT Kits. For the current campaign, all&#xD;
      patients enrolled will receive usual care and the investigators are delivering an automated&#xD;
      phone call to half the eligible patients reminding them to return their FIT kits and&#xD;
      prompting them to request a new kit if needed. The investigators will investigate if this&#xD;
      intervention increases the number of patients who complete the mailed Fit Kit or any type of&#xD;
      CRC screening over a 6-month follow up period. This quality improvement project will help the&#xD;
      investigators improve the processes of care for the patients, and community. If this phone&#xD;
      call is successful the investigators will likely expand it to the entire population in future&#xD;
      FIT Kit mailer campaigns. However, if it is not effective this will help the investigators&#xD;
      minimize the number of calls/interventions the investigators send to patients and will&#xD;
      hopefully allow for more useful outreach to patients in the future.&#xD;
