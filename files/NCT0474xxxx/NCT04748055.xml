  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the change from baseline in IL-1β (interleukin 1 beta) concentrations in the nasal&#xD;
      airway during acute asthma exacerbation, specifically to measure the degree of change and&#xD;
      identify the timing of peak IL-1β concentration. This information will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to estimate effect size and guide decisions about the optimal timing of&#xD;
      anakinra administration for the future study.&#xD;

      The study team will recruit 60 teens and young adults with persistent asthma who are at high&#xD;
      risk for future exacerbation from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC)&#xD;
      Children's Allergy and Asthma Center in Raleigh, NC. Participants will complete 13 study&#xD;
      visits: an initial in-person visit (the study team will make every attempt to coordinate this&#xD;
      visit with a scheduled clinic visit) and 12 monthly virtual follow up visits. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to use an at home spirometer once daily in the evening and will also complete&#xD;
      an electronic asthma survey each night. Participants will also be provided with a sensor that&#xD;
      tracks their rescue medication use throughout the study. Participants will undergo collection&#xD;
      of nasal epithelial lining fluid (NELF) at the baseline visit. During the 12 months of study,&#xD;
      participants will self-collect NELF samples if certain prespecified criteria for asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation are met. Samples will be analyzed for IL-1β, interleukin receptor antagonist&#xD;
      (IL-1RA) and other mediators associated with acute asthma exacerbation. Virtual follow up&#xD;
      visits using a video platform will occur monthly for 12 months. Participants will self-report&#xD;
      healthcare utilization and prescription for systemic corticosteroids. Spirometry and symptom&#xD;
      survey data will be matched to subject-reported asthma exacerbations. The study design is&#xD;
      adapted to minimize in-person visits, using web-based platforms for virtual visits and&#xD;
      self-collection of samples to prioritize safety during the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ages 12 to 21 years, inclusive, of both genders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physician diagnosis of persistent asthma or symptoms consistent with persistent asthma&#xD;
             based on expert guidelines for diagnosis and management of asthma (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of a controller therapy such as an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), ICS in&#xD;
             combination with long-acting beta agonist (LABA), or leukotriene receptor antagonist&#xD;
             (LTRA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of at least one exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS) in the&#xD;
             past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Access to a smartphone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Wireless internet access in the participant's home&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Access to a standard freezer in the home&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic corticosteroid-dependent asthma (i.e. people who take oral steroids such as&#xD;
             prednisone daily for asthma control). Use of other immunomodulator medications (such&#xD;
             as biologics for asthma like omalizumab, etc) is allowable so long as the participant&#xD;
             has been on a stable dose of the medication for at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants whose asthma is sufficiently severe that the participants routinely&#xD;
             require rescue albuterol multiple times a day for symptom relief (not including&#xD;
             pre-exercise albuterol use).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary disease other than asthma that in the opinion of investigators may affect&#xD;
             the interpretation of spirometry data, including but not limited to vocal cord&#xD;
             dysfunction, restrictive lung disease, or cystic fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to perform spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of spirometry-induced bronchoconstriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or nursing a baby. Due to the effect of hormonal changes of&#xD;
             pregnancy/lactation on airway inflammation, participants who are pregnant or nursing&#xD;
             will be excluded from study.&#xD;
