    <description>The demographic characteristics, physical characteristics such as age, height and body weight of the individuals included in the study and their education status will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnea Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after treatment (8 week)</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea will be assessed by the modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnea scale. Individuals will be asked to choose the statement that best describes their dyspnea level.&#xD;
Scoring in MMRC varies between 0-4 points. &quot;0 points&quot; means that there is no dyspnea; &quot;4 points&quot; indicates a perception of dyspnea during basic daily life activities such as dressing.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory Function Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after treatment( 8 week )</time_frame>
    <description>A spirometer will be used to evaluate the lung function of individuals. It will be expressed as a percentage of the expected values by age, height, body weight and gender.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after treatment (8 week)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). SGRQ is a health-related quality of life questionnaire that questions a total of 50 items under 3 main components: symptoms (8 items), activity (16 items) and effects of disease (26 items). The symptoms component includes the frequency and duration of symptoms such as cough, sputum, shortness of breath, wheezing.&#xD;
The activity component relates to physical activities that are restricted due to shortness of breath. It includes factors such as the effects component of the disease, the drugs used and its side effects, the individual's expectations for health and the discomfort they face in daily life. The total score is between 0-100. The higher the score, the lower the quality of life</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Functional Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after treatment (8 week)</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals' functional capacity will be evaluated with the six-minute walking test (6MWT). During the 6MWT, individuals are asked to walk in a straight corridor of 30 meters as fast as possible, at their own walking pace in standard directions.&#xD;
At the end of the test, the walking distance is recorded in meters.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after treatment (8 week)</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) will be used to evaluate the sleep quality of the individuals participating in our study before and after the 8-week study period.&#xD;
PSQI is a test that plays a role in determining sleep quality and sleep-related disorders in the last month. It is a scale consisting of 19 self-report items, a total of 24 questions with a score range of 0-21, and the remaining five questions must be answered by a roommate or a spouse. It is a test that evaluates a wide variety of areas related to sleep quality, including components, sleep time, delays in falling asleep, the frequency and severity of sleep-related problems, and the impact of poor sleep on an individual's work.</description>
