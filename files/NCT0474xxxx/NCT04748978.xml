      BACKGROUND Leiomyomas or uterine fibroids are benign lesions that can cause infertility,&#xD;
      uterine bleeding (hypermenorrhea, metrorrhagia, and menometrorrhagia), resulting in anemia,&#xD;
      disorders in urinary tract function and symptoms of abdominal pressure, chronic pelvic pain,&#xD;
      and/or dysmenorrhea. Often doctors decide to remove the myoma or uterus to resolve the&#xD;
      symptoms. Myomas or uterine fibroids occur in 25 to 44% of women during reproductive age.&#xD;
      Myomas are more common in the fourth and fifth decade of life when their incidence can reach&#xD;
      almost 70% in Caucasian women and over 80% in African origin women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Submucosal fibroids are classified according to their development within the endometrial&#xD;
      cavity in G0: intracavitary pedunculate fibroids G1 : fibromas whose intramural development&#xD;
      is less than 50%. G2 : fibromas whose intramural development is greater than or equal to 50%.&#xD;
      Resectoscope myomectomy for G2 myomas is a difficult procedure that should only be performed&#xD;
      by surgeons experienced in hysteroscopy. In fact, resectoscope hysteroscopy is associated&#xD;
      with a significant risk of complications that is proportional to the degree of intramural&#xD;
      development of the myoma. Furthermore, the greater the myoma and its intramural development,&#xD;
      the more likely the procedure will need to be divided into several surgical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of these problems, several myolysis techniques have developed in which myomas are&#xD;
      coagulated rather than removed using electrical energy or laser (thermomyolysis), liquid&#xD;
      nitrogen (cryomyolysis), or recently even ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myolysis was performed for the first time by Mergui in France in 1987 using laser YAG to&#xD;
      create holes in the myomas resulting in necrosis and narrowing. Later Leukens and Gallinat,&#xD;
      in 1993, used bipolar needles from 1 to 3 cm to perform myolysis; their technique was similar&#xD;
      to Mergui's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2009 Bettocchi et al. evaluated the efficacy of a procedure to prepare submucosal fibromas&#xD;
      with partially intramural development (G1 and G2) &gt;1.5 cm in an outpatient setting (OPPIuM)&#xD;
      to facilitate subsequent resectoscope hysteroscopic removal with the patient under general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that if the pseudocapsule is removed, the myoma is pushed into the uterine&#xD;
      cavity by myometrial contractions. The optimum technique, performed at the time of office&#xD;
      hysteroscopy, consisted of incision of the endometrial mucosa and the pseudocapsule covering&#xD;
      the myoma, using 5Fr scissors or Versapoint Twizzle bipolar electrode (Gynecare; Ethicon&#xD;
      Inc., Somerville, NJ) until the precise identification of the contact surface between the&#xD;
      myoma and the pseudocapsule itself. This procedure was intended to facilitate the intramural&#xD;
      portion of the myoma protrusion into the cavity during subsequent menstrual cycles and&#xD;
      facilitate subsequent resectoscope myomectomy under general anesthesia. Subsequently, in 2013&#xD;
      Haimovich et al. evaluated the feasibility of the same technique using diode laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the results obtained in terms of controlled fibroma ablation, the investigators&#xD;
      decided to combine the OPPIuM technique and myolysis with a new diode laser: DWLS. The&#xD;
      combination of two wavelengths, 980 nm, and 1470 nm, gives a simultaneous absorption in H2O&#xD;
      and hemoglobin with excellent hemostasis, cutting, and vaporization capacity, as previously&#xD;
      demonstrated in laparoscopic and hysteroscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The study aims to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      OPPIuM technique combined with myolysis using the DWLS diode laser. In addition, to evaluate&#xD;
      the reduction of myoma volume and the extent of uterine bleeding with myolysis to improve&#xD;
      women's quality of life and avoid resectoscope hysteroscopy for a G2 MIOMA, which may lead to&#xD;
      an increase in intraoperative surgical risks and long-term complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED BENEFITS Compared to the traditional technique (resectoscope hysteroscopic&#xD;
      treatment) of G2 myomas, this approach could make the treatment simpler, faster, and in some&#xD;
      cases unnecessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to the OPPIuM technique with the bipolar electrode and subsequent resectoscope&#xD;
      hysteroscopic treatment, the treatment with diode laser could:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. obtaining the same result and in this case, a subsequent evaluation of comparison&#xD;
           between the costs would be useful to evaluate the most suitable instrumentation from a&#xD;
           health economics point of view;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. could obtain a more important clinical result on the patient's symptomatology and volume&#xD;
           reduction of myoma, thanks to the well-known properties of tissue vaporization of laser&#xD;
           energy, which could avoid the traditional resectoscope hysteroscopic treatment in the&#xD;
           operating room burdened with direct health costs and indirect and potential&#xD;
           intra-operative or late complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION STRATEGY AND INSTRUMENTS The investigators plan to recruit 35 patients who are&#xD;
      symptomatic but against hysterectomy and wish to keep the uterus with fibroids ≤ 3 G2. The&#xD;
      subjects will be evaluated at the Endometriosis/Pelvic Pain Clinic of the Complex Operating&#xD;
      Unit of Gynaecology of the University Hospital of Monserrato and in the other centers&#xD;
      involved in the study. All patients will perform a transvaginal examination and ultrasound to&#xD;
      provide accurate information on the submucosal myoma characteristics to be operated on and&#xD;
      exclude other coexisting uterine or adjunct diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A validated PBAC questionnaire will be filled in to assess the extent of uterine bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before carrying out the in vivo test on the enrolled patients, an ex vivo test will be&#xD;
      performed on myomas collected during a hysterectomy to evaluate which settings and wave&#xD;
      powers are the best to achieve our goal for the myolysis step (the possible decrease in myoma&#xD;
      volume).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An office hysteroscopy will be performed in the early proliferative menstrual phase. After a&#xD;
      biopsy of the lesion and histological examination, the OPPIuM technique combined with&#xD;
      myolysis with the DWLS diode laser using the Myolysis fiber will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 1 or 2 menstrual cycles, a transvaginal ultrasound will be performed in the early&#xD;
      proliferative phase to assess the volumetric reduction of myoma (following the myolysis). The&#xD;
      PBAC questionnaire will be re-administered to assess the clinical response and the extent of&#xD;
      uterine bleeding (following the combined technique), and one of the following 3 options will&#xD;
      be decided with the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. do not re-intervene due to a reduction/disappearance of the lesion and/or resolution of&#xD;
           the symptomatology&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. perform a second outpatient hysteroscopy to assess the protrusion in the endometrial&#xD;
           cavity of the intramural portion of the myoma (following OPPIUM technique) and perform a&#xD;
           possible outpatient laser myomectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. program a laser/resettoscopic myomectomy in narcosis. The benefits that the patient can&#xD;
           receive derive from the possibility of being able to avoid, thanks to a simple&#xD;
           outpatient intervention, the intervention of resectoscope hysteroscopy in narcosis for&#xD;
           MIOMA G2, which would lead to increase the intraoperative risks of hemorrhage, cervical&#xD;
           trauma, gas embolism, uterine perforation, syndrome from intravasation and late&#xD;
           complications such as postoperative intrauterine adhesions and uterine rupture during&#xD;
           pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks associated with the OPPIuM-MYOLYSIS outpatient procedure are, albeit to a very&#xD;
      reduced extent compared to resectoscope hysteroscopy, bleeding, and uterine perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the OPPIuM-MYOLYS technique, complications related to cervical trauma would be avoided&#xD;
      (because the cervical canal does not dilate, since the Bettocchi hysteroscope is 4 mm of a&#xD;
      much smaller diameter than the resectoscope) and above all, the intravasation syndrome&#xD;
      (because of the physiological saline solution at low pressure and for a short time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should a narcotic resectoscope hysteroscopy be scheduled due to the first OPPIuM-MYOLYS&#xD;
      treatment's failure, the latter will allow surgeons to perform a resectoscope hysteroscopic&#xD;
      myomectomy in less than 30 minutes on average, with reduced risks associated with prolonged&#xD;
      anesthesia and intravasation syndrome. Furthermore, by favoring the expulsion of MIOMA G2&#xD;
      into the cavity (thus making it G0 or G1), it will be mainly intracavitary lesions, and&#xD;
      surgeons will remove these lesions in a single surgical step without intraoperative&#xD;
      complications such as uterine perforation, fluid overload, or intraoperative or postoperative&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION 35 patients aged between 18 and 48 years with clinical and/or ultrasound diagnosis&#xD;
      of uterine fibromatosis, belonging to the Endometriosis/Pelvic Chronic Pain Centre of the&#xD;
      Complex Operating Unit of Gynecology of the University Polyclinic of Monserrato and other&#xD;
      centers involved in the study. To be eligible for inclusion, patients with ultrasound and&#xD;
      hysteroscopic diagnosis of a single submucosal myoma, partially intramural (G1 or G2) ≤ 3 cm,&#xD;
      must present symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding and pelvic pain, for which surgical&#xD;
      treatment was scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The data will be tabulated on a specific database and analyzed using&#xD;
      specific software. A descriptive output will be created, and the comparison between variables&#xD;
      will be made through parametric and non-parametric tests with a level of significance of 95%.&#xD;
      The IBM SPSS Statistics software will be used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
