  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to help individuals cope with their current depressive symptoms by&#xD;
      providing them access to a 4-week online Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy: Be Mindful.&#xD;
      Research has shown that completion of the Be Mindful intervention can reduce depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in a community sample, and this study aims to evaluate if it can also help reduce&#xD;
      depressive symptoms in individuals with a confirmed history of depression. Participants will&#xD;
      either receive the intervention at the start of the study or four months after the start of&#xD;
      the study (i.e., at 3-month follow-up), which will allow research staff to assess if&#xD;
      reductions in depression are due to the intervention or something else. Research staff will&#xD;
      also evaluate if the reduction in depressive symptoms lasts over the three months following&#xD;
      intervention, and will investigate possible reasons for the change in depression (i.e., why&#xD;
      the intervention produces change).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participant outcome variables will be assessed weekly for the first month after baseline.&#xD;
      This will include the primary dependent variable (i.e., depressive symptoms), but will also&#xD;
      include variables that will be explored as potential mechanisms of change (i.e., mindfulness,&#xD;
      decentering, rumination, worry, self-compassion, and dysfunctional attitudes). The final&#xD;
      weekly assessment will represent the Post-Intervention assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief follow-up assessments of the primary dependent variable will be given 1-month and&#xD;
      2-months after the final weekly questionnaire. There will be a 3-month assessment that&#xD;
      measures potential mechanisms of change in addition to the primary dependent variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 3-month follow-up, the Waitlist Control condition will be given access to the&#xD;
      intervention. All participants (i.e., in both conditions) will be asked to complete another&#xD;
      month of weekly questionnaires. These questionnaires will be identical to the first set of&#xD;
      weekly questionnaires, and will allow mechanisms of change to be evaluated in the Waitlist&#xD;
      Control condition.&#xD;

    <description>The online 4-week Be Mindful intervention was designed to follow the same outline as typical in-person 8-week MBCT courses. Week 1 and Week 2 introduce the topic of mindfulness and encourage its daily use, whereas Week 3 and Week 4 teach the individual to decenter from thoughts and utilize mindfulness when coping with stressors. Each week focuses on a separate mindfulness topic, which is initially presented to the individual in a short (under 5 minute) video containing didactic information and an overview of the experiential activities that will be introduced in subsequent videos. The intervention is provided entirely through audio, video, and text provided on the Be Mindful website (BeMindfulOnline.com).</description>
