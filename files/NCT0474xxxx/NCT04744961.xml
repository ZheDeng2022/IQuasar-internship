  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves surveying two matched groups of patients that underwent dermatologic&#xD;
      surgery at our department. One group had a documented surgical site infection and the other&#xD;
      didn't. All patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire in which they assess the&#xD;
      physical appearance of their scars and its psychosocial impact. Results will be compared&#xD;
      between the groups.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      65 patients with a documented surgical site infection will be compared to 65 patients with&#xD;
      normal wound healing in terms of patient reported outcome regarding scar physical appearance&#xD;
      and psychosocial impact using SCAR-Q questionnaire.&#xD;

    <description>Scar-Q (http://qportfolio.org/scar-q/) is a patient reported outcome instrument in which scars will be assessed in terms of scar appearance and psychosocial impact. Scores will range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Scores will be compared between the two groups using either parametric or non-parametric tests depending on the distribution of the results.</description>
