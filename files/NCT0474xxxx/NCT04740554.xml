      A cross-sectional study was carried out, in which 40 boys, aged 11 to 18 years, were&#xD;
      evaluated. The recruitment of groups was carried out at the neuromuscular disease outpatient&#xD;
      clinic of the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP). The recruited individuals were&#xD;
      divided into 4 groups, namely: DMD that used deflazacort (DMD-D); DMD that used&#xD;
      Prednisone/Prednisolone (DMD-P); DMD Control with no corticoid use (DMD-C) and Controls with&#xD;
      typical development (CTD). The protocol was applied during the evaluation that was carried&#xD;
      out at outpatient follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the functionality of each patient, the Vignos scales were used to characterize the&#xD;
      sample and the Motor Function Measure (MFM) for association with HRV indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All heart rate records were performed using a cardiofrequencymeter (V800, Polar). After&#xD;
      placing the brace and monitor, the individuals were placed in the supine position and&#xD;
      remained at rest spontaneously breathing for 25 minutes. For HRV analysis, indexes obtained&#xD;
      by linear methods, in the domain of time and frequency, and non-linear methods were used.&#xD;

      A cross-sectional study was carried out, in which 40 boys, aged 11 to 18 years, were&#xD;
      evaluated. The recruitment of groups was carried out at the neuromuscular disease outpatient&#xD;
      clinic of the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP). The recruited individuals were&#xD;
      divided into 4 groups, namely: DMD that used deflazacort (DMD-D) with n=11; DMD that used&#xD;
      Prednisone/Prednisolone (DMD-P), with n=9; DMD Control with no corticoid use (DMD-C), and&#xD;
      n=10 and Controls with typical development (CTD) with n=10. The protocol was applied during&#xD;
      the evaluation that was carried out at outpatient follow-up visits. Anthropometry was&#xD;
      analyzed in 4 groups and functionality was assessed in 3 groups with DMD. To assess the&#xD;
      functionality of each patient, the Vignos scales were used to characterize the sample and the&#xD;
      Motor Function Measure (MFM) for association with HRV indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, the resting ECG was analyzed to verify the existence of sinus rhythm and to&#xD;
      exclude individuals with arrhythmias and blocks. The measurements at rest were performed&#xD;
      immediately before and after the HRV assessment, including systolic (SBP) and diastolic&#xD;
      (DBP), heart rate (HR), Respiratory Rate (RF - blood pressure) to ensure that at the&#xD;
      beginning and at the end of the collection FR remains between 9 - 24rpm, in the range of 0.15&#xD;
      - 0.40Hz) and partial oxygen saturation (SO2). Heart rate was recorded by the cardiofrequency&#xD;
      meter (RS800CX, Polar). And the partial oxygen saturation by means of a digital oximeter&#xD;
      (DX2010, Dixtal) connected to the participant's index finger or hallux, through a sensor of&#xD;
      age-appropriate size, in room air. Hemoglobin saturation by oxygen was recorded after the&#xD;
      first minute of stabilization, as the value that remains most constant during the second&#xD;
      minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All heart rate records were performed using a cardiofrequencymeter (V800, Polar). After&#xD;
      placing the brace and monitor, the individuals were placed in the supine position and&#xD;
      remained at rest spontaneously breathing for 25 minutes. For HRV analysis, indexes obtained&#xD;
      by linear methods, in the domain of time and frequency, and non-linear methods were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the time domain, for linear analyses, each normal RR interval (sinus beats) was verified&#xD;
      during a certain time interval and, using statistical and non-linear methods, the translating&#xD;
      indexes of fluctuations in the duration of the cardiac cycles were calculated. With this, the&#xD;
      indices expressed in ms were obtained: SDNN (Standard deviation of the normal RR intervals&#xD;
      recorded in a time interval); rMSSD (square root of the mean of the square of the differences&#xD;
      between adjacent normal RR intervals in a time interval).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the frequency domain, the spectral power density is more used, mainly when treating&#xD;
      individuals in resting conditions. This analysis divides HRV into fundamental oscillatory&#xD;
      components, which were used the main: High Frequency normalized unite (HFnu) component and&#xD;
      Low Frequency normalized unite (LFnu) component. O algoritmo utilizado para a análise&#xD;
      espectral foi a transformada rápida de Fourier - FFT (janela de 256 s com 50% de overlap).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the nonlinear methods used for HRV analysis, we can mention the Detrended Fluctuations&#xD;
      Analysis (DFA), Visual Recurrence Analysis (VRA) and symbolic analysis (SA), the three of&#xD;
      which were verified in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DFA is used to quantify the fractal property of RR interval time series, being used to detect&#xD;
      possible abnormalities present in a subject, based on α coefficients. For this, short memory&#xD;
      parameters α1, which corresponds to a period of 4 to 11 beats, and long memory α2, which&#xD;
      corresponds to the period from 64 to 1024 beats, were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VRA is used to study the time dependence of a series, that is, in the study of&#xD;
      stationarity35. The recurrence graph makes it possible to visualize the behavior of&#xD;
      trajectories in the phase space and, in addition, to show the times in which a state of a&#xD;
      dynamic system is repeated, besides these factors can be confirmed regarding the quantitative&#xD;
      analysis of this, wich presents such indices: Mean, SD, PerRec, PerDet, PerLam, TrapTim,&#xD;
      Ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the symbolic analysis is based on the quantification of the information&#xD;
      carried in a time series, in the transformation of the previously selected iRRs into integers&#xD;
      from zero to six, from which sequences of 3 symbols (symbolic patterns) are constructed. For&#xD;
      this, all possible patterns will be grouped according to the number and type of variations&#xD;
      between the symbols, shown subsequently. The patterns were (1) patterns, without variation&#xD;
      (0V), three identical symbols; (2) patterns with a variation (1V), that is, two subsequent&#xD;
      symbols that are the same and a different one; (3) patterns with two similar variations (2LV)&#xD;
      that is, the three symbols form a ramp; (4) patterns with two different variations (2ULV),&#xD;
      that is, the three symbols form a peak or a valley.&#xD;
