    <textblock>
      This 2-stage study will evaluate participants with locally advanced, unresectable, or&#xD;
      metastatic HER2-overexpressing colorectal cancer (CRC) (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or IHC&#xD;
      2+/ in situ hybridization [ISH]+) of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 (BRAF)&#xD;
      wild-type and either rat sarcoma viral oncogenes homologue (RAS) wild-type or mutant tumor&#xD;
      type, previously treated with standard therapy. In the first stage, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 with 2 doses of T-DXd. After Stage 1 enrollment is complete, all further&#xD;
      eligible participants will be registered to T-DXd administered IV in Stage 2. Participants&#xD;
      will receive the assigned dose of T-DXd until progression of disease or the participant meets&#xD;
      one of the discontinuation criteria.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months after the last participant is registered or later</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions assessing global health-related quality of life, five aspects of subject functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and six single-items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. Higher scores for functioning scales and global health status indicate a better level of functioning while higher scores on the symptom and single-item scales indicate a higher level of symptoms.</description>
