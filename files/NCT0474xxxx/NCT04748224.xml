  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is considered one of the major problems after abdominal operations, so&#xD;
      proper pain control is one of the main issues in clinical practice. Cesarean section (CS.) is&#xD;
      one of the most common abdominal surgeries and the use of CS. worldwide has increased to&#xD;
      unprecedented levels. Effective postoperative analgesia enhances early recovery of the&#xD;
      delivered mother, early ambulation, breast feeding and decreases the risk of postoperative&#xD;
      thromboembolism. Therefore, Opioids are prescribed routinely for postoperative pain control,&#xD;
      but they have many adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, excessive&#xD;
      sedation, dizziness, respiratory depression, and addiction, so it is important to practice&#xD;
      alternative opioid sparing analgesic approaches. Recently, QL block is considered one of the&#xD;
      perioperative pain management techniques used in patients undergoing various pelvi-abdominal&#xD;
      surgeries. Quadratus Lumborum block inhibits both pain components (somatic and visceral) as a&#xD;
      result of local anesthetic spread to the paravertebral spaceA study has been published&#xD;
      comparing the analgesic efficacy between QLB and TAP block after cesarean section and proved&#xD;
      that QL block II is more effective than TAP Block regarding pain relief and duration of&#xD;
      action after CS. Also, Many studies have been published and prove that Combination of&#xD;
      adjuvants like (fentanyl, clonidine and MgSo4,etc.) to local anesthetics agents helps in&#xD;
      prolonging the analgesic effect and decrease 24hours opiate consumption.one of these&#xD;
      adjuvants which used extensively in the regional techniques is dexmedetomidine, which is a&#xD;
      selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. The optimal dosage of dexmedetomidine to be added to&#xD;
      local anesthetics still remains unclear, but in other studies the dose of 0.5 μg/kg is widely&#xD;
      used with no postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      in this double blinded randomized controlled trial, the investigators compare the analgesic&#xD;
      efficacy of adding dexmedetomidine to local anesthetic in quadratus lumborum block and their&#xD;
      role in reduction postoperative opioid consumption after cesarean section&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a computer-generated randomization schedule, fifty patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      into two equal groups: group A (bupivacaine only; n=25) and group B (bupivacaine plus&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine; n=25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants, investigators, care providers and outcome assessors will be blinded to the&#xD;
      study group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day Prior to surgery, all patients will have pre anesthesia check-up with routine and&#xD;
      subjective investigations and explained about the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ranging from&#xD;
      0-10 (0 indicating no pain and 10 for severe intractable pain) The patients will be pre&#xD;
      medicated by 40mg oral pantoprazole at night and in the morning of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival to the operating room, patients will be monitored by peripheral pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      five-lead electrocardiogram and non-invasive blood pressure monitor. Two 18-gauge intravenous&#xD;
      cannulae will be inserted in the nondominant arm and 1500 ml crystalloid will be infused as&#xD;
      acoload plus ephedrine infusion 4mg/min. to prevent post spinal hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random allocation of patients into one of two groups using concealed closed envelope method,&#xD;
      the patients' envelope which contain the number of group will be opened and recorded in the&#xD;
      data collection sheet as a number of group because the data collector will be blinded to the&#xD;
      intervention on the patient, only the anesthetist knows each number is referring to which&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anesthesia will be performed with the patient in the sitting position at the level of&#xD;
      L2 to 3 or L3 to 4 intervertebral spaces using a 25-gauge Quincke Bevel type needle&#xD;
      (Spinocan®, Braun Melsungen AG,Germany) with 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine(AstraZeneca&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, UK) and 25μ g of fentanyl. Patients will be placed in the supine position&#xD;
      with left uterine displacement and a face-mask will be applied to deliver oxygen at rate of 6&#xD;
      L/minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five minutes after spinal injection, Spinal anesthesia level will be assessed by loss of cold&#xD;
      (ice cube) and touch (blunt pin) discrimination and will be considered successful if a&#xD;
      bilateral sensory blockade to T4-T6 is established. Anesthesia and surgical management will&#xD;
      be performed in the usual manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery, all patients will receive 1 gm of intravenous paracetamol. After the&#xD;
      abdomen will be cleaned with surgical solution, covering the wound and while the patient is&#xD;
      still fully monitored, the patient will be placed in the lateral decubitus position and the&#xD;
      QLB will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convex (5-8 MHz) ultrasound probe (Shenzhen Mindray BIO-Medical Electronics, Model: DP-20,&#xD;
      China) with a protective sheath will be used after imaging depth and gain is adjusted. The&#xD;
      procedure will be done under complete aseptic condition (facemask, gown, and gloves) after&#xD;
      cleaning of the abdominal skin with antiseptic solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probe will be placed in the mid axillary line cranially to the iliac crest to identify&#xD;
      the three muscles of the anterior abdominal wall (transversus abdominis, internal oblique,&#xD;
      and external oblique). Then, scan dorsally keeping the transverse orientation until observing&#xD;
      that the transversus abdominus muscle became aponeurotic, and this aponeurosis will be&#xD;
      followed until the QL muscle is clearly visualized with its attachment to the lateral edge of&#xD;
      the transverse process of the L2 vertebral body and visualize the thoracolumbar fascia at the&#xD;
      lateral edge of the QL muscle , followed by recognition of Shamrock pattern by viewing psoas&#xD;
      major muscle (PM) anteriorly, the erector spinae muscle (ESM) posteriorly and the QL muscle&#xD;
      adherent to the apex of the transverse process (trifoliate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimuplex® A 21G 100-mm needle (B. BRAUN, Melsungen AG, Germany) will be inserted in plane&#xD;
      under real time US guidance from anterolateral to posteromedial direction via the abdominal&#xD;
      wall. Two milliliters of 0.9% saline will be injected to visualize the solution spread (hydro&#xD;
      dissection) to determine the optimal point of injection over the lumbar interfacial triangle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A will be injected with 20 ml of 0. 25% bupivacaine in each side. (14) Group B will be&#xD;
      injected with 20 ml of 0. 25% bupivacaine in each side added to it dexmedetomidine 0.5 μg/kg;&#xD;
      (Precedex 100 μg/ml (Hospira, inc, lake forest, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be transferred to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) and discharged from PACU&#xD;
      when fully conscious, hemodynamically stable and pain free.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive IV paracetamol 1gm every 8 hours. As a rescue analgesic, IV&#xD;
      morphine (0.05 mg/kg) will be given when Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) &gt; 3, maximum dose of&#xD;
      morphine will be given 30 mg per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the following data will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total morphine consumption at predetermined time intervals (4, 8, 12, and 24) hrs. after&#xD;
           surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ranging from 0-10 (0 indicating no pain and 10 for severe&#xD;
           intractable pain) will be recorded and compared at 4,8,12, and 24h after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of post-operative complications as nausea, vomiting or abdominal distension&#xD;
           will also be recorded.&#xD;
