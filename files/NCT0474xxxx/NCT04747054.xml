    <time_frame>From randomization to death from any cause, up to 5 years.</time_frame>

    <measure>Quality of life questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials. The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Questionnaire - Head &amp; Neck Cancer Module (QLQ-H&amp;N35)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The head &amp; neck cancer module is a 35-item questionnaire designed for use among a wide range of patients with head &amp; neck cancer, varying in disease stage and treatment modality. It includes 7 multi-item scales that assess pain (4 items), swallowing (4 items), senses (2 items), speech (3 items), social eating (4 items), social contact (5 items), and sexuality (2 items). There are also 11 single items. Using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;not at all&quot;, 2 = &quot;a little&quot;, 3 = &quot;quite a bit&quot;, and 4 = &quot;very much&quot;), patients indicate the degree to which they have experienced symptoms. For all items and scales, high scores indicate more problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Objective response rate is defined as the presence of a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) observed at week 18. The investigator will evaluate the objective response using RECIST v1.1.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Loco-regional progression</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to loco-regional progression, up to 5 years.</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Distant progression</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to distant progression, up to 5 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Distant progression is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented distant disease progression evaluated by RECIST v1.1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival 2 (PFS2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years after randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival 2 is defined as time from randomization to a second tumor progression (according to RECIST V1.1) on next-line treatment (given after a first progression) or death from any cause. Patients who did not have a progression after the initial treatment are counted as an event at the time of death if they died whatever the cause of death or are censored at the time of last news if they are alive. Patients who had a progression after the initial treatment are counted as an event when they progressed again under or after the treatment of the first progression (if they start a new treatment, i.e. a third treatment, they are also counted as an event) or when they died whatever the cause of death or they are censored at the time of last news if they are alive without new progression after the first progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Treatment Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout study completion, up to 5 years.</time_frame>
    <description>The tolerance and safety will be evaluated by toxicity (acute [&lt;1 months after the end of pembrolizumab] and late [≥1 month after the end of pembrolizumab]), assessed using the Common terminology criteria for adverse events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0).</description>
