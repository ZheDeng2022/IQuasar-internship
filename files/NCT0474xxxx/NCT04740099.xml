  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among people at risk of opioid overdose and receiving care in an academic emergency&#xD;
      department, family practice, opioid substitution clinic or general inpatient units, does&#xD;
      brief opioid overdose resuscitation training and naloxone distribution reduce resuscitation&#xD;
      failures in a simulated overdose even, in comparison with standard-of-care referral to a&#xD;
      local OEND program, within 14 days post-intervention? Can an integrated participant&#xD;
      recruitment and retention strategy recruit approximately 28 eligible participants within 4&#xD;
      weeks and maintain less than 50% attrition rates in the context of a randomized trial on&#xD;
      point-of-care OEND and simulated overdose resuscitation performance in family practice,&#xD;
      emergency department, and addictions settings?&#xD;

    <description>The questionnaires were developed for the Toronto Public Health OEND program evaluation using data points from other overdose education and naloxone distribution programs and from the validated Opioid Overdose Knowledge and Attitudes Scales (OOKS and OOAS). We also included relevant questions from a national survey of injection drug users (ITRACK, Health Canada) and the CAMH Monitor conducted by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). The questionnaire items include:&#xD;
Demographics: age, gender, ethnicity, housing status, and neighbourhood&#xD;
Prescription medications&#xD;
Opioid and non-opioid drug use in past 4 weeks: drug, amount, route, frequency&#xD;
Drug use setting: where and with whom opioids were used&#xD;
Periods of abstinence&#xD;
Use of prevention strategies, and speaking to others about overdose or overdose response&#xD;
Knowledge of overdose and naloxone use&#xD;
Status of naloxone kit&#xD;
Willingness and confidence to respond to overdose</description>
