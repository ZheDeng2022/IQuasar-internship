  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Appropriate gestational weight gain (GWG) is a key factor in balancing maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      needs of nourishment and health, which is especially important in women with gestational&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, there are no specific guidelines for GWG in Chinese&#xD;
      pregnant women and even for GDM pregnant women.This project intends to fill in the gaps of&#xD;
      this field through multi-center large sample prospective cohort study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inappropriate gestational weight gain (GWG) is an important risk factor affecting adverse&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes. However, the current guidelines for GWG are based on American population&#xD;
      and may not apply to pregnant women in China, especially for those with gestational diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (GDM) who have high risk factors. The big gaps in academic-related fields need to be&#xD;
      filled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research group has previously found the heterogeneous relationships between GWG and&#xD;
      adverse outcomes in GDM women with different abnormal glucose metabolism. Therefore, based on&#xD;
      the principles of precision medicine, this project intends to establish for the first time&#xD;
      the GWG standard for Chinese pregnant women to optimize the GWG management through a&#xD;
      multicenter prospective cohort study. At the same time, specific GWG guidelines applicable to&#xD;
      GDM women with different glucose metabolism abnormalities were innovatively constructed. Our&#xD;
      study will provide strong evidence for stratified management and precise intervention of GDM&#xD;
      pregnant women, which is of great significance to ensure health of both mothers and their&#xD;
      offspring.&#xD;
