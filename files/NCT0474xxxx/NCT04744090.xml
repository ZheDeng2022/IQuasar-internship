      -  Mild cases of ARDS will be included in a two-arm protocol, to receive 500 mcg of&#xD;
           roflumilast daily up to 28 days (FDA approved dose for COPD) plus standard of care&#xD;
           versus standard of care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 76 hospitalized patients with ARDS will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible patients will be randomized at ratio of (1:1) to receive either roflumilast&#xD;
           plus standard of care or standard of care alone.&#xD;

      • Methodology in details:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent will be obtained from included participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild cases of ARDS will be included in a two-arm protocol, to receive 500 mcg of&#xD;
           roflumilast daily up to 28 days (FDA approved dose for COPD) plus standard of care&#xD;
           versus standard of care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 76 hospitalized patients with ARDS will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible patients will be randomized at ratio of (1:1) to receive either roflumilast&#xD;
           plus standard of care or standard of care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be in 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks of different sizes. Random.org&#xD;
      website will be used for random selection of a sequence of blocks. The latter will be used to&#xD;
      generate a randomized list which will be generated and stored by a third party independent of&#xD;
      the study team. For allocation concealment, the list will be used to make sequentially&#xD;
      numbered sealed opaque envelopes, each containing the sequential randomization number and&#xD;
      allocation of subsequent cases. Envelopes will be handed to the study team member responsible&#xD;
      for medication preparation. Each envelope will be opened only after:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening for eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obtaining consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recording baseline characters The treatment allocation dictated in the envelope will be&#xD;
           documented in the case record form and will be subject to audit to assure correct&#xD;
           randomization according to the original list.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug: Roflumilast&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Roflumilast 500 mcg daily for up to 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Total follow up time will be 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Proinflammatory parameters will be assessed at baseline, day 7, day 14, and at the end&#xD;
           of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Roflumilast will be combined with standard of care for ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. During hospitalization, clinical and laboratory data will be recorded daily in the&#xD;
           medical history of the patient and in data collection table of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. During hospitalization, adverse drug reaction will be monitored clinically and by&#xD;
           laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. In case of an adverse effect or a need to discontinue the treatment, roflumilast should&#xD;
           be suspended.&#xD;
