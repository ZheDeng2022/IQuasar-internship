  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial is to find out the effect of adding cord blood tissue-derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stromal cells (cb-MSCs) to ruxolitinib in treating patients with acute graft&#xD;
      versus host disease that does not respond to steroid therapy (steroid-refractory).&#xD;
      Ruxolitinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. cb-MSCs are a type of tissue helper cell that can be removed from donated&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood tissue and grown into many different cell types that can be used to&#xD;
      treat cancer and other disease, such as graft versus host disease. This trial aims to learn&#xD;
      if adding cb-MSCs to ruxolitinib may help control steroid-refractory acute graft versus host&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate between-arm differences (Arm 3 versus [vs] Arm 1, and Arm 2 vs Arm 1) for each&#xD;
      of the 28-day co-primary outcome probabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1: Patients receive ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for at least 3 days and may&#xD;
      consider tapering after 6 months of therapy if response occurs and therapeutic corticosteroid&#xD;
      doses have been discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2: Patients receive ruxolitinib PO BID as in Arm 1. Patients also receive lower dose of&#xD;
      cb-MSCs intravenously (IV) for up to 60 minutes twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) over 4&#xD;
      consecutive weeks for 8 total doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 3: Patients receive ruxolitinib PO BID as in Arm 1. Patients also receive higher dose of&#xD;
      cb-MSCs IV for up to 60 minutes twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) over 4 consecutive weeks&#xD;
      for 8 total doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on day 28 and then for up to 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled infections will be excluded. Infections are considered&#xD;
             controlled if appropriate therapy has been instituted and, at the time of enrollment,&#xD;
             no signs of progression are present. Progression of infection is defined as&#xD;
             hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis, new symptoms, worsening physical signs&#xD;
             or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever without other&#xD;
             signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as progressing infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with significant supplemental oxygen requirement defined as &gt; 6 L oxygen by&#xD;
             nasal cannula&#xD;
