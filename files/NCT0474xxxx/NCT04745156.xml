  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is being done to induce remapping of functional cortex in patients with invasive&#xD;
      gliomas to enable a greater extent of resection of invasive gliomas while minimizing the risk&#xD;
      of a permanent neurological deficit. Adult diffuse gliomas, or the type of gliomas that are&#xD;
      being targeted in this study, are not generally curable by surgery; however, life expectancy&#xD;
      is generally believed to be increased by resecting more of the tumor. Because surgeons cannot&#xD;
      resect all the tumor when it invades certain parts of the brain that are primarily&#xD;
      responsible for language or movement, the investigators are attempting to see if they can&#xD;
      electrically inactivate those parts of the brain with tumor in it so it can be resected in a&#xD;
      subsequent surgery.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1: To induce a remapping of primary motor function by pairing deficit-inducing&#xD;
      cortical stimulation with targeted physiotherapy after an initial maximal safe, but subtotal,&#xD;
      resection (i.e. standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction. The objective for this aim is to demonstrate the ability to induce&#xD;
      glioma-involved hand M1 remapping with an ICS-TBT protocol using the RNS System (responsive&#xD;
      neurostimulation device) to enable an extended EoR (extent of resection) upon a second&#xD;
      surgery before the tumor has significantly grown. The working hypothesis is that the proposed&#xD;
      protocol will mobilize motor function enough to allow extended resection during a second&#xD;
      surgery without an associated permanent loss of function. My approach involves implanting the&#xD;
      RNS System in 3 patients with M1-involved gliomas after they undergo a maximal safe, but&#xD;
      subtotal, resection (i.e. current SoC (standard of care)). An outpatient ICS-TBT (inhibitory&#xD;
      cortical stimulation-targeted behavioral therapy) protocol will then be initiated based on&#xD;
      the previously demonstrated principles with our newly proposed techniques. The rationale for&#xD;
      this aim is to provide initial evidence for the ability of this technique to safely induce&#xD;
      plasticity in this anatomical location and patient population. The expected outcome will be a&#xD;
      demonstration of the remapping of hand M1 function and a corresponding extended resection&#xD;
      without permanent neurological deficit upon a second surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Evidence. It is well established that the function inherent to certain critical&#xD;
      cortical nodes, i.e. movement and speech generation, can remap to new areas after years of&#xD;
      slow tumor invasion. Recently, however, such plasticity was accelerated by delivering&#xD;
      deficit-inducing cortical stimulation (130 Hz) with implanted subdural grids. While this&#xD;
      protocol generated remapping that enabled further resection in 5 patients, it also required&#xD;
      an average inpatient stay of 33 days and unacceptable infectious morbidity, making it not a&#xD;
      widely applicable protocol. The FDA-approved NeuroPace RNS device is fully implantable and&#xD;
      can deliver similar stimulation in the outpatient. In fellowship, the investigator became&#xD;
      well trained in the implantation of this device, and wrote a review of 57 consecutive cases&#xD;
      at their institution without a single reported infection, lead migration, or hemorrhage.&#xD;
      Similar technique will be applied to the proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design. This is a proof-of-concept study to be performed on 3 patients over&#xD;
      approximately 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Patients with radiographical evidence of lesions consistent with WHO grade II&#xD;
      gliomas (i.e. non-enhancing lesions) involving hand M1 will be eligible for this study. WHO&#xD;
      grade IV gliomas (glioblastomas) will not be considered due to their shorter life&#xD;
      expectancy4, and WHO grade I gliomas will also not be included because they are more likely&#xD;
      to receive a GTR (gross total resection). Patients with tumors invading or abutting primary&#xD;
      motor cortices on structural and functional MRIs such that GTR is anticipated to be unlikely&#xD;
      during initial resection as SoC will be targeted. Outside of active pregnancy, Neither sex&#xD;
      nor gender will be considered inclusionary nor exclusionary as it is not expected to affect&#xD;
      outcome and due to the small study N.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Surgery: Subjects will undergo an awake craniotomy for maximal safe tumor resection&#xD;
      with DES (direct electrical simulation) motor mapping and continuous motor monitoring&#xD;
      consistent with SoC and the anatomy of their lesion. Upon completion of the resection, a&#xD;
      final DES map will be obtained, and an intraoperative MRI will be taken. If a GTR has been&#xD;
      achieved, there is evidence of tumor widespread beyond the intraoperative functional map, or&#xD;
      the final DES suggested new injury to motor pathways, the case will be concluded, consistent&#xD;
      with SoC, and the patient will exit the study. Otherwise, if there is evidence of residual&#xD;
      tumor which cannot be resected due to invasion of hand-M1 but which is small enough to be&#xD;
      covered by two four-electrode strips, these strips will be placed on the functional cortex of&#xD;
      interest and secured to the dura. The location of the leads will be registered into the&#xD;
      navigation software (either Medtronic Stealth or Brainlab). The dura will then be closed as&#xD;
      watertight as possible, and the RNS System will be incorporated into the craniotomy on&#xD;
      closure. Prior to closure, four bone screws will be placed and registered to the&#xD;
      intraoperative navigation system as internal fiducials to be retrieved for future procedures.&#xD;
      Despite the newly proposed indication, the surgical technique used to implant the device is&#xD;
      similar to those in combined subtotal resection epilepsy cases. Therefore, the device-related&#xD;
      risk profile is expected to be similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICS-TBT Protocol: When the patient is clinically ready for discharge, prior to leaving the&#xD;
      hospital and removing any intravenous lines, the patient will undergo another complete&#xD;
      neurological examination and measurement of grip and pinch strength on a dynamometer. An&#xD;
      extra-operative cortical stimulation map (ECSM) will be performed through the implanted&#xD;
      electrodes using parameters similar to intraoperative mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the ECSM is obtained, ICS will begin. Initial stimulation parameters will be chosen to&#xD;
      closely approximate previously published parameters of 130 Hz and 1 ms pulse width, and they&#xD;
      will be adjusted to clinical effect (i.e. a measurable decrease in strength on the Manual&#xD;
      Motor Scale and/or dynamometer). The stimulation intensity at each electrode contact (or&#xD;
      pair) will be increased by approximately 0.5 V increments every 3 minutes until the threshold&#xD;
      for induction of weakness is discovered. Grip and pinch strength will be remeasured, and&#xD;
      stimulation will be set at this threshold so that the patient might recover the corresponding&#xD;
      disrupted function through daily intensive TBT practice. If this threshold is set without&#xD;
      incident, ICS will remain on and the patient can be discharged after 1 hour of observation.&#xD;
      Further sessions can be conducted on an outpatient basis. If stimulation induces a seizure,&#xD;
      the stimulation will be paused and the patient will be treated as clinically necessary. If a&#xD;
      seizure occurs that requires medical intervention, the stimulation will be paused and may be&#xD;
      turned back on the following day with lower settings up to three more times. If it is&#xD;
      determined that stimulation cannot be tolerated without seizure induction, no further ICS&#xD;
      attempts will be made for that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a mild deficit is induced, a TBT regimen of movements focused on rehabilitating the&#xD;
      affected area will be established. Supervised sessions will be conducted 5 days per week for&#xD;
      1 hour per session, and patients will be encouraged to continue unsupervised practice&#xD;
      (self-applied training) at home. Such sessions will continue until an increase of 1.0 V from&#xD;
      the previous session no longer induces any measurable deficit, at which point the patient&#xD;
      will undergo another ECSM and may be considered a candidate for a second surgery. Previous&#xD;
      patients received stimulation for an average of 16 days as inpatients; a similar timeline is&#xD;
      anticipated here, with the possibility of extending up to 2 months if continued deficits are&#xD;
      seen. If no improvements change is seen at 2 months, the patient will be offered a second&#xD;
      surgery at that time to retest the DES map and explant the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the RNS System is designed to deliver stimulation in response to a detection algorithm (as&#xD;
      opposed to continuous stimulation), the device will be set to its longest stimulation&#xD;
      duration of 10-seconds and the lowest possible threshold for triggering. This will&#xD;
      essentially trigger a responsive stimulation therapy constantly with a downtime of about&#xD;
      100-300ms between stimulations (i.e. 97-99% continuous stimulation). It is anticipated that&#xD;
      this is to be essentially equivalent to 100% continuous stimulation. Battery life is expected&#xD;
      to be sufficient for the proposed trial period, with the option of replacing the battery in&#xD;
      case of longer-than-expected stimulation requirements with evidence of progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second Surgery: After opening the previous wound, the bone screw fiducials will be&#xD;
      re-registered to the neuro-navigation system and lead locations will be reconfirmed. The RNS&#xD;
      System will then be explanted. An intraoperative MRI with and without contrast will be&#xD;
      obtained at this point to re-assess the tumor status (note that the RNS System precludes MRIs&#xD;
      on magnets over 1.5T and with a head coil), and another intraoperative DES map will be&#xD;
      obtained. Two attending neurosurgeons will discuss the results, and, if it agreed to be safe&#xD;
      to proceed, an extended resection will be performed with continuous motor monitoring. Once&#xD;
      the extended resection is completed based on functional constraints and tumor location,&#xD;
      stable monitoring will be confirmed, and a final intraoperative MRI will be obtained. The&#xD;
      wound will then be closed in the standard fashion, repairing the skull defect from the device&#xD;
      with a titanium mesh plate. Standard post-craniotomy clinical care will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures, Analyses, and Expected Outcome: Hand strength will be assessed by the&#xD;
      Manual Motor Scale and dynamometer grip and pinch strength. Upper extremity function will be&#xD;
      assessed with the Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT) and Duruoz Hand Index survey. Formal assessments&#xD;
      will occur preoperatively, after the first surgery, before the second surgery, after the&#xD;
      second surgery, and then weekly until the results return to within baseline (i.e. within the&#xD;
      previously validated minimal clinically important difference [MCID]) or at 3 months. Extent&#xD;
      of resection will be calculated as: (preoperative tumor volume - postoperative tumor&#xD;
      volume)/preoperative tumor volume. Determination of volumes will be made by an attending&#xD;
      radiologist without knowledge of clinical outcome. Manual segmentation will be performed to&#xD;
      measure tumor volumes based on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) axial slices. The&#xD;
      expected outcome is that all assessments of hand strength and function in all three patients&#xD;
      will return to within the MCID for their respective scales by 3-months postoperatively with a&#xD;
      radiographically measurable increase in EoR from the first to second surgery, thereby&#xD;
      demonstrating the first safe resections into previously unresectable hand M1 enabled by ICS&#xD;
      delivered through a fully implanted device.&#xD;
