  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravitreal&#xD;
      injection of ONL1204 Ophthalmic Solution in patients with geographic atrophy associated with&#xD;
      AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GA associated with AMD is one of the world's leading causes of visual disability. It is a&#xD;
      progressive disease with no approved therapy to slow or arrest the process of continual&#xD;
      photoreceptor and retinal epithelial (RPE) cell loss. A safe and effective therapy for GA&#xD;
      will have vast societal benefits. ONL1204 is being developed for this purpose. ONL1204 is a&#xD;
      first-in-class inhibitor of fragment apoptosis stimulator receptor-mediated cell death in&#xD;
      development for to reduce rates of vision in patients with GA associated with AMD. ONL1204&#xD;
      has demonstrated protection of multiple retinal cell types in several preclinical models of&#xD;
      acute ocular injury and the protection of RPE in AMD models. ONL1204 Ophthalmic Solution is&#xD;
      currently in a Phase 1 clinical study in patients with macula-off retinal detachment to&#xD;
      evaluate safety and tolerability of a single-dose of ONL1204 Ophthalmic Solution. The study&#xD;
      is ongoing and uses the same doses and route of administration as this Phase 1b study in&#xD;
      patients with GA.&#xD;

      In this study patients will be enrolled and followed for 24 weeks (natural history phase) at&#xD;
      which point they will be randomized to 1 of 2 doses of ONL1204 Ophthalmic Solution or sham.&#xD;
      Weeks 24 to 48 make up the Treatment Phase. Patients will be on study for a total of 48&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
