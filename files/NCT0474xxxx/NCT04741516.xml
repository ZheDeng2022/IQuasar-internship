  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Foquest® on sleep, using actigraphy&#xD;
      and sleep diaries, in children aged 6-12 compared to baseline on no medication. Sleep&#xD;
      difficulties, including prolonged sleep onset latency and decreased total sleep time have a&#xD;
      significant negative impact on the functioning of children. In adults, sleep deprivation may&#xD;
      result in drowsiness and yawning. However, in children, this may manifest as mood and&#xD;
      behavioural disturbances which may even mimic the classic symptoms of ADHD; hyperactivity,&#xD;
      poor impulse control, and inattention. This can in turn negatively affect the day to day&#xD;
      activities of a child such as social interactions and learning. A meta-analysis in 2015&#xD;
      showed that stimulant medications impair sleep of children and adolescents. Some researchers&#xD;
      have argued that stimulant medication may improve sleep. Importantly there appears to be&#xD;
      heterogeneity in the effects of stimulant medication on sleep with some people sleeping&#xD;
      better and some people worse after taking Foquest®. Although the randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      done to date have demonstrated the efficacy and outlined the safety profile of Foquest, there&#xD;
      remains some unanswered questions about the practical implications in the real-world setting.&#xD;
      Some clinicians have raised the concern, for example, that the extended duration of Foquest,&#xD;
      may have a negative impact on sleep. This study will evaluate the effect of Foquest® on sleep&#xD;
      and particularly sleep latency and self and parent reported sleep restorative quality. This&#xD;
      would be a novel study as there is no objective or subjective data on the effect of the&#xD;
      Foquest® on sleep latency and total sleep time in children aged 6-12.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous neurobehavioral disorder&#xD;
      characterized by a persistent pattern of developmentally inappropriate inattentiveness,&#xD;
      impulsivity, and hyperactivity. It is the most common pediatric neurobiological condition&#xD;
      affecting approximately 5-7% of children worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep difficulties, including prolonged sleep onset latency and decreased total sleep time&#xD;
      have a significant negative impact on the functioning of children. This may manifest as mood&#xD;
      and behavioural disturbances which may even mimic the classic symptoms of ADHD;&#xD;
      hyperactivity, poor impulse control, and inattention. This can in turn negatively affect the&#xD;
      day to day activities of a child such as social interactions and learning. A meta-analysis in&#xD;
      2015 showed that stimulant medications impair sleep of children and adolescents. Some&#xD;
      researchers have argued that stimulant medication may improve sleep. Importantly there&#xD;
      appears to be heterogeneity in the effects of stimulant medication on sleep with some people&#xD;
      sleeping better and some people worse after taking Foquest®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, seven pharmacokinetic studies of FOQUEST and six phase 3 clinical trials have been&#xD;
      conducted. FOQUEST has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of ADHD symptoms in&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized clinical trials in children (aged 6 to 12), adolescents (aged 12 to&#xD;
      17) and adults (aged 18 or older). However, some clinicians have raised the concern that the&#xD;
      extended duration of Foquest, may have a negative impact on sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Foquest® on sleep, using actigraphy&#xD;
      and sleep diaries, in children aged 6-12 compared to baseline on no medication. This study&#xD;
      will particularly evaluate the effect of Foquest® on sleep latency and self and parent&#xD;
      reported sleep restorative quality. This would be a novel study as there is no objective or&#xD;
      subjective data on the effect of the Foquest® on sleep latency and total sleep time in&#xD;
      children aged 6-12.&#xD;

    <description>The drug being evaluated in this study is controlled release methylphenidate HCl control (Foquest®). Foquest® is a novel formulation of MPH developed by Purdue Pharma (Canada) and is approved in Canada for the treatment of ADHD in patients six years of age and older. Foquest® is the first methylphenidate product approved in Canada with an onset of action within one hour and a duration of action up to and including 16 hours (Wigal et al.2016). Foquest® is an ADHD treatment option for patients who require a rapid onset of action and extended duration of action</description>
