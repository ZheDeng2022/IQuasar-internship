  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/II, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of TT-00420 tablet, as monotherapy or in combination regimens, in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study consists of two arms, Arm A is a Phase Ib/II study of TT-00420 tablet monotherapy, and&#xD;
      Arm B is a Phase Ib/II study of TT-00420 tablet in combination with nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      (Abraxane®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: TT-00420 Tablet Monotherapy Phase Ib will enroll patients with preferred indications&#xD;
      including metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, HER2-negative breast cancer including TNBC, bladder&#xD;
      cancer, small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, sarcoma, gastric cancer,&#xD;
      gallbladder cancer and other advanced solid tumors to receive TT-00420 monotherapy. Based on&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy results, Phase II will enroll additional patients in select indications&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy of TT-00420 monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: TT-00420 tablet in combination with nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) Arm B will enroll&#xD;
      patients with metastatic HER2-negative breast cancers, including triple-negative breast&#xD;
      cancer (TNBC). Phase Ib will be a dose escalation study of TT-00420 in combination with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel, guided by 3+3 design, to determine a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). Phase&#xD;
      II will enroll additional patients with metastatic HER2-negative breast cancers to further&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of the combination regimen.&#xD;
