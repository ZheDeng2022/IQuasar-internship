      This prospective, multicountry, multicentre, non-interventional study plans to include&#xD;
      patients who have undergone surgery for early-stage (IA to IIIB on the basis of pathologic&#xD;
      criteria) non-squamous NSCLC up to 6 weeks prior to enrolment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of EGFRm in patients with&#xD;
      surgically resected early-stage (IA to IIIB) non-squamous NSCLC as there are limited data on&#xD;
      its prevalence in this patient population&#xD;

      This prospective, multicountry, multicentre, non-interventional study plans to include&#xD;
      patients who have undergone surgery for early-stage (IA to IIIB on the basis of pathologic&#xD;
      criteria) non-squamous NSCLC up to 6 weeks prior to enrolment into the study. Eligible&#xD;
      patients should have availability of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimen(s) to&#xD;
      be primarily tested for EGFRm at validated local laboratories or a central laboratory. The&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from the patients during their routine clinical care visit&#xD;
      before data are collected from the medical records. The data on socio-demographics, tumour&#xD;
      staging, histology, surgical management, and neoadjuvant therapies will be collected from&#xD;
      available medical records at the treating facility by the investigator. If PD-L1 testing is&#xD;
      conducted as part of routine clinical care, the available results will be recorded. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed prospectively and follow-up will be considered as complete once EGFRm status&#xD;
      of the patient's tumour sample is known and any planned adjuvant therapy has been recorded.&#xD;
