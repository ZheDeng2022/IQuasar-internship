  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare the postprandial effects of ß-glucan derived from oats bread (OB)&#xD;
      and barley bread (BB) on appetite and glycemia. A randomized, double-blind, crossover trial&#xD;
      included 20 healthy individuals. All participants consumed BB, white bread (WB), and whole&#xD;
      wheat bread (WWB) with a standard breakfast and then were served an ad libitum lunch on four&#xD;
      different days. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess appetite before breakfast and&#xD;
      at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes after breakfast. Blood glucose levels were&#xD;
      measured at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Postprandial appetite and glucose&#xD;
      responses were quantified as the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) calculated according&#xD;
      to the trapezoidal rule.&#xD;

      This study aimed to compare the postprandial effects of ß-glucan on glycemia and appetite of&#xD;
      breads derived from oats and barley, which are the best natural grain sources. In addition,&#xD;
      the positive health effects of ß-glucan were sought to be determined independent of total&#xD;
      dietary fiber intake, using not only WB as the control food but also WWB, which has a dietary&#xD;
      fiber content equal to that of breads containing ß-glucan. This study was planned as a&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and crossover. Twenty healthy adults (10 men, 10&#xD;
      women) between the ages of 19-35 years, with normal body weight (BMI 18.5-25 kg /m2) were&#xD;
      included in the study. Participants were selected from among Erciyes University students and&#xD;
      staff in accordance with the inclusion criteria. The eating behaviors of all participants&#xD;
      were also evaluated using the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire before starting the study.&#xD;
      Since the total score obtained from this questionnaire &gt;3.5 is considered as restrictive&#xD;
      eating behavior, these individuals were not included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were served barley bread (BB), oat bread (OB), and white bread (WB), and whole&#xD;
      wheat bread (WWB) with a standard breakfast on four different days at least two days apart.&#xD;
      Breads were prepared with similar amounts of energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate, and fiber&#xD;
      (except WB). The test meal was served to the participants at 09:00 and they were asked to&#xD;
      consume it within 15 minutes. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess appetite before&#xD;
      breakfast and at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes after breakfast. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      separate VAS components such as hunger, fullness, desire to eat, and prospective food&#xD;
      consumption were combined to produce an additional measure termed 'composite appetite score'.&#xD;
      For the postprandial glucose assessment, blood glucose measurements were made with the&#xD;
      finger-tip glucometer at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Postprandial appetite and&#xD;
      glucose responses were quantified as the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) calculated&#xD;
      according to the trapezoidal rule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of three hours, the ad libitum lunch was served to the participants as a&#xD;
      buffet-style, and the energy and macronutrient intakes in this meal were determined. All&#xD;
      foods (meatballs, tuna, sauce pasta, yogurt, salad, white bread, apple, banana, yogurt drink,&#xD;
      fruit juice, and water) were weighed using a calibrated kitchen scale with an accuracy of ±1g&#xD;
      before being served. At lunch, the participants were asked to consume the foods they wanted&#xD;
      and continue eating until they felt completely full. After the participants completed their&#xD;
      consumption, the remaining amounts were reweighed and the difference with the initial amounts&#xD;
      was accepted as the amount consumed.&#xD;

    <description>The separate visual analog scale factors like hunger, fullness, desiring for eat, and prospective food consumption were combined to produce an additional measure termed 'composite appetite score'. This average appetite score was computed for 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes using the following equation: [(hunger + desire to eat + prospective food consumption + (100 - fullness)]/4 Total scale score changes in a range of 0-100. Higher values represent a worse outcome. Postprandial apetite response was quantified as incremental area under the curve (iAUC), which was calculated according to the trapezoidal rule by using composite appetite scores at time points 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Palatability of test meals was measured by using a visual analog scale (VAS) composed of lines (of 100 mm in length) with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive and the most negative rating.
