  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no available treatments aside from supportive care for patients with Centronuclear&#xD;
      myopathy (CNM). This trial will assess the safety and tolerability as well as&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary efficacy of DYN101 in&#xD;
      participants 2 to 17 years of age with CNM caused by mutations in DNM2 or MTM1.The trial will&#xD;
      consist of a pre-screening consent, a screening period, a run-in period (if applicable), and&#xD;
      a Part 1 of 12 weeks with weekly infusion of DYN101 to evaluate safety and tolerability as&#xD;
      well as PK, PD and preliminary efficacy. The dose level may need adjustment based on the Part&#xD;
      1 results of the current study and available data from the Unite-CNM study (DYN101-C101,&#xD;
      NCT04033159). If a dose adjustment is needed, Part 2 will be conducted in the same&#xD;
      participants and the newly selected dose level will be used to assess whether efficacy is&#xD;
      seen after an additional 12 weeks of treatment. As this trial is investigational, there is no&#xD;
      defined, expected benefit for subjects who participate in this trial except a better&#xD;
      knowledge of their disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          1. Male or female aged ≥2 to &lt;18 years on the date the main ICF is signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a clinically symptomatic CNM, with a documented MTM1 or DNM2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have impaired muscle function as evidenced by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  MFM20 score between 5% and 80% for subjects ≥2 and &lt;6 years of age, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  MFM32 score between 5% and 80% for subjects ≥6 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have sufficient skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis, gastrocnemius, or biceps brachii as&#xD;
             last resort) to perform 2 open muscle biopsies during the trial, as determined by&#xD;
             ultrasound imaging at screening.&#xD;
