          7. Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as intraocular pressure [IOP] ≥25 mmHg&#xD;
             despite treatment with antiglaucoma medication), and/or glaucoma filtering surgery&#xD;
             (e.g., trabeculectomy, scleral nipping, non-penetrating trabeculectomy, etc.)&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Any concurrent intraocular condition in the fellow eye that may require anti VEGF&#xD;
