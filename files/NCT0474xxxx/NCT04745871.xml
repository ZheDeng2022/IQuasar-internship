  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men over 50 years of age (nearly&#xD;
      50,000 new cases per year) and is the second most common cause of cancer death in men&#xD;
      (approximately 9,000 deaths per year). Although mortality has been declining since the end of&#xD;
      the 1990s (about 7%/year), about 30 to 35% of them will have a biological recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate assessment of local, regional and distant spread of the disease is therefore needed&#xD;
      to design optimal personalised care for each patient, either curative or palliative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, in France, recommended disease assessment includes bone scintigraphy and&#xD;
      Abdomino-Pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging. However, conventional imaging has limited&#xD;
      performance with regard to lymph node extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Node dissection is the best way to assess node status. Currently, no imaging exam allows this&#xD;
      level of accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, molecular imaging has emerged as a promising tool to improve the initial&#xD;
      extensional assessment of prostate cancer. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a&#xD;
      transmembrane glycoprotein, specific to the prostate, which is over-expressed on the surface&#xD;
      of prostate cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies of PSMA PET/CT as part of the initial extension assessment of prostate cancer&#xD;
      report superior diagnostic performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity compared to&#xD;
      conventional tests, as well as an impact of PSMA PET/CT on patient management.&#xD;
