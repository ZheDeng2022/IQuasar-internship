  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kawasaki disease (KD) is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in the&#xD;
      developed world. Despite available treatment, 25% of children in San Diego County&#xD;
      appropriately treated for KD develop coronary artery abnormalities that could lead to&#xD;
      complications later in life, including heart attack. Although we can identify children with&#xD;
      KD that have these coronary artery abnormalities, there is no approved additional treatment&#xD;
      to decrease coronary artery inflammation and arrest or prevent damage to the coronary&#xD;
      arteries. Statins, a class of drugs that is known for lowering cholesterol, have also been&#xD;
      shown to decrease inflammation in general as well as at the level of the vessel wall.&#xD;
      Anakinra, a therapy that blocks the high levels of interleukin 1 (IL1) that leads to&#xD;
      inflammation during acute KD, has been shown in the KD mouse model to prevent the development&#xD;
      of coronary artery damage. Both of these therapies have been demonstrated to be safe and&#xD;
      well-tolerated in KD patients. Therefore, we propose to study the effects of combination&#xD;
      therapy with atorvastatin and anakinra in children with acute KD and early coronary artery&#xD;
      abnormalities.&#xD;
