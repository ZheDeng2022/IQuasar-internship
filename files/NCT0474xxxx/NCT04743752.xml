  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, observational cohort study aims to explore the influence of obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea(OSA) on the efficacy of PD-1-based immunotherapy in patients with non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer(NSCLC). Patients who had no prior treatment for advanced NSCLC and are intended&#xD;
      to receive PD-1/PD-L1 antibody will be recruited. According to sleep monitor results,&#xD;
      participants will be divided into Group NSCLC and Group OSA+NSCLC. Primary outcome is the&#xD;
      objective remission rate(ORR).&#xD;

      This is a single-center, prospective, observational cohort study. Patients who had no prior&#xD;
      treatment for advanced NSCLC and are intended to receive PD-1/PD-L1 antibody will be&#xD;
      recruited and followed for 4 years. According to the baseline sleep monitor results,&#xD;
      participants will be divided into Group NSCLC(AHI&lt;15), and Group OSA+NSCLC(AHIâ‰¥15), and then&#xD;
      explore the influence of obstructive sleep apnea on the efficacy of PD-1-based immunotherapy.&#xD;
      The baseline level of white blood cell count (WBC); absolute neutrophil count (ANC); absolute&#xD;
      lymphocyte count (ALC); ANC to ALC (ANC:ALC) ratio; interleukin 6 (IL-6); C-reactive Protein&#xD;
      (CRP) in peripheral blood, lymphocytes classification and count by flow cytometry, and gut&#xD;
      microbiome analysis by quantitative metagenomics will also be measured to further search for&#xD;
      the possible mechanisms. Primary outcome is the objective remission rate (ORR), secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol has been approved by the Peking University First Hospital Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board (IRB). Any protocol modifications will be submitted for the IRB review and&#xD;
      approval.&#xD;
