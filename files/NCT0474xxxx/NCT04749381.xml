      The hypothesis is that TCM can decrease the postoperative complications for rectal cancer. So&#xD;
      the study is to investigate the role of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on the&#xD;
      postoperative recovery of rectal cancer patients. Patients enrolled in this study will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups with TCM intervention or placebo. The intervention will be&#xD;
      described below. Primary endpoint is postoperative complications.&#xD;
