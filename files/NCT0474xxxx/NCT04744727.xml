      investigators conducted a randomized clinical study included including 96 primiparous women&#xD;
      admitted to Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Menoufia University Hospitals, starting the&#xD;
      study from May 2019 to March 2020 to assess the use of paracetamol intravenously versus&#xD;
      Pethidine HCL intravenously in management of intrapartum pain. After obtaining approval from&#xD;
      the local ethics committee, women who agreed to participate gave their signed informed&#xD;
      consent after explanation of the trial benefits and hazards&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Cases were divided into 2 groups:&#xD;
Group I (paracetamol group): Included 48 pregnant women who received 1000 mg of intravenous paracetamol. The treatment was administered at the begining of the active phase of 1st stage of labor [roughly defined as a cervical dilatation of 3-4 cm and a cervical effacement ≥ 50%].&#xD;
Group 2 (pethidine group): Included 48 pregnant women who received 50 mg of intravenous pethidine HCL diluted in 10 ml normal saline. The treatment was administered at the beginning of the active phase of 1st stage of labor [roughly defined as a cervical dilatation of 3-4 cm and a cervical effacement ≥ 50%]. Randomization was done by a computer-generated randomization system. Letters of the allocated were concealed in serially numbered opaque envelope that were only released after recruitment.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Labour pain was semi-objectively assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS). In this technique, the patient is shown a ten cm line which represent at one end no pain and the other worst pain, and the patient is asked to point on the line where her pain lies. This scale has the added advantage that the pain can be given a numerical value.</description>
