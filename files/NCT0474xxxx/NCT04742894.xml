  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aphasia is the most common type of post-stroke communication disorder characterized by&#xD;
      deficits in speech comprehension, production and control. While recovery can be promoted with&#xD;
      speech therapy, improvement remains modest and typically requires a large number of sessions&#xD;
      contributing to rising health care costs. Traditional aphasia therapy focus on enhancing&#xD;
      speech motor output; however, recent evidence suggests that the auditory feedback also plays&#xD;
      a critical role in fluent speech. Therefore, a key step toward refining treatment strategies&#xD;
      is to develop objective biomarkers that can probe the integrity of sensorimotor mechanisms of&#xD;
      speech auditory feedback and identify their impaired function in patients with post-stroke&#xD;
      aphasia. This study aims to examine the behavioral, neurophysiological (EEG), and&#xD;
      neuroimaging (fMRI) biomarkers of speech impairment following stroke with focus on&#xD;
      understanding the role of auditory feedback for speech production and control. We plan to&#xD;
      test individuals with post-stroke aphasia and a matched neuroptypical control group during&#xD;
      different speech production tasks under the altered auditory feedback paradigm. In addition,&#xD;
      we aim to examine the effect of audio-visual feedback training on enhancing communication&#xD;
      ability during speech. These biomarkers will be combined with existing lesion-symptom-mapping&#xD;
      data in the aphasic group in order to identify the patterns of brain damage and diminished&#xD;
      structural connectivity within the auditory-motor areas of the left hemisphere that predict&#xD;
      impaired sensorimotor processing of speech in aphasia. The long-term goal of this research is&#xD;
      to develop a model for identifying the source of sensorimotor deficit and improve diagnosis&#xD;
      and targeted treatment of speech disorders in aphasia.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A total of 100 individuals with aphasia due to chronic left hemisphere stroke (&gt; 6&#xD;
             months post-stroke) and 100 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects will be&#xD;
             recruited in this study with age ranges between 21-80 years in both groups. The&#xD;
             aphasic subjects have previously undergone neuro-psychological speech/language testing&#xD;
             and have been diagnosed with one type of aphasia (e.g., Broca's, Wernicke's,&#xD;
             conduction or anomic). Subjects in the control group will meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
             with having normal voice, speech, language, and hearing function and no history of&#xD;
             neurological and psychiatric disorder. We expect that a significant proportion of&#xD;
             aphasic patients will show symptoms associated with Apraxia of Speech (AOS) or&#xD;
             dysarthria; however, these patients will not be excluded unless their deficits will&#xD;
             preclude them from performing the experimental tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with severe hearing, memory, and/or cognitive impairments will be excluded&#xD;
             for both groups.&#xD;
