  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm pilot trial to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of the 12-week, phone-delivered, Midlife Activity, Stress reduction, Time&#xD;
      Efficiency, Resilience, and Youthfulness (MASTERY) intervention, which utilizes positive&#xD;
      psychology (PP), motivational interviewing (MI), and specific midlife modules (e.g., on time&#xD;
      management, financial stress, caregiving stress, or occupational stress) to promote&#xD;
      well-being and physical activity in mid-life adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm proof-of-concept trial of a phone-delivered positive&#xD;
      psychology-motivational interviewing (PP-MI) intervention, with content adapted to midlife&#xD;
      persons. Midlife adults with low physical activity were recruited from outpatient clinics,&#xD;
      completed baseline outcome measures (including wearing an accelerometer to measure activity&#xD;
      for one week), completed the 12-week MASTERY intervention, and then completed a follow-up&#xD;
      session to obtain repeat outcome information. The intervention, which involved weekly phone&#xD;
      sessions with a trained study team member, included the completion of PP exercises, setting&#xD;
      physical activity goals, and completion of activities to reduce midlife-specific stressors.&#xD;
      The primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability, and secondary outcomes included&#xD;
      accelerometer-measured physical activity and self-report outcomes.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Moderate-Vigorous Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ActiGraph GT3X+ step counters are validated as measures of physical activity and have been used in numerous studies of physical activity in patients with medical illness. In this trial, participants will wear the accelerometer for one week at baseline and at 12 weeks. We will report change from baseline to 12 weeks in the average number of minutes of MVPA performed per day.</description>

    <measure>Change in Positive Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in score from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The positive affect items on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), a well-validated scale used in other intervention trials and in patients with medical illnesses, will be used to measure positive affect (Range: 10-50). Change will be calculated by subtracting the score at baseline from the score at 12 weeks. Higher scores indicate higher levels of positive affect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Optimism</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in score from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Life Orientation Test-Revised is a well-validated 6-item instrument used to measure dispositional optimism (Range: 0-24). Change will be calculated by subtracting the score at baseline from the score at 12 weeks. Higher scores indicate higher levels of optimism.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in score from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)-depression subscale will be used to measure depression. This is a well-validated scale with few somatic symptom items that can confound mood/anxiety assessment in medically-ill patients (Range: 0-21). Change will be calculated by subtracting the score at baseline from the score at 12 weeks. Higher scores indicate higher levels of depression.</description>

This is a well-validated scale with few somatic symptom items that can confound mood/anxiety assessment in medically-ill patients (Range: 0-21).

    <description>For each session, a PP exercise will be described in the manual, with instructions and space to write about the exercise and its effects. Next, an MI section will outline specific MI-based topics (e.g., pros/cons, managing slips) and will contain space to write a specific physical activity goal and to track physical activity (e.g., through step counter data) over the subsequent week. At the in-person visit #2, interventionists will explain PP exercise 1 and MI session 1 to the participants. Calls will last ~30 minutes. Participants will then independently complete PP exercises and MI-based goals and review them at phone sessions over 12 weeks. PP and MI components will be delivered stepwise within sessions (rather than intertwined) based on our experience, participant feedback, and pilot work.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Low physical activity (defined as â‰¤150 minutes/week of MVPA, in accordance with&#xD;

             review of the medical record, with clarification by participants' primary clinician if&#xD;
             needed, as part of recruitment procedures. Existing coronary artery disease will be&#xD;
             defined as a prior acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or myocardial infarction)&#xD;
             or diagnosed via cardiac catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To meet criteria for a prior acute coronary syndrome, for myocardial infarction,&#xD;
             patients must have experienced at least two of three World Health Organization&#xD;
             criteria for an acute myocardial infarction: typical chest pain, elevated cardiac&#xD;
             enzymes, and electrocardiographic changes consistent with myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For unstable angina, participants must have had new onset angina within 2 months,&#xD;
             exacerbation of previous angina with rest pain or with minimal exercise, or angina&#xD;
             within 2 weeks of myocardial infarction, with confirmation of this diagnosis by the&#xD;
             patient's primary medical provider or inpatient treatment team; this definition has&#xD;
             been used in prior trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To meet criteria for coronary artery disease diagnosed at cardiac catheterization,&#xD;
             participants must have had 50% stenosis of the left main artery or 70% stenosis of&#xD;
             another coronary artery, consistent with consensus definitions of obstructive coronary&#xD;
             artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive disturbance precluding participation or informed consent, as identified&#xD;
             using a six-item cognitive screen designed to assess suitability for research&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of available telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An inability to communicate in English.&#xD;
