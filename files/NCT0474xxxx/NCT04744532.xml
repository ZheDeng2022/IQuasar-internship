  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of bosutinib to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) and a recommended&#xD;
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) of bosutinib for treatment of ALS patients. Also, efficacy will be&#xD;
      evaluated exploratory.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a 12-week observation period, a 1-week (acceptable window: 5-9 days)&#xD;
      transitional period, a 12-week study treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period.&#xD;
      Subjects who have been receiving riluzole since before the enrollment are allowed to&#xD;
      continuously receive riluzole during the 12-week observation period (with the dosage&#xD;
      remaining unchanged), and stop receiving riluzole from the beginning of the 1-week&#xD;
      (acceptable window: 5-9 days) transitional period. After the completion of the transitional&#xD;
      period, subjects whose total ALSFRS-R score decreased by 1 to 3 points during the 12-week&#xD;
      observation period will receive bosutinib for 12 weeks to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of bosutinib in ALS patients. All ALS drugs including riluzole will be&#xD;
      prohibited during the bosutinib treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 3 to 6 ALS patients will be enrolled in each of the 4 bosutinib dose lelvels&#xD;
      [100 mg/day (dose level 1), 200 mg/day (dose level 2), 300 mg/day (dose level 3), or&#xD;
      400mg/day (dose level 4)] to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational drug&#xD;
      (bosutinib) under a 3+3 dose escalation study design. The dose will be escalated by 1 dose&#xD;
      level at a time; no skipping will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation and MTD will be determined by the safety assessment committee comprising&#xD;
      oncologist, hematologist, ALS Expert based on the incidence of DLT in 4 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      among 3 subjects enrolled (6 subjects if additionaly enrolled) in each dose level. RP2D will&#xD;
      be determined by the safety assessment committee upon completion of 12-week study treatment&#xD;
      in all subjects in all dose levels.&#xD;
