  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an international, multicenter, academically sponsored, observational study,&#xD;
      that focusses on fertile female patients with proven symptomatic deep vein thrombosis of the&#xD;
      legs (DVT) or acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The incidence and severity of abnormal menstrual&#xD;
      bleeding will be assessed for each menstrual period and correlated to quality of life. Causes&#xD;
      of abnormal menstrual bleeding other than active anticoagulant treatment will be assessed.&#xD;
      Treatment of abnormal menstrual bleeding (all within routine clinical care) will be evaluated&#xD;
      for efficacy and safety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A recently performed international survey of expert opinion and current practice revealed&#xD;
      divergent expert recommendations and very heterogeneous management approach in clinical&#xD;
      practice with regard to anticoagulation choice, use of HC and treatment of abnormal uterine&#xD;
      bleeding during anticoagulant treatment of VTE. Together with the fact that up to 70% of&#xD;
      female patients with childbearing potential treated with anticoagulants may suffer from&#xD;
      abnormal menstrual bleeding with a severe negative impact on quality of life, this is a&#xD;
      compelling argument to initiate high quality observational studies to better quantify the&#xD;
      magnitude of the problem and to identify unmet clinical needs. This study will do so and at&#xD;
      the same time provide solid ground for future prospective management trials aimed at&#xD;
      establishing preventive and/or treatment strategies for VTE patients with&#xD;
      anticoagulant-associated abnormal menstrual bleeding.&#xD;

        Consecutive female patients between the ages of 18 and 50 with child bearing potential and&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ability of subject to understand the character and individual consequences of this&#xD;
             clinical study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Signed and dated informed consent of the subject available before the start of any&#xD;
             specific study procedures;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age ≥18 years and ≤ 50 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Confirmed symptomatic first or recurrent VTE;&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. DVT: incompressibility of proximal or distal veins of the affected leg by&#xD;
                  compression ultrasonography or venous filling defect on multi-detector computed&#xD;
                  tomography venography. The diagnosis of ipsilateral recurrent DVT is defined as a&#xD;
                  CUS that shows incompressibility of a different venous segment than at the&#xD;
                  reference CUS examination, or in case of a pronounced increase in vein diameter&#xD;
                  (≥4 mm) of a previous non-compressible venous segment, or by an abnormal signal&#xD;
                  of Magnetic resonance direct thrombus imaging (MRDTI);&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. PE: both first and recurrent PE are diagnosed in case of at least one filling&#xD;
                  defect in the pulmonary artery tree on multi-detector computed tomography&#xD;
                  pulmonary angiography (CTPA) up to the subsegmental level, or high probability&#xD;
                  result of ventilation perfusion scintigraphy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Childbearing potential, i.e. with active menstrual cycle with or without hormonal&#xD;
             regulation of any kind initiated for reasons of either contraception or for treatment&#xD;
             of abnormal menstrual bleeding;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Inclusion before the first day of next menstrual cycle after VTE diagnosis or within 1&#xD;
             month after the VTE diagnosis, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Woman between the ages of 18 and 50 who were subjected to hysterectomy or chemically&#xD;
             induced menopause;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Woman between the ages of 18 and 50 with premature menopause (established before study&#xD;
             inclusion);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Planned treatment with parenteral anticoagulation (and no switch to oral drugs);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Medical or psychological condition that would not permit completion of the study or&#xD;
             signing of informed consent, including life expectancy less than 6 months, or&#xD;
             unwillingness to sign informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Non-compliance or inability to adhere to the follow-up visits;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnancy or post-partum (first three months) associated VTE;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Active in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment or planned IVF treatment during the&#xD;
             study period.&#xD;
