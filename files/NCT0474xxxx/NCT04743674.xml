  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if ctHPVDNA (circulating tumor HPV DNA) can be used&#xD;
      as a non-invasive biomarker for identification and treatment monitoring of cervical cancer by&#xD;
      characterizing correlation between plasma ctHPVDNA, urine transrenal HPVDNA (TrHPVDNA) levels&#xD;
      and presence of cervical cancer at diagnosis and following definitive intent management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early stage cervical cancer is managed surgically while chemoradiation is the mainstay for&#xD;
      treatment of bulky or advanced stage disease. The primary aim of post-treatment surveillance&#xD;
      is to detect early recurrences and guide additional therapy. There is no definitive agreement&#xD;
      on the best practice for cervical cancer surveillance. Most recurrences are detected based on&#xD;
      patient history and physical exam as there is limited data to support cervicovaginal cytology&#xD;
      and routine use of imaging in follow up. Novel non-invasive biomarkers are needed to monitor&#xD;
      disease status, detect early recurrence and guide personalized treatment decisions.&#xD;
      Biospecimens including urine and blood plasma will be collected from patients presenting to&#xD;
      the UNC Department of Gynecology Oncology and Multidisciplinary clinics with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      cervical cancer to assess for HPVDNA. Archived or residual tissue will also be accessed. For&#xD;
      patients who undergo definitive management with surgery or chemoradiation, a post-treatment&#xD;
      blood plasma and urine sample will be collected 2-6 weeks after completion and will be&#xD;
      compared to pre-therapy ctHPVDNA and TrHPVDNA levels.&#xD;
