             of such treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastrointestinal condition which could impair absorption of study medication.&#xD;

          -  Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any diseases or medical conditions, at the Investigator's discretion, that may be&#xD;

             5 mIU/mL). Breast-feeding woman can become eligible for this study if she stops&#xD;
             breast-feeding, however, cannot restart the breast-feeding on/after the completion of&#xD;
             the study treatment.&#xD;
