  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Awareness, or explicit recall, under sedation is often intended and expected by&#xD;
      anesthesiologists and is assumed that does not associate with any sequelae. Thus, awareness&#xD;
      under sedation is a common event and is estimated to occur in around one-quarter of patients&#xD;
      in our population. However, two recent registry studies suggested some patients with&#xD;
      awareness under sedation have comparable psychological sequelae to those patients with&#xD;
      awareness during general anesthesia. As such, we plan to conduct a a single center,&#xD;
      prospective cohort study to evaluate the incidence, experience and psychological consequence&#xD;
      of awareness under sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will prospectively include 2500 patients who will be scheduled to have&#xD;
      major joint replacement surgery under regional anesthesia and sedation at University&#xD;
      Hospital, London Health Sciences Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be assessed at four separate time points including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enrollment/Surgical Preparatory Area (~ 2 hours before surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post Anesthesia Care Unit (or up to 6 hours after surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Postoperative day one (in hospital)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Postoperative 3 months (expected to be after discharge via telephone)&#xD;

The Michigan Awareness Classiﬁcation is used to report the levels of sensation during awareness. 5 Levels of sensation are classiﬁed as auditory, tactile, pain, paralysis, or pain and paralysis. A designation of 'D' for distress is used for patient reports of fear, anxiety, suffocation, sense of doom, sense of impending death, or similar reports that indicated emotional distress during the explicit recall experience.</description>
