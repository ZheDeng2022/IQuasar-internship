  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microbial derived uremic solutes (p-cresol sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, and&#xD;
      phenylacetylglutamine) are present in blood and excreted into the urine. Uremic solutes have&#xD;
      high inter-individual variability of unclear etiology, that the investigators hypothesize is&#xD;
      due to intestinal microbiome variation and/or dietary variation between people. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators will collect baseline samples on participant's habitual diet. The&#xD;
      investigators will then administer a homogenous diet to all participants for 7 days and&#xD;
      examine levels of uremic solutes in the urine via 24-hour urine collection during this&#xD;
      period. In parallel, the investigators will monitor microbiome composition. The investigators&#xD;
      predict that during the period subjects are consuming the same, homogenous diet, their&#xD;
      excretion of uremic solutes (p-cresol sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, and phenylacetylglutamine)&#xD;
      into the urine will have less inter-individual variation.&#xD;

      Participants will be asked to eat exactly the same meal for one week and to eat this same&#xD;
      meal three times each day. Subjects will be allowed to eat as much of this meal as they want&#xD;
      and to eat enough so that they do not lose weight. The food will provide a nutritionally&#xD;
      adequate diet, designed by a registered dietitian. Participants will be asked not to eat&#xD;
      anything else including candy, snacks, etc. and not to drink anything except water including&#xD;
      coffee, tea, sodas, or alcoholic drinks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be collected at 5 time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 weeks prior to starting test diet, Baseline (day 1 on diet), day 4 on the diet, day 7 on&#xD;
      the diet, 7 days after end of diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples collected include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample Stool sample 24 hr urine collection Diet and Gastrointestinal questionnaires&#xD;
