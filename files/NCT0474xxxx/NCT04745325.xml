  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smartphone apps targeting alcohol consumption are increasingly employed as a means to help&#xD;
      people reduce their alcohol consumption. Recognizing this potential, there has been an&#xD;
      explosion of app development for unhealthy alcohol use, as well as other health-related&#xD;
      behaviours. This study will recruit people who consume alcohol in an unhealthy manner.&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned by chance to one of two groups and will be contacted 6 months&#xD;
      after consenting to the study to assess changes in their drinking. In addition, this study&#xD;
      will help us understand which components of the smartphone app are important to use in order&#xD;
      to promote reductions in alcohol consumption. An app with proven efficacy, made widely&#xD;
      available and free-of-charge to Canadians, will provide a much needed option to help those in&#xD;
      need to reduce their alcohol use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unhealthy alcohol use is common and causes tremendous harm. Most people with unhealthy&#xD;
      alcohol use will never seek formal alcohol treatment. As an alternative, smartphone apps have&#xD;
      been developed as one means to provide help to people concerned about their alcohol use.&#xD;
      While such apps are widely available, the large majority have little or no evidence base, and&#xD;
      research has indicated that some may actually do more harm than good. An app with proven&#xD;
      efficacy at reducing alcohol consumption is needed in order to capitalize on this opportunity&#xD;
      to motivate the large number of people seeking assistance using this promising technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit people who consume alcohol in an unhealthy manner. Participants will&#xD;
      be assigned by chance to one of two groups to either receive access to: 1) the full app; or&#xD;
      2) a copy of the app where only the educational content is provided (as opposed to the full&#xD;
      intervention content of the app). Participants will be contacted 6 months after consenting to&#xD;
      the study to assess changes in their drinking. We predict that the full app will lead to&#xD;
      larger reductions in drinking and a more sustained impact than the educational content only&#xD;
      app. In addition, this study will help us understand which components of the smartphone app&#xD;
      are important to use in order to promote reductions in alcohol consumption.&#xD;
