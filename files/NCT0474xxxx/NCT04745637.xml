    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Cohort Treatment Plan is to allow access to ruxolitinib for eligible&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with PMF, PPV MF or PET MF. The patient's Treating Physician should follow&#xD;
      the suggested treatment guidelines and comply with all local health authority regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The requesting Treating Physician submitted a request for access to drug (often referred to&#xD;
      as Compassionate Use) to Novartis which was reviewed and approved by the medical team&#xD;
      experienced with the drug and indication.&#xD;
