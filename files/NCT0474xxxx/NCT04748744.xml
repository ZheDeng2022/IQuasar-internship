    <textblock>
      Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is an Î±-glycoprotein synthesized in the liver. BchE's serum&#xD;
      level decreases in many clinical conditions such as acute and chronic liver damage,&#xD;
      inflammation, injury and infections, and malnutrition. The Investigators prospectively&#xD;
      evaluate patients undergoing elective procedures for colorectal diseases. Blood samples are&#xD;
      collected preoperatively (at day 0), post-operatively in the recovery room (day 1), and on&#xD;
      the subsequent four days (days 2, 3, 4, and 5) for assessment of BChE, C-reactive protein,&#xD;
      and white blood cell concentrations. The same surgical team operates all patients and is&#xD;
      blinded to the study. Patients are monitored for post-operative infection by using standard&#xD;
      laboratory and clinical methods. If surgical site infection (SSI) is suspected the wound is&#xD;
      swabbed and empirical antibiotics are started. The aim of the current trial is to study&#xD;
      whether BChE is a reliable marker for the presence of SSI in patients undergoing colorectal&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE or BuChE) is a cholinesterase enzyme that is very similar to&#xD;
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE). However, though the role and function of AChE in the human body&#xD;
      are widely studied and known, BChE is usually referred to as an 'orphan enzyme' because its&#xD;
      specific physiological role is still under question. Lastly, it has been found, however, that&#xD;
      BChE has more specific functions than it was previously believed and acetylcholine (ACh),&#xD;
      which will be further analyzed, can affect the immune system and is associated with&#xD;
      inflammation-related events. Butyrylcholinesterase is an enzyme that for several years was&#xD;
      not considered to have a specific physiological role but lately, it has been observed that&#xD;
      plays an important role in inflammation as acetylcholine is a major player of the&#xD;
      'cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway' inhibiting inflammation. It has been proved that BChE&#xD;
      activity can be affected by several diseases. Low-grade inflammation is associated with an&#xD;
      increase of its levels whereas a reduction is observed when systemic inflammation is present.&#xD;
      However, future research is needed in order to be widely used in clinical practice as a&#xD;
      biomarker for several pathological conditions involving inflammation. Therefore, the aim of&#xD;
      this study is to present information about butyrylcholinesterase, its function, and its role&#xD;
      in the human body, highlighting its association with inflammation analyzing past studies&#xD;
      about this subject. The Investigators prospectively evaluate patients undergoing elective&#xD;
      procedures for colorectal diseases. Blood samples are collected preoperatively (at day 0),&#xD;
      post-operatively in the recovery room (day 1), and on the subsequent four days (days 2, 3, 4,&#xD;
      and 5) for assessment of BChE, C-reactive protein, and white blood cell concentrations. The&#xD;
      same surgical team operates all patients and is blinded to the study. Patients are monitored&#xD;
      for post-operative infection by using standard laboratory and clinical methods. If surgical&#xD;
      site infection (SSI) is suspected the wound is swabbed and empirical antibiotics are started.&#xD;
      The aim of the current trial is to study whether BChE is a reliable marker for the presence&#xD;
      of SSI in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.&#xD;
