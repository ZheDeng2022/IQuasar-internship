  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization's Global Tuberculosis Programme (WHO-GTB) issues&#xD;
      evidence-informed guideline recommendations on tuberculosis (TB). These recommendations are&#xD;
      used by decision-makers, guideline developers and other stakeholders. In an effort to improve&#xD;
      the accessibility and usability of these recommendations, a new eTB catalogue of&#xD;
      recommendations has been developed. This study aims to compare the accessibility of the new&#xD;
      eTB catalogue to the earlier method of accessing recommendations directed through the general&#xD;
      WHO website.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm superiority randomized controlled trial. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      compare the accessibility of information between the eTB catalogue (intervention) and WHO TB&#xD;
      (comparison). Secondary outcomes include understanding of the information, satisfaction of&#xD;
      catalogue presentation, and preference toward the catalogue. Current and potential users of&#xD;
      TB recommendations will be recruited. Data will be collected using a survey with demographic&#xD;
      questions and subsequent 1:1 randomization to the intervention. Superiority will be declared&#xD;
      if the mean difference in accessibility is 0.5 or greater for the intervention arm on the&#xD;
      seven-point Likert scale.&#xD;

    <measure>Accessibility of Information on a Seven-Point Likert Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of survey (approximately 10 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the accessibility of information on the eTB catalogue compared to the current WHO TB guidelines. Accessibility is defined as the ability to access and use information. This outcome considers the four following domains: (1) how easy is it to find the information (2) how easy is it to understand the information (3) whether the presentation of this information facilitates decision-making (4) overall accessibility of information. These domains will be measured using a seven-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). The statements will be: 'It was easy to find the information', 'it was easy to understand the information', 'the information was presented in a way that would help me make a decision', and 'this website was easy to navigate'. We will calculate mean composite values of these four domains for the primary outcome of accessibility, and present the four individual domains as secondary outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction on a Seven-Point Likert Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of survey (approximately 10 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction is defined as a stakeholder's impression of catalogue presentation. This outcome considers the three following domains: (1) home page presentation (2) recommendation list presentation (3) individual recommendation presentation.&#xD;
These domains will be measured using a seven-point Likert-scale (1 = very dissatisfied, 2 = dissatisfied, 3 = somewhat dissatisfied, 4 = neutral, 5 = somewhat satisfied, 6 = satisfied, 7 = very satisfied). The questions will be: 'how satisfied are you with presentation of the home page?', and 'how satisfied are you with the presentation of the list of recommendations?', and 'how satisfied are you with the presentation of this individual recommendation?'. We will compare means between the intervention and control groups for each domain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Understanding with Multiple Choice Questions</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of survey (approximately 10 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Understanding is defined as the correct comprehension of findings. This outcome will be measured using three multiple-choice questions with four choices and one correct answer. There will be an additional option to select 'not found'. The questions will be: 'what is the recommendation strength?', 'what is the certainty of the evidence?' and 'on which page does the evidence to decision (EtD) table for this recommendation start?'. The proportion of correct responses will be compared between groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preference on a Seven-Point Likert-Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of survey (approximately 10 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Preference is defined as a greater liking of one platform over the other. Participants will be provided with a demonstration of both platforms. They will subsequently answer the question 'between the WHO Tuberculosis Guidelines (current website), and the eTB Guidelines (alternative website), which do you prefer?'. This response will be measured on a Likert-scale (1 = strongly prefer WHO TB, 2 = prefer WHO TB, 3 = somewhat prefer WHO TB, 4 = same preference for WHO TB and eTB, 5 = somewhat prefer eTB, 6 = prefer eTB, 7 = strongly prefer eTB). The means will be compared between the intervention and control groups.</description>

             trial, a user is defined as someone who has previously accessed TB guidelines,&#xD;
             recommendations or policy advice, and a potential user is someone who plans to access&#xD;
             TB guidelines, recommendations, or policy advice in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may be part of any group that has a stake in TB, including the public,&#xD;
             healthcare providers, policymakers, or researchers. Participants may be from either&#xD;
             low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) or high-income countries (HIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They may also vary in levels of education and previous TB work experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
