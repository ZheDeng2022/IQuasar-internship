  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase I study is to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy&#xD;
      and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CBP-1008, a bi-specific ligand&#xD;
      conjugated drugs in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ia/Ib, open-label, multicenter study has two stages. The Ia stage is a&#xD;
      dose-escalation study that will focus on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, MTD and&#xD;
      RP2D. Patients with advanced solid tumor who failed from previous standard treatment or&#xD;
      without standard therapy exists will be enrolled in the phase Ia study. DLT observation&#xD;
      period is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in phase Ib part will be recruited into certain tumor cohorts and receive RP2D&#xD;
      CBP-1008 iv infusion every two weeks. Primary efficacy of ORR, DCR, PFS, etc., will be&#xD;
      evaluated. The correlation between tumor response and the receptors will be explored. Safety&#xD;
      information will be collected in phase Ib stage.&#xD;
