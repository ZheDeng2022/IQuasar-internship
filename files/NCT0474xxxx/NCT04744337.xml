      The aim of this study is to document the changes brought about in the internal anatomic&#xD;
      relationships of the TMJ complex,positional changes of glenoid fossa with respect to adjacent&#xD;
      cranial structures after completion of fixed orthodontic treatment in adolescent females&#xD;
      initially treated with removable functional appliances for skeletal class II, Angle's class&#xD;
      II division 2 Malocclusion.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Angle's class II division 2 malocclusion is subtype of Angle's class II malocclusion with&#xD;
      unique facial, dental and craniofacial features which differentiate it from other&#xD;
      malocclusions so much that it has been said to be a syndrome itself. Its frequency lies&#xD;
      between 1.5 and 5% of all malocclusions found in a white western population. Hypertrophic&#xD;
      masticatory muscles as documented in class II division 2 are directed in more anterior&#xD;
      direction leading to increased magnitude of occlusal forces and hence increased TMJ loading.&#xD;
      TMJ morphology depends, to an extent on occlusal loads acting on it, so class II division 2&#xD;
      malocclusion patients are expected to have specific TMJ complex morphology. Condyle position&#xD;
      changes from anterior to posterior with age in class II division 2 cases. The use of&#xD;
      functional orthopedic appliances to correct Class II malocclusions associated with&#xD;
      retrognathic mandibles is indicated for the first phase of orthodontic treatment. A second&#xD;
      phase of treatment is undertaken with fixed orthodontic appliances to obtain occlusal&#xD;
      refinement. Although various investigations have shown the efficiency of this method of&#xD;
      treatment, the mechanism by which the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) responds to the treatment&#xD;
      is controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various techniques have been used to image the TMJ which include Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      (MRI), Cephalograms, Orthopantomograms , Tomograms , Bone scintigraphy with radiologic&#xD;
      markers like 99mTc-MDP, Arthroscopy and Arthrography , CT scanning, Cone Beam Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (CBCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a multiplanar imaging technique, has the advantage of&#xD;
      giving an accurate assessment of both the bony and the soft tissues. This technique is&#xD;
      believed to be non-invasive, radiation free and gives more superior contrast resolution than&#xD;
      any other imaging modality. MRI is considered the imaging modality of choice for assessment&#xD;
      of internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint. According to Akar et al &quot;Bony&#xD;
      structures and especially soft tissues of the TMJ can be examined by means of MRI and the&#xD;
      relations of the tissues with each other can be evaluated.&quot; MRI studies have been done on&#xD;
      fixed functional appliances which show significant displacement of condyle during treatment&#xD;
      but later condyles returned to pre treatment positions at the end of fixed functional&#xD;
      appliance treatment. Results documented in fixed functional appliance may not be same in&#xD;
      removable appliances. Effects of removable functional appliances on the condyle-glenoid fossa&#xD;
      (C-GF) complex have been studied with respect to the Frankel, Activator, Twin block and&#xD;
      Bionator appliances. Franco et al found that Frankel therapy resulted in a 'more normal'&#xD;
      articular disc morphology. Arat et al. concluded that disc positions were insignificant after&#xD;
      6 months of Activator therapy Chintakanon et al. concluded that Twin Block therapy had&#xD;
      neither positive nor negative effects on disc position, and there was little evidence that&#xD;
      the disc was recaptured. They also noted anterior positioning of the condylar head (CH) in&#xD;
      the glenoid fossa after 6 months of Twin Block therapy. It should be noted that all of above&#xD;
      studies are limited to the phase of removable functional appliance therapy only in Class II&#xD;
      division 1 and no MRI study has attempted to evaluate the changes in the position of the&#xD;
      Condyle-Glenoid Fossa (C-GF) complex treated with removable functional appliance therapy,&#xD;
      followed by fixed orthodontic treatment in Class II division 2 malocclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aidar et al have studied changes in temporomandibular joint disc position and form following&#xD;
      Herbst and fixed orthodontic treatment and found that at the end of the bi-phasic treatment&#xD;
      the position and form of the initial articular discs were maintained. Kinzinger, et al.&#xD;
      studied the effects of fixed orthodontic treatment in the case of skeletal class II on the&#xD;
      position of the articular disc and condyle using MRI on 20 subjects and concluded that&#xD;
      treatment did not alter the position of articular disc and even noticed an improvement in the&#xD;
      anterior disc displacement in 8 joints out of 40. No studies have been done on bi-phasic&#xD;
      treatment of skeletal class II, Angle's class II division 2 involving removable functional&#xD;
      appliances in the first phase followed by fixed orthodontic treatment in second phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to document the changes brought about in the internal&#xD;
      anatomic relationships of the TMJ complex , positional changes of glenoid fossa with respect&#xD;
      to adjacent cranial structures after completion of fixed orthodontic treatment in adolescent&#xD;
      females initially treated with removable functional appliances for skeletal class II, Angle's&#xD;
      class II division 2 malocclusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a longitudinal clinical trial to evaluate TMJ disc-condyle-fossa relationship using MRI&#xD;
      scan following bi-phasic therapy in skeletal Class II, Angle's class II division 2&#xD;
      malocclusion in adolescent females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will be conducted in the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial&#xD;
      Orthopedics, PGIDS, in association with the Department of Radiology, PGIMS, and Department of&#xD;
      Oral Radiology, PGIDS, Pt B. D. Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical clearance- The study will be carried out in humans after the institutional approval&#xD;
      obtained from ethical committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source of Data The study sample will consist of the subjects from the Department of&#xD;
      Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, PGIDS , who will be successfully completing the&#xD;
      prefunctional and functional appliance therapy for correction of skeletal class II, Angle's&#xD;
      class II division 2 malocclusion and will be ready for fixed orthodontic treatment for final&#xD;
      finishing and detailing of occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT OF THE PATIENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      A valid, bilingual informed written consent of the patient or parent/guardian will be&#xD;
      obtained from the patient before registering the patient in this clinical study. Patients&#xD;
      will be informed of all the theoretical risks and benefits of the interventions under test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and design of study The study sample will consist of those 14 adolescent females&#xD;
      who had been treated initially with pre functional and functional appliance therapy for&#xD;
      skeletal Class II, Angle's class II division 2 malocclusion and had following MRI scans done&#xD;
      during the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage- A (pre-treatment), Stage- B (after pre-functional therapy) Stage- C (After completion&#xD;
      of Functional Appliance Therapy) These patients will be further treated with fixed&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment for final finishing and detailing and an MRI will be taken after&#xD;
      debonding of fixed orthodontic appliance (stage D). MRI scans thus obtained will be evaluated&#xD;
      for documenting changes in the morphology and anatomic positions of condylar head, articular&#xD;
      disc and glenoid fossa and will be traced for the various angular and linear metric&#xD;
      measurements MRI scans of the TMJ will be obtained with a 1.5/3 Tesla Philips Intera Nova&#xD;
      Gradient (Netherlands) scanner equipped with Sense Head 6 channel coil for simultaneous&#xD;
      imaging of right and left joints. Sagittal images will be taken perpendicular to the long&#xD;
      axis of the condylar head and the coronal images will be taken parallel to the long axis of&#xD;
      the condylar head. The images will be recorded in maximum intercuspation after debonding of&#xD;
      fixed orthodontic appliance. The MRI protocol will include PD TSE (Turbo Spin Echo) sequence&#xD;
      (TR 1500/ TE 30/ FoV 150x150 mm) T1 spin echo sequences (TR 450⁄TE 15⁄FoV 160x160 mm) and T2&#xD;
      TSE sequence (TR 2424⁄ TE 100⁄FoV 160x160 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIXED MECHANOTHERAPY TREATMENT PHASE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be having cases in class I/ superclass I molar relation and lateral open bite&#xD;
      may be present in premolar regions after the completion of functional phase. The final fixed&#xD;
      orthodontic phase will be taken up for the final finishing and detailing of the occlusion&#xD;
      after the retentive phase of functional appliance therapy is completed. It involves banding&#xD;
      and bonding of both upper and lower arches with MBT 0.022&quot; appliance. Progressive wire&#xD;
      sequences to be used are 0.014&quot; NiTi, 0.016&quot; NiTi, 0.018&quot; NiTi, 0.017&quot; x 0.025&quot; NiTi, 0.019&quot;x&#xD;
      0.025&quot; NiTi, , 0.019&quot;x 0.025&quot; S.S., 0.014&quot; S.S. Once stainless steel archwires are in place,&#xD;
      class II elastics may be prescribed to the patient to prevent relapse of class I molar&#xD;
      relation achieved. Cases are to be finished in class I molar intercuspation with normal&#xD;
      overjet and overbite. Appliance will be debonded and final MRI (stage D) will taken for all&#xD;
      the patients. Hawley's retainer with anterior bite plane will serve for retention of achieved&#xD;
      results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of MRI stages&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done with the help of following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANGULAR AND LINEAR MEASUREMENTS The eminence angle and the sagittal disc position measured in&#xD;
      relation to two reference lines: the posterior condylar line (PC line) and the Frankfurt&#xD;
      Horizontal plane (FH Plane). The PC line to be drawn directly on the MRI scan, while the FH&#xD;
      plane transferred from the lateral cephalogram to the MRI scan, according to the method given&#xD;
      by Nebbe et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfer of FH plane Determination of long axis of the condyle will be done by two step&#xD;
      circle center method by Nebbe et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANGULAR MEASUREMENTS 1-2) The eminence angle and the coronal disc position will be evaluated&#xD;
      by the method described by Chintakanon et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) The sagittal disc position will be evaluated using PC line and FH plane as described by&#xD;
      Chintakanon et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) Sagittal condylar concentricity will be evaluated using the method described by Pullinger&#xD;
      et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5) The glenoid fossa angle will be measured on the sagittal films as the angle between the&#xD;
      tangents to the anterior and posterior slopes of the glenoid fossa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LINEAR MEASUREMENTS 6) Condyle and glenoid fossa displacements: The position of the glenoid&#xD;
      fossa, and that of the condyle, will be evaluated with respect to the centre of the external&#xD;
      auditory meatus (c-EAM). by marking one point at the centre of condyle (c-CH) and the linear&#xD;
      distance of the c-CH from the c-EAM will be evaluated as the shortest distance from the&#xD;
      constructed FH perpendicular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7) Distance between c-PGS (crest of the post-glenoid spine ) &amp; c-EAM : One point will be&#xD;
      marked at the crest of the post-glenoid spine (c-PGS) and the linear distance of the c-PGS&#xD;
      from the c-EAM will be evaluated as the shortest distance from the constructed FH&#xD;
      perpendicular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8) Superior joint space will be measured from the shortest distance between the most superior&#xD;
      point of the condyle and the most superior point of the mandibular fossa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The final data recorded will be processed by standard statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
