      Background A growing body of research recognises the key role of both parental sensitivity&#xD;
      and mentalizing in fostering positive parent-child relationships. This, in turn, is&#xD;
      fundamental for a child's mental health and intergenerational transmission of attachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parental sensitivity concerns a parent's ability to perceive and interpret their child's cues&#xD;
      accurately and to respond accordingly in a contingent manner (Ainsworth et al., 1978).&#xD;
      Parental sensitivity has been associated with the development of attachment and general&#xD;
      socio-emotional development in childhood. The association between parental sensitivity and&#xD;
      cognitive variables like joint attention, executive functioning development in early&#xD;
      childhood and Theory of Mind in preschoolers has also demonstrated it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The caregiver's capacity to think of his/her child in terms of mental state (i.e., parental&#xD;
      mentalizing or parental reflective functioning) is linked with the development of affect&#xD;
      regulation in the child, with the intergenerational transmission of attachment and with the&#xD;
      development of social and reflective abilities in childhood. Evidence also suggests that&#xD;
      mentalizing may constitute a protective factor for the transmission of psychopathology in&#xD;
      childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *THE INTERVENTION*&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present intervention aims to improve parental sensitivity and mentalizing in depressed&#xD;
      mothers using a model based on video-feedback methodology in an online modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole intervention consists of 4 sessions plus 1 pre-intervention assessment session.&#xD;
      Additionally, there is 1 weekly group supervision, along with the therapist independent work&#xD;
      on the case between sessions. Each intervention's session has the same structure: Checking&#xD;
      outcomes from the previous session; Videofeedback; New video recording; Post-interview; Tasks&#xD;
      definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between each session, the therapist analyses the material independently and attends group&#xD;
      supervision. Each element of the intervention is described in detail below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRE-INTERVENTION ASSESSMENT Methodology: Online, delivered by a trained clinical psychologist&#xD;
      Duration and frequency: 90 minutes, once.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Questionnaires and scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Sociodemographic information questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Children social-emotional screening (ASQ SE).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Mothers depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; EDPS; Patient&#xD;
                Health Questionnaire; PHQ-9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Video recording of free mother-baby play at the end of the session (coded with the&#xD;
           Emotional Availability Scale; EAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MINI PDI interview (after video recording).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form (CTQ-SF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Examination of the mother's concerns regarding the child, their relationship, or her as&#xD;
           a mother. Discussion of the mother's reason for referral and intervention goals&#xD;
           definition, integrating the mother's concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THERAPIST INDEPENDENT WORK General Description: Review of case's background information,&#xD;
      video analysis and VF script elaboration Duration and frequency: 60 minutes weekly. The free&#xD;
      play video -recorded in the initial assessment is watched and analysed, and then resources&#xD;
      and opportunities are identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention's goal is defined considering the mother's concerns and the reason for&#xD;
      referral defined in the initial assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Segments of 30 and 60 seconds are selected by stopping the video at the end of the&#xD;
      interaction sequence. Both the start and end's times are written down on the script. It is&#xD;
      recommended to show the complete video unless negative segments are identified (i.e.,&#xD;
      segments in which the mother appears as hostile or insensitive when the child appears&#xD;
      severely under-regulated). In such cases, it might be necessary to consider only the positive&#xD;
      sequences or selecting specific images within the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific goals to be achieved in each selected segment must be identified. Comments and&#xD;
      questions to be made by the therapist should be defined, and these should be linked to each&#xD;
      selected segment's goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUPERVISION Methodology: Online group supervision. Duration and frequency: 120 minutes&#xD;
      weekly. Guidelines: Two guidelines are provided and examined. These documents were developed&#xD;
      to orient both online psychotherapeutic processes in early childhood and psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      interventions using video feedback in 0-5 years old children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the therapist prepares their first case, they must present to the group at least 1&#xD;
      complete VF process. Then, they must present parts of the other cases they will address. In&#xD;
      the first case, the therapist must present a comprehensive diagnosis of the case integrating&#xD;
      the initial assessment results, the complete videos, the completed analyses, the segment&#xD;
      selected and the elaborated script. At further sessions, the therapist would have to present&#xD;
      not the whole process but only particular aspects of each case or about his work as a&#xD;
      therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supervision has a reflective methodology, and the experience of each of the&#xD;
      intervention's participants is considered (i.e., supervisor, child, caregiver and therapist).&#xD;
      In the supervision space, the supervisor can also act as a supportive figure for the&#xD;
      therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION'S SESSIONS Methodology: Online and delivered by the same therapist that made the&#xD;
      initial assessment. Duration and frequency: 60 minutes weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Checking outcomes from the previous sessions. Starting from session 2. A space for discussing&#xD;
      the caregiver's perceptions about changes in the relationship related to the former session's&#xD;
      tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video Feedback. The topic of each session addresses the contents of the video recorded in the&#xD;
      previous session. First, the structure of the session is explained to the mother. Next, the&#xD;
      mother is asked about the video recorded -this is useful to check if what she remembers is&#xD;
      consistent with what was observed-. After that, the Video Feedback intervention's goal is&#xD;
      presented to the mother, explaining its benefits and exploring their perceptions around this&#xD;
      issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the video sequences previously selected are shown. Before commenting, it is important&#xD;
      to ask the mother to observe and describe objectively (i.e., without making inferences) what&#xD;
      she is watching, to check that both caregiver and therapist are watching the same and&#xD;
      therefore, reflecting about the same contents. For example, a caregiver watching a video&#xD;
      might say &quot;my son does not want to play with me&quot; when the child is focused on playing with a&#xD;
      toy. In those cases, it can be useful to ask the mother again to describe what was watched&#xD;
      without interpreting. In this way, we check that we are both watching the same, which is key&#xD;
      for our comments to be well received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video Recording. Each session has a moment when a new interaction following a new instruction&#xD;
      is recorded (e.g., playing, feeding, singing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Interview. After each video recording, a semi-structured interview is carried out with&#xD;
      the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (About the mother herself) What was the most pleasant aspect of the interaction with your&#xD;
      baby? Why? What was the most difficult aspect of the interaction with your baby? Why? (About&#xD;
      the baby) What do you think was the most pleasant aspect of the interaction for your baby?&#xD;
      What made you think that ___ was the most pleasant aspect for your baby? What do you think&#xD;
      was the most difficult aspect of the interaction for him/her? What made you think that___ was&#xD;
      the most difficult aspect for him/her? (About the interaction) Has this type of interaction&#xD;
      with your baby happened before? (if yes) Could you please give me an example? Could you&#xD;
      describe what caught your attention or what you learned about yourself, your baby or your&#xD;
      relationship after this interaction?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tasks definition: behaviours or activities to perform during the week are defined. These can&#xD;
      be proposed by the therapist or emerge from what the mother learnt in the video feedback.&#xD;
      Examples: playing 5 minutes, 3 times per week with; observe the baby's preferences in a&#xD;
      specific context, support the baby in reaching a new ability; among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *THE STUDY*&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Cluster randomized controlled trial feasibility and pilot study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Mothers presenting depressive symptoms will be invited from three public&#xD;
      primary health centres from Santiago, Valparaíso and Puerto Varas. Sample size will be 60&#xD;
      (control group [CG]=30; experimental group [EG]=30), based on similar studies and general&#xD;
      recommendation for pilot studies1819.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Professionals delivering the intervention must be psychologists with at least 1 year of&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Participants will be invited by a primary health worker. On participation&#xD;
      agreement, they will be contacted to perform the first interview to assess eligibility and&#xD;
      sign an informed consent (as established by the PUC Ethical Committee). After that,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to CG or EG in a 1:1 ratio. A random number sequence will be&#xD;
      computer-generated in varying block sizes (2&amp;4) and stratified by centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a mentalization-based VFI developed by Olhaberry and colleagues aimed to improve&#xD;
      maternal sensitivity, a 4 sessions internet VFI will be manualized. Therapists will be&#xD;
      trained in the model over 3 days (24 hours) and then supervised session by session. The&#xD;
      CORE-OM and an assessment of the therapist's adherence to the model will be used during&#xD;
      supervision. For this purpose, each session will be video recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CG, psycho-educational intervention: They will receive weekly information on parenting in the&#xD;
      1st year of life. They will have direct contact (via WhatsApp) with a child psychologist to&#xD;
      ask questions about the material and to refer to specialized support if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be taken before the first session, after treatment, and in a 3 -months&#xD;
      follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments: 1. Sociodemographic information questionnaire; Parental Sensitivity (Primary&#xD;
      Outcome; Emotional Availability Scale; EAS; 2. Secondary outcomes: Parental Reflective&#xD;
      Functioning (Parent Development Interview-Revised, Short Version; PDI-R); Children&#xD;
      Social-emotional screening 3. Covariates: Mothers depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal&#xD;
      Depression Scale; EDPS; Patient Health Questionnaire; PHQ-9); Childhood Trauma Questionnaire&#xD;
      Short Form (CTQ-SF)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Outcomes: Descriptive statistics to establish CG's and EG's clinical and&#xD;
      sociodemographic variables, eligibility and recruitment rate, and adherence. ANCOVA will be&#xD;
      used to determine differences between groups, controlling for a baseline for each outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational measures will be applied by a certified pair of coders. Cohen-kappa will be&#xD;
      used for Inter-rater reliability. Qualitative study: to assess participant's satisfaction&#xD;
      with the intervention, semi-structured interviews will be conducted after the trial's end. 4&#xD;
      mothers from each centre will be interviewed, selected according to the presence/absence of&#xD;
      change in the main outcome (2 presenting change/2 not presenting change, to ensure&#xD;
      variability). Additionally, a focus group will be performed with VF therapists (3&#xD;
      professionals for each centre; 9 in total). Interviews aim to collect information regarding&#xD;
      the feasibility of performing the intervention and also training and supervision experience.&#xD;
      Interviews' data will be analyzed using Grounded Theory´s open coding.&#xD;
