      The goal of the current study is to measure the requirement for threonine in patients with CD&#xD;
      using the IAAO method and compare the requirement to previously determined threonine&#xD;
      requirement estimated in young adults using the IAAO technique. It is hypothesize that the&#xD;
      requirement for threonine in patients with CD will be higher than the threonine requirement&#xD;
      previously determined in young adults using the IAAO method. Up to 10 clinically stable&#xD;
      patients with CD will be recruited from the IBD Clinic at Mt. Sinai Hospital, Toronto, and&#xD;
      subsequently followed up at the Clinical Research Center (CRC), The Hospital for Sick&#xD;
      Children (SickKids), Toronto, Canada. Before the study begins, the participants will be&#xD;
      required to visit the CRC (Room 5500 Hill Wing, The Hospital for Sick Children) for a&#xD;
      pre-study assessment of their height, weight, fat mass, fat free mass, resting metabolic rate&#xD;
      and medical history. These assessments will take about 3 hours to complete. They will need to&#xD;
      have been fasted for 10 hours prior to the pre-study assessment. The pre-study assessment is&#xD;
      needed to calculate their dietary requirements for the study, and to assess health status.&#xD;
      After signing the consent form, the subjects will complete the screening procedures (height,&#xD;
      weight, fasting blood sample and medical history questionnaire, BIA, Skinfold and&#xD;
      calorimetry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study will consist of a 2-day adaptation period to a prescribed diet in accordance with&#xD;
      the energy requirement of the subject and 1-study day. The diet will provide an adequate&#xD;
      amount of protein, of 1 g protein/kg/d. The 2-day adaptation period is to allow the body to&#xD;
      adapt to an adequate amount of protein as it has been shown that protein kinetics is altered&#xD;
      without it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intakes during this time will be provided in the form of lactose-free milk shakes&#xD;
      (Scandishake) with added carbohydrate (SolCarb) and protein (beneprotein) to meet the&#xD;
      subjects' requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 2 days of adaptation is the study day where threonine intake will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned and phenylalanine (Phe) kinetics will be measured with the use of isotopically&#xD;
      labelled Phe. On this day, VCO2 will be measured by calorimetry immediately after the 5th&#xD;
      meal for a period of 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the study day (3rd day of each 3-day period), the diet will be provided as 8 hourly&#xD;
      isocaloric, isonitrogenous meals made up of a flavored liquid formula and protein free&#xD;
      cookies developed for use in amino acid kinetic studies. Each meal will represent 1/12th of&#xD;
      the subject's total daily requirements. The nitrogen (protein) content of the diet will be&#xD;
      provided in the form of a crystalline amino acid mixture based on the amino acid composition&#xD;
      of egg protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A daily multivitamin supplement will be provided during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No other food or beverages will be consumed on the adaptation days except water, 1 cup&#xD;
           clear tea, or 1 cup clear coffee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the 8-hr study day, no other food or drink will be consumed except water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine and breath samples will be collected at baseline and at isotopic steady state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breath samples will be collected simultaneously with urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Five baseline breath samples will be collected 60, 45, 30, 15 min, and just before the&#xD;
           tracer protocol begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three baseline urine samples will be collected 60, 30 min, and just before the tracer&#xD;
           protocol begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four plateau breath samples will be collected every 15 minutes 2.5 h after the tracer&#xD;
           protocol begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three plateau breath samples will be collected every 30 minutes 2.5 h after the tracer&#xD;
           protocol begin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breath samples will be collected with subjects breathing into an Exetainers plastic tube&#xD;
           and samples will be stored in pre-evacuated glass tubes at room temperature until&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine samples will be collected in Eppendorf tubes and stored at - 20 ยบ C until analyzed&#xD;
           for 1-13C phenylalanine enrichment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rate of CO2 production (VCO2) will be measured on each testing day using a&#xD;
           ventilated hood indirect calorimeter at meal 5 to quantify 13CO2 excretion in breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects can choose to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, based on&#xD;
      his/her individual judgment. In particular, if a subject is unable to tolerate the diet,&#xD;
      whether it is regards to taste, loose stools or constipated stools, he/she has the right to&#xD;
      withdraw at any time during the study.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND The current Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) recommendations for essential amino&#xD;
      acid requirements are based on recommendations for young healthy adults and have not been&#xD;
      directly determined in patients with Crohn's disease. Protein and amino acids are key&#xD;
      components of our diet. Having defined the requirement of the essential amino acid, Threonine&#xD;
      in healthy adults using the IAAO, the investigators are now in an ideal position to define&#xD;
      the needs in vulnerable populations, such as patients with chronic inflammatory conditions,&#xD;
      such as Crohn's disease (CD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in animals suggest an increase in the threonine requirement in Crohn's and colitis&#xD;
      models. If this is also true in humans, knowledge of the threonine requirement in patients&#xD;
      with IBD could provide valuable information for improvement in medical nutritional management&#xD;
      of this patient population. Improved medical nutrition therapy could likely shorten recovery&#xD;
      time and/or increase the period of remission in patients with IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indicator Amino Acid Oxidation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the requirement for threonine in patients with CD will be higher than&#xD;
      the threonine requirement previously determined in young adults using the IAAO method (19&#xD;
      mg/kg/d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the requirement for threonine in patients with CD using the IAAO technique;&#xD;
           by measuring the oxidation of L-[1-13 C] phenylalanine to 13 CO 2 [F 13 CO 2] in&#xD;
           response to graded intakes of leucine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare, on the basis of body weight and fat-free mass, the requirement derived from&#xD;
           this study to the requirement of threonine determined previously in young adults by the&#xD;
           IAAO method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 10 clinically stable patients with CD will be recruited from the IBD Clinic at Mt.&#xD;
      Sinai Hospital, Toronto, who will be identified by Dr. Mark Silverberg for this study and&#xD;
      subsequently followed up at the Clinical Research Center (CRC), The Hospital for Sick&#xD;
      Children (SickKids), Toronto, Canada. Before the study begins, the participants will be&#xD;
      required to visit the CRC (Room 5500 Hill Wing, The Hospital for Sick Children) for a&#xD;
      pre-study assessment of their height, weight, fat mass, fat free mass, resting metabolic rate&#xD;
      and medical history. These assessments will take about 3 hours to complete. They will need to&#xD;
      have been fasted for 10 hours prior to the pre-study assessment. We need the pre-study&#xD;
      assessment to calculate their dietary requirements for the study, and to assess health&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the consent form, the subjects will complete the screening procedures (height,&#xD;
      weight, fasting blood sample and medical history questionnaire, BIA, Skinfold and&#xD;
      calorimetry).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The voluntaries will receive financial compensation for the costs incurred while&#xD;
           participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All procedures in the study will be approved by the Research Ethics Board at SickKids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental design will be based on the minimally invasive IAAO model for collecting&#xD;
      breath and urine, instead of blood during the study day. A maximum total of 50 IAAO studies&#xD;
      will be carried out to determine the requirement for threonine in patients with CD. Up to 10&#xD;
      male patients with CD will be recruited. Each subject will be studied for at least 2 intake&#xD;
      levels and up to at a maximum of 5 different intake levels of threonine. Each level of intake&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the pre-study assessment, the subject's resting energy expenditure (REE) will be measured&#xD;
      by continuous, open-circuit indirect calorimetry, and body composition will be measured by&#xD;
      skinfold thickness and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Subjects will also be weighed&#xD;
      at the pre-study assessment and at the start of each IAAO study day to ensure accurate&#xD;
      prescription of diets and isotopes, and to confirm weight maintenance throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study will consist of a 2-day adaptation period to a prescribed diet in accordance with&#xD;
      the energy requirement of the subject and 1-study day. The diet will provide an adequate&#xD;
      amount of protein, of 1 g proteinโkg-1โd-1. The 2-day adaptation period is to allow the body&#xD;
      to adapt to an adequate amount of protein as it has been shown that protein kinetics is&#xD;
      altered without it. Following the 2 days of adaptation is the study day where threonine&#xD;
      intake will be randomly assigned and phenylalanine (Phe) kinetics will be measured with the&#xD;
      use of L-[1-13C]Phe. On this day, VCO2 will be measured by calorimetry immediately after the&#xD;
      5th meal for a period of 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Intake and Experimental Diet:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-day protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On days 1 and 2, the subject will consume an adaptation diet and on the 3rd day&#xD;
           participate in an 8-hour testing period. Each 3-day protocol will be separated by at&#xD;
           least one week (wash-out period).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary intakes during the 2-day adaptation period before the day 3 IAAO study will be&#xD;
           provided in the form of lactose-free milk shakes (Scandishake) with added carbohydrate&#xD;
           (SolCarb) and protein (beneprotein) to meet the subjects' requirement. The protein will&#xD;
           be provided from the scandishake as milk protein (casein and whey) and providing&#xD;
           1g.kg-1.day-1 protein intake. Total calories will be provided as resting energy&#xD;
           expenditure (REE) measure by indirect calorimetry and multiplied by 1.7. On the&#xD;
           adaptation days, the diet will be provided as four isonitrogenous, isocaloric meals&#xD;
           spread evenly throughout the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the study day (3rd day of each 3-day period), the diet will be provided as 8 hourly&#xD;
           isocaloric, isonitrogenous meals made up of a flavored liquid formula and protein free&#xD;
           cookies developed for use in amino acid kinetic studies. Each meal will represent 1/12th&#xD;
           of the subject's total daily requirements. The nitrogen (protein) content of the diet&#xD;
           will be provided in the form of a crystalline amino acid mixture based on the amino acid&#xD;
           composition of egg protein. The energy intake on the study day will be provided as REE x&#xD;
           1.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tyrosine will be provided in excess at 40 mg/kg/day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phenylalanine will be provided at a constant intake of 20mg/kg/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Threonine will be provided at graded intakes ranging from 3-45 mg/kg/d and alanine&#xD;
           levels will be adjusted to balance the changing levels of leucine and ensure formulas&#xD;
           are isonitrogenous.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A daily multivitamin supplement will be provided during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No other food or beverages will be consumed on the adaptation days except water, 1 cup&#xD;
           clear tea, or 1cup clear coffee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the 8-hr study day, no other food or drink will be consumed except water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study day diet will be divided into 8 isonitrogenous, isocaloric meals each&#xD;
           representing one-twelfth of the total subjectยดs daily requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the morning of each study day, the subject will consume 4 of the hourly meals at home&#xD;
           and then visit the research laboratory. The subject will then start to consume the&#xD;
           remaining 4 out of the 8 isocaloric meals at hourly intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 5 dietary threonine intake levels will be tested in random order as mentioned&#xD;
           under &quot;experimental design&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1-13C phenylalanine will be given as the tracer in the 5th meal and continue to be&#xD;
           administered with the remaining meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body-composition measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      โข Body composition will be determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA and multiple&#xD;
      skin fold-thickness measurements at the beginning of study during the pre-study assessment.&#xD;
      Four Skinfold thicknesses (triceps, biceps, subscapular, and suprailiac) will be measured to&#xD;
      obtain estimates of fat mass. BIA will be performed by using a fixed-frequency analyzer (50&#xD;
      kHz; BIA model 101A: RJL Systems). Equations described previously will be used to calculate&#xD;
      FFM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isotope Infusion Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1-13C phenylalanine will be used as the isotope. Oral priming dose of 0.66 mg/kg will be&#xD;
           administered with the fifth meal, and an hourly oral dose of 1.2 mg/kg/d will begin&#xD;
           simultaneously and continue for 3 hrs with meals 6, 7 and 8. A total of 4 isotopic doses&#xD;
           are given to ensure background 13CO2 in breath reaches equilibration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the same time which the priming dose of L-[13C]phe is administered, an oral priming&#xD;
           dose of 0.176 mg/kg of bicarbonate (NaH13CO3) will also be given&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The amount of phenylalanine given as the isotope on the study day will be subtracted&#xD;
           from dietary phenylalanine to maintain the total dietary intake at 20 mg Phe /kg/d&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tyrosine intake will be maintained at 40 mgโkg-1โd-1 to ensure an excess of tyrosine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breath and urine samples are collected periodically before and after the tracers are&#xD;
           consumed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine and breath samples will be collected at baseline and at isotopic steady state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breath samples will be collected simultaneously with urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Five baseline breath samples will be collected 60, 45, 30, 15 min, and just before the&#xD;
           tracer protocol begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three baseline urine samples will be collected 60, 30 min, and just before the tracer&#xD;
           protocol begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four plateau breath samples will be collected every 15 minutes 2.5 h after the tracer&#xD;
           protocol begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three plateau breath samples will be collected every 30 minutes 2.5 h after the tracer&#xD;
           protocol begin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breath samples will be collected with subjects breathing into an Exetainers plastic tube&#xD;
           and samples will be stored in pre-evacuated glass tubes at room temperature until&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine samples will be collected in Eppendorf tubes and stored at - 20 ยบ C until analyzed&#xD;
           for 1-13C phenylalanine enrichment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rate of CO2 production (VCO2) will be measured on each testing day using a&#xD;
           ventilated hood indirect calorimeter at meal 5 to quantify 13CO2 excretion in breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breath: expired 13 CO2 enrichment will be measured by continuous flow isotope ratio mass&#xD;
           spectrometer (IRMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinary 1-13C phenylalanine enrichment will be analyzed by gas chromatography tandem&#xD;
           mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of Isotopic Kinetics Whole-body phenylalanine flux will be calculated as&#xD;
      previously described according to the stochastic model of Matthews et al. Isotopic steady&#xD;
      state in the tracer enrichment at baseline and plateau will be represented as the unchanging&#xD;
      values of L-[1-13C]phenylalanine in urine and 13CO2 in breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenylalanine flux (umol/kg/h) will be calculated from the dilution of orally administered&#xD;
      13C-phenylalanine into the metabolic pool (at steady state) by using enrichment of 13C-&#xD;
      phenylalanine in urine. The rate of appearance of 13CO2 in breath (F13CO2 umol/kg/h) after&#xD;
      the oxidation of ingested 13C-phenylalanine will be calculated according to the model of&#xD;
      Matthews et al., by using a factor of 0.82 to account for carbon dioxide retained in the&#xD;
      body's bicarbonate pool. The rate of phenylalanine oxidation (umol/kg/h) will be calculated&#xD;
      from F13CO2 and urinary 13C-phenylalanine enrichment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A paired t test will be used to test for: differences in FFM and percentage of body fat;&#xD;
      differences in the two body-composition methods of BIA and skinfold. ANOVA will be used to&#xD;
      test for differences among the various estimates of body composition (fat and FFM), and&#xD;
      correlation analysis will be performed to test for associations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Threonine intakes will be completely randomized within subjects, with the amount of threonine&#xD;
      intake serving as the main treatment effect. The effect of threonine on phenylalanine flux,&#xD;
      oxidation, and F13CO2 will be tested by using a mixed linear model with subject as a random&#xD;
      variable (PROC MIXED) by using SAS. Differences between individual fluxes will be compared by&#xD;
      ANOVA, with post hoc analysis using the Bonferroni multiple-comparisons test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Threonine requirement will be determined by applying a biphasic linear regression crossover&#xD;
      analysis to determine the breakpoint (EAR) and subsequently calculate the 95% CI. The mean&#xD;
      threonine requirement will be estimated by applying a nonlinear mixed-effects model (PROC&#xD;
      NLMIXED; SAS Institute) to the oxidation and F13CO2 data. Observations within subjects will&#xD;
      be regarded as statistically depended.&#xD;
