  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last few years, high-definition (HD) videobronchoscopy has become widely available in&#xD;
      the market and will progressively become the standard of care for airway inspection and&#xD;
      sampling, as it provides substantially higher resolution images as compared to conventional&#xD;
      white light bronchoscopy. Furthermore, in combination with improved video processor units,&#xD;
      some HD videobronchoscopes offer post-processing real-time image enhancement (i-scan&#xD;
      technology). Preliminary studies, performed in the setting of lung cancer, suggest that HD&#xD;
      bronchoscopy with optical image enhancement (OE) may result in better detection of subtle&#xD;
      vascular abnormalities in the airways, which are often associated with preneoplastic lesions.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that HD videobronchoscopy could help identify bronchial involvement from&#xD;
      sarcoidosis before it is (plainly) visible by conventional bronchoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a systemic disorder of unknown cause that primarily involves the lung and&#xD;
      lymphatic systems and that can be more reliably diagnosed if a compatible clinical picture is&#xD;
      combined with a pathologic demonstration of non-necrotizing epithelioid-cell granulomas. As&#xD;
      the thorax (bronchi, lung parenchyma, and/or intrathoracic lymph nodes) is almost invariably&#xD;
      involved, bronchoscopy with its ancillary sampling procedures (endobronchial biopsy,&#xD;
      transbronchial lung biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage, conventional and ultrasound&#xD;
      guided-transbronchial needle aspiration, endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration)&#xD;
      has been the diagnostic tool most frequently used to confirm pathologically the clinical&#xD;
      suspect of sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the possible bronchoscopic sampling procedures, endobronchial biopsy (EBB), which is&#xD;
      the easiest and safest, has long been used, even though its value has been assessed in small&#xD;
      studies, mostly retrospective. Although its diagnostic yield has been shown to be widely&#xD;
      variable (5%-71%) across different studies, EBB has constantly demonstrated to increase the&#xD;
      diagnostic success of bronchoscopy in sarcoidosis when coupled with other sampling methods.&#xD;
      In the last few years, high-definition (HD) videobronchoscopy has become widely available in&#xD;
      the market and will progressively become the standard of care for airway inspection and&#xD;
      sampling, as it provides substantially higher resolution images as compared to conventional&#xD;
      white light bronchoscopy. Furthermore, in combination with improved video processor units,&#xD;
      some HD videobronchoscopes offer post-processing real-time image enhancement (i-scan&#xD;
      technology). Preliminary studies, performed in the setting of lung cancer, suggest that HD&#xD;
      bronchoscopy with optical image enhancement (OE) may result in better detection of subtle&#xD;
      vascular abnormalities in the airways, which are often associated with preneoplastic lesions.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that HD videobronchoscopy could help identify bronchial involvement from&#xD;
      sarcoidosis before it is (plainly) visible by conventional bronchoscopy.&#xD;
