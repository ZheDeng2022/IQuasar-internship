  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to conduct a feasibility study to evaluate the potential&#xD;
      for implementing the developed decision support tool with Latina, Black, and non-Latina White&#xD;
      women. The investigators will collect feasibility data and assess the use of the decision&#xD;
      support tool with end-users. The aim is to determine if women using the decision support tool&#xD;
      make more informed choices measured by knowledge, attitudes, and intentions.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in knowledge of screening mammography guidelines as measured by Breast Cancer and Breast Cancer Screening Mammography knowledge questions</measure>
    <time_frame>In both the pre-questionnaire and post-questionnaires occurring in a single encounter in one day (Day 1 approximately 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>-This questionnaire was modified from an existing breast cancer screening knowledge from Hersch et al. This questionnaire covers mammography, screening benefits and downsides, and guidelines. This includes open-ended questions eliciting participants' knowledge regarding the benefits and downsides of screening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feelings of being fully informed and clear about the importance of the components for making informed decisions as measured by the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>In the post-questionnaire occurring in a single encounter in one day (Day 1 approximately 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>-The Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) captures feelings of being fully informed and clear about that the importance of the components for making informed decisions. There are four subscales: uncertainty, informed, values clarity, and support (questions 6-8). This scale has high internal consistency reliability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision self-efficacy as measured by the 3-Point Decision Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>In the post-questionnaire occurring in a single encounter in one day (Day 1 approximately 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>-The 3-Point Decision Self-Efficacy Scale will be modified for breast cancer screening and will measure self-confidence or belief in one's decision-making abilities, including shared decision-making. Questions ask participants how confident they are in a variety of health related skills. This 11 item scale has three response options: &quot;A lot confident&quot;, &quot;A little confident&quot;, &quot;Not confident&quot;. Items are summed and scores are calculated on a range of 0-100. There is high reliability with an alpha of 0.86.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability as measured by the Ottawa Acceptability Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>In the post-questionnaire occurring in a single encounter in one day (Day 1 approximately 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>-Adapted acceptability measures from the Ottawa Acceptability Measures including questions eliciting ratings of the tool regarding length, clarity, balance of information).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Preparation for decision making scale as measured by PrepDM</measure>
    <time_frame>In the post-questionnaire occurring in a single encounter in one day (Day 1 approximately 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>-The Preparation for Decision Making Scale (PrepDM) assesses a patient's perception of how useful a decision aid or educational materials are in making a screening or treatment decision. The 10-item scale uses a 5-point Likert response format, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great deal). Internal reliability of the scale is excellent, with alpha coefficients ranging from 0.92 to 0.96.</description>
