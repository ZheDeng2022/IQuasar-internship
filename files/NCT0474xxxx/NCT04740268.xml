      This pilot study will expand the knowledge and application of needling using the Epistamp&#xD;
      device and its safety and benefits for improving the appearance of atrophic acne scarring.&#xD;
      The pilot aims to objectively measure skin quality using the Derma Scan, photographs and&#xD;
      provide objective data showing improvement by way of the Goodman and Barons quantitative scar&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Derma Scan System utilizes two special lighting systems (RGB +UV) and smart skin analyzer software that allows two images (before and after care) to be compared side by side, which can be used to detect the changes in skin</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Patient satisfaction of skin improvement assessed by the Goodman and Barons quantitative scar scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A global quantitative grading system for assessing the disease load and global severity of disease in a patient with post acne scarring. The Goodman and Baron score considers type of scar, number of scars, and severity of scarring and assigns a grade 1-4 with grade 1 representing mild, macular disease and grade 4 representing severe scarring that is obviously visible at social distances of 50cm, is not easily covered by makeup, and is not able to be flattened by manual stretching of the skin. Lower scores are favorable. Scale will be completed at every office visit over the 6 month study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Skin changes assessed by Acne Scar Subtypes</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Skin improvement assessed by Acne Scar Subtypes for improvement of acne scarring rolling, icepick, and or boxcar subtypes.Ice pick scars are narrow, sharply demarcated, V-shaped tracts, &lt;2 mm in diameter, that extend into the deep dermis or even subcutaneous layer. Boxcar scars are wider (1-4 mm in diameter), U-shaped tracts, with sharp, vertical edges that extend 0.1-0.5 mm into the dermis. Rolling scars are characterised by dermal tethering of the dermis to the subcutis. They are generally â‰¥4 mm in diameter, irregular, with a rolling or undulating appearance.Scale will be completed at every office visit over the 6 month study.</description>

    <description>The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) is a 5-point scale rating global aesthetic improvement in appearance, compared to pretreatment, as judged by the investigator 5 point scale ranging from 1 to 5 with 5 = The appearance has worsen compared with the original condition and 1 = Excellent corrective results</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire (DLQI) is 10 questions were asked to the patients and score is 0-3 for each question. The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>
