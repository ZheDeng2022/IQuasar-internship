  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of patients with Hypoxemic respiratory failure (HRF) and Acute Respiratory Distress&#xD;
      Syndrome (ARDS) is complex. Therapies that have been shown to save the lives of patients with&#xD;
      HRF and ARDS are available but they are not always provided. To reduce practice variation and&#xD;
      improve adherence to evidence-informed therapies, the investigators developed the Treatment&#xD;
      of Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure and ARDS with Protection, Paralysis, and Proning (TheraPPP)&#xD;
      Pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of TheraPPP Pathway is to improve the quality of care for patients with&#xD;
      HRF. Implementation of the pathway across Alberta will test the effectiveness and&#xD;
      implementation of the TheraPPP Pathway.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxemic respiratory failure (HRF) and ARDS are common conditions among patients admitted to&#xD;
      the Intensive care unit (ICU). Treatment of these patients is complex. Evidence based&#xD;
      therapies that can improve survival exist; however, implementation is extremely inconsistent.&#xD;
      As a potential solution to this problem, the investigators developed the Treatment of&#xD;
      Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (HRF) and ARDS with Protection, Paralysis, and Proning&#xD;
      (TheraPPP) Pathway to reduce practice variation and improve adherence to evidence-informed&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TheraPPP pathway is a comprehensive evidence-based, stakeholder-informed pathway for the&#xD;
      diagnosis and management of HRF. The overall objective of the pathway is to improve the&#xD;
      quality of care for patients with HRF. The specific objectives are to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Effectiveness of the pathway. A cost-effectiveness analysis is a secondary objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implementation of the pathway by conducting a process evaluation which will assess&#xD;
           fidelity of the delivered interventions and clinician perceptions about the&#xD;
           acceptability of the pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanically ventilated patients admitted to any one of 17 adult ICUs in Alberta will receive&#xD;
      the intervention. One ICU (Calgary) is the setting for a pilot study (NCT04070053).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For data analysis, the investigators will use chart abstraction to quantitatively assess the&#xD;
      fidelity of the delivered intervention, and surveys and focus groups to qualitatively assess&#xD;
      clinician perceptions about the acceptability of the pathway. Fidelity of the intervention&#xD;
      will be tracked using process of care indicators that reflect the five key steps of the&#xD;
      pathway.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will use an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study design (type 1). Phase 1 will evaluate effectiveness and Phase 2 will assess the implementation of the pathway.&#xD;
Implementation will occur via a pragmatic registry-based stepped wedge cluster randomization of Intensive Care Units (ICUs). The unit of randomization will be a cluster of two ICUs. The intervention will be implemented into one cluster every two months. Once implemented, the cluster will continue to receive it for the remainder of the study.&#xD;
Effectiveness: There will be a 10-month baseline data collection period at the beginning of the study. The total study duration will be 27 months (Estimate: 2496 patients). The comparison (control) therapy will be usual management assessed in the baseline period.&#xD;
Implementation: A process evaluation of TheraPPP pathway implementation will be conducted to 1) quantitatively evaluate fidelity, 2) qualitatively assess acceptability (Estimate 1048 clinicians).</intervention_model_description>
