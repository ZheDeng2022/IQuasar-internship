  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first Intestinal Vascular Emergency Unit (SURVI), with the institutional support of&#xD;
      AP-HP, opened on 4 January 2016, within the Paris-Nord Val de Seine University Hospital&#xD;
      Group. This intensive care is dedicated to the management of mesenteric ischemias (acute&#xD;
      mesenteric ischemias, chronic mesenteric ischemias) and Intestinal Vascular Diseases Without&#xD;
      Ischemia. The organisation of this type of dedicated centre, combining advances in&#xD;
      resuscitation, interventional radiology and knowledge of intestinal vascular diseases, has&#xD;
      led to a radical change in the prognosis for acute mesenteric ischaemia with a survival rate&#xD;
      of over 80% and an intestinal resection rate of less than 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is characterised by the combination of digestive distress&#xD;
      and vascular insufficiency: occlusive (thrombosis, embolism, arterial, venous) or&#xD;
      non-occlusive (low flow or vasospasm). The vital prognosis is catastrophic in the absence of&#xD;
      treatment (the mortality rate of an intestinal infarction is almost 100% without treatment),&#xD;
      and the functional and anatomical after-effects are major for the survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many intestinal vascular diseases have been identified as providing acute and chronic&#xD;
      mesenteric ischaemia. The nosological framework of these diseases is broad, ranging from&#xD;
      constitutional diseases of the vessels (collagenosis, arcuate ligament syndrome) to acquired&#xD;
      diseases of a thrombophilic, cardiac, degenerative, autoimmune, iatrogenic, traumatic&#xD;
      nature... The rarity of these diseases (with the exception of atherosclerotic disease, the&#xD;
      incidence of which is increasing with the ageing of the population) makes their level of&#xD;
      knowledge insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural history of vascular diseases without ischaemia (rate of acute and chronic&#xD;
      mesenteric ischaemia, mortality rate, resection rate...) is currently not described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The construction of a longitudinal observational cohort is necessary for the prevalence of&#xD;
      ischaemic complications and predictive factors.&#xD;
