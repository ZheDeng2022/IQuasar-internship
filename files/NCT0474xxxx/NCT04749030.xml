  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomised, double-blinded and placebo-controlled intervention study. The study aim to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility, safety and pilot-efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation as a&#xD;
      treatment of severe gastrointestinal neuropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus type 1.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes type 1 may cause damage to nerve cells in the gut causing neuropathy that leads to&#xD;
      changes in gastric and intestinal motility. This change predisposes to an abnormal amounts&#xD;
      and composition of bacteria in the gut, probably leading to uncontrollable diarrhea and&#xD;
      severely impaired quality of life. Transferal of intestinal microbiota from a healthy donor&#xD;
      to a patient is called faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT may potentially change&#xD;
      the bacteria in the gut and reduce gastrointestinal symptoms. However, FMT may also have&#xD;
      potential side effects, especially in persons with autonomic neuropathy and delayed transit&#xD;
      through the gut.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a 8-week, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot trial of oral FMT versus placebo in patients with DM1 and severe GI neuropathy. The intervention period consists of a first 4 weeks where patients receive either FMT or placebo and a second 4 weeks where all patients receive FMT. The patients will undergo the investigations before and after each 4-week period.</intervention_model_description>
