  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paediatric behavioural, developmental, and mental health issues are more common than&#xD;
      childhood cancers, cardiac problems, and renal problems combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioural problems have often been conceptualized along two broad spectrums: internalizing&#xD;
      problems which are expressed in intrapersonal manifestation, such as anxiety, depression, and&#xD;
      withdrawal; and externalizing problems which are demonstrated in interpersonal manifestation,&#xD;
      such as hyperactivity and aggression The lack of attention to the mental health of children&#xD;
      and adolescents may lead to mental disorders with lifelong consequences, undermines&#xD;
      compliance with health regimens, and reduces the capacity of societies to be safe and&#xD;
      productive. As, children and adolescent mental health problems often have serious long term&#xD;
      debilitating effects . Early identification and treatment of these problems are in the best&#xD;
      interest of children, adolescents, their families, and society as a whole . All three&#xD;
      essential ways in which epidemiology can contribute to our understanding of children and&#xD;
      adolescent mental health: community burden, measurement, and triage were of utmost&#xD;
      importance. planning and conducting the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the researchers will present the first large-scale survey of child and&#xD;
      adolescent psychiatric disorders at Assiut government For adequate planning of services,&#xD;
      including evidence-based mental health prevention and intervention, a&#xD;
      population-representative survey of children and adolescent estimating mental disorders was&#xD;
      urgently needed&#xD;
