  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to calculate sensitivity, and accuracy of ultrasound guided&#xD;
      percutaneous core needle biopsy in different thoracic tumors (lung, pleural, chest wall and&#xD;
      mediastinal).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral intrathoracic shadows are common presentation of different diseases of different&#xD;
      origin (chest wall, pleura, pulmonary, and mediastinum), they are increasing in numbers&#xD;
      including, peripheral lung cancer, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and atelectasis. [1] Thoracic&#xD;
      masses with wall contact represent a frequent pathology that requires complex imaging&#xD;
      studies, and often interventional procedures, in order to reach the complete diagnosis. In&#xD;
      most cases, after a thoracic lesion is found on a thoracic X-Ray, the next step is to perform&#xD;
      a CT and/or a bronchoscopy exam, but pleural and pulmonary lesions often call for additional&#xD;
      investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, transthoracic ultrasonography (US) permits visualization of these lesions, their&#xD;
      structural characterization, while offering suggestive elements for their malignant nature&#xD;
      and for the differential diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sonography has the capacity to clarify the nature of opaque lesions such as effusions,&#xD;
      atelectasis, masses, and consolidations. Transthoracic ultrasound has received increased&#xD;
      interest from chest Physicians in recent years as it has the advantages of bedside&#xD;
      availability, absence of radiation, and guided aspiration of fluid-filled areas and solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore US allows percutaneous guided biopsies with lower risks compared with the&#xD;
      radiological guiding methods (fluoroscopy and CT). Trransthoracic US can replace other&#xD;
      imaging modalities of the chest and guide a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.&#xD;
      Under real time US guidance, the success rate of transthoracic needle aspiration or biopsy&#xD;
      (TNB) significantly increases, whereas the risk of complications is greatly reduced.&#xD;

True positive result: the tumor is confirmed by a definite histopathologic diagnosis made by Tru-Cut core biopsy&#xD;
True negative result: case not diagnosed as a tumor by ultrasound Tru-Cut core biopsy &amp; this finding was confirmed by another modality for biopsy&#xD;
False negative result was considered to have occurred if the tumor wasn't diagnosed by ultrasound guided biopsy, and the tumor was confirmed using other modalities (CT guided, Thoracoscopic, or surgical biopsy).</description>

    <description>60 patients that had radiographic evidence of thoracic mass suspected of malignancy .Twenty masses were in the lung, seventeen lesions were in the pleura, ten masses were in the mediastinum, eleven enlarged palpable lymph nodes, and two masses were in chest wall. The sensitivity, PPV and accuracy for detection of chest tumors in chest wall, mediastinum, lung, and pleura were (100 %) for all, and in LN (88.9, 100 and 90.9 %) respectively. The overall diagnostic performance of sonar guided true cut needle biopsy in diagnosis was 97.78 % sensitivity, 98.18% accuracy, and 100 % PPV</description>
