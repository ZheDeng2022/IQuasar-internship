    <textblock>
      Current models suggest that mental health is not the mere absence of a mental disorder.&#xD;
      Rather, mental health consists of two factors, mental disorder symptoms and positive mental&#xD;
      health, that can be regarded as continua. Programmes applying interventions known from the&#xD;
      positive psychology or positive psychotherapy framework have been shown to enhance&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing, subjective wellbeing and to reduce depressive symptoms. However,&#xD;
      interventions were mostly conducted in an individual or small group setting and usually&#xD;
      consisted of more than one session. The few trainings of minimal length that were conducted&#xD;
      in group settings only used one intervention strategy or one part of multicomponent positive&#xD;
      psychological interventions. Therefore, the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the&#xD;
      effectiveness of short group-interventions are limited. In this study, the investigators plan&#xD;
      to conduct an online large-group one-session training to enhance positive mental health that&#xD;
      comprises multiple positive psychological interventions (e.g. character strengths, positive&#xD;
      communication, goal attainment, etc). Furthermore, an active as well as a passive (waitlist)&#xD;
      control group are included in the study. In the active control group, dysfunctional thoughts&#xD;
      are adressed that are known to everybody but exist in a great measure in people suffering&#xD;
      from depressive disorders. Methods used in cognitive therapy are applied in this group.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from a community sample without any inclusion criteria but&#xD;
      being of legal age. The only exclusion criterion is not having the appropriate technical&#xD;
      equipment for participation in a videoconference. Positive mental health as well as other&#xD;
      constructs of mental health will be assessed before and after training and at one month and&#xD;
      six months follow up to investigate long-term effects of the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In general, the investigators expect an increase in positive mental health in the&#xD;
      multicomponent positive psychological intervention (MPPI) group. This effect should be&#xD;
      present at the assessment points one month and six months after training. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      increase in positive mental health in the MPPI group is expected to be larger than in the two&#xD;
      control groups (cognitive intervention targeting dysfunctional thoughts [CIDT], waitlist).&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize participants to benefit from the MPPI in terms of&#xD;
      other constructs related to mental health, i.e. self efficacy, happiness, wellbeing, positive&#xD;
      emotions, and life satisfaction, in the long term. This increase is expected to be larger in&#xD;
      the MPPI than in the two control groups. A decrease in depressive symptoms is hypothesized to&#xD;
      occur in the MPPI as well as in the CIDT group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample under investigation will be a community sample. All participants can attain the&#xD;
      training for free and there is no payment for participation. One week before the first&#xD;
      training day, the random allocation to the three groups will take place. Two days before the&#xD;
      first training day, all participants are asked to fill out another survey through a link sent&#xD;
      to them via e-mail. This survey comprises all outcome measures. The same procedure is carried&#xD;
      out one day after, one month after and six months after the first training day. After the&#xD;
      last assessment time point, the training for the waitlist control group will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target sample size is 300 participants (100 per group). The investigators will attempt to&#xD;
      recruit more participants, assuming that not all will complete the study, especially the&#xD;
      assessment after six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators used the software program G*Power to conduct a power analysis. The goal was&#xD;
      to obtain .95 power to detect a small effect size of .1 at the standard .05 alpha error&#xD;
      probability. The investigators extended the calculated sample size of 264 participants to a&#xD;
      target sample size of 300 participants as there was no study before that compared an online&#xD;
      multicomponent large-group one-session training to enhance positive mental health with an&#xD;
      online large-group one-session intervention targeting dysfunctional thoughts. Therefore, the&#xD;
      effect size for the comparison of these two groups could be smaller than f = .1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be analyzed with a 3x2 repeated measures ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all other outcome measures, the investigators will use 3 x 4 between-within repeated&#xD;
      measures ANOVAs (rmANOVA) to analyze the results. The first factor is a between-subjects&#xD;
      factor that comprises the three groups MPPI, CIDT and waitlist control group. The second&#xD;
      factor is a within-subjects factor reflecting the four assessment time points two days before&#xD;
      the intervention, one day after the intervention, one month after the intervention and six&#xD;
      months after the intervention. This analysis will be conducted for positive mental health,&#xD;
      life satisfaction, affect, generalized self-efficacy, happiness, wellbeing, stress&#xD;
      perception, positive and negative aspects of mental health, depression, anxiety and stress,&#xD;
      social support and media-related variables. Before these analyses are carried out,&#xD;
      correlations among the outcome measures are calculated. If outcome measures correlate&#xD;
      significantly high (above .5), they will be first analyzed together in a between-within&#xD;
      repeated measures MANOVA to control for alpha-error accumulation. After that, the separate&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted. Furthermore, there will be paired comparisons between each of the&#xD;
      three groups, reducing the first between-subjects factor in the between-within rm(M)ANOVA to&#xD;
      two levels. For each group, rmANOVAs will be conducted to analyze the change of outcome&#xD;
      variables over time entailing paired contrasts between the assessment time points.&#xD;
