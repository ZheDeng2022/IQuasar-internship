  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed as a non-randomized pilot trial to study, in a preliminary fashion,&#xD;
      whether proton radiation therapy (proton RT) reduces acute gastrointestinal toxicities at the&#xD;
      end of treatment compared to intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)&#xD;
