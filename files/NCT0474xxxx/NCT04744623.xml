      Abstract: Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) is an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized&#xD;
      by inflammation, blistering, and scarring and predominantly occurring at mucous membranes.&#xD;
      Successful treatment can be challenging, and uncontrolled disease may result in significant&#xD;
      morbidity with scarring of the conjunctiva and oropharynx leading to blindness and dysphagia.&#xD;
      Therefore successful treatment is a must to improve patient quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of work: to evaluate clinically the effectiveness of systemic large dose of prednisolone&#xD;
      plus intra-lesional of Triamcinolone Acetonide followed the systemic combination of&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), dapsone and low dose prednisolone in treatment of MMP cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and method: 10 patients suffering from MMP were selected after complete diagnosis&#xD;
      based on their clinical diagnosis and immunopathologic findings of IgG, IgA, and/or C3&#xD;
      targeting skin basement membranes with a linear deposition pattern refered from dermatology&#xD;
      department. These patient were treated using large dose of prednisone 60mg daily plus&#xD;
      intrational injection of Triamcinolone Acetonide every week until no further improvement of&#xD;
      the lesion occurred (stage I) then the prednisolone is withdrawn gradually and substituted&#xD;
      with using 1 g of MMF plus 50 mg dapsone till the lowest dose of prednisone could be reached&#xD;
      (stage II). The lesion size and pain score will be assessed before treatment and during&#xD;
      treatment in stage I and stage II. These data will be tabulated and statistically analyzed&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before starting any treatment the size of the lesion will be measured and pain score will be&#xD;
      evaluated. then patient were treated using large dose of prednisone 60mg daily plus&#xD;
      intra-lesional injection of Triamcinolone Acetonide every week until no further improvement&#xD;
      of the lesion occurred (stage I) at this stage the patients pain would be evaluated and&#xD;
      lesion size would be measured .&#xD;
&#xD;
      as no further improvement is gained, the prednisolone is withdrawn gradually and substituted&#xD;
      with using 1 g of MMF plus 50 mg dapsone till the lowest dose of prednisone could be reached&#xD;
      (stage II) at this stage the patients pain would be evaluated and lesion size would be&#xD;
      measured. then the data will be tabulated and statistically analyzed regarding pain score and&#xD;
      lesion size&#xD;
