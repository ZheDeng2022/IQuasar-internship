    <textblock>
      Cerclage placement is known to be beneficial in prevention of preterm birth when placed inn a&#xD;
      certain subset of patients. Clinically, the number of sutures can also vary by surgeon&#xD;
      preference to one or two sutures in one procedure. This is often decided in the operating&#xD;
      room (OR) on the day of surgery but is poorly studied in the efficacy of maintaining the&#xD;
      closed cervical length. Retrospective data found no significant benefit on placing two&#xD;
      stitches instead of one in preterm birth rate but was extremely limited and heterogenous in&#xD;
      many clinical characteristic among the cerclage procedures. There were suggestions that two&#xD;
      cerclage sutures may reduce the risk of cerclage revision, birth before 20 weeks, and a&#xD;
      nonsignificant improvement in outcome of early preterm deliveries. Therefore, two randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials, one prospective study and one meta-analysis were performed. They did&#xD;
      suggest a beneficial effect of double cerclage on obstetrical outcomes especially in earlier&#xD;
      preterm birth rates although all were limited in sample size and therefore power. A&#xD;
      randomized control trial with adequate sample size is still needed to answer the question of&#xD;
      whether double cervical cerclage suture is more beneficial than a single suture. Therefore,&#xD;
      we propose conducting a randomized control trial between a single or double suture in&#xD;
      prophylactic and ultrasound indicated cerclage procedures.&#xD;

      Preterm birth (PTB), defined as birth at less than 37 completed weeks is the leading cause&#xD;
      for neonatal mortality and morbidity in the USA. The most common risk factor for PTB is a&#xD;
      prior preterm birth. The etiology includes several risk factors including prior preterm&#xD;
      birth, cervical insufficiency, short cervical length, low socioeconomic and educational&#xD;
      status, extremes of maternal age, genital tract infection/colonization, smoking, underlying&#xD;
      chronic disease, uterine anomalies, cervical surgery, injury to the endometrium, race, and&#xD;
      exposure to environmental factors. The objective of our study specifically focuses on&#xD;
      cervical insufficiency and a short cervical length at &lt;24 weeks gestation defined as less&#xD;
      than 25 mm as measured by transvaginal ultrasonography. It is well known that infants born&#xD;
      prematurely have increased morbidity and mortality, including respiratory distress syndrome,&#xD;
      intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, long term health and neurologic&#xD;
      abnormalities, extensive hospital stays, neonatal death, etc. The risks are significantly&#xD;
      more pronounced at earlier gestational ages. Cervical cerclage, when indicated, has been&#xD;
      shown to be beneficial in reducing preterm birth rates and therefore decrease adverse&#xD;
      neonatal outcomes, perinatal morbidity, and mortality. The indications for cervical cerclage&#xD;
      include a history of recurrent second trimester losses and/or PTB (history indicated), short&#xD;
      cervical length (&lt;2.5cm on transvaginal ultrasound (ultrasound indicated), or a dilated&#xD;
      cervix on physical exam (physical exam indicated). Our study focuses on history and&#xD;
      ultrasound indicated cerclage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are various surgical approaches to placement of cervical cerclages- transvaginal and&#xD;
      transabdominal. Our study focuses on the transvaginal approach and the modified McDonald&#xD;
      technique with transvaginal placement of a purse-string suture at the cervicovaginal&#xD;
      junction. Suture material varies by the surgeon's preference and can involve monofilament&#xD;
      suture (Prolene), polyester fiber (Mersilene tape), or a braided polyester suture (Ti-Cron or&#xD;
      Ethibond). Clinically, the number of sutures can also vary by surgeon preference to one or&#xD;
      two sutures in one procedure. This is often decided in the operating room (OR) on the day of&#xD;
      surgery but is poorly studied in the efficacy of maintaining the closed cervical length.&#xD;
      Retrospective data found no significant benefit on placing two stitches instead of one in&#xD;
      preterm birth rate but was extremely limited and heterogenous in many clinical characteristic&#xD;
      among the cerclage procedures. There were suggestions that two cerclage sutures may reduce&#xD;
      the risk of cerclage revision, birth before 20 weeks, and a nonsignificant improvement in&#xD;
      outcome of early preterm deliveries. Therefore, two randomized controlled trials one&#xD;
      prospective study and one meta-analysis were performed. They did suggest a beneficial effect&#xD;
      of double cerclage on obstetrical outcomes especially in earlier preterm birth rates although&#xD;
      all were limited in sample size and therefore power. A randomized control trial with adequate&#xD;
      sample size is still needed to answer the question of whether double cervical cerclage suture&#xD;
      is more beneficial than a single suture.&#xD;
