      This is a randomised trial on the efficacy of a Pharmacist-led Patient-Centered Medication&#xD;
      Therapy Management on clinical outcomes among preterm infants born before 32 weeks gestation&#xD;
      with iron supplementation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical outcome in the&#xD;
      PPMTM program compared with usual care in an integrated health care system.&#xD;

      This is a randomised trial on the efficacy of a Pharmacist-led Patient-Centered Medication&#xD;
      Therapy Management on clinical outcomes among preterm infants born before 32 weeks gestation&#xD;
      with iron supplementation. As a result, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of&#xD;
      Pediatrics (AAP) recommends daily oral iron supplementation, of at least 2-4 mg/kg/day from 2&#xD;
      weeks of age, to prevent iron deficiency in extremely premature infants. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate clinical outcome in the PPMTM program compared with usual care in an&#xD;
      integrated health care system.&#xD;

    <description>This was an open labelled randomised study. Preterm Infants With iron supplementation were recruited and arbitrarily divided into the intervention group (usual care plus PPMTM) and the non-intervention group (usual care only). Those enrolled in the research were scheduled for follow-up for eight consecutive visits. Improvements in lab results and direct costs were compared longitudinally (pre and post analysis) between the groups.</description>
