    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to characterize the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      GS-3583 as monotherapy, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of GS-3583 as monotherapy in participants with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic malignant&#xD;
             solid tumor that is refractory to or intolerant of standard therapy or for which no&#xD;
             standard therapy is available&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have measurable disease on imaging based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
             Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of ≥ 3 months, in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function as assessed by hematological, renal, and hepatic parameters,&#xD;
             and no clinically significant coagulopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiotherapy, or&#xD;
             major surgery within 3 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1; a 1-week washout is permitted for&#xD;
             palliative radiation to non-central nervous system (CNS) disease with sponsor approval&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known severe hypersensitivity reactions (NCI CTCAE Grade ≥ 3) to fully human&#xD;
             monoclonal antibodies or fusion proteins, GS-3583 formulation excipients, or severe&#xD;
             reaction to immuno-oncology agents, such as colitis or pneumonitis requiring treatment&#xD;
             with corticosteroids, any history of anaphylaxis, or uncontrolled asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent active malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of&#xD;
             the cervix, or superficial bladder cancer who has undergone potentially curative&#xD;

          -  Known CNS metastasis(es), unless metastases are treated and stable and the individual&#xD;
             does not require systemic corticosteroids for management of CNS symptoms at least 1&#xD;
             week prior to study treatment. Individuals with history of carcinomatous meningitis&#xD;
             are excluded regardless of clinical stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or history of autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment within 2&#xD;
             years of the start of study treatment (ie, with use of disease-modifying agents,&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Note: Individuals with diabetes type 1, vitiligo, psoriasis, hypothyroid disease,&#xD;
                  or hyperthyroid disease, not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible.&#xD;
