  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression and poor quality of life during postpartum were an vital issue in&#xD;
      recent years. Infant's health condition was thought to be a possible reasons related mother's&#xD;
      postpartum quality of life, and functional gastrointestinal disorders such as infantile colic&#xD;
      and regurgitation were common problem during infant period. Previous study revealed that&#xD;
      probiotics may improve the infant's discomfort caused by functional gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disorders. Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether probiotics use in neonate and infant&#xD;
      improve their mother's life quality?&#xD;

      This is single blinded intervention study. The investigators will invite mother to&#xD;
      participate in the project after giving birth. At week 0, mother who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be randomized in a single-blind study in a 1:1 ratio to probiotics with Vit. D3&#xD;
      (five drops per day) or Vit. D3 (placebo) (single drop per day) for 90 days. The follow-up&#xD;
      will be at the 1, 3 and 6 months all the subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Maternal Sleep Quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. In scoring the PSQI, there are seven component scores with each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce total score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>
