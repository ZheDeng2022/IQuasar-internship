    <textblock>
      Patients with primary dysmenorrhea diagnosed by a physician, spondylolisthesis and chronic&#xD;
      low back pain were excluded from the study. They were randomly assigned into two equal groups&#xD;
      (A&amp; B). Group (A) consisted of twenty subjects, with an average age 29.2±1.9Yrs, and BMI&#xD;
      27.28±2.1kg/m2 who received Extracorporeal shock waves. Group (B) consisted of twenty&#xD;
      patients, with an average age 28.58±2.2Yrs, and BMI 28.92±0.7kg/m2 who received sham&#xD;
      technique. A hot pack was used for 15 minutes for both groups (A&amp;B) before the treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Visual analogue scale: that was used to determine the pain intensity level. It consists of 10 cm as a horizontal line with one end represented that (0= no pain) and the other end (10= worst pain). The assessment was performed for every woman in both groups (A, B) before and after the treatment program.</description>
