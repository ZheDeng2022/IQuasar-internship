  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in survivor, single-arm pilot study with the goal of establishing evidence of&#xD;
      feasibility and safety of a combined pharmacologic (metformin) and lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      (using an existing digital platform) to prevent diabetes in prediabetic adult survivors of&#xD;
      childhood cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this proposal is to establish the feasibility and safety of a 24-week&#xD;
      combined metformin + intensive lifestyle intervention among adult survivors with prediabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints of this trial will be adherence to 1) daily metformin administration and 2)&#xD;
      completion of required core-curriculum of the lifestyle change intervention. Safety will be&#xD;
      assessed using the Global Rating of Side Effects Burden&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to assess preliminary evidence for efficacy of the combined metformin +&#xD;
      intensive lifestyle intervention on glycemic control and insulin resistance. Glycemic control&#xD;
      will be measured by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and insulin&#xD;
      resistance measured by the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) and IGF- binding protein 1&#xD;
      (IGF-BP1; a measure of insulin sensitivity strongly correlated with euglycemic insulin clamp&#xD;
      testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess preliminary evidence for efficacy of the combined metformin + intensive lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention on weight, other anthropometric measures, blood pressure and lipid profile,&#xD;
      physical activity (self-reported and as measured by accelerometer), frailty measures, and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL). We will also assess diabetes development at future&#xD;
      SJLIFE visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess measures of participation in the lifestyle change program as well as barriers to&#xD;
      participation and medication adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects who meet inclusion criteria will receive metformin extended release daily&#xD;
      and be enrolled in the digital lifestyle intervention program. Following a 2-week run-in&#xD;
      period at lower dose (500 mg/day) to minimize gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea,&#xD;
      nausea, flatulence, bloating), participants will be escalated to a maximum dose of 1000&#xD;
      mg/day. The digitally delivered lifestyle change program will include a core curriculum&#xD;
      focused on diet quality, food types, exercise and behavioral strategies for goal setting, and&#xD;
      self-monitoring.&#xD;

    <description>Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With Metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.</description>

On day 14, participants will be contacted by phone (+/- 4 days, day 10 to 18) and adherence assessed using virtual pill counts via phone calls.&#xD;
At weeks 4, 8, 16 and 20 a phone-based pill count for adherence and adverse event symptom log will be completed and study medication dispensed.&#xD;
At week 12 (interim assessment) and 24 (study-end), the participant will return to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) for an in-person assessment.&#xD;
The digital lifestyle change program will complete at week 24.</description>
