    <textblock>
      The main aim of this effort is to test a physical activity intervention, for adult clinical&#xD;
      care patients at risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The intervention includes&#xD;
      social-cognitive theory-based sessions, remote coaching, a body worn physical activity&#xD;
      tracker (PAT), and is delivered online over one year. The investigators hypothesis that this&#xD;
      intervention will be more successful at increasing physical activity (defined as objectively&#xD;
      measured step counts and % of individuals meeting the moderate-vigorous physical activity&#xD;
      goal) as an active control group who receives a body worn PAT and information on the CDC&#xD;
      activity recommendations. The proposed intervention will be aligned with efforts by the US&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control to increase population physical activity levels and the American&#xD;
      College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) to increase physical activity prescription in primary care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this effort is to test a physical activity intervention, for adult clinical&#xD;
      care patients at risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The intervention includes 13&#xD;
      weekly and 6 monthly social-cognitive theory-based sessions, remote coaching, a body worn&#xD;
      physical activity tracker (PAT), and is delivered online over one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of n=54 Clinical care patients aged 40-70 years of age with low physical activity&#xD;
      (PA) levels (&lt;150 minutes/week) at risk for cardiovascular disease will be recruited. Study&#xD;
      outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6 months after intervention start and 12 months after&#xD;
      intervention start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary outcomes, the investigators hypothesize that participants randomized to&#xD;
      ActiveGOALSv2 + PAT will have significantly larger (a) increases in step counts/day and %&#xD;
      meeting moderate-vigorous physical activity goal of 150 minutes/week (to 12 months) compared&#xD;
      to the active PAT control group. Descriptive analyses and graphic displays will be used to&#xD;
      identify outliers, missing data, and pattern of attrition. To ensure rigor, the primary&#xD;
      analytic strategy will be a linear or generalized mixed-effect models approach in which&#xD;
      treatment group, time, and time by group interaction are treated as fixed effects, and&#xD;
      subject is treated as a random effect to account for individual subject variability (two&#xD;
      sided hypothesis test; .05 level). Mixed models are applicable to longitudinal datasets that&#xD;
      contain missing observations, (assuming data is missing at random). Regression modeling will&#xD;
      be conducted to adjust for important covariates. The investigators will perform similar&#xD;
      analyses to examine changes in secondary outcomes. Descriptive statistics on patient&#xD;
      experience, beliefs/attitudes related to maintenance of physical activity changes, and&#xD;
      program cost will also be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power and sample size: For a 2 sided test with alpha level set at .05, and assuming 20%&#xD;
      attrition at 12 months, the investigators plan to recruit 54 participants to identify&#xD;
      clinically relevant mean difference between randomized groups at 12-months of 2000 steps/day&#xD;
      (with a power of .80), and 35% meeting MVPA goal (with a power of .80), given reference mean&#xD;
      (sd) values were calculated from baseline waist worn accelerometer data from the current K12&#xD;
      of: 5250 (2200) steps/ day and the investigators assume 5% meeting goal at baseline in the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the total eligible population, those&#xD;
      referred, and those referred who participated in the study; in order to determine program&#xD;
      reach. Exploratory Analysis of Important Pre-Existing Factors: Factor analysis will be used&#xD;
      to identify importance of factors related to physical activity levels/ activity goal&#xD;
      achievement over the 12 month follow-up (Mplus) from participant EHR data collected prior to&#xD;
      intervention start. Factor structures of how individual factors contribute to activity&#xD;
      outcomes will be explored at each time point. The best factor structure will be determined&#xD;
      with Eigenvalues and fit indices (RMSEA, CFI, and TLI). Factor structures at the 2 time&#xD;
      points will be compared at three levels to establish measurement invariance: 1) Configural&#xD;
      equivalence, number of factors/ pattern of factor-indicator relationships are identical over&#xD;
      time; 2) Metric equivalence, factor loadings are equal over time; and 3) Scalar equivalence,&#xD;
      means and values are equivalent over time. Finally, the investigators will use descriptive&#xD;
      statistics to report presence/absence of data on physical activity levels, cardiometabolic,&#xD;
      and patient-centered outcomes in the EHR. The investigators will apply the same regression&#xD;
      approaches utilized in Aim 1a to determine differences between randomized groups for EHR&#xD;
      reported outcomes.&#xD;
