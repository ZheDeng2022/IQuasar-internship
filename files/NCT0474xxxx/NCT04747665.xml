  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bowel cancer is the 3rd most common cancer in males and females. Most bowel cancers develop&#xD;
      from precancerous polyps in the bowel. Colonoscopy can detect and remove these polyps,&#xD;
      thereby reducing the risk of developing bowel cancer. However, colonoscopy is an invasive&#xD;
      procedure with inherent risk, and can be both uncomfortable and embarrassing to undergo. The&#xD;
      risks and numerous other barriers often mean colonoscopy, and cancer preventing polyp&#xD;
      removal, is not performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to start the first in-human feasibility clinical investigation of a&#xD;
      robotic magnetic colonoscope in 2021. The new device aims to reduce the discomfort and risk&#xD;
      associated with colonoscopy. As part of the patient and end user involvement aspect of the&#xD;
      project the investigators aim to perform a mixed methodology inductive type research project&#xD;
      exploring experiences of colonoscopy for patient and endoscopists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow an exploratory mixed methodology format with two parallel work-streams&#xD;
      for patients and endoscopists. Each work-stream will consisting of a focus groups (1-2 for&#xD;
      each patients and endoscopists), followed by 20 endoscopist and 30 patient in-depth&#xD;
      interviews, then an online questionnaire. Each stage will be thematically analysed to form&#xD;
      the semi-structured questions for the next stage. The target population will be endoscopists&#xD;
      who perform colonoscopy and people who have undergone, or refused to undergo, a colonoscopy.&#xD;
      Focus groups will be performed in groups of 6-10 participants, and both interview and focus&#xD;
      groups will be performed via video/teleconferencing.&#xD;
