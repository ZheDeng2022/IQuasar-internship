  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of colorectal cancer ranks the third in the world and the mortality ranks the&#xD;
      second in the world. The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer have increased in China&#xD;
      in the past decade. The incidence of colorectal cancer is associated with dietary patterns,&#xD;
      obesity and lifestyle. The 2010 colorectal cancer survey in China showed that the incidence&#xD;
      of colorectal cancer was low in the age group below 50 years old, and began to increase&#xD;
      rapidly in the age group above 50 years old, reached the maximum in the age group above 70&#xD;
      years old, and decreased after 80 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For advanced colorectal cancer, systemic chemotherapy, local radiotherapy, synchronous or&#xD;
      sequential chemoradiotherapy are lack of specificity, killing tumor cells as well as human&#xD;
      normal cells, and the space for the traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs to further&#xD;
      improve the clinical efficacy of anti-malignant tumor is very limited. Therefore, molecular&#xD;
      targeted tumor therapy with strong specificity and relatively small toxic and side effects&#xD;
      has gradually become the fourth treatment mode following the three conventional treatment&#xD;
      methods of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is&#xD;
      a clear target for treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Immunotherapy has been a hot&#xD;
      topic in recent years, In the field of colorectal cancer, studies on MSI-H population have&#xD;
      been carried out successively since ASCO in 2015.However, the MSI-H population accounts for&#xD;
      only 5% of patients with advanced colorectal cancer and 12-15% of total colorectal cancer,&#xD;
      and the benefit population is very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab is approved for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer in the United States,&#xD;
      Europe and China. Cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy is the standard treatment for&#xD;
      RAS wild-type (RAS-WT) colorectal cancer. PD-1 monotherapy has been approved for patients&#xD;
      with MSI-H/ DMMR colorectal cancer. The approved PD-1 mAb includes Nivolumab and&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab. In some small trials, PD-1 monoclonal antibody combined with Regorafenib&#xD;
      showed initial efficacy in patients with MSS type advanced colorectal cancer. EGFR signaling&#xD;
      pathway blocker combined with PD-1 antibody, a new treatment mode, is of great significance&#xD;
      to enrich the content of immunotherapy for patients with colorectal cancer, improve the&#xD;
      survival prognosis of patients, and search for new efficacy predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, this study, on the one hand, is expected to confirm that RAS and RAF wild-type&#xD;
      advanced colorectal cancer and MSS type can benefit from Sintilimab combined with Regorafenib&#xD;
      treatment, and at the same time, observe the effective rate of this regimen in the mutant&#xD;
      group, so as to provide reference for clinical selection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 1.8 million new cases of colorectal cancer and 881,000 deaths are expected&#xD;
      worldwide in 2018, accounting for about one in 10 cancers, according to the Global Cancer&#xD;
      Statistics Report 2018.The incidence of colorectal cancer ranks the third in the world and&#xD;
      the mortality ranks the second in the world. The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer&#xD;
      have increased in China in the past decade.The incidence of colorectal cancer is associated&#xD;
      with dietary patterns, obesity and lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest national cancer statistics, &quot;Analysis of Malignant Tumor Epidemiology in China in&#xD;
      2015&quot;, showed that the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer ranked third and fifth in&#xD;
      China, respectively. The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer were both higher in&#xD;
      urban areas than in rural areas, and that of males was higher than that of females.In 2010,&#xD;
      the incidence of colorectal cancer in China was 26.70/100,000 in urban areas and&#xD;
      15.01/100,000 in rural areas, which was 1.78 times higher than that in rural areas.The top&#xD;
      five cities of incidence in China are Shenzhen, Xiamen, Tonghua of Jilin, Guangzhou and&#xD;
      Yueyanglou District of Hunan, while the bottom five cities are Hai 'an County of Jiangsu,&#xD;
      Tengzhou City of Shandong, Lianshui County of Jiangsu, Tong 'an District of Xiamen and&#xD;
      Taixing City of Jiangsu.The 2010 survey of colorectal cancer in China showed that the&#xD;
      incidence of colorectal cancer was low in the age group below 50 years old, and began to rise&#xD;
      rapidly in the age group above 50 years old, reached the maximum in the age group above 70&#xD;
      years old, and decreased after 80 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For advanced colorectal cancer, with systemic chemotherapy and local radiotherapy,&#xD;
      synchronous or sequential radiation and chemotherapy treatment lack of specificity, at the&#xD;
      same time of killing tumor cells and normal cells to produce damage effect to human body, and&#xD;
      the traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs to further improve the resistance of malignant&#xD;
      tumor clinical curative effect of the space is very limited, therefore, strong specificity,&#xD;
      side effects of relatively small tumor molecular targeted therapy gradually became the three&#xD;
      conventional surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment method of the fourth&#xD;
      model.Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a clear target for treatment of advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.Immunotherapy has been a hot topic in recent years.In the field of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, studies on MSI-H population have been carried out successively since ASCO&#xD;
      in 2015.However, the MSI-H population accounts for only 5% of patients with advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer and 12-15% of total colorectal cancer, and the benefit population is very&#xD;
      limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies confirming the third-line treatment of MCRC with cetuximab include Bond,&#xD;
      NCICCO.17, etc.The primary objective of the NCICCO.17 study was to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      of cetuximab in patients with advanced colorectal cancer who failed chemotherapy and ceased&#xD;
      to receive chemotherapy. It has been confirmed that compared with the best supportive&#xD;
      treatment, cetuximab can prolong the survival period of patients and delay the deterioration&#xD;
      of quality of life, which is manifested in delaying the deterioration of overall condition&#xD;
      and physical function, and has obvious advantages in improving symptoms, highlighting the&#xD;
      role of cetuximab in third-line treatment. Cetuximab was approved for second-line treatment&#xD;
      of advanced colorectal cancer in the United States and Europe in 2004.Cetuximab combined with&#xD;
      irinotecan is the standard second-line treatment for MCRC with oxaliplatin failure. This&#xD;
      study included the European BOND study, the MABEL study, the Latin American LABEL study, and&#xD;
      the Australian ELSIE study. All patients were tested for EGFR and irinotecan failed. The&#xD;
      results showed that the response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free&#xD;
      survival time (PFS) and overall survival time (OS) were similar among different populations,&#xD;
      indicating that Cetuximab improved ORR and PFS.Thus, the position of Cetuximab in the&#xD;
      second-line treatment of mCRC was consolidated. On September 18, 2019, China's National&#xD;
      Medical Products Administration (SFDA) officially approved cetuximab for the first-line&#xD;
      treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer based on the Tailor trial. The Tailor&#xD;
      trial compared the efficacy and safety of first-line treatment with cetuximab combined with&#xD;
      FOLFOX-4 (5-FU/LV+ oxaliplatin) versus FOLFOX-4 without cetuximab in patients with RAS&#xD;
      wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC).The primary endpoint was progression-free&#xD;
      survival, and secondary endpoints included overall survival, overall response rate, and&#xD;
      safety and tolerability. Research into the group of 393 RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (mCRC) patients with cetuximab combined FOLFOX4 compared with using FOLFOX alone - 4,&#xD;
      significantly improve the patient's primary end point, in addition, the secondary endpoint&#xD;
      has improved significantly, and well tolerated treatment, no unexpected adverse reaction,&#xD;
      good safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on KEYNOTE-016, KEYNOTE-164, and KEYNOTE-028, Pembrolizumab was approved for line 1 and&#xD;
      above treatment in patients with MSI-H/ DMMR colorectal cancer, with an ORR of 36%. The&#xD;
      CheckMate -142 study was a multi-cohort, phase II study in which Nivolumab was shown to be&#xD;
      effective monotherapy in patients with line 2 or higher mSI-H /dMMR colorectal cancer. Phase&#xD;
      Ib/II trials of Pembrolizumab in combination with cetuximab for RAS wild-type, EGFR&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody primary treatment of advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer confirmed&#xD;
      that the two-agent combination was well tolerated. The most common AEs were cutaneous&#xD;
      toxicity, hymenopagnesemia, vomiting, and fatigue, and no new AEs occurred.Preliminary&#xD;
      results show synergistic effect. PD-1 monotherapy has been approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      mSI-H /dMMR patients with colorectal cancer. The approved PD-1 mAb includes Nivolumab and&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab.Cetuximab combined with chemotherapy is the standard treatment for RAS&#xD;
      wild-type (RAS-WT) colorectal cancer. Phase II clinical trials of Avelumab (PD-L1) in&#xD;
      combination with cetuximab and chemotherapy for primary RAS/BRAF wild-type, MSI, or MSS&#xD;
      colorectal cancer are ongoing;A phase Ib/II study of Pembrolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      cetuximab in patients with RAS-WT metastatic colorectal cancer of line 2 and above is also&#xD;
      ongoing. In some small trials, PD-1 monoclonal antibody combined with Regorafenib showed&#xD;
      initial efficacy in patients with MSS type advanced colorectal cancer. EGFR signaling pathway&#xD;
      blocker combined with PD-1 antibody, a new treatment mode, is of great significance to enrich&#xD;
      the content of immunotherapy for patients with colorectal cancer, improve the survival&#xD;
      prognosis of patients, and search for new efficacy predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, this study, on the one hand, is expected to confirm that RAS and RAF wild-type&#xD;
      advanced colorectal cancer and MSS type can benefit from Sintilimab combined with Regorafenib&#xD;
      treatment, and at the same time, observe the effective rate of this regimen in the mutant&#xD;
      group, so as to provide reference for clinical selection.&#xD;
