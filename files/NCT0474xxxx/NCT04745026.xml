             within 2 years at the trial site or at screening by a qualified assessor). Note:&#xD;
             During special circumstances (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) where the ADOS-2 cannot be&#xD;
             performed due to site restrictions (e.g., mandatory use of face masks) and an ADOS- 2&#xD;
             conducted within 2 years at the trial site by a qualified assessor is not available,&#xD;
             eligibility can be confirmed using: 1) an ADOS-2 performed within 2 years by a&#xD;
             qualified assessor (external to the site); 2) if 1) is not available, eligibility may&#xD;
             be confirmed using the Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R) at screening.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All medications or interventions (including psychosocial interventions, dietary&#xD;
             supplements, probiotics, speech therapy, etc.) for ASD related symptoms must have been&#xD;
             stable for 4 weeks prior to screening and randomization, and the patient/caregiver&#xD;
             should be willing to maintain a stable regimen throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have the ability to swallow the investigational medicinal product&#xD;

             participant's primary care practitioner (if they have one) and consultant (if they&#xD;
             have one) to be notified of participation in the trial if the primary care&#xD;
             practitioner/consultant is different from the investigator.&#xD;

             investigator, may either put the participant, other participants, or site staff at&#xD;

             may affect the participant's ability to take part in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
