    <textblock>
      The study should evaluate the biological distribution of 99mTc-RM26 in patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer and breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the distribution of 99mTc- RM26 in normal tissues and tumors at different time&#xD;
           intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate dosimetry of 99mTc- RM26.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the safety and tolerability of the drug 99mTc- RM26 after a single injection in&#xD;
           a diagnostic dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To compare the obtained 99mTc- RM26 SPECT imaging results with the data of CT and/or MRI&#xD;
      and/or ultrasound examination and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies in prostate cancer and&#xD;
      breast cancer patients.&#xD;

      The overall goal is to study the effectiveness of SPECT imaging prostate cancer and breast&#xD;
      cancer patients Using technetium-99m labeled RM26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biodistribution of 99mTc-RM26 in patients with prostate cancer and breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the distribution of 99mTc-RM26 in normal tissues and tumors in patients with&#xD;
           prostate cancer and breast cancer at different time intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate dosimetry of 99mTc-RM26 based on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug&#xD;
           after a single intravenous administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the safety of use and tolerability of the drug 99mTc-RM26 after a single&#xD;
           intravenous administration in a diagnostic dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional research tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To conduct a comparative analysis of the diagnostic information obtained in the&#xD;
      visualization of prostate cancer and breast cancer by SPECT using 99mTc-RM26 with data&#xD;
      obtained by CT and/or MRI and/or ultrasound examination and immunohistochemical (IHC)&#xD;
      research of postoperative material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, exploratory, single centre study. The subjects will receive a single injection of&#xD;
      the labeled tracer.&#xD;
