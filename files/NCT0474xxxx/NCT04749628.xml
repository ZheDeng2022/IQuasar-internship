  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In light of the opioid epidemic and evidence suggesting that cannabis may be opioid-sparing,&#xD;
      we are in a unique position to conduct a novel, high-impact study that would set the stage&#xD;
      for future RCTs examining the effects of a nonintoxicating and nonaddictive cannabinoid in an&#xD;
      orthopedic patient population. Epidiolex®, an oral cannabidiol (CBD) solution, is the first&#xD;
      ever cannabis-derived medication to be approved by the Food &amp; Drug Administration. Our aim is&#xD;
      to conduct a pilot study using a placebo oral solution, 400mg and 800mg Epidiolex® to gather&#xD;
      data on its effects on patients undergoing bilateral total knee arthroplasty (BTKA). We will&#xD;
      be estimating whether Epidiolex® is associated with minimal opioid use and adequate&#xD;
      analgesia. We will also assess its tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and effects on&#xD;
      inflammatory markers in the perioperative setting.&#xD;

    <description>Brief Pain inventory short form measures the severity of pain and its impact on function. It measures pain from 0-10 0 being no pain whatsoever to 10 being the worst pain imaginable.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid related Symptom Distress Scale (ORSDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>POD1-3</time_frame>
    <description>ORSDS measures opioid related side effects. There are 13 side effects with 3 subcategories (severity, frequency, bothersomeness) each with 5 different responses (scored 0-4).</description>

    <time_frame>Preoperatively; postoperatively in the PACU, morning of postoperative day (POD) 1,2,3 and at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) asks 14 questions, 7 about anxiety and 7 about depression. Responses are scored from 0-3. Responses between the two categories are summed and scoring is as follows: 0-7 = normal, 8-10=borderlines abnormal, 11-21=abnormal</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blinding Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>At Hospital Discharge - up to 3 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are asked which treatment they think they received. The correctness of their guesses is then measured using the bang-blinding index to see if patients were able to accurately guess which treatment they received. It is measured on a scale of -1 to 1. Scores closer to 0 indicate better blinding, or patients not being able to guess their treatment</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to reach discharge physical therapy goals</measure>
    <time_frame>At Hospital discharge - up to 3 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Physical therapy goals for total knee replacement include walking 100 feet, going up and down 4 stairs, and independent transfer (meaning they can move from a lying to standing position independently). Patients need to complete these goals before being discharged</description>
