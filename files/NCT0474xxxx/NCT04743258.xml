    <textblock>
      Rationale: Class II Division 1 malocclusion is characterized by upper anterior teeth&#xD;
      protrusion resulting in upper lip protrusion and convex facial profile, which are considered&#xD;
      esthetically unfavorable. Treatment of class II malocclusion due to maxillary protrusion can&#xD;
      be done with bilateral maxillary first premolar extraction followed by en-masse retraction of&#xD;
      upper anterior teeth using mini implants placed between maxillary 2nd premolar &amp; 1st molar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of class II malocclusion due to maxillary protrusion without premolar extraction&#xD;
      frequently requires distalization of maxillary molars into Class I molar relation by means of&#xD;
      extra-oral or intraoral forces. Absolute skeletal anchorage, available 24 hours a day is an&#xD;
      alternative method for molar distalization. Zygomatic miniplates fixed at a distance from the&#xD;
      root apices, allows distalization of entire dentition as there is no interference between the&#xD;
      fixation device and roots of the teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Objectives: To evaluate dental, skeletal &amp; soft tissue changes achieved with&#xD;
      maxillary premolar extraction vs full arch distalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of study: Patients will be allocated randomly to 2 groups-G1 and G2. Patients in G1&#xD;
      will undergo bilateral maxillary 1st premolar extraction before bonding followed by leveling&#xD;
      &amp; alignment. Maxillary arch will be stabilized with the help of 0.019&quot;×0.025&quot; stainless steel&#xD;
      wire. Hooks will be soldered on archwire used for stabilizing dentition. Mini implants will&#xD;
      be placed under local anaesthesia between maxillary 2nd premolar &amp; 1st molar. Ni-Ti closed&#xD;
      coil spring will be used to apply a force for en masse retraction of maxillary anterior teeth&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In G2, treatment will be initiated by bonding 0.022&quot; slot MBT preadjusted edgewise appliance.&#xD;
      Maxillary arch will be stabilized with the help of 0.019&quot;×0.025&quot; stainless steel wire.&#xD;
      Zygomatic miniplates will be placed bilaterally. Hooks will be soldered on archwire used for&#xD;
      stabilizing dentition. Ni-Ti closed coil spring will be used to apply a force .&#xD;

      The present study is a prospective, non-pharmacological, single blind, randomized clinical&#xD;
      study to evaluate the skeletal, dental and soft tissue changes with distalization of entire&#xD;
      maxillary dentition using bilateral maxillary 1st premolar extraction in comparison with&#xD;
      zygomatic miniplates in class II division 1 patients. The present study will be conducted in&#xD;
      the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics, in conjunction with the&#xD;
      Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, P.G.I.D.S., Pt. B.D.Sharma University of Health&#xD;
      Sciences, Rohtak. The study will be carried out after the institutional approval obtained&#xD;
      from the ethical committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOURCE OF DATA The study sample consists of 34 subjects selected from the patients attending&#xD;
      the regular OPD at the Department of Orthodontics and DentofacialOrthopaedics for orthodontic&#xD;

           compensate for 10% dropouts the final sample size was calculated to be 17 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT OF THE PATIENT AND AGREEMENT TO BE RANDOMIZED A valid, written informed&#xD;
      consent of the patient or parent/ guardian and an agreement to be randomized will be obtained&#xD;
      from the patient before registering the patient in this clinical study. Patient will be&#xD;
      informed about all the theoretical risks and benefits of the intervention under test&#xD;
      (Annexure I). The patient will be given 72 hours to discuss the study with his/her family and&#xD;
      take the decision regarding participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION &amp; ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT Randomization will be done by a person not involved in&#xD;
      the trial using computer generated randomization list. The study subjects will be blinded&#xD;
      regarding intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION AND DESIGN OF STUDY The main intervention in this prospective clinical study is&#xD;
      the extraction of bilateral maxillary first premolars before initial leveling and alignment&#xD;
      with retraction of anterior teeth using mini implants in first group (G1) and is the&#xD;
      placement of zygomatic miniplates after initial leveling and alignment of maxillary dental&#xD;
      arch in second group(G2) . The study consists of 2 groups with equal allocation of subjects&#xD;
      in each group:- Group 1 (G1):- In this group, bilateral maxillary 1st premolars will be&#xD;
      extracted followed by Levelling &amp; alignment with 0.022&quot; MBT preadjusted edgewise appliance.&#xD;
      Maxillary arch will be stabilized with the help of 0.019&quot; × 0.025&quot; stainless steel wire.&#xD;
      Placement of Mini implants bilaterally between maxillary 2nd premolar &amp; 1st molar under LA.&#xD;
      Hooks will be soldered on archwire used for stabilizing dentition. Ni-Ti closed coil spring&#xD;
      will be used to apply force . Regular follow up of the patient will be done and records&#xD;
      including cephalograms and study models will be taken post 6 months of application of NiTi&#xD;
      closed coil spring Group 2 (G2):- In this group treatment will be initiated with 0.022&quot; MBT&#xD;
      preadjusted edgewise appliance. Maxillary arch will be stabilized with the help of 0.019&quot; ×&#xD;
      0.025&quot; stainless steel wire. After that, bilateral Maxillary third molar will be extracted,&#xD;
      if present followed by placement of zygomatic miniplates bilaterally under LA.Hooks will be&#xD;
      soldered on archwire used for stabilizing dentition. Ni-Ti closed coil spring will be used to&#xD;
      apply force . Regular follow up of the patient will be done and records including&#xD;
      cephalograms and study models will be taken post 6 months of application of NiTi closed coil&#xD;
      spring DATA COLLECTION The investigator will record the patient's name, address and contact&#xD;
      number and other relevant case history records (Annexure II) will be taken. Cephalometric&#xD;
      radiographs will be recorded before treatment and after 6 months of application of NiTi&#xD;
      closed coil spring for assessment of hard and soft tissue changes. The pretreatment and post&#xD;
      6 months of application of NiTi closed coil spring the cephalometric radiographs will be&#xD;
      analyzed. The relevant values will be entered in a predesigned format. (Annexure III, IV).&#xD;
      Soft tissue profile changes between pretreatment and post treatment will be assessed on&#xD;
      lateral cephalogram and the raters- orthodontist, laypersons,patients,parents and general&#xD;
      dentists will assess changes in facial appearance on a visual analog scale with profile&#xD;
      photographs and comparison will be done between the two groups. Patient perception will be&#xD;
      assessed using questionare rating by patient regarding various parameters at 1week, 2 weeks,&#xD;
      1 month and 6 months after the placement of zygomatic miniplate or extraction Quality of life&#xD;
      will also be assessed using questionnaire rating by patient at pre-treatment, mid-treatment&#xD;
      and post treatment. Occlusal status changes between pre and post treatment will be assessed&#xD;
      using PAR index(peer assessment rating between 2 groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The data will be entered into Microsoft Excel and analyzed using SPSS&#xD;
      21(Statistical Package For Social Sciences) package for relevant statistical comparison.&#xD;
      Results will be presented in the form of tables and graphs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics will be used. Data will be checked for&#xD;
      normality. In all the analysis, the level of significance will be set a 5 percent.&#xD;
