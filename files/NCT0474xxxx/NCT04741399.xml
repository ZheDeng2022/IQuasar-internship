      EXSTATIC is a multicenter mixed methods convergent study exploring experiences and attitudes&#xD;
      of ICU healthcare professionals caring of agitated traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. The&#xD;
      study aims to explore the experiences and attitudes of ICU nurses and other ICU healthcare&#xD;
      professionals on the management of agitation in acute TBI patients. This project includes&#xD;
      three qualitative methods and one quantitative method. First step consists in structured&#xD;
      observations of the daily routine of ICU healthcare professionals when TBI patient admitted&#xD;
      in the ICU develops agitation. This step will allow us to raise emerging research questions&#xD;
      from the field and to develop subsequent steps. Secondly, we will conduct semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews with ICU nurses. Themes emerged in the interviews are essential to understand&#xD;
      nurses' experiences and attitudes towards TBI agitated patients and describe their relational&#xD;
      role amongst patients, other professionals and families. A retrospective cohort of TBI&#xD;
      patients gathered through medical files will follow aiming to document in which way&#xD;
      observations in the two first phases are reflected in the clinical notes. Finally, different&#xD;
      ICU healthcare professionals will be invited to participate in focus groups to identify&#xD;
      further themes in semi-structured interviews in nurses, compare them and prioritize which are&#xD;
      the most relevant to nurses experiences and which ones need to be addressed for their future&#xD;
      practice. The integration of the different methods will be done using sequential steps of the&#xD;
      research (the previous informing the next one) and by the integration of results for each&#xD;
      step. Qualitative data will be evaluated following the grounded theory using thematic&#xD;
      analysis. Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative results will be combined in a convergent interactive interpretative design. Race&#xD;
      and gender perspective will be integrated in collection, analysis and interpretation of data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A convergent design will be performed using three qualitative research methods (structured&#xD;
      observations, semi-structured interviews and focus groups) and a quantitative research method&#xD;
      (retrospective observational study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, a researcher will observe the daily ICU routine, in two ICU units, when a TBI-patient&#xD;
      is admitted. In this first step, the specific objective is to observe the care of TBI&#xD;
      patients during periods of agitation, to understand how it affects the actions of healthcare&#xD;
      professionals and their interactions with each other and other actors present in the unit.&#xD;
      These observations will enable researchers to detect non-verbal expression of feelings,&#xD;
      interactions and communication between patients, their family and health professionals as&#xD;
      well as interactions between health professionals at the bedside. The observations will also&#xD;
      enable us to map bedside clinical activities made by health professionals and the time spent&#xD;
      doing them. The goal is to develop a repertoire of situations combining the degree of&#xD;
      agitation, the resources present, the experience and the effects on the staff, the patient&#xD;
      and their relatives, the actions and medical decisions in response to agitation. The data&#xD;
      gathered in this phase will inform the interview guide for the semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with ICU nurses to explore&#xD;
      their experiences and attitudes towards the care of TBI patients with agitated behaviours.&#xD;
      Nurses will be interviewed as they are the healthcare professionals most present at the&#xD;
      bedside of TBI patients and their families. Semi-structured interviews enable to explore&#xD;
      nurse's perspectives and experiences. This will also allow us to investigate how these&#xD;
      experiences can predict their reactions to agitated behaviours, and how these reactions are&#xD;
      shared between different health professionals or also with hospital health personnel. This&#xD;
      particular phase enables us to uncover unanticipated themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will then undertake a retrospective observational study aiming to describe the&#xD;
      documentation of agitated behaviours in TBI patients and interventions to manage them. In&#xD;
      this step, the objective is to substantiate the documentation of the significant elements&#xD;
      identified in the first two phases of the study. This third phase will be complementary to&#xD;
      the previous two phases and will allow to document in which way observations in the first two&#xD;
      phases are reflected in the clinical notes. A convenience sample of consecutive admissions&#xD;
      for TBI with an abnormal CT-scan will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, interprofessional focus groups will be conducted in order to gain insights into ICU&#xD;
      healthcare professionals experiences and explore their attitudes and needs when TBI patients&#xD;
      develop agitation. Group process can help people to explore and clarify their views and to&#xD;
      share ideas and perceptions. All healthcare professional who participate in the care of TBI&#xD;
      patients in the ICU will be solicited for participation. Specifically, the aim is to discuss&#xD;
      the various themes identified in the previous steps and understand their relational dimension&#xD;
      among different healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The integration of the different methods will be done by the connection of the different&#xD;
      steps and by the integration of results for each step. This multistep approach allows to&#xD;
      identify organizational, cultural factors and to better understand social interactions as&#xD;
      well as health care delivery process.&#xD;
