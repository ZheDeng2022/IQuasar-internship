      This clinical trial was conducted in a qualified clinical trial institution. Investigators&#xD;
      will use WeFlow-JAAA Stent Graft System manufactured by EndoNom Medtech (Hangzhou) Co., Ltd.&#xD;
      to treat patients with juxta renal abdominal aortic aneurysms. This is a Prospective,&#xD;
      single-center, first in man study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of abdominal aorta&#xD;
      stent graft system in the treatment of patients with juxta renal abdominal aortic aneurysms.&#xD;
      Follow-up will be conducted before discharge, 30 days after surgery, 6 months after surgery&#xD;
      and 12 months after surgery.&#xD;

    <description>The abdominal aorta stent graft system consists of the abdominal aorta embedded stent system, the abdominal aorta bifurcation stent system and the extended stent system. The abdominal aorta embedded stent has two embedded branch stents and two fenestrations. It can be combined with a peripheral small stent system of appropriate specifications to reconstruct the superior mesenteric artery, bilateral renal arteries and keep the abdominal trunk unobstructed. At the same time, the combination of the abdominal aorta embedded stent, the abdominal aorta bifurcation stent and the extended stent can solve the proximal renal and transrenal abdominal aortic aneurysm lesions with the upper edge of the abdominal aortic aneurysm body and the lower edge of the superior mesenteric artery opening ≥ 5 mm.</description>
