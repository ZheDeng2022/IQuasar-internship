      This is a randomized controlled trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Half the patients are&#xD;
      randomized to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and half to routine medical care.&#xD;
      Included are one hundred and twenty patients aged 18-80 years plus patients with ongoing CPAP&#xD;
      scheduled for abdominal surgery at Ume책 university hospital. The primary outcome is oxygen&#xD;
      partial pressure (PaO2) measured on postoperative day 2 compared with the day before surgery.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include diffusion capacity for carbon-monoxide, vital capacity, FEV1 and&#xD;
      carbon-dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2) on postoperative day 2 compared with the day before&#xD;
      surgery. PaO2 and PaCO2 are recorded from blood gas measurements obtained from the radial&#xD;
      artery. Percentage of nocturnal hypoxia defined as the percentage of oxygen saturation during&#xD;
      90% of the second postoperative night. Tolerance to CPAP measured by the number of hours used&#xD;
      CPAP. Side effects related to CPAP. All patients are examined with a simplified sleep apnea&#xD;
      examination (Noxturnal T3, Res Med) the night before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the CPAP treated group are given an auto-CPAP with a minimum pressure of 5 cm and&#xD;
      a maximum pressure of 10 cm. They will be treated with CPAP for at least 2 hours immediately&#xD;
      after surgery and during the first two postoperative nights. Oxygen is supplied to CPAP if&#xD;
      oxygen saturation falls below 90%. Patients in the control group receives standard treatment&#xD;
      and supplemental oxygen if oxygen saturation falls below 90%. In a third arm, we will include&#xD;
      patients who already are using CPAP at night at home for previously diagnosed obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea. are instructed to use CPAP for 2 hours immediately after surgery and subsequent&#xD;
      nights during hospital stay.&#xD;

      Theory Research question: Does nasal CPAP abolish postoperative hypoxia and lung function&#xD;
      decline after abdominal surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This is a randomized controlled trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Half of the&#xD;
      patients are randomized to CPAP and half to routine medical care. Randomization is generated&#xD;
      by a computer program and handled by a person outside the study. Randomization procedure is&#xD;
      documented by the contact person and in the patient's study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Include are one hundred and twenty patients age 18-80 years old, scheduled for abdominal&#xD;
      surgery at Ume책 university hospital. Excluded are patients with American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesia (ASA) class 2-3 and patients with cognitive impairment or dementia, unable to&#xD;
      participate. Patients with ongoing CPAP treatment are not randomized. Instead, they form a&#xD;
      separate group with ongoing CPAP after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) measured on postoperative day 2&#xD;
      compared with the day before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include diffusion capacity for carbon-monoxide, vital capacity, FEV1 and&#xD;
      carbon-dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2) on postoperative day 2 compared with the day before&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PaO2 and PaCO2 are recorded from blood gas measurements obtained from the radial artery.&#xD;
      Percentage of nocturnal hypoxia defined as the percentage of oxygen saturation during 90% of&#xD;
      the second postoperative night. Tolerance to CPAP measured by the number of hours used CPAP.&#xD;
      Side effects related to CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are examined with a simplified sleep apnea examination (Noxturnal T3, Res Med)&#xD;
      the night before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A need of 35 patients in each arm was estimated to detect a difference in mean (SD) in PaO2&#xD;
      of 1 (1.5) kilo Pascal with a significance of p&lt;0.05 and a power of 80%. Due to dropouts, it&#xD;
      is estimated a need to include and randomize 120 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the CPAP treated group are given an auto-CPAP that can increase the pressure&#xD;
      during respiratory arrest (AirSense 10 AutoSet, ResMed Inc) including a silicone nasal mask.&#xD;
      It is set with a minimum pressure of 5 cm and a maximum pressure of 10 cm during instruction&#xD;
      on the day before surgery. Pressure and mask are tested by trained personnel at the Lung&#xD;
      section so that both pressure and mask are comfortable and can be tolerated by the patient.&#xD;
      Immediately after surgery they will be given CPAP for at least 2 hours immediately after&#xD;
      surgery and during the first two postoperative nights. Oxygen is supplied to CPAP if oxygen&#xD;
      saturation falls below 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group receive standard treatment and supplemental oxygen if oxygen&#xD;
      saturation falls below 90%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included in a third arm are patients who already are using CPAP at night at home for&#xD;
      previously diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. They are instructed to use CPAP for 2 hours&#xD;
      immediately after surgery and subsequent nights during hospital stay.&#xD;
