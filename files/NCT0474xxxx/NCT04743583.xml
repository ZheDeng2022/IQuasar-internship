  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of calcifications, which is a relatively common feature in intrathoracic lymph&#xD;
      nodes, typically contributes to confer them a heterogeneous aspect during endosonographic&#xD;
      B-mode examination, but their prevalence and a possible association between calcifications&#xD;
      and metastatic involvement has never been systematically evaluated. We hypothesize that in&#xD;
      patients undergoing mediastinal diagnosis or staging of suspected/known lung cancer the&#xD;
      prevalence of lymph node metastases is similar in calcified and non-calcified lymph nodes.&#xD;

      The presence of calcifications, which is a relatively common feature in intrathoracic lymph&#xD;
      nodes, typically contributes to confer them a heterogeneous aspect during endosonographic&#xD;
      B-mode examination, but a possible association between calcifications and metastatic&#xD;
      involvement has never been systematically evaluated. The most likely reason why this possible&#xD;
      association has been overlooked up to now is that the presence of calcifications in&#xD;
      intrathoracic lymph nodes has long been thought to be the consequence of the prior&#xD;
      involvement from granulomatous diseases (i.e., tuberculosis or sarcoidosis), and as such has&#xD;
      been considered a sign of benignity. However, the presence of lymph node calcifications at&#xD;
      ultrasound examination is a known predictor of lymph node metastasis in patients with some&#xD;
      specific tumours, such as the papillary thyroid carcinoma or the squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
      head or neck. Furthermore, recent radiological-pathological studies have shown that&#xD;
      metastatic foci from lung cancer are observed in up to 19% calcified mediastinal lymph nodes&#xD;
      identified at CT in surgical candidates. Finally, a recently published EBUS study has&#xD;
      reported, for the first time, a very strong association between a very specific pattern of&#xD;
      mediastinal lymph node calcification, known as &quot;starry sky sign&quot;, and metastasis from&#xD;
      pulmonary, colonic and breast adenocarcinoma. Interestingly, the starry sky sign is&#xD;
      characterized by the presence of few to countless dot-like calcifications which are too small&#xD;
      to be seen at CT and can be identified only during EBUS B-mode examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been carried out to assess the correlation&#xD;
      between the presence and the ultrasound pattern of lymph node calcifications and lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis from lung cancer.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>These are the 5 patterns of calcification: a) single macrocalcification; b) multiple macrocalcifications; c) single microcalcification or local cluster of microcalcifications involving a limited area (&lt; 20%) of the lymph node; d) few (&lt; 10) scattered microcalcifications not distributed in a local cluster; e) countless, punctate (&lt; 1 mm) non shadowing foci distributed across the whole lymph node (starry sky sign).</description>

    <description>At the end of the study, two experienced endosonographers from different units/centers, blinded to the clinical, radiological (CT, PET) and pathological details, will be provided a video-clip of each calcified lymph node and will be asked to classify the pattern of calcification.</description>

    <description>This prevalence will be calculated on a per patient basis and will be compared with the prevalence of actionable mutations in a group of consecutive patients with non-calcified lymph nodes submitted to endosonography in the same study period and with the same indications and inclusion/exclusion criteria</description>
