      The purpose of this Managed Access Program (MAP) Cohort Treatment Plan is to provide guidance&#xD;
      to the Physician for the treatment and monitoring of patients in the Cohort MAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Physician should follow the suggested treatment guidelines. Furthermore, the Physician&#xD;
      must comply with the MAP Agreement Letter and applicable local laws and regulations.&#xD;

      Prior to inclusion of a patient in the Cohort, the requesting Physician must submit a request&#xD;
      for access to the product in GEMS (Grants, External Requests and Managed Access System)&#xD;
      accessible through https://www.novartis.com/our-focus/healthcare-professionals/managedaccess-&#xD;
      programs providing the rationale for the request and relevant medical history of the patient.&#xD;
      The request is then assessed against the MAP and Cohort inclusion/exclusion criteria by the&#xD;
      medical team experienced with the product and indication. Upon the required approvals, the&#xD;
      patient is included in the Cohort.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Any other condition that would, in the treating physician's judgment, contraindicate&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on&#xD;
                  the program the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;

                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. In case of use&#xD;
                  of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a&#xD;
                  minimum of 3 months before taking treatment. Women are considered post-menopausal&#xD;
                  and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural&#xD;
                  (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age&#xD;
                  appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks&#xD;
                  before program entry. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level&#xD;
                  assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug&#xD;
             and for 7 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period.&#xD;
             A condom is required for all sexually active male to prevent them from fathering a&#xD;
             child AND to prevent delivery of capmatininb via seminal fluid to partner. In&#xD;
             addition, male participants must not donate sperm for the time period specified above&#xD;
