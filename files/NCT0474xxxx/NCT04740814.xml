    <description>A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:&#xD;
Results in death&#xD;
Is life-threatening&#xD;
Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
Results in persistent disability/incapacity&#xD;
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect&#xD;

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>
