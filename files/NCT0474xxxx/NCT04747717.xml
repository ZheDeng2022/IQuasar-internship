  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy with&#xD;
      mitomycin C plus cisplatin (MP) in BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer versus standard regimen&#xD;
      (paclitaxel plus carboplatin (TP)).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial includes two arms, one of which is experimental arm with MP regimen chemotherapy&#xD;
      that is compared with other arm with the standard TC regimen chemotherapy. To participate in&#xD;
      this study, patients must have histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian carcinoma (ะะก) or&#xD;
      fallopian tubes carcinoma and FIGO stage IIB, IIC, III, or IV disease and BRCA1/BRCA2&#xD;
      germline mutation. All OC patients before the treatment start are subjected to the testing&#xD;
      for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations cases that are examined by the next-generation sequencing. All&#xD;
      BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, who could not be treated by primary debulking surgery owing to&#xD;
      extensive tumor spread, are given neoadjuvant chemotherapy. OC patients are randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive the TP regimen (paclitaxel at175 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC5-6) or the MP regimen&#xD;
      (mitomycin C at 10 mg/m2 and cisplatin at 100 mg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3-4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a formal assessment is made and patients are&#xD;
      categorized according to the RECIST 1.1 standard. The patients who show partial clinical&#xD;
      response or complete clinical response has to be undergoing interval debulking surgery. The&#xD;
      patients who show stabilization of the process should continue chemotherapy for up to 6&#xD;
      cycles, followed by an assessment of the treatment (it is possible to continue up to 12&#xD;
      cycles) and a decision on whether to perform interval debulking surgery. Patients categorized&#xD;
      as progressed clinically has to finish the protocol treatment and are allowed to receive any&#xD;
      secondary treatment at the investigators' discretion. For those patients undergoing interval&#xD;
      debulking surgery has to receive further regimens (up to 6 cycles of protocol treatment)&#xD;
      without changing chemotherapy regimen. After six cycles of protocol treatment, the patients&#xD;
      had to be categorized with regard to their final response status with the use of&#xD;
      clinical/radiologic assessment. Patients not showing disease progression at this point could&#xD;
      cease all cytotoxic therapy or can receive three additional cycles of protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on protocol therapy, patients underwent the following procedures: symptom recording and&#xD;
      physical examination every 3 weeks, complete blood cell counts weekly for the first two&#xD;
      cycles and every 3 weeks thereafter, and laboratory tests of blood and CA 125 measurements on&#xD;
      day 1 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiologic investigations to document the status of all measurable lesions noted at baseline&#xD;
      had to be repeated after three, six, and nine cycles of chemotherapy. Once patients were off&#xD;
      the protocol therapy, they were monitored for assessment of disease status every 3 months for&#xD;
      2 years and every 6 months thereafter. Monitoring comprised clinical examination and CA 125&#xD;
      estimation; routine computed tomography scans were not required but were requested if the CA&#xD;
      125 level rose and/or symptoms developed.&#xD;
