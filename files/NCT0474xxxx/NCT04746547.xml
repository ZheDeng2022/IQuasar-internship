  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stage 1 proposed study will provide evidence to support the use of twice-daily dose 50mg DTG&#xD;
      in children (20-35kgs) co-treated with RIF.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open-label, non-randomised, prospective study evaluating the&#xD;
      steady-state pharmacokinetics of twice-daily dose DTG administered during concurrent RIF&#xD;
      treatment and assessing safety and tolerance in HIV-TB co-infected children weighing 20 to 35&#xD;
      kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DTG will be administered as a twice-daily dose 50mg tablet formulation both before starting&#xD;
      and after completion of the standard six-month RIF-based anti-TB treatment. The NRTI&#xD;
      background and anti-TB drugs will be prescribed following the national weight band dosing&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those initially diagnosed with TB are likely to be sicker, and the recommendation is to start&#xD;
      anti-TB treatment first and follow with ART two weeks later.&#xD;

          -  Severe hepatic impairment or unstable liver disease (as defined by the presence of&#xD;
             ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, oesophageal or gastric&#xD;
             varices, or persistent jaundice), known biliary abnormalities (except for Gilbert's&#xD;
             syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding&#xD;
