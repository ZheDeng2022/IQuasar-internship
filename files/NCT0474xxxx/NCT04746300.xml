      The PROMPT study aims to routinely implement genomic pre-sorting of metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients for personalized treatment (e.g.&#xD;
      immuno-, PARP inhibitors, or platinum-therapy). The investigators hypothesize that, by doing&#xD;
      this early in the disease course (before exhausting standard of care options), it will&#xD;
      improve treatment planning, patient outcome, quality of life, and reduce costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is a major health problem leading to significant morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      men worldwide. Approved therapies for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)&#xD;
      include abiraterone and enzalutamide (targeting the androgen signaling pathway), radium-223&#xD;
      (bone targeting radionuclide therapy), and taxane chemotherapy. Controversy remains on&#xD;
      optimal sequencing of available therapeutic agents, and these drugs are still commonly&#xD;
      prescribed in a trial-and-error manner. Only a minority of patients receives the full benefit&#xD;
      of the anticancer armamentarium, but all experience unnecessary side-effects, quality of life&#xD;
      deterioration, and delay in onset to adequate life-prolonging treatment. In addition, the&#xD;
      prescription of ineffective drugs and avoidable hospital admissions contribute to the&#xD;
      financial burden of health care systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, distinct molecular subsets of prostate cancer have been identified in mCRPC.&#xD;
      These molecular defects may guide physicians in proper sequencing of medication and in&#xD;
      predicting the individual response more accurately. In previous studies using next-generation&#xD;
      sequencing (NGS) mCRPC patients could be grouped into clearly distinct molecular subtypes.&#xD;
      Moreover, in these subtypes biomarkers associated with resistance to certain therapies, or&#xD;
      biomarkers actually predictive for enhanced response were identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will introduce routine molecular characterization in&#xD;
      participants with mCRPC as early as possible in their disease state. Participants will be&#xD;
      screened before initiation of second-line treatment, since early identification will maximize&#xD;
      clinical and financial benefit. Following screening, participants will be discussed in&#xD;
      molecular tumor board and clinical meetings, and stratified to the agent they are most likely&#xD;
      to respond to. Translational research is included to identify and validate additional&#xD;
      predictive molecular biomarkers.&#xD;
