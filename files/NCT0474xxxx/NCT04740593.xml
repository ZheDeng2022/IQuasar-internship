  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized controlled trial, we will establish whether early glasses for high refractive&#xD;
      error at age one reduce the development of amblyopia between age one and four. As a secondary&#xD;
      outcome early literacy will be compared in groups with and without glasses.&#xD;

      Background of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amblyopia (prevalence approx. 3.4%) develops in early childhood when the child's eyes have&#xD;
      severe refractive error, when they squint, or both. It can effectively be treated with&#xD;
      glasses and patching the better eye, but treatment should start before age 6 to be effective.&#xD;
      Therefore, visual acuity should be measured in all children aged 4-5 to detect amblyopia&#xD;
      early enough. In an effort to prevent the development of amblyopia all together, in some&#xD;
      countries devices are being used to measure refractive error in toddlers and, when refractive&#xD;
      error is severe, fit them glasses before amblyopia develops. In Flanders, the measurement of&#xD;
      refractive error in 1- and 2.5-year-olds began in 2012, in addition to regular vision&#xD;
      screening with measurement of the visual acuity at the age of 3, 4 and 5. Between 2012 and&#xD;
      2017 the percentage of 4-year-old glasses wearing children had risen from 4.7% to 6.4%, but&#xD;
      it was unknown how many cases of amblyopia had been prevented from developing. A prospective&#xD;
      comparison seems warranted between this new method and the current national vision screening&#xD;
      program in the Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether treating children with high refractive errors at age one with glasses&#xD;
      prevents the development of amblyopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform an interventional prevention study comparing the effect of prescribing&#xD;
      glasses to children with high refractive error at age 1 (intervention) versus no prescription&#xD;
      of glasses (control) on the prevalence of amblyopia at age 4. 12-18-months-old children will&#xD;
      be recruited by the study physician after visiting the children's healthcare centers (CHCs)&#xD;
      at 11 or 14 months. Refractive error will be determined by retinoscopy in cycloplegia in all&#xD;
      children. Children with refractive error exceeding the AAPOS 2003 criteria (Donahue et al.&#xD;
      2003) are considered to have high refractive error in this study. We anticipate that 8% of&#xD;
      all children will have high refractive error according to these criteria. These children will&#xD;
      be randomized to the intervention group or the control group, and will be followed up until&#xD;
      final examination at age 4 with visual acuity serving as primary outcome. In case amblyopia&#xD;
      or strabismus develops during the course of the study, children will be referred for&#xD;
      immediate treatment, and visual acuity at the moment of referral will be used as primary&#xD;
      outcome. In all children in the intervention group compliance with wearing spectacles will be&#xD;
      measured electronically. At age 4 pre-literacy skills will be measured in the intervention&#xD;
      group and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of children, approximately 92%, will have mild or no refractive error at age&#xD;
      one. After the first examination, these children will continue regular vision screening at&#xD;
      the CHCs. They will have their visual acuity measured at the age of 4 as part of standard&#xD;
      vision screening in the Netherlands at the CHCs, which will serve as secondary outcome. If&#xD;
      there is uncertainty about the visual outcome at the CHC, the child will receive a&#xD;
      supplementary examination. Children with amblyopia or strabismus at the age of one will be&#xD;
      excluded from this study and referred for immediate treatment. Due to ethical considerations,&#xD;
      children with severe refractive error at the age of one, i.e. exceeding the AAPOS 2003&#xD;
      criteria twofold, will also be excluded from this study and referred for immediate treatment&#xD;
      with glasses. Due the nature and design of the study, blinding of the researchers on site and&#xD;
      of participants will not be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study we will recruit an estimated 2000-4000 healthy children aged 12-18 months&#xD;
      after visiting one of the participating CHCs, located in different regions of the&#xD;
      Netherlands: Utrecht, Harderwijk/Ermelo/Putten, Tiel/Geldermalsen/Culemborg,Roermond/Venlo&#xD;
      and Eindhoven. It is estimated that approximately 8% of all included children will have high&#xD;
      refractive error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children assigned to the intervention group will be examined by the study orthoptist one to&#xD;
      three times yearly until final examination, and will be fitted with glasses, based on&#xD;
      accurate determinations of refractive error by retinoscopy in cycloplegia. Children with high&#xD;
      refractive error assigned to the control group will be examined by the study orthoptist one&#xD;
      to three times yearly until final examination, but will not be fitted with glasses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of amblyopia at the final examination, stratified according to visual acuity&#xD;
      of the amblyopic eye in the intervention group and in the control group. The final&#xD;
      examination will take place at the age of 4, unless children have been referred to an&#xD;
      orthoptist and/or ophthalmologist before, for example when amblyopia or strabismus are&#xD;
      suspected before the age of 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence of amblyopia at age 1;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type and severity of refractive error at age 1;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurrence of amblyopia at the final examination, stratified according to visual acuity&#xD;
           of the amblyopic eye in the children without high refractive error at age 1;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-literacy skills in the intervention and control group at age 4;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurrence of strabismus, determined at the final examination in all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electronically measured compliance with spectacles wearing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The evolution of refractive error between age 1 and 4;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family history for ocular disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethnicity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parental level of education, social economic status and language skill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected burden and risks associated with participation can be considered minimal. In&#xD;
      order to measure refractive error accurately, retinoscopy will be done by study orthoptists&#xD;
      after the instillation of cycloplegic eye drops, as happens daily in clinical practice of&#xD;
      orthoptists and pediatric ophthalmologists. We will install 1 eyedrop of cyclopentolate 1% in&#xD;
      each eye, which we will repeat after 10 minutes. Cyclopentolate can cause sleepiness in rare&#xD;
      cases: children are difficult to awaken for several minutes, but can be awoken thereafter,&#xD;
      which is without sequelae without exception.&#xD;
