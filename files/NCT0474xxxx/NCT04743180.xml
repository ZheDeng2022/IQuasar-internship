    <textblock>
      The objective of this all-comers registry is to explore the safety, efficacy, and&#xD;
      cost-efficiency of the LUMINOR© DEB in de-novo and restenotic-FP lesions. For de-novo and&#xD;
      restenotic lesions, especially for calcified and/or long lesions/occlusions, the use of&#xD;
      debulking devices to improve recalibration and drug penetration will be evaluated in a&#xD;
      specific sub-group.&#xD;
