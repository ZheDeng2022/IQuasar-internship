  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 implants from patients seeking treatment at the University of Oklahoma,&#xD;
      College of Dentistry will be recruited for this study. Osteotomies will be prepared using the&#xD;
      osseodensification technique and implants will be placed immediately after. The implants will&#xD;
      be from a single manufacturer (Roxolid® SLA® Bone Level Tapered; Straumann®, Institut&#xD;
      Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland). Volumetric analysis of alveolar ridge will be studied&#xD;
      using intra-surgical direct measurements and CBCT imaging. A custom stent will be fabricated&#xD;
      to standardize the clinical and radiographic measurements at 2mm, 3mm, and 4mm apical to the&#xD;
      alveolar crest. Changes in peri-implant bone density will be analyzed on standardized&#xD;
      periapical and bitewing radiographs, using the ImageJ software (National Institute of Health,&#xD;
      Bethesda, Maryland, USA). Implant stability quotient (ISQ) values will be recorded with a&#xD;
      resonance frequency analysis system (Osstell®, Gothenburg, Sweden). Calibrated examiners will&#xD;
      assess implant survival and biological or restorative complications and failures. Sites will&#xD;
      be evaluated throughout osseointegration and one year after final restoration is delivered.&#xD;

    <description>Alveolar bone remodeling after tooth extraction may result in significant ridge resorption and inadequate bone volume for implant placement. Several methods have been designed for ridge augmentation, among which is the new technique of osseodensification, using the Densah® burs by Versah® (Versah®, LLC, Jackson, MI, USA). This method compresses the trabecular bone to periphery of the osteotomy site and has shown up to 80% ridge expansion in animal histological studies , , , , , . Apart from being an animal model with a short follow-up, another limitation of these studies is the lack of three-dimensional evaluation of the change in morphology of the ridge. Human clinical studies , , , , have reported similar results, but they do not evaluate if this bone volume is retained during osseointegration and loading periods. No standardization method or long-term evaluation of peri-implant health was reported.</description>
