      Aim of the Work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this work is to compare the outcomes of tunneled femoral catheter (TFC) and&#xD;
      femoro-femoral AVG as regards survival, complication and quality of life as bailout procedure&#xD;
      for hemodialysis in CRF patient with exhausted upper limb extremity and chest wall vascular&#xD;
      accesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-centre prospective randomized controlled trial that will be conducted in The&#xD;
      Vascular Surgery Department, Mansoura University Hospital, during the period from November&#xD;
      2020 to November 2022. It will be submitted for approval by Institutional Review Board,&#xD;
      faculty of medicine, Mansoura University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be on patients referred to the vascular surgery department&#xD;
      suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with exhausted upper-extremity and chest wall&#xD;
      vascular accesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, The investigator will include all ESRD patients belonging to the age group (≥&#xD;
      15 years) who complain of exhaustion of all upper extremity vascular accesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will exclude patients with previous history or evident deep venous&#xD;
      thrombosis (DVT), varicose veins, femoral vein stenosis, arterial insufficiency, severe groin&#xD;
      or limb infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive history will be taken from the patients with regard to patient's&#xD;
      demographics, underlying medical conditions, duration since the starting of haemodialysis,&#xD;
      previous trials of vascular access, history of DVT and arterial insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, patients will be examined to exclude any possibility for upper extremity vascular&#xD;
      access. A meticulous examination of both lower limbs is done to assess the possibility of&#xD;
      infection, signs of venous stenosis or arterial inefficiency including palpation of&#xD;
      accessible lower limb arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine laboratory investigations are carried out for all patients including complete blood&#xD;
      count, liver function tests, renal function tests, arterial blood gases, bleeding and&#xD;
      coagulation profiles, fasting and 2hr-postprandial serum glucose level, lipid profile, and&#xD;
      glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further investigations include duplex ultrasonography (US) assessing for both superficial and&#xD;
      deep venous system of the both lower limb. Bilateral lower limb arterial duplex is done to&#xD;
      exclude any arterial disease. Also, a preoperative venous mapping of lower limb veins is&#xD;
      mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures and Postoperative care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tunneled femoral catheter: a standard technique is adopted according to the study&#xD;
           performed by Herzallah using long tunneled catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Femoral artery-femoral arteriovenous graft: a straight or loop configuration Ponikvar&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints and Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will be followed every week until first month, then every 3 months until the&#xD;
      end of the first years so that the hemodynamic improvement will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Evaluation of primary patency rates within the study follow-up time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of TFC: Normally an extracorporeal blood flow should be about 300 ml/min. based&#xD;
           on this, the catheter dysfunction can be defined by the first occurrence of either peak&#xD;
           blood flow of 200 ml per minute or less for 30 minutes during a dialysis treatment, mean&#xD;
           blood flow of 250 ml per minute or less during two consecutive dialysis treatments, or&#xD;
           inability to initiate dialysis owing to inadequate blood flow, after attempts to restore&#xD;
           patency have been attempted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of AVG, stenosis &gt; 50% of the prosthesis diameter or complete occlusion is&#xD;
           considered significant. This can be assessed by duplex ultrasonography every six months&#xD;
           or when the patency is questionable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patency rates will be determined according to the reporting standards, set by the&#xD;
      Committee of Reporting Standards for arteriovenous hemodialysis accesses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary patency: the patency rates will be determined according to the reporting&#xD;
           standards, set by the Committee of Reporting Standards for arteriovenous hemodialysis&#xD;
           accesses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The special adverse events complicating lower-extremity hemodialysis access. The&#xD;
           severity of arteriovenous access complications will be graded according to the Reporting&#xD;
           Standards document . Complications are defined according Clavien-Dindo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction will be assessed using a validated tool, the vascular access score&#xD;
           questionnaire, at 6 and 12 months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Besides, operative time, hospital stay, and survival rate will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the average of the primary outcome (primary patency), a previous study showed that&#xD;
      the mean rate in AVGs at 6 months was 53%, while another study showed that the mean rate in&#xD;
      TFC at six months was 14%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using sample size calculation software (www.clincalc.com), a minimum of 44 patients will be&#xD;
      needed to achieve a study power of 80% with alpha set at 5%. Estimating a drop-out rate and&#xD;
      loss to follow-up of 10%, a total of 48 patients will be ultimately included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random sequence generation and blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one of two groups; group I Tunneled femoral catheter and group&#xD;
      II Femoral artery-femoral vein graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be undertaken by the sealed envelope method using randomization software.&#xD;
      Neither the operating surgeons nor the assessors during the follow-up will be aware about&#xD;
      patients' participation in the study.&#xD;
