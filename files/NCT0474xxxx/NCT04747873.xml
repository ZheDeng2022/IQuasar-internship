    <textblock>
      This randomized trial intervention will provide e-CBT for MDD through the Online&#xD;
      Psychotherapy Tool (OPTT), a secure, cloud-based, digital mental health platform.&#xD;
      Participants (age: 18-65 years) will be offered an e-CBT program tailored to MDD over 12&#xD;
      weeks to address their depressive symptoms. Participants will complete pre-designed modules&#xD;
      and homework assignments while receiving personalized feedback and asynchronous interaction&#xD;
      with a therapist through the platform. The content of the e-CBT modules is designed to mirror&#xD;
      in-person standard CBT for MDD. There will be 12 weekly sessions that include approximately&#xD;
      30 slides each along with interactive content, delivered through OPTT. Using clinically&#xD;
      validated symptomology questionnaires, the efficacy of the e-CBT program will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Both groups will receive the 12-week e-CBT program with one group receiving the standard&#xD;
      program. In the second arm, a stepped care approach can be implemented if deemed necessary by&#xD;
      the care provider. This decision will be made if the participant has not shown improvement.&#xD;
      Questionnaire data along with physiological data will be used to determine the decision.&#xD;

      Participants Participants (n = 110; 55 e-CBT participants, 55 e-CBT + stepped care&#xD;
      participants) aged 18-65 years will be recruited at Queen's University from outpatient&#xD;
      psychiatry clinic at both Kingston Health Sciences Centre sites (Hotel Dieu Hospital and&#xD;
      Kingston General Hospital) as well as Providence Care hospital, family doctors, physicians,&#xD;
      clinicians, and self-referrals in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Once informed consent is&#xD;
      provided, participants will be evaluated by a psychiatrist on the research team through&#xD;
      secure video appointment to make or confirm a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)&#xD;
      using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria for the study include the following: at least 18 years of age at the&#xD;
      start of the study, diagnosed with major depressive disorder according to DSM-5 by an&#xD;
      attending psychiatrist on the research team, competence to consent to participate, ability to&#xD;
      speak and read English, and consistent and reliable access to the internet. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria include active psychosis, acute mania, severe alcohol or substance use disorder,&#xD;
      and/or active suicidal or homicidal ideation. If a participant is receiving another form of&#xD;
      psychotherapy, they will also be excluded from the study, to avoid any confounding effect on&#xD;
      the efficacy of this e-CBT program. If eligible for the study, participants will choose&#xD;
      between the e-CBT program (n = 55) or the in-person CBT offered individually through this&#xD;
      program at Hotel Dieu Hospital (n = 55).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the informed consent process, it is explained to all participants that this program is&#xD;
      not a crisis resource and that they will not have access to their therapist at all times. In&#xD;
      the case of an emergency, participants are directed to the proper resources (e.g., emergency&#xD;
      department, crisis lines, etc.) and this event will be reported to the principal investigator&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online Module Content Both e-CBT modules and in-person CBT sessions are designed to instill&#xD;
      constructive and balanced coping strategies in participants. During the program, we focus on&#xD;
      essential thinking and behavioural skills to help the patients become more engaged in&#xD;
      day-to-day activities. The focus of the sessions is placed on the connection between&#xD;
      thoughts, behaviours, emotions, physical reactions, and the environment. We work on&#xD;
      evaluating negative beliefs and thought processes and their relationship with depression. Our&#xD;
      goal is to adjust the negative thinking so that participants can think about and adapt to the&#xD;
      things that are happening to them. This allows them to adjust the way they behave and think&#xD;
      about their problems in a way that is not as negative and replaces those thoughts and&#xD;
      behaviours with potentially more realistic and productive ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e-CBT Procedures The e-CBT care plan consists of 12 weekly sessions of approximately 30&#xD;
      slides and interactive content, delivered through OPTT. The e-CBT module content mirrors&#xD;
      in-person standard CBT content, including different weekly topics, general information, skill&#xD;
      overviews, and homework. Participants are instructed to go through the content and complete&#xD;
      homework at the end of the session which helps them practice skills they learned through that&#xD;
      session. Homework is submitted through OPTT and reviewed by the therapist assigned to the&#xD;
      participant, who will provide personalized feedback within three days of submission.&#xD;
      Therapists have access to pre-designed session-specific feedback templates to use as a basic&#xD;
      structure to write their feedback. By doing so, the time needed to respond to each patient is&#xD;
      reduced and therefore the number of patients each therapist can handle increases. At the same&#xD;
      time, by using a structured format in responding to patients, a more standardized quality of&#xD;
      care can be assured. The general structure of the feedback template is as follows:&#xD;
      -validating the participant's time and effort, -reviewing the event they have used in their&#xD;
      homework, -summarizing the previous module's content, and -discussing the participant's&#xD;
      homework submission and how they could improve it. In addition to these points, the feedback&#xD;
      will have an emphasis on specific content from the participant's submission, reassuring them&#xD;
      that their therapist is reading and understanding their challenges. All feedback submissions&#xD;
      are finished with a personalized signature from the therapist, helping to develop a rapport&#xD;
      between the therapist and the participant. On average, developing this feedback takes a&#xD;
      therapist 15-20 minutes per patient. In addition to the weekly feedback, participants have&#xD;
      the option to message their therapist through the platform throughout the week regarding any&#xD;
      questions or concerns they may have. All technical issues are handled directly through OPTT's&#xD;
      technical support team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stepped Care Procedure For the stepped care e-CBT group, the decision of whether to add in&#xD;
      the additional care will be made starting at the end of week 3. This decision will be made by&#xD;
      the principal investigator using the questionnaire and wearable tracker data (Fitbit). The&#xD;
      wearable will record heart rate, sleep patterns, and physical activity information. Five&#xD;
      possible interventions (see below) may be implemented on a step-by-step basis. If the&#xD;
      participant does not show signs of improvement, they will advance to the next step with a&#xD;
      total of five steps. Once the participant advances to the next step, they can revert to a&#xD;
      previous step if they show signs of improvement or once again advance to the next step if&#xD;
      they do not show signs of improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1 (Message from Therapist): The participant will receive a message from their assigned&#xD;
      care provider on OPTT who check in with them about some of the strategies and techniques they&#xD;
      will have discussed and remind them of their weekly homework due date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2 (Phone Call): The participant will receive a phone call from their therapist who will&#xD;
      check in on them, remind them of some therapy strategies and techniques, and verbally and&#xD;
      remind them of their weekly homework due date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3 (Enhanced Telephone Call): The participant will receive a telephone call from their&#xD;
      assigned care provider who will check in on them, remind them of some therapy strategies and&#xD;
      techniques and their weekly session due date, and provide a CBT summary of previously&#xD;
      reviewed CBT concepts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4 (Video Call): The participant will receive a video call (via Microsoft Teams) from&#xD;
      their therapist who will check in on them, remind them of their weekly session due to date,&#xD;
      and provide CBT content support to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 5 (Video Call Sessions): The final stage involves the participant receiving their CBT&#xD;
      sessions in a live video call format (via Microsoft Teams) with the research psychiatrist&#xD;
      involved in their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training All therapists are research assistants hired by the principal investigator. They all&#xD;
      undergo training in psychotherapy and additional training from a psychiatrist on the research&#xD;
      team before any interaction with participants. During this training, therapists complete&#xD;
      feedback on practice homework, which is reviewed by a psychiatrist on the research team to&#xD;
      ensure adequate quality of work. All therapists are supervised by the lead psychiatrist, who&#xD;
      is an expert in the area of electronically delivered psychotherapy. Feedback is always&#xD;
      reviewed by the lead psychiatrist, before submission to the participants.&#xD;
