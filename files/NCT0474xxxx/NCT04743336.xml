  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to examine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and stage/grade of&#xD;
      periodontitis per the current classification of periodontal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      142 patients (82 males/60 females) were included in this study. &quot;2017 World Workshop on the&#xD;
      Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions&quot; was taken as basis to&#xD;
      characterize the stage/grade of periodontitis. As well as age, gender, smoking status, and&#xD;
      frequency of tooth brushing, medical data of the patients including hypertension,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, BMI, and diabetes mellitus were obtained from the patient's hospital records.&#xD;
      Obesity was assessed by BMI using the &quot;World Health Organization&quot; criteria.&#xD;

      In this retrospective study, dental and medical records of 200 patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      periodontitis who applied to Baskent University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of&#xD;
      Periodontology between January 2019 and January 2021 were reviewed. Fifty three patients were&#xD;
      excluded due to unclear or missing data, and five subjects were not included as they were&#xD;
      under the age of 18. The final study population therefore consisted of 142 patients (82&#xD;
      males/60 females).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As well as age, gender, smoking status, and frequency of tooth brushing, medical data of the&#xD;
      patients including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, BMI, and diabetes mellitus were obtained&#xD;
      from the patient's hospital records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal records of the patients were obtained for six different sites (mesio-buccal,&#xD;
      mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual, and disto-lingual) per tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean ± standard deviation (SD) and median (minimum-maximum) were utilized for quantitative&#xD;
      variables, and number of patients (percentage) were utilized for qualitative variables as&#xD;
      descriptors. For quantitative variables, Kruskal-Wallis H test was performed to see whether&#xD;
      there was a statistically significant difference between categories of the qualitative&#xD;
      variable with more than two categories. Chi-square test was used for investigating the&#xD;
      relationship between two qualitative variables. For determining the risk factors considered&#xD;
      to have an effect on the dependent quantitative variable, univariate and multivariate&#xD;
      logistic regression analyses were performed. Statistical significance level was defined to be&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
