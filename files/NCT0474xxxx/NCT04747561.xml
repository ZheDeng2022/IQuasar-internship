      This study is a diagnostic study. Patients and healthy volunteers were recruited from&#xD;
      clinically suspected or confirmed melanoma patients to undergo 18F-PEG3-FPN PET/MR or PET/CT&#xD;
      imaging to observe the response of the subjects after drug injection, and evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of 18F-PEG3-FPN PET imaging in the diagnosis and staging of melanoma compared with&#xD;
      18F-FDG PET imaging. PET/CT imaging was performed in patients with contraindications to MR.&#xD;
      The subjects underwent 18F-PEG3-FPN and 18F-FDG PET/MR or PET/CT imaging at an interval of&#xD;
      two days, respectively. The general information, clinical data, blood routine, liver and&#xD;
      kidney function indexes, 18F-PEG3-FPN and 18F-FDG PET/MR or PET/CT imaging results and other&#xD;
      imaging data of the patients and volunteers were collected, and the histopathology of biopsy&#xD;
      or surgical specimen was taken as the final diagnostic criteria. This study plans to set the&#xD;
      sample size as 50 cases.&#xD;

      This team always picolinamide structure based, successfully synthesized a positron nuclide&#xD;
      targeting melanin probe - 18-5 - f FPN [18 f - 5 - fluoro - N - (2 - (diethyl amino) ethyl)&#xD;
      pyridine formamide] for PET imaging, we found that combining FPN and melanin with high&#xD;
      specificity and favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics, can be sensitive to detect the&#xD;
      tiny metastases (lung, lymph node metastasis), which shows good potential of PET imaging for&#xD;
      melanoma.The preparation method of 18F-5-FPN is simple and can be directly synthesized and&#xD;
      purified by GE's synthesis module automatically.Then, we optimized the probe with triethylene&#xD;
      glycol (PEG3), 18F-PEG3-FPN, to improve the labeling rate of the probe (44.68% &gt;;6.98%,&#xD;
      18F-5-FPN), reduced its uptake in the liver, improved its drug distribution in vivo, and was&#xD;
      successfully applied in the detection of liver metastasis.The integrated TOF PET/MR imaging&#xD;
      equipment is the most advanced imaging equipment at present, which combines the advantages of&#xD;
      PET and MR. With the high sensitivity of PET and the high soft tissue contrast of MR, it has&#xD;
      obvious advantages over PET/CT in head, neck, abdomen and pelvic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, MR has no additional radiation and is more biosafety. With 18 f - PEG3 -&#xD;
      FPN in clinical potential of melanoma imaging, 18 f - this project intends to apply PEG3 -&#xD;
      FPN integrated PET/MR imaging diagnosis and staging of malignant melanoma tumors and clinical&#xD;
      use of 18 f - FDG PET/CT imaging contrast, design of a prospective study, explore 18 f - PEG3&#xD;
      - FPN detection performance of melanoma, to make up for 18 f - FDG PET imaging diagnosis and&#xD;
      staging of melanoma value.&#xD;
