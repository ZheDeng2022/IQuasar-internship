  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in the US. Mild stroke&#xD;
      comprises half of stroke hospital admissions, but most people with mild stroke receive no&#xD;
      rehabilitation services. Mild stroke is often the manifestation of uncontrolled chronic&#xD;
      conditions (e.g. hypertension, diabetes), and people with mild stroke also experience ongoing&#xD;
      chronic symptoms (e.g. depression, fatigue) that may impact their daily activities. An&#xD;
      inability to manage chronic conditions and symptoms may lead to decreased participation in&#xD;
      pre-stroke roles and activities, which may increase the chance of sustaining a second stroke.&#xD;
      An effective intervention to manage chronic conditions and support participation is&#xD;
      self-management. A meta-review of 13 systematic reviews demonstrated that self-management&#xD;
      interventions significantly improve stroke survivors' daily activities, independence, and&#xD;
      mortality. National research agendas from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)&#xD;
      and Institute of Medicine (IOM) include self-management as one key goal of a strategic&#xD;
      framework, aligning with the AOTF Research Priorities, for promoting (1) health behaviors to&#xD;
      prevent and manage chronic conditions. Our preliminary studies indicate that mobile health&#xD;
      (mHealth), defined as the delivery of healthcare services via mobile devices, can be used to&#xD;
      precisely monitor participation in daily activities and mood and is acceptable in stroke&#xD;
      survivors. Our meta-analysis indicates that digital self-management interventions are more&#xD;
      effective in improving depression, fatigue, anxiety, and self-efficacy in people with&#xD;
      neurologic disorders in comparison to non-digital self-management interventions. These&#xD;
      studies support the AOTF Research Priorities that include (2) use of technology to support&#xD;
      home and community activities, and (3) emotional influences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The investigators will harness mHealth technology for a self-management program.&#xD;
      Our intervention is a mobile phone intervention called iOTA, which builds on extensive work&#xD;
      by my mHealth mentor and colleagues in health behavior research. The investigators will use a&#xD;
      formal implementation science framework to adapt and test the iOTA intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators will cohere an adaptation framework by soliciting stakeholder input to adapt&#xD;
      the iOTA from Improving Participation after Stroke Self-Management (IPASS), an evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention that targets self-management of chronic conditions and increased community&#xD;
      participation in stroke survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will use a two-step approach, including a rigorous treatment&#xD;
      adaptation and a Phase I feasibility trial. Our first step is to adapt the intervention with&#xD;
      input from all relevant stakeholder levels. Our second step is to use a pre-post,&#xD;
      non-randomized study design to test the adapted iOTA. Ten community-dwelling people with mild&#xD;
      stroke will participate in the iOTA for 3 months. The iOTA incorporates daily short message&#xD;
      service (SMS) text messages to supplement monthly in-person health coaching and weekly&#xD;
      videoconference sessions. The investigators will include an occupational therapist (OT) as a&#xD;
      health coach to teach individuals to incorporate self-management strategies into their daily&#xD;
      routines to support participation in meaningful activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcome: This mHealth treatment development study will increase the reach and access&#xD;
      of IPASS-a patient-centered, participation-focused self-management program for stroke&#xD;
      survivors. The iOTA created will not only maximize our potential for the future randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) but also lay the groundwork for future funding mechanisms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will take 30 stroke survivors and have them participate in a&#xD;
      3-month study consisting of screening, assessments, goal setting, health coaching, EMA&#xD;
      surveys, and feedback on how to improve the study for a future expanded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the research team consents and enrolls participants, participants will be randomized&#xD;
      and complete screening, assessment, and training on the video conferencing system, training&#xD;
      on the Status/Post and SMS. The screening measures and assessments that will be performed&#xD;
      are: Participation Strategies Self-Efficacy Scale, PROMIS Self Efficancy, Stroke Impact&#xD;
      Scale, Activity Card Sort, Reintegration to Normal Living Index, PHQ-9, PROMIS 29+2, Light&#xD;
      House Test, Boston Naming Test, and Short Blessed Test form are all assessments that will be&#xD;
      performed online through REDCap via a secure link over the phone or email. The last three&#xD;
      tests are screening instruments. The investigators can perform all assessments online through&#xD;
      REDCap via a secure link over the phone or email. All data collected will be directly entered&#xD;
      into REDCap. Participants will receive an iPod touch if they do not have an iPhone which will&#xD;
      be mailed to them to use for the next 14 days. Participants will complete the EMA assessment&#xD;
      prototype 5x/day for 14 days via the Status/post-application. Goals will also be set that the&#xD;
      participant would like to achieve. If participants do not have a phone or mobile device&#xD;
      capable of using the video conferencing system and SMS, the investigators will mail them an&#xD;
      iPad to use for the study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 15 MyIPASS participants will engage in video conference sessions between the pre and post&#xD;
      visits. A health coach will collaboratively work with the participant to practice treatment&#xD;
      strategies and set goals in weekly individual sections. In addition, all participants will&#xD;
      engage in weekly group sessions with a health coach in order to learn and practice specific&#xD;
      self-management skills and strategies in a group context. In addition, MyIPASS entails using&#xD;
      an interactive SMS to provide ongoing support and self-monitoring of behavior change goals.&#xD;
      The SMS is programmed to &quot;touch&quot; participants daily; the SMS system prompts participants to&#xD;
      report their daily activities and progress in achieving goals via &quot;check-in&quot; messages and&#xD;
      sends immediate, tailored feedback about their progress. If a participant is making progress&#xD;
      toward their goal, the SMS system will suggest a change to the participant's goal between&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 15 attentional control group stroke survivors will receive phone calls over the 12-week&#xD;
      intervention checking in with them on how they are doing in their everyday life. They will&#xD;
      also receive stroke education materials, but they will not receive the same MyIPASS&#xD;
      intervention as the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre-selected time will be scheduled for the participant to complete their post-assessments,&#xD;
      and complete an interview after the 12 weeks via the phone. The assessments will be&#xD;
      administered the same as they were in the pre-test, given a link over the phone or email to a&#xD;
      secure RedCap site which will include the following assessments: Client Satisfaction&#xD;
      Questionnaire (CSQ), Healing Encounters &amp; Attitudes Lists - Patient-Provider Connection&#xD;
      (HEAL-PPC), PROMIS Self Efficancy, Stroke Impact Scale, Activity Card Sort, Reintegration to&#xD;
      Normal Living Index, PHQ-9, PROMIS 29+2, Acceptability of Implementation Measure (AIM),&#xD;
      Appropriateness of Implementation Measure (IAM), and Feasibility of Implementation Measures&#xD;
      after the intervention. The investigators will ask them to mail the iPod back to the lab when&#xD;
      they are finished with their 14-day surveys with a prepaid envelope. If participants used an&#xD;
      iPad, they will return it to the lab via mail in a prepaid envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the trial, the investigators will ask the 30 stroke survivors, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct the feedback questions during the follow-up phone appointment. All&#xD;
      interviews will be facilitated by a moderator. Moderators will be trained with the interview&#xD;
      guide and Computer Usage Questionnaire. Sessions will be audio/video recorded to allow for&#xD;
      transcription and analysis. Participants may share as much as they would like or feel&#xD;
      comfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from participants will be collected from screening measures, assessments, and the SMS&#xD;
      prototype. Please refer to the attachment for knowing what coded data will be extracted from&#xD;
      the SMS dashboard. During the data collection process, members of the research team may&#xD;
      photograph the participant doing a variety of tasks if given permission.&#xD;
