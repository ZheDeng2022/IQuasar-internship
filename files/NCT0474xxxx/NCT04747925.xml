      back extensors and abdominals. 34 patients in Group B is receiving moist heat for the&#xD;
      hamstrings muscles prior the Mulligan Bent leg raise technique for 10 minutes.Study duration&#xD;
      was of 6 months. Sampling technique being applied is purposive.Study includes patients with&#xD;
      mechanical LBP more than 3 months.Tools being used in the study are Goniometer, Measuring&#xD;

      The term Low Back Pain (LBP) refers to pain in the lumbo-sacral area of the spine from 1st&#xD;
      lumbar vertebra to the 1st sacral vertebra. Low back pain (LBP) can be caused by different&#xD;
      varieties of problems with any parts of the complex, interconnected network of spinal&#xD;
      muscles, nerves, bones, discs or tendons in the lumbar spine.The stability and support of the&#xD;
      trunk area is mainly dependent on strength of supporting structures, the muscles. Weak back&#xD;
      extensor muscles can result improper vertebral alignment which may lead to undue loading on&#xD;
      the spine. Causes of low back pain can be due to many factors, for example: individual&#xD;
      characteristics, working environment such as heavy physical work, awkward static and dynamic&#xD;
      working postures, as well as manual handling and lifting, lifestyle factors and psychological&#xD;
      factors. It can also be caused because of muscle sprain, ligament sprain, poor posture, age,&#xD;
      disc bulge, other causes of low back pain include bladder/kidney infection, endometriosis,&#xD;
      cancer, or ovarian problems Hamstring muscles are comprised of three semitendinosus,&#xD;
      semimembranosus and biceps femoris. They are located on the posterior compartment of the&#xD;
      thigh. Hamstring muscles are two joint muscles of body its function is hip extension and knee&#xD;
      flexion. Injury rate within hamstring muscle, is the long head of biceps femoris that is&#xD;
      frequently injured and accounts for approximately 80 % of all hamstring injuries. Flexibility&#xD;
      is the most important component of physical fitness. Normal flexibility allows the person to&#xD;
      move smoothly and safely . For normal movement and locomotion flexibility of muscle is&#xD;
      important. It will help a person for normal body function. The flexibility of hamstring&#xD;
      muscle is always emphasized more. The Hamstring muscle is the most common muscle to always go&#xD;
      for tightness. The tightness of this muscle apparently increases from childhood up to the age&#xD;
      of 40-49 years. Tight hamstring muscles causes a major effect on body's normal postural&#xD;
      alignment. Till date studies have shown that tightness of hamstring always led to low back&#xD;
      pain with lumbar intervertebral disc pathologies. Biomechanically tightness of hamstring&#xD;
      muscle is thought to increase patellofemoral joint compressive forces because of increase in&#xD;
      passive tension at the time of the swing phase of ambulation under rapid and stressful&#xD;
      situations hamstring muscles fails to pass through full physiological amplitude when&#xD;
      specifically this muscle goes for tightness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;core&quot; has been described as a muscular box with the abdominals in the front, Para&#xD;
      spinals and gluteal in the back, the diaphragm as the roof, and the pelvic floor and hip&#xD;
      girdle musculature as the bottom. Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a complex condition which&#xD;
      is mainly associated with back (multifidus) abdominal (transversusabdominis) and hip (Gluteus&#xD;
      Maximus) muscles dysfunction along with reduced lumbar flexibility Mulligan Bent Leg Raise is&#xD;
      a newer technique which has been developed to manage hamstring tightness. This stretching&#xD;
      technique is painless and is recently utilized in the management of hamstring tightness with&#xD;
      limitation of straight leg raise. The Mulligan bent leg raise (BLR) technique has been&#xD;
      described as a means of improving range of straight leg raise (SLR) in subjects with LBP&#xD;
      and/or referred thigh pain (Mulligan, 1999). The intention of this technique is to restore&#xD;
      normal mobility and reduce LBP and physical impairment. Impairment is defined as&#xD;
      abnormalities of structure or function, as indicated by signs or symptoms .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mulligan's Two Leg Rotation Technique(TLR) is also a painless technique, and it can be&#xD;
      applied to any subjects having hamstrings tightness, low back pain or limited and/or painful&#xD;
      straight leg raise (SLR).It can be extremely useful in patients who have a gross bilateral&#xD;
      limitation of straight leg rising. TLR Technique is a new technique that has been developed&#xD;
      by Dr. Brain R Mulligan and colleagues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toby Hall ,Sonja Hardt ,Axel Schäfer, Lena Wallin conducted a study in 2006 to investigate&#xD;
      the immediate effects, on range of motion and pain, of Mulligan's bent leg raise (BLR)&#xD;
      technique in subjects with limited straight leg raise (SLR) and low back pain (LBP). the&#xD;
      study reveals that there was a significant increase in the range by 7° in the BLR group,&#xD;
      which may be clinically important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pratik A. Phansopkar and Vijay Kage in 2014 conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of Mulligan's TLR technique for hamstrings flexibility in acute non-specific low back pain.&#xD;
      The Results of the study were focused on Pain relief, decrease in the functional disability&#xD;
      due to low back pain. Their study demonstrates that, Mulligan's Two Leg Rotation technique is&#xD;
      effective in increasing the hamstrings flexibility in subjects with low back pain in terms of&#xD;
      pain, range of motion and functional disability In 2015 Tarun Kumara, Suraj Kumarb, Md.&#xD;
      Nezamuddinc and V.P. Sharmad conducted a study to evaluate the Efficacy of core muscle&#xD;
      strengthening exercise in chronic low back pain patients. This study concluded that core&#xD;
      muscle strengthening exercise is an effective rehabilitation technique for all chronic low&#xD;
      back pain patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study conducted in 2018 to investigate the Effectiveness of bent leg raise v/s two leg&#xD;
      rotation in patients with low back pain. The study was designed to compare the immediate&#xD;
      effects of two manual techniques in patients with low back pain. The study showed that both&#xD;
      BLR and TLR techniques were equally effective in reducing LBP. But clinically group A bent&#xD;
      leg raise technique showed more effective in reducing low back pain and improving ROM than&#xD;
      group B two leg rotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, Parag P Kulkarni., Ankita Devasthali., Ajay Kumar and Satish Pimpale conducted a&#xD;
      study to compare effectiveness of mulligan bent leg raise v/s knee to chest McKenzie for&#xD;
      hamstring tightness. Their study concluded that Bend Leg raise technique of Mulligan was&#xD;
      found to be more effective than Knee to the chest of McKenzie.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study conducted by Shrinivas Vinayakrao Shinde, Smita Bhimrao Kanase showed that the active&#xD;
      knee extension and straight leg raise was statistically extremely significantly improved in&#xD;
      participants treated with mulligan bent leg raise. This improvement is mainly attributed to&#xD;
      change in stretch tolerance of the hamstring muscle. It may also be assumed that bent leg&#xD;
      raise triggers neurophysiological responses influencing the muscle stretch tolerance.Thus,&#xD;
      there was improvement in active knee extension and straight leg raise range in participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rina, Shamima Nasrin in 2016 conducted a study to investigate the Effectiveness of bent leg&#xD;
      raise exercise along with conventional physiotherapy comparing with conventional&#xD;
      physiotherapy alone for the patients with chronic radiating low back pain. Their experimental&#xD;
      study showed that Bent Leg Raise Exercise with conventional physiotherapy was more effective&#xD;
      than conventional physiotherapy alone for patients with chronic radiating Low Back Pain C&#xD;
      Romani-Ruby investigated that the performance of core stability would result in increased&#xD;
      flexibility of the hamstring musculature and vice versa. Core stability exercise programs&#xD;
      target these muscles to help improve the overall function of the spine and body during&#xD;
      activities of daily living, where it provides &quot;proximal stability for distal mobility. More&#xD;
      recent research demonstrates a significant correlation between core stability and the range&#xD;
      of motion of the Lower extremities, specifically the hamstrings.&#xD;
