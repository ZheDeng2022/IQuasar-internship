      This open non-randomized controlled single center study investigates to what extent the&#xD;
      removal of circulating Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) from blood by NucleoCapture&#xD;
      device has a positive effect on the treatment of patients with sepsis and sepsis-associated&#xD;
      AKI (SA-AKI).&#xD;

      The term &quot;sepsis&quot; refers to a clinical syndrome in which a dysregulation of the host's&#xD;
      inflammatory reaction to infection leads to a life-threatening of organ dysfunctions. Sepsis&#xD;
      and septic shock are major causes of death in intensive care units worldwide. Sepsis remains&#xD;
      the most important cause of AKI in the intensive care unit (ICU) with 15%-20% of patients&#xD;
      with sepsis-associated AKI (SA-AKI) prescribed RRT . In addition to association with short&#xD;
      term mortality, AKI is also linked to the later development of CKD, ESRD, and long-term&#xD;
      increased risk of death&#xD;
&#xD;
      NETosis is a unique form of neutrophil cell death that is characterized by the release of&#xD;
      neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) composed of DNA web-like structures decorated with&#xD;
      highly cytotoxic protein components. Release of NETs leads to bystander tissue damage&#xD;
      (including the kidneys) and drives a fatal course of disease in sepsis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasmapheresis is a medical procedure, where pathogenic components are being removed from&#xD;
      the blood by adsorbers outside the body in an extracorporeal circulation. For removal of the&#xD;
      pathogenic substances the plasma is separated from the blood to pass the adsorber. The&#xD;
      purified plasma is merged with the solid blood components thereafter and returned to the&#xD;
      patient. The NucleoCapture device provide highly selective removal of neutrophil&#xD;
      extracellular traps from human blood during plasmapheresis procedure.&#xD;
