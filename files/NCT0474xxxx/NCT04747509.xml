      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Blackburn exercises on&#xD;
      Scapulothoracic stability in patients with Type-1 Scapular Dyskinesia, in comparison with&#xD;
      conventional physical therapy. A randomized control trial is being conducted at National&#xD;
      Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine (NIRM), Islamabad and Railway Hospital, Rawalpindi. The&#xD;
      sample size was calculated through open epi tool, is 38. The participants are divided into&#xD;
      two equal groups, 19 participants in experimental group and 19 participants in control group.&#xD;
      The study duration is six months. Sampling technique applied is non-probability convenient&#xD;
      sampling and groups have been randomized using sealed envelope method. Participants aged&#xD;
      25-55 years, having Type-1 Scapular Dyskinesia due to shoulder related causes, positive&#xD;
      scapular assistance test, bilateral distance&gt;1.5 cm in Lateral scapular slide test are being&#xD;
      included in the study. Tools that are being used in this study are Lateral Scapular Slide&#xD;
      Test, handheld dynamometer, Static measurements with scapula goniometry, and Shoulder pain&#xD;
      and disability index (SPADI). Data will be analyzed through Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPSS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The shoulder joint plays an important role in the function of the upper limb and in the&#xD;
      activities of daily living. Shoulder pathologies are very common with the lifetime risk being&#xD;
      between 40% and 60%. Prevalence rates of shoulder disorders are approximately 70% as compared&#xD;
      to other musculoskeletal conditions. Ideal motion of scapula plays a major role in the&#xD;
      shoulder functioning, any variation in the kinematics of scapula leads to various pathologies&#xD;
      in shoulder and alteration in the scapular positioning can affect pain in the shoulder. Loss&#xD;
      in the rhythmic functionality of the scapula due to muscular imbalance results in the&#xD;
      scapular dyskinesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scapular Dyskinesia is an observable alteration in the position of the scapula and the&#xD;
      pattern of scapular motion in relation to the thoracic cage during static or dynamic movement&#xD;
      of scapula. According to Borloz et al., a defective scapular posture caused by muscular&#xD;
      imbalances, also generates imbalances of muscular strength. Scapular dyskinesia is followed&#xD;
      by combination of symptoms such as malposition of scapula, prominent inferior border, pain in&#xD;
      coracoids process and scapular motion dyskinesia. Patients report scapular medial border pain&#xD;
      mainly. Kibler et al classified scapular dyskinesia in three dysfunctional patterns. Type I&#xD;
      is characterized by posterior displacement or winging of the inferior medial scapular border.&#xD;
      It is associated with inflexibility of pectoralis major and minor, and weakness of lower&#xD;
      trapezius and serratus anterior. Type II is characterized by the projection of the entire&#xD;
      medial border of the scapula. Type III is characterized by excessive superior translation,&#xD;
      with elevation and some anterior displacement of the superior border of the scapula on the&#xD;
      thorax. According to data reported in the literature, Scapular Dyskinesia (SD) incidence is&#xD;
      frequent in patients with shoulder diseases, including rotator cuff diseases, glenohumeral&#xD;
      instability, impingement syndrome, and labral tears. Type 1 pattern is however most commonly&#xD;
      found in patients with rotator cuff dysfunction , shoulder impingement and instability, with&#xD;
      the development of dyskinesis being associated with trapezius and serratus anterior, both of&#xD;
      which are weakened in Type 1 Scapular Dyskinesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally the muscles that stabilize the scapula are directly related to direct-trauma,&#xD;
      microtrauma, leading to muscle weakness and inhibition of movement by painful conditions&#xD;
      around the shoulder. The serratus anterior and trapezius are the most susceptible to the&#xD;
      effects of this inhibition, and are most often involved in the early stages of shoulder&#xD;
      pathology. Stability at the scapulothoracic joint depends on the surrounding musculature.&#xD;
      When the arm is raised overhead, the scapulothoracic motion involves upward rotation and&#xD;
      posterior tilt of the scapula. Of the numerous muscles inserted on the scapula, those playing&#xD;
      the most important role in the scapulothoracic kinematics are the upper and lower trapezius,&#xD;
      and the serratus anterior. The serratus anterior (SA) works in concert with the upper and&#xD;
      lower trapezius to upwardly rotate the scapula. Most overhead lifts and push-ups effectively&#xD;
      recruit the serratus anterior. Activity of the serratus anterior tends to increase linearly&#xD;
      with the amount of elevation at the glenohumeral joint. So when the scapulothoracic rhythm is&#xD;
      altered, there are associated changes in glenohumeral angulation and loss of normal arm&#xD;
      position, motion and stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In rehabilitation of scapular dyskinesia, therapeutic exercises should give attention to&#xD;
      restoring the alignment of the scapulothoracic area and control of scapular muscles. The&#xD;
      physiotherapy management is aimed to decrease the imbalances in the scapular stabilizing&#xD;
      muscles so that control of scapular motion can be acquired. Interventions for scapular&#xD;
      dyskinesia comprise of various stabilization exercises for scapula, but evidence scarcity is&#xD;
      there in relation to Blackburn exercises in scapular dyskinesia. Blackburn exercises are one&#xD;
      of the ways to treat shoulder pain and to regain proper mobility and decrease painful&#xD;
      movements. These scapular stabilization exercises, based on stretching and strengthening, aim&#xD;
      to improve muscle strength and joint position sense. The goal of increasing muscle strength&#xD;
      is obtained with the aid of facilitation, and focus on restoring the alignment of the&#xD;
      scapulothoracic area and control of scapular muscles. The Blackburn exercises are optimal for&#xD;
      the stimulation of lower trapezius, being the &quot;Y&quot; the optimal exercise for this purpose.&#xD;
      However, there is no clear evidence regarding their effect on serratus anterior. Although&#xD;
      serratus anterior muscle works in concert with lower trapezius, and it is the only&#xD;
      scapulothoracic muscle that produces upward rotation of the scapula with acromioclavicular&#xD;
      (AC) joint external rotation and posterior tilting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is dearth in literature regarding the effect of Blackburn exercises on scapulothoracic&#xD;
      stability in Dyskinesia, in relation to serratus anterior and lower trapezius muscles. There&#xD;
      is poor available evidence regarding the effects of Blackburn exercises specifically on&#xD;
      serratus anterior muscle strength, contributing to scapulothoracic stability. Also, the&#xD;
      studies conducted previously were lacking a control group for comparison, and majority of the&#xD;
      intervention protocols evaluated the immediate effects of Blackburn exercises with no focus&#xD;
      on scapular stabilizers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature Review:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A case report presented by Navreet Kaur et al. in 2019 evaluated the effects of Blackburn&#xD;
      exercises in scapular dyskinesia. By the end of one week of treatment, the patient felt no&#xD;
      pain in resisted movements and range of motion was complete. After one month of treatment,&#xD;
      observations included both shoulders on the same level, no droop observed from&#xD;
      antero-posterior view and no prominency of scapular border from postero-anterior view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2018, Rasika Panse et al evaluated the effects of Blackburn exercises in shoulder&#xD;
      impingement in rock climbers on pain and disability using Shoulder pain and disability index&#xD;
      (SPADI) scale. Subjects were given Blackburn exercises thrice a week with each session&#xD;
      lasting for 30 minutes. They reported positive results of Blackburn exercises in shoulder&#xD;
      impingement, with decreased pain in certain shoulder movements after treatment. However, long&#xD;
      term effects and the effects of Blackburn exercises on shoulder muscles were not considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study was conducted by Patel Neelam Jayesh et al. regarding the effectiveness of open&#xD;
      kinematic chain exercises in overhead atheletes with SICK scapula. Participants were given 4&#xD;
      sessions per week for 3 weeks and the intervention protocol included Blackburn exercises&#xD;
      along with Dynamic hug, W exercise, Lunges with dumbells and Pectoralis minor stretching.&#xD;
      Results of this study showed significant improvement after 3 weeks of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pradeep Shankar et al conducted a study to find the effect of scapular stabilization&#xD;
      exercises for Type 2 Scapular Dyskinesia in subjects with shoulder impingement. 3 sessions of&#xD;
      scapular stabilization exercises were given per week for 2 weeks and outcomes were measured&#xD;
      using Lateral Scapular Slide Test and Shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI). Study&#xD;
      findings reported the protocol to be effective. However this study lacked a control group&#xD;
      receiving only conventional exercises. Also, the study was done for a period of two weeks,&#xD;
      therefore long term effects were not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2018, Hugo Machado Sanchez reviewed the Scapular Dyskinesia from the point of view of&#xD;
      pathology, evaluation and treatment. He concluded that emphasis on strengthening of scapular&#xD;
      depressor muscles and scapular stabilizers acting primarily on the shoulder should be of&#xD;
      paramount importance for the restoration of normal scapular function in rehabilitation of&#xD;
      Scapular Dyskinesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kevin G. Laudner et al. assessed the relationship between lower trapezius and serratus&#xD;
      anterior strength and the quantity of scapular upward rotation by using a hand-held&#xD;
      dynamometer. The results of their study demonstrated a moderate-good relationship between&#xD;
      scapular upward rotation and lower trapezius strength. However, a poor relationship was seen&#xD;
      between scapular upward rotation and serratus anterior strength that was thought to be due to&#xD;
      strength measurement occurring at a higher amount of humeral elevation (120°-130°) than was&#xD;
      tested during scapular upward rotation (0° , 60° , 90° , 120°).&#xD;
