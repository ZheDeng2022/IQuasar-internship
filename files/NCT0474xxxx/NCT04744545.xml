  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the Meru Health Program plus&#xD;
      adjunctive curcumin (MHP-CUR) versus Meru Health Program only (MHP-ONLY) for adults with&#xD;
      depression. Meru Health is a 12-week integrative treatment program based on several&#xD;
      evidence-based practices and overseen by licensed clinical therapists that is delivered via a&#xD;
      Smartphone app. The primary objective of the study is to determine the feasibility, initial&#xD;
      efficacy (depressive symptoms), and potential harms of taking adjunctive curcumin&#xD;
      supplementation during the 12-week MHP among adults with depression. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      include comparing changes in inflammation biomarkers, anxiety, worker productivity, and&#xD;
      burnout that occur during the program between those in MHP-CUR and MHP-ONLY.&#xD;

      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the Meru Health Program plus&#xD;
      adjunctive curcumin (MHP-CUR) versus Meru Health Program only (MHP-ONLY) for adults with&#xD;
      depression. Meru Health is a 12-week integrative treatment program based on several&#xD;
      evidence-based practices and overseen by licensed clinical therapists that is delivered via a&#xD;
      Smartphone app. The primary objective of the study is to determine the feasibility, initial&#xD;
      efficacy (depressive symptoms), and potential harms of taking adjunctive curcumin&#xD;
      supplementation during the 12-week MHP among adults with depression. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      include comparing changes in inflammation biomarkers, anxiety, worker productivity, and&#xD;
      burnout that occur during the program between those in MHP-CUR and MHP-ONLY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study will use a randomized controlled trial of up to 60 adult patients with&#xD;
      depression. Patients will be recruited through Facebook ads, complete online and&#xD;
      telephone/Zoom screening and, if eligible, invited to participate in the 12-week Meru Health&#xD;
      program. One group will be randomized to being in the MHP plus receiving curcumin&#xD;
      supplementation (MHP-CUR) and the other will be randomized to being in the MHP only&#xD;
      (MHP-only). The MHP overseen by a licensed therapist who is available to the participant as&#xD;
      needed via text messaging and, when requested, telephone. The program is delivered via an app&#xD;
      downloaded to the user's Smartphone made available via email. The lab orders will be sent to&#xD;
      each patient's Ultalabs center of choice or, if preferred, done in the patient's home. All&#xD;
      study participants (in both groups) will be asked to get their blood drawn before starting&#xD;
      the program, 6 weeks into the program, and just after the 12-week program. Two vials of blood&#xD;
      will be taken at each visit, one to test for high sensitivity-CRP (hs-CRP) levels and the&#xD;
      other to test for interleukin (IL-6) levels. 2ml of serum is needed for each vial. Patients&#xD;
      in both groups will receive a wearable HRVB device via US mail; patients in the MHP-CUR group&#xD;
      will also receive curcumin supplements via US mail. All non-laboratory study assessments will&#xD;
      be made via the app and online via email.&#xD;
