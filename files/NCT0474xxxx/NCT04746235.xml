    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the possible benefits of venetoclax and ASTX727 in treating&#xD;
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to&#xD;
      treatment (refractory), or elderly patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia who&#xD;
      are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy. Venetoclax may help block the formation of&#xD;
      growths that may become cancer. ASTX727 is the combination of a fixed dose of 2 drugs,&#xD;
      cedazuridine and decitabine. Cedazuridine may slow down how fast decitabine is broken down by&#xD;
      the body, and decitabine may block abnormal cells or cancer cells from growing. Giving&#xD;
      venetoclax and ASTX727 may help to control the disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of decitabine and cedazuridine (ASTX727) in&#xD;
      combination with venetoclax in patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of ASTX727 in combination with venetoclax in&#xD;
      elderly (&gt; 60 year old) patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) not&#xD;
      eligible for intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the duration of response, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) of patients with refractory/relapsed AML treated with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine similar outcomes for newly diagnosed patients with AML who are not&#xD;
      candidates for intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the safety of venetoclax in combination with ASTX727 in patients with&#xD;
      refractory/ relapsed AML, and newly diagnosed patients with AML not candidates for intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the number of relapsed patients able to proceed to stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      upon achieving response with the combination venetoclax/ASTX727 regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of ASTX727 when combined with&#xD;
      venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive decitabine and cedazuridine orally (PO) daily on days 1-5 and venetoclax PO&#xD;
      daily on days 1-28 of the first cycle and on days 1-21 of subsequent cycles. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients with an objective response are followed every&#xD;
      3-6 months for up to 5 years.&#xD;

Response criteria will be modified from the International Working Group for AML. Will estimate the ORR for the combination treatments for each cohort, along with the 90% credible intervals. The association between ORR and patient's clinical characteristics will be examined by Wilcoxon's rank sum test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate.</description>
