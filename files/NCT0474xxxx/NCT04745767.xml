  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hoped that TAK-994 will eventually help people with a sleep condition called&#xD;
      narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a condition that causes extreme sleepiness during the day,&#xD;
      including falling asleep suddenly. Before then, the sponsor needs to understand how the body&#xD;
      processes TAK-994.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of the study are to learn how the body processes 4 different new forms of&#xD;
      TAK-994, when taken with food and without food, compared to a standard form of TAK-994.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take part. Then the participants will&#xD;
      be picked for 1 of 3 groups by chance. These groups of participants will take different new&#xD;
      forms of TAK-994 and the standard form. They will take these with and without food. This will&#xD;
      happen again 3 or 4 times but will take TAK-994 in a different order each time. After each&#xD;
      treatment with TAK-994, the study doctors will check the amount of TAK-994 in the blood of&#xD;
      the participants, over time. The study doctors will also check if the participants have any&#xD;
      side effects from TAK-994.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wait 5 or more days between each dose to allow time for TAK-994 to&#xD;
      completely leave their bodies. Participants will stay in the clinic during their treatment&#xD;
      with TAK-994. They will stay in the clinic for 15 days or longer. Participants who have 4&#xD;
      treatments with TAK-994 will stay in the clinic for 20 days or longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the clinic will telephone the participants 12 days after their final treatment of&#xD;
      TAK-994 to check if they have any health problems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-994. TAK-994 is being tested in healthy&#xD;
      participants. This study will look at the relative BA of different TAK-994 test formulations&#xD;
      relative to the currently used formulation (T1) and the effect of food on the test&#xD;
      formulations in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 54 participants. The study consists of three parallel&#xD;
      groups (Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3). In each group, one test TAK-994 formulation (T2&#xD;
      formulations in Group 1; T3 formulations in Group 2; and T4 and T5 formulations in Group 3)&#xD;
      will be evaluated under fed and fasting condition compared to reference T1 formulation under&#xD;
      fasting conditions in a cross-over design. Participants will be randomly assigned into 6&#xD;
      sequences within each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States. The overall time to participate&#xD;
      in this study is approximately 57 days. Participants will be followed up for up to 14 days&#xD;
      after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;
