  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of TU-100 on resolution of postoperative ileus (POI) in subjects undergoing open or&#xD;
      laparoscopic bowel resection (BR).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be screened up to 28 days before their planned surgery and will be randomized&#xD;
      1:1:1 (TU-100 15 g/day: TU-100 7.5 g/day: placebo) on postoperative Day 1 before the first&#xD;
      dose of study medication. After randomization, subjects will receive a total daily dose of&#xD;
      TU-100 15g, TU-100 7.5 g, or matching placebo (3 times per day (TID)) until hospital&#xD;
      discharge or ≤ 10 days (whichever is earlier). All subjects will be treated with study&#xD;
      medication as adjunct to an enhanced recovery (ERAS) pathway for gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
