  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HX008 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1 on T cell surface, restores T cell&#xD;
      activity, thus enhancing immune response and has potential to treat various types of tumors.&#xD;
      In this study, the efficacy and safety of HX008 in patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma who have failed the standard treatments will be evaluated.&#xD;
