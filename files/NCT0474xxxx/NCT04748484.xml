  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is common in limb amputees and causes reductions in activity and&#xD;
      participation as well as impaired quality of life. Some of these pains lead to the diagnosis&#xD;
      of a responsible lesion and to precise and effective treatments (amputation neuroma pains,&#xD;
      for example), whether they are etiological or symptomatic. Other pains of a neuropathic&#xD;
      character remain totally or partially resistant to symptomatic treatment. Their appearance,&#xD;
      intensity, duration and frequency vary depending on the amputee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Old scientific data confirmed by modern imagery indicates a process of reorganization of&#xD;
      cortical areas by multimodal afferents. This reconstruction, coherent or not of the body&#xD;
      diagram, is at the genesis of sensations, normal or not, in the amputee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early plurimodal reassignment constitutes the founding principle of the rehabilitation of&#xD;
      amputees: tactile afferents, visual afferents, motor afferents, proprioceptive afferents.&#xD;
      Rehabilitation techniques and early fitting contribute to this reafferentation and to the&#xD;
      functional integration of the fitting and to the quality of life of the amputee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific work by Katz et al, and experiences of amputees relieved by the application of&#xD;
      local heat or stay in hot climatic zones show that the thermoregulation of the residual limb&#xD;
      could be of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that these pain conditions are often related to a reduction in superficial&#xD;
      blood flow to the distal part of the stump. The physiological response of the body to&#xD;
      variations in outside temperature physiologically consists in the regulation of skin&#xD;
      temperature. The goal seems to keep the body in a so-called &quot;thermal neutrality&quot; zone,&#xD;
      substantially between 30 ° C and 33 ° C, by vasodilation or vasoconstriction of the&#xD;
      superficial blood vessels depending on exposure to cold or heat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An innovative medical device has been developed for a regulated thermal re-afferentation of&#xD;
      the residual limb, during and outside the wearing of the prosthesis. The Connected&#xD;
      Caloprosthesis Kit (CCK®) includes a connected sleeve put in place when wearing the&#xD;
      prosthesis (interface between the skin and the socket) and a connected sock to put in place&#xD;
      outside of wearing the prosthesis. These 2 devices include an autonomous heating and&#xD;
      regulation process, which maintains the amputation stump in the area known as &quot;skin thermal&#xD;
      normality&quot;. This device is non-invasive. It includes a silicone sleeve and a heating sock for&#xD;
      femoral or tibial amputee patients equipped with an expandable textile warmer, a flexible&#xD;
      micro-temperature sensor and a 4-conductor extensible cable connected to a thermoregulation&#xD;
      box worn as a belt which regulates the temperature of the stumps in the thermal neutrality&#xD;
      zone between 30 and 33°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the therapeutic effect of CCK®, given the heterogeneity of the population&#xD;
      and the small number of patients eligible for the study, the Single Case Experimental Design&#xD;
      (multiple baselines design) seems to us to be the methodology the most suitable: the&#xD;
      principle is to evaluate intensively and prospectively a small group of subjects, each case&#xD;
      being its own comparator. The methodology is defined a priori including systematic&#xD;
      observations and repeated measurements at a defined frequency before, during, or even after&#xD;
      the intervention introduced in a sequential and randomized manner. The data analysis can be&#xD;
      individual and therefore patient-specific, but also group with the calculation of the size of&#xD;
      the therapeutic effect and the calculation of significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This design therefore makes it possible to overcome the difficulties encountered during&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials: having to have a large number of subjects necessary to show a&#xD;
      significant difference in the medical device and to have a homogeneous population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This methodology is therefore not a description of a clinical case but an alternative&#xD;
      methodology to randomized controlled trials. In fact, it is considered by the Oxford Center&#xD;
      for Evidence-Based Medicine 2011 to be level I, like the randomized controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed clinical study therefore has a dual objective: practical as a new treatment&#xD;
      therapy by validating this medical device and theoretical, supporting the pathogenic model of&#xD;
      painful sensations in amputees&#xD;
