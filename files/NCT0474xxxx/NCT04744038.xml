  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will take between 4-6 months (with first patient first visit to last patient last&#xD;
      visit expected to span 3-4 months across all study sites). Each participant will use the&#xD;
      investigational PAP device with their own mask for a period of up to 7 nights and will&#xD;
      complete a series of questionnaires upon completion. The study will evaluate the usability&#xD;
      and efficacy of the investigational device in the intended use environment by the intended&#xD;
      use population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new PAP device has been developed by ResMed which includes an improved humidification&#xD;
      system, a new user interface and optimized workflows. This study will assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      usability of the new PAP device in an OSA population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, open-label, single arm study, multi-site study to assess the usability&#xD;
      and efficacy of investigational device in the home environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Recruitment will be done via phone calls/ SMS messages/ emails. Participants will&#xD;
      be explained the details of the study and those who wish to take part will be invited to a&#xD;
      ResMed clinic or selected site for the first study visit (As detailed in section 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 Participants will provide written informed consent (as per section 6.1). If eligible,&#xD;
      baseline participant demographics will be collected. Participants will be shown the&#xD;
      investigation device. If the participant is happy to proceed the investigational device will&#xD;
      be set-up to be exactly the same as their current CPAP device, and the participant will take&#xD;
      it home to use in place of their own device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 At the conclusion of the 7 nights of use, the participant will be asked to fill in a&#xD;
      questionnaire documenting their experience with the investigational device. The participant&#xD;
      will return all study equipment to the researcher. The questionnaires will be reviewed. This&#xD;
      concludes the participation in the study.&#xD;
