  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies found that some NMDA-enhancing agent was able to augment antioxidant&#xD;
      activity and its adjunctive therapy was better than placebo in reducing clinical symptoms and&#xD;
      cognitive deficits and revealed favorable safety in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Of&#xD;
      note, a substantial portion of schizophrenia patients refuse or cannot tolerate&#xD;
      antipsychotics due to poor response or severe side effects. Therefore, this study aims to&#xD;
      examine the efficacy and safety of an NMDA enhancer (NMDAE) as a monotherapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several lines of evidence suggest that schizophrenia is associated with accelerated aging and&#xD;
      oxidative stress may play a role. Cognitive deficits are core symptoms of accelerated aging&#xD;
      in patients with schizophrenia and the most difficult domain to treat. Current antipsychotics&#xD;
      have limited, if any, efficacy for cognitive function. Previous studies found that some&#xD;
      NMDA-enhancing agent was able to augment antioxidant activity and its adjunctive therapy was&#xD;
      better than placebo in reducing not only clinical symptoms but also cognitive deficits and&#xD;
      revealed favorable safety in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Of note, a substantial&#xD;
      portion of schizophrenia patients refuse or cannot tolerate antipsychotics due to poor&#xD;
      response or severe side effects. This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of NMDAE&#xD;
      monotherapy for the treatment of schizophrenia. The investigators enroll patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia who refuse or are unable to tolerate antipsychotics due to poor response or&#xD;
      adverse effects into a 6-week randomized, double-blind trial to receive monotherapy of NMDAE&#xD;
      or placebo. The investigators biweekly measure clinical performances and side effects.&#xD;
      Cognitive functions are assessed at baseline and at endpoint of treatment by a battery of&#xD;
      tests. The efficacies of NMDAE and placebo will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi-square (or Fisher's exact test) will be used to compare differences of categorical&#xD;
      variables and t-test (or Mann-Whitney test if the distribution is not normal) for continuous&#xD;
      variables between treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline in repeated-measure&#xD;
      assessments will be assessed using the generalized estimating equation (GEE). All p values&#xD;
      for clinical measures will be based on two-tailed tests with a significance level of 0.05.&#xD;
