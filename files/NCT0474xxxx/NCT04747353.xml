    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of MAP IN HEART is that catheter ablation for post-infarction ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia (VT) can be largely improved through a direct definition of primary ablation&#xD;
      targets from pre-operative CT scan imaging. The objective of is to demonstrate that catheter&#xD;
      ablation of post-infarction VT targeting left ventricular wall thickness channels as defined&#xD;
      from CT scan is feasible and associated with favorable efficacy, efficiency and safety&#xD;
      profiles. A single-arm prospective cohort study will be conducted, including 40 patients over&#xD;
      3 European centres. Baseline, procedural and 6-month follow-up data will be analyzed&#xD;

      Background: Although catheter ablation is a recommended therapeutic option in patients with&#xD;
      history of myocardial infarction presenting with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT),1 the&#xD;
      current approach relies on lengthy, poorly reproducible and poorly standardized&#xD;
      identification of targets derived from invasive catheter measurements. As a consequence, the&#xD;
      rate of VT recurrence remains high, leading to repeat interventions.2 Pre-operative CT scan&#xD;
      imaging was shown able to identify arrhythmogenic sites within scar through a detailed&#xD;
      analysis of left ventricular (LV) wall thickness.3,4 This study aims at demonstrating that&#xD;
      using these as primary targets for ablation is a feasible strategy associated with favorable&#xD;
      efficacy, efficiency and safety profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 40 patients with post-infarction VT referred for catheter ablation will be included&#xD;
      over 3 European centres. Pre-operative CT scan will be processed to obtain a 3D model of the&#xD;
      patient heart comprising detailed anatomy and LV wall thickness maps. Channels of relatively&#xD;
      preserved thickness penetrating within severely thinned scar (i.e. CT-channels) will be&#xD;
      identified using a proprietary algorithm developed at the IHU LIRYC, University of Bordeaux,&#xD;
      and used as primary targets for catheter ablation. During the intervention, the 3D model&#xD;
      along with pre-operatively defined targets will be registered in the 3D mapping space, and&#xD;
      each CT-channel will be transected by ablation. The inducibility of VT will then be tested&#xD;
      and any VT remaining inducible after CT-channels ablation will be targeted using conventional&#xD;
      catheter mapping techniques, with a composite procedural endpoint combining the ablation of&#xD;
      all CT channels and the non-inducibility of any VT. Procedural and 6-month follow-up data&#xD;
      will be analyzed to assess the feasibility of the approach and report its efficiency,&#xD;
      efficacy and safety profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: the CT-guided ablation strategy is expected to be feasible in a vast&#xD;
      majority of post-infarction patients referred for VT ablation, and to be extremely&#xD;
      time-efficient, the lengthy diagnostic part of the procedure (catheter mapping) being moved&#xD;
      pre-operatively (imaging). The short procedure duration should translate into a favorable&#xD;
      safety profile. The strategy should also be associated with a high efficacy in eliminating&#xD;
      the arrhythmia, thanks to a more comprehensive definition of targets and to the dedication of&#xD;
      the procedure time almost entirely to therapy. In conclusion, the present study should&#xD;
      provide solid proof of concept on which randomized controlled trials may be built.&#xD;
