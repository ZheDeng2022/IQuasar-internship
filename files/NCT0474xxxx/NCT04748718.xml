  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Athletic injury can result in decreased athletic performance or removal from sport&#xD;
      participation. There may also be psychological and financial impacts of athletic injury.&#xD;
      Additionally, there can be long-term consequences, such as increased risk of subsequent&#xD;
      injury or arthritis. Therefore, determining ways to prevent athletic injury from occurring is&#xD;
      critical. Movement quality during sport is related to injury risk. Athletes who move poorly&#xD;
      are generally at increased risk of injury compared to athletes who move well. Movement&#xD;
      quality can be improved through exercise-based injury prevention training, thereby decreasing&#xD;
      injury risk. This purposed of this study is to evaluate movement quality multiple times over&#xD;
      the course of an athletic season in collegiate athletes who perform injury prevention&#xD;
      training. The hypothesis is that movement quality will improve over the course of an athletic&#xD;
      season.&#xD;
