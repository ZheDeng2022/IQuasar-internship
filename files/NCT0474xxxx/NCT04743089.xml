  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatectomy (ERCP) is the most commonly used endoscopic&#xD;
      method for the treatment of biliary diseases including choledocholithiasis. When the ERCP&#xD;
      cannot be performed under fluoroscopy due to various reasons such as the location of disease&#xD;
      (i.e. intrahepatic bile duct lesion) and characteristics of the bile duct (i.e. altered&#xD;
      anatomy, stenosis etc.), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTCS) is performed as an&#xD;
      another treatment option. However, treatment of biliary lesions via PTCS requires at least 10&#xD;
      days of hospitalization for hepato-cutaneous fistula formation and tract epithelial&#xD;
      maturation for the advancement of cholangioscope, which causes a significant financial burden&#xD;
      as well as discomfort associated with fistula formation to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SpyGlass™ DS Direct Visualization System (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, Mass.) can be&#xD;
      applied directly into the bile duct via the working channel of the duodenoscope. It can&#xD;
      directly visualize the intra-ductal lesions with high-resolution digital imaging and it also&#xD;
      has a working channel that allows the use of forcep, electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) and&#xD;
      Holmium Laser. So, it has the advantage of being able to directly examine intraductal lesions&#xD;
      and perform treatment under the 'endoscopic view' which enables improved sensitivity of the&#xD;
      diagnosis and the success rate of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrahepatic duct (IHD) stone is difficult to treat by ERCP under fluoroscopy because IHD&#xD;
      lesion is far from the orifice of bile duct (ampulla of Vater) and usually accompanied with&#xD;
      IHD stenosis that causes technical difficulty. In addition, even if the stone is located in&#xD;
      an extrahepatic bile duct (EHD; common hepatic duct and common bile duct), it is difficult to&#xD;
      treat by ERCP in the case of a huge stone that has risk of incarceration. Therefore in these&#xD;
      cases, bile duct stones have been being treated by PTCS. If the SpyGlass™ DS Direct&#xD;
      Visualization System is used for the treatment of IHD/EHD stone that is not treatable with&#xD;
      ERCP, it have potential benefits of reducing the financial burden and patient's discomfort&#xD;
      caused by the PTCS significantly. Thus, we will investigate the usefulness of the SpyGlass™&#xD;
      DS Direct Visualization System for the treatment of IHD stones and huge EHD stones in terms&#xD;
      of cost and success rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will evaluate the treatment efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the&#xD;
      SpyGlass™ DS Direct Visualization System facilitated management for IHD/EHD stones. The&#xD;
      efficacy, cost-effectiveness and safety will be compared with historical cohort of&#xD;
      percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTCS)&#xD;
