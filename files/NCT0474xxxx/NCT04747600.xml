      Introduction: Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) comprise neoplasms with a wide range of&#xD;
      benign and malignant varieties. The most common include serous cystic neoplasms (SCNs),&#xD;
      mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and solid&#xD;
      pseudo-papillary neoplasms (SPPNs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) are&#xD;
      used to diagnose different PCNs types. The cyst fluid aspiration and analysis is performed in&#xD;
      difficult differential diagnosis. Frequently, amylase and CEA levels are measured. The choice&#xD;
      of surgery depends on cyst location and size and includes pancreatico-duodenectomy or distal&#xD;
      pancreatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes after pancreatic surgery when&#xD;
      adopted as the management of true exocrine epithelial cystic neoplasms.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients and methods: Between June 2014 and January 2018, 63 patients referred to our&#xD;
      tertiary referral center with diagnosis of true exocrine cystic neoplasms of the pancreas&#xD;
      accepted for surgery were included in the present prospective cohort study. Patients were&#xD;
      categorized according to preoperative diagnosis into: serous cystic neoplasms (Group A: 30&#xD;
      patients), mucinous cystic neoplasms (Group B: 13 patients), intra-papillary mucinous&#xD;
      neoplasms (Group C: 9 patients), whereas the last 5 patients diagnosed as solid&#xD;
      pseudo-papillary neoplasms (Group D). Demographic data, perioperative data and univariate&#xD;
      analysis for malignancy, recurrence and pancreatic fistula were collected and analyzed.&#xD;

        A total of 63 patients with a clinical diagnosis of true exocrine pancreatic cystic&#xD;
        neoplasms were enrolled in this prospective cohort study as a comprehensive sampling in our&#xD;
        hepato-biliary pancreatic unit of our university hospital between June 2014 to January&#xD;
        2018. They were categorized into 4 groups: Group A(30 patients)that were diagnosed as&#xD;
        serous cystic neoplasms, Group B(19 patients) that were diagnosed as mucinous cystic&#xD;
        neoplasms, Group C(9 patients )that were diagnosed as intra-ductal papillary mucinous&#xD;
        neoplasms and Group D(5 patients ) that were diagnosed as solid pseudo-papillary neoplasms.&#xD;
