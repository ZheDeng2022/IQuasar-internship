  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in need of a single implant in the premaxilla will be invited to participate in this&#xD;
      multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT). Prior to surgery, a small-field low-dose cone&#xD;
      beam computed tomography (CBCT) is taken to verify the integrity of the facial bone wall and&#xD;
      an adequate amount of apical and palatal bone dimensions. Sixty patients will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to the test group or control group in 6 centers. Each center receives 10 sealed&#xD;
      envelopes (5 are internally labelled with 'delayed implant placement' and 5 with 'immediate&#xD;
      implant placement').&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient a digital planning is performed in implant planning software and a&#xD;
      tooth-supported surgical guide is fabricated prior to tooth extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, alveolar ridge preservation is performed following tooth extraction.&#xD;
      After a healing period of 4 months, a single implant is installed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the test group, a single implant is installed immediately after tooth extraction and ridge&#xD;
      preservation is performed by filling the gap between the facial bone wall and the implant&#xD;
      surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A provisional crown is placed at the day of implant surgery, which is replaced by a permanent&#xD;
      one 3m later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months after tooth extraction and subsequent ridge preservation, the need for soft tissue&#xD;
      grafting is assessed on the base of predetermined criteria (primary outcome measure). Soft&#xD;
      tissue augmentation is performed by inserting a palatal connective tissue graft (CTG) into&#xD;
      the buccal mucosa at the implant site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures include 3D hard and soft tissue changes as well as clinical,&#xD;
      aesthetic, patient-reported and clinician-reported outcomes.&#xD;

      Patient selection Patients in need of a single implant in the premaxilla (15-25) will be&#xD;
      included in this multicenter RCT following screening and after having received written&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation A sample size calculation using the Pearson Chi-square test was&#xD;
      performed in SAS Power and Sample Size based on a comparison of the proportion on the need&#xD;
      for soft tissue augmentation at 5 months following alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) between&#xD;
      the control group (ARP + delayed implant placement 'DIP') and test group (ARP + immediate&#xD;
      implant placement 'IIP'). The calculation was based on finding a 30% difference between these&#xD;
      groups. With alpha set at 0.05 and a power of 0.80, the sample size calculation indicated 28&#xD;
      patients to be included per group. To compensate for drop-outs, 30 patients would be treated&#xD;
      with ARP+DIP and 30 would be treated with ARP+IIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians and centers, randomization, allocation concealment and blinding Six experienced&#xD;
      clinicians will treat at least 10 patients each. Five clinicians are staff members of the&#xD;
      Department of Periodontology and Oral Implantology at UGent - UZ Gent, who also work&#xD;
      part-time in different private practices. The final clinician is a professor at the Saint-Luc&#xD;
      University Hospital (UCL). The digital workflow, the implant placement protocol, the&#xD;
      application of a connective tissue graft (CTG) at 6 months following ARP and the restorative&#xD;
      protocol will be thoroughly discussed among the 6 clinicians in a training session before the&#xD;
      start of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the training session each clinician will receive 5 sealed envelopes internally coded&#xD;
      as 'Delayed implant placement' and another 5 as 'immediate implant placement'. Just prior to&#xD;
      surgery, a sealed envelope will be randomly selected and opened to reveal the treatment to be&#xD;
      conducted. The measuring investigator will not be involved in the treatment of any of the&#xD;
      patients and will be blinded to allow unbiased registrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative digital planning for fabrication of surgical guide A digital workflow will be&#xD;
      adopted for every patient for fabrication of a surgical guide prior to tooth extraction. This&#xD;
      requires 3D digital implant planning in designated software on the basis of a pre-op low-dose&#xD;
      small-field Cone-Beam CT and intra-oral scan. Note that surgical guides for patients in the&#xD;
      ARP+DIP group will also be fabricated following patient selection, even though they are only&#xD;
      to be used 4 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: ARP+DIP Patients start to take systemic antibiotics (Amoxicilline 1g) and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medication (Ibuprofen 600 mg) 1h pre-operatively. Following local&#xD;
      anesthesia (Septanest special, Septodont, Saint Maur des Fossés, France) and oral&#xD;
      disinfection (Corsodyl mouth rinse, GSK, Wavre, Belgium), the failing tooth is extracted&#xD;
      without raising a flap. Following socket debridement and rinsing, collagen-enriched DBBM&#xD;
      (Bio-Oss Collagen 250 mg, Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switserland) is applied up to the&#xD;
      level of the palatal bone crest and slightly condensed. The occlusal aspect is closed with a&#xD;
      collagen matrix (Mucograft Seal, Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switserland), which is fixed&#xD;
      with single sutures (Seralon 6/0, Serag Weissner, Naila, Germany) to the soft tissues.&#xD;
      Post-op instructions include the intake of systemic antibiotics during 4 days (Amoxicilline&#xD;
      1g, two times a day), anti-inflammatory medication as deemed necessary by the patient and&#xD;
      oral disinfection twice a day during 1 week. Then, sutures are removed. A removable partial&#xD;
      denture as used as provisional tooth replacement when considered needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 4 months, a mucoperiosteal flap is raised, the surgical guide is applied, and the implant&#xD;
      is installed according to manufacturer's prescriptions. Then, an implant impression is taken&#xD;
      for fabrication of a provisional crown. Prior to wound closure with vertical mattrass sutures&#xD;
      (Seralon 6/0, Serag Weissner, Naila, Germany), an appropriate healing abutment is installed.&#xD;
      This healing abutment is replaced by the provisional crown two days later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months, the need for soft tissue augmentation is assessed by the 5 clinicians who have&#xD;
      not been clinically involved. The treating clinician is excluded since he/she cannot be&#xD;
      blinded for the treatment group. The need for soft tissue augmentation is assessed on the&#xD;
      basis of screenshots from the pre-op CBCT with lip retractors enabling to evaluate buccal&#xD;
      bone and soft tissue thickness. Pre-op clinical pictures, clinical pictures at 6 months with&#xD;
      the provisional crown in situ and the STL file at 6 months are also offered to the panel in&#xD;
      order to assess the loss of buccal convexity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soft tissue augmentation is required necessary when at least one of the following criteria&#xD;
      are met: thin gingival biotype as defined as &lt; 1mm midfacial soft tissue thickness as&#xD;
      assessed on pre-op CBCT with lip retractors, thin buccal bone wall as defined as &lt; 0.5mm as&#xD;
      assessed on pre-op CBCT, loss of ideal buccal convexity at 6 months following ARP as assessed&#xD;
      on the basis of clinical pictures and STL. Each clinician makes a decision on the need for&#xD;
      soft tissue augmentation for 50 out of 60 cases independent from the other clinicians. Soft&#xD;
      tissue augmentation is offered to the patient when the majority of the panel is in favor of&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soft tissue augmentation is performed using a CTG harvested from the lateral palate using the&#xD;
      single incision technique. At the recipient site, a pouch is made in the buccal mucosa and an&#xD;
      appropriately sized CTG is pulled in. The CTG is secured into the buccal mucosa with multiple&#xD;
      single sutures (Seralon 6/0, Serag Weissner, Naila, Germany) and the provisional crown is&#xD;
      re-installed. Sutures are removed after 1 week. The provisional crown is replaced by a&#xD;
      permanent crown 3 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test group: ARP+IIP Patients start to take systemic antibiotics (Amoxicilline 1g) and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medication (Ibuprofen 600 mg) 1h pre-operatively. Following local&#xD;
      anesthesia (Septanest special, Septodont, Saint Maur des Fossés, France) and oral&#xD;
      disinfection (Corsodyl mouth rinse, GSK, Wavre, Belgium), the failing tooth is extracted&#xD;
      without raising a flap. Following socket debridement and rinsing, the surgical guide is&#xD;
      applied, and the implant is installed according to manufacturer's prescriptions. Then, an&#xD;
      implant impression is taken for fabrication of a provisional crown. Finally, the gap is&#xD;
      filled with collagen-enriched DBBM (Bio-Oss Collagen 250 mg, Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen,&#xD;
      Switserland), which is applied up to the level of the free mucosal margin, and an appropriate&#xD;
      healing abutment is installed. This healing abutment is replaced by the provisional crown two&#xD;
      days later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months, the need for soft tissue augmentation is assessed by the 5 clinicians who have&#xD;
      not been clinically involved. The treating clinician is excluded since he/she cannot be&#xD;
      blinded for the treatment group. The need for soft tissue augmentation is assessed on the&#xD;

      soft tissue augmentation for 50 out of 60 cases independent from the other clinicians. Soft&#xD;
      tissue augmentation is offered to the patient when the majority of the panel is in favor of&#xD;
