  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will assess the feasibility of alpha/beta T-cell and B-cell depleted allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) followed by blinatumomab therapy for high-risk B&#xD;
      cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as a means of reducing rates of subsequent relapse&#xD;
      and improving survival, while also minimizing treatment-related morbidity/ mortality and late&#xD;
      effects. The conditioning regimens will be dependent on the patient's minimal residual&#xD;
      disease (MRD) status prior to HCT using high throughput sequencing.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial evaluates the ability of a biologically active therapy in blinatumomab, an&#xD;
      anti-CD19/CD3 bispecific T-cell engager, to further reduce the risk of leukemia relapse&#xD;
      following HCT to improve post-HCT outcomes. The investigators will also utilize an alpha-beta&#xD;
      T-cell and B-cell depleted graft to reduce the risk of GVHD along with a reduced intensity&#xD;
      conditioning regimen without the use of TBI in patients who are minimal residual disease&#xD;
      (MRD) negative using high throughput sequencing (HTS) prior to HCT. For those patients who&#xD;
      remain HTS-MRD positive, a myeloablative conditioning regimen will be utilized, also followed&#xD;
      by blinatumomab. This multi-institutional pilot study will be limited to 25 (estimated 10-15&#xD;
      per stratum) evaluable children, adolescents and young adults with B-ALL, that have&#xD;
      experienced a relapse or have high-risk disease.&#xD;
