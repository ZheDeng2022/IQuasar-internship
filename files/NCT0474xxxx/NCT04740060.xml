      Investigate development of an Innovative Instrument on Robot-Aided and Virtual Reality&#xD;
      Rehabilitation for Intelligent Physical Training (i.e. gait and stepping) of Individuals&#xD;
      post-stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants will be asked to test the effectiveness of up to two games. Participants are&#xD;
      stroke survivors with post-stroke hemiparesis, which is affecting their ability to walk and&#xD;
      step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to go to the UAB Spain Rehabilitation Center where they will&#xD;
      tested up to two games in a maximum of two sessions. Each session will last approximately two&#xD;
      hours. Testing of the games will be done in a robotic device known as the KineAssistTM-MX&#xD;
      (KA-MX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The KA-MX is a robotic device that allows full freedom of motion for the body and pelvis&#xD;
      during walking and balance tasks, and also helps to control your posture to enhance your&#xD;
      balance and stability. The KA-MX also offers you safety while training and will catch you if&#xD;
      you lose your balance. This assistance is available while participants are strapped into the&#xD;
      device with a harness and the device allows them to walk over the treadmill with minimal&#xD;
      things affecting their walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the performance conditions, participants will be asked to fill out a&#xD;
      questionnaire that asks about demographics, apathy, balance confidence,and their experience&#xD;
      with VR and gaming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will help participants into the KineAssist MX, and once secured in the device,&#xD;
      they will be allowed to get acclimated to the device prior to approach the performance&#xD;
      conditions. Then, they will perform three walking or stepping conditions that measure their&#xD;
      maximum walking speed or maximum step length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will play one of our two developed VR-exergames. One of the games is called&#xD;
      &quot;Racing Game&quot; and its purpose is to test people's walking speed and ask them to race against&#xD;
      virtual competitors to incentivize them to walk faster over a 1 minute period. Another game,&#xD;
      called &quot;Stepping Game&quot; tests participant's ability to step farther.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside the games, participants will perform maximum walking or maximum stepping with simple&#xD;
      VR environment as well as without VR environment. The games have been developed to be tested&#xD;
      and will be modified based on feedback from participants. Participants will have the option&#xD;
      to participate in one or all two tests (i.e., walking and stepping).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While in the KA-MX, during each condition performance (i.e., walking or stepping),&#xD;
      participants heart rate will be monitored by a pulse oximeter placed on their finger or&#xD;
      through a chest strapped heart rate monitor. Participants will be periodically asked to state&#xD;
      how hard they feel they are working (Rating of Perceived Exertion). Additionally,&#xD;
      participants maximum walking speed or maximum step length taken in the device during&#xD;
      performance testing will be counted and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each condition, participants will be given a questionnaires to complete&#xD;
      regarding their motivation and flow state (i.e., the positive experiential state where&#xD;
      participants skill equal to the required challenge).&#xD;

    <measure>Walking Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Three Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>ast walking speed will be measured on the KineAssist and quantified based on the distance covered in one minute as a meter per second.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Step Length</measure>
    <time_frame>About Five Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum step length will be measured as traveled distance by the foot in centimeters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intrinsic Motivation</measure>
    <time_frame>About Three Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) will be used as measurement tool after performing each of the three conditions. The IMI consists of 22 questions rating from 1-7 in four subscales (interest/enjoyment, perceived competence, perceived choice, and pressure/tension). For this study, we will only use the Interest/Enjoyment subscale which contains seven questions and is considered as a self-report measure of intrinsic motivation</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apathy Evaluation Scale-Self rated version (AES-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>About Five Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Apathy Evaluation Scale-Self rated version (AES-S) was developed to quantify and characterize apathy. The AES-S consists of 18 questions on an ordinal scale (i.e., not at all, slightly, somewhat, a lot).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC)</measure>
    <time_frame>About Three Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC Scale is a 16-item self-report measure in which patients rate their balance confidence for performing various activities rating from 0-100 (i.e., a score of zero represents no confidence, a score of 100 represents complete confidence).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived competence,Perceived choice, and Pressure/tension</measure>
    <time_frame>About Five Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>We will use Intrinsic Motivation Inventory subscales (perceived competence, perceived choice, and pressure/tension) contain 5 questions rating from 1-7 where 1 means not at all true and 7 means very true.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>About Three Seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) is a psychophysical category scale with rating ranging from 6 as no exertion at all to 20 as maximal exertion, will be conducted every 30 seconds in order to evaluate participants level of perceived exertion. We will hold up the scale on a clipboard and asked participants, &quot;how hard are you working?&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Flow State Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>About Five Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Flow State Scale (FSS) will be conducted after each condition. The Flow state is a positive experiential state, occurs when the performer is connected to the performance in a situation where personal skill equals the requiredchallenge. The FSS consists of 36-items in nine subscales representing the dimensions of flow using a Likert scale with five levels (i.e., strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, strongly agree).</description>
