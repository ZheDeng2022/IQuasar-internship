      Because of these anabolic properties of ketone bodies and the fact that ketone bodies prevent&#xD;
      muscle protein breakdown for gluconeogenesis during energetic stress, ketone bodies can be a&#xD;
      promising strategy to prevent or treat skeletal muscle wasting. Therefore, our aim is to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of 3HHB intake on muscle wasting and its adverse consequences during a&#xD;
      period of caloric restriction in lean females. In addition, we compare the effects of 3HHB&#xD;
      intake with a high protein diet, which is currently considered as the best strategy to&#xD;
      minimize lean loss during hypo-energetic periods. To end, we aim to investigate the&#xD;
      synergistic effects of the intake of 3HHB in combination with a high protein diet.&#xD;

      Thermodynamics state that body mass declines during periods in which energy expenditure&#xD;
      exceeds energy intake. This negative energy balance can be obtained either by reducing energy&#xD;
      intake, called caloric restriction, by increasing energy expenditure, i.e higher level of&#xD;
      physical activity, or the combination of both. The sustained energy deficit results in a net&#xD;
      loss of body weight due to losses of both fat and skeletal muscle mass in a ratio of&#xD;
      approximately 3:11, depending on the severity of caloric restriction, diet composition and&#xD;
      initial body fat percentage. Decreases in muscle mass are due to a combination of&#xD;
      downregulated muscle protein synthesis in conjunction with an increased&#xD;
      ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated muscle proteolysis, resulting in a negative net protein&#xD;
      turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of sports, many athletes try to lose body weight to achieve different goals,&#xD;
      such as improving performance by optimizing power-to-weight ratio, competing in a certain&#xD;
      body weight category or for aesthetic reasons. However, the loss of body weight is often&#xD;
      accompanied by detrimental loss of skeletal muscle mass, which is associated with a myriad of&#xD;
      negative consequences including impaired physical performance and increased susceptibility to&#xD;
      injury. Hence, athletes undergoing periods of caloric restriction strive for body weight loss&#xD;
      via fat loss, while minimizing loss of lean mass. Recent studies have demonstrated that an&#xD;
      increased protein intake, higher than the recommended dietary allowance (0.8g/kg/day),&#xD;
      attenuates the loss of muscle mass during caloric restriction. Research has shown that the&#xD;
      high protein diet has minor effects on muscle proteolysis compared to normal dietary protein&#xD;
      but restores muscle protein synthesis, which is probably the primary mechanism by which lean&#xD;
      mass is preserved. Specifically, in young healthy athletes, it is shown that a higher protein&#xD;
      intake of 1.6-2.4 g per kg body weight per day reduces the loss of muscle mass during&#xD;
      short-term caloric restriction periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In female athletes, longer periods of low energy availability (with or without an eating&#xD;
      disorder) are often interrelated with menstrual dysfunctions and decreased bone mineral&#xD;
      density, a syndrome called the 'female athlete triad'. The triad is particularly common in&#xD;
      sports that emphasize aesthetics or leanness and can impose lifelong health consequences.&#xD;
      However, interventions that minimize loss of lean mass and prevent hormonal and bone&#xD;
      metabolism dysregulations in females during periods of caloric restriction, are still&#xD;
      missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketone bodies, i.e. D-β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), acetoacetate (AcAc) and acetone are naturally&#xD;
      occurring chemical compounds synthesized in the liver from circulating fatty acids under&#xD;
      conditions of low blood glucose and insulin levels. In normal physiological conditions, the&#xD;
      concentration of serum ketone levels remains low (&lt; 0.1 mM). However, during starvation or&#xD;
      applying a ketogenic diet, i.e low carbohydrate content, serum concentrations of βHB and AcAc&#xD;
      can increase up to 5-8 mM and 1-2 mM, respectively. In these conditions, ketone bodies serve&#xD;
      as an alternative and more efficient energy source for various tissues, including the brain,&#xD;
      heart and skeletal muscle, thereby 'sparing' the glucose storages. In normal conditions, the&#xD;
      brain can only use glucose as an energy fuel to maintain central nervous system functions.&#xD;
      Therefore, sparing glucose storages during periods of energetic stress is extremely important&#xD;
      for survival. Besides, this sparing of glucose storages prevents the breakdown of muscle&#xD;
      proteins which can be used as precursors for gluconeogenesis, providing glucose for the brain&#xD;
      and other tissues. Hence, the availability of ketone bodies reduces the breakdown of muscle&#xD;
      proteins for gluconeogenesis and, thus, preserves skeletal muscle mass even when energy&#xD;
      availability is limited. Therefore, elevating ketone body levels may be an important strategy&#xD;
      to prevent skeletal muscle wasting during periods of energetic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since recently, serum levels of ketone bodies can be increased by the intake of the ketone&#xD;
      body ester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (3HHB). This orally absorbable ketone&#xD;
      body ester is proven safe and well-tolerated in both animals and humans and can elevate&#xD;
      ketone body levels within 30 min to 5-6 mM, similar to levels after approximately one week of&#xD;
      fasting. The availability of this ketone body ester allows for controlled studies on the&#xD;
      effect of ketone bodies on muscle homeostasis without the negative side-effects of starvation&#xD;
      and a ketogenic diet, i.e high serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. The effects of 3HHB&#xD;
      on endurance performance is still debated. However, a recent study from our lab showed that&#xD;
      post-exercise ingestion of 3HHB increases markers of protein synthesis, which was further&#xD;
      confirmed by in vitro experiments. C2C12 myoblasts showed increased leucine-mediated muscle&#xD;
      protein synthesis by incubation of physiological concentrations of ketone bodies. Most&#xD;
      recently, we found that dietary supplementation with 3HHB substantially improved survival and&#xD;
      maintenance of functional capacity and muscular integrity in a mouse model of cancer&#xD;
      cachexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of these anabolic properties of ketone bodies and the fact that ketone bodies prevent&#xD;
      muscle protein breakdown for gluconeogenesis during energetic stress, ketone bodies can be a&#xD;
      promising strategy to prevent or treat skeletal muscle wasting. Therefore, our aim is to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of 3HHB intake on muscle wasting and its adverse consequences during a&#xD;
      period of caloric restriction in lean females. In addition, we compare the effects of 3HHB&#xD;
      intake with a high protein diet, which is currently considered as the best strategy to&#xD;
      minimize lean loss during hypo-energetic periods. To end, we aim to investigate the&#xD;
      synergistic effects of the intake of 3HHB in combination with a high protein diet.&#xD;
