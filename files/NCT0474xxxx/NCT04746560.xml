  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive bleeding is common during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for cardiac surgery. This&#xD;
      may result from the systemic activation of the coagulation pathway and the acquired platelet&#xD;
      dysfunction during the procedure. This study aims to compare the diagnostic performances of&#xD;
      the TEG®6S device and its Platelet mapping® cartridge to those of the &quot;gold standard&quot; tests&#xD;
      (light transmittance aggregometry and Multiplate®) for platelet function monitoring in&#xD;
      patients undergoing CPB for cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    Haemonetics, the company that manages the TEG device, has given a negative answer as to the&#xD;
    continuation of the study. For technical and internal reasons, they will take over the device.&#xD;
