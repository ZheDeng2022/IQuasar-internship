      This study aims to investigate the degree of Health Technologies Readiness amongst patients&#xD;
      with suspected breast cancer using the READHY-tool.&#xD;

      Health information, patient education, and self-management (health information and advice)&#xD;
      tools are increasingly being made available to adults with different health conditions,&#xD;
      either through internet-based health and mobile health digital information technologies (1).&#xD;
      At the department of plastic surgery, there has, for several years, been a transition to&#xD;
      digital solutions when delivering information to patients. Patient information now consists&#xD;
      of web-sites, apps and videos available for the patients to use when they seek information&#xD;
      about their disease and their treatment options. From a care-givers perspective, the&#xD;
      increased amount of information available is positive, but can these patients cope with so&#xD;
      much information being available digitally instead of information face-to-face or by paper?&#xD;
      Despite the rapid change from analogue informatics to digital solutions, we do not know a lot&#xD;
      about our patients' readiness for such a change. There is an increasing amount of studies on&#xD;
      the subject, but no recent study on readiness for digital solutions among this patient group,&#xD;
      patients with suspected breast cancer. That is what this study is hoping to achieve with this&#xD;
      study. The plan is to use a relatively new tool called &quot;READHY&quot; to assess the health&#xD;
      technology readiness amongst breast cancer patients. The tool consists of 70 questions, and&#xD;
      the results will enable grouping of these patients according to their health technology&#xD;
      readiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a cross-sectional study where participants fill out a single questionnaire at&#xD;
      first contact with the out-patient clinic. There will not be any follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is planned to start at 01.03.2021 and run for six months with termination at&#xD;
      30.09.21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical statistician was consulted regarding power and sample size. No power analysis was&#xD;
      performed due to the nature of the study. In accordance with previous studies with similar&#xD;
      methods, a convenience sample was chosen. 250 participants will be included over six&#xD;
      consecutive months (2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient-reported data will be handled through the secure server solution provided by OPEN&#xD;
      Region of Southern Denmark. Additional data will be kept in the secure server Sharepoint,&#xD;
      provided by Odense University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project complies with The General Data Protection Regulation act&#xD;
      (databeskyttelsesforordningen) and the Danish Data Protection act (databeskyttelsesloven).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is in line with the Helsinki-declaration. Participation is by individuals capable&#xD;
      of giving informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no personal gains for our participants, but in the longer perspective, the&#xD;
      information gathered will enable physicians to better understand the eHealth literacy in this&#xD;
      patient group. This will, in turn, help to improve the way the patients arre informed about&#xD;
      their disease, treatment and options.&#xD;

    <description>The READHY tool consists of 70 questions divided into three sections, one with a focus on eHealth literacy, one on self-management and one on the social context. The READHY consists of the eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (eHLQ) that includes seven scales, supplemented with four scales from the Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ) and two scales from the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ). The READHY tool has been validated. Each question presented to the participant as a statement and scored on a 4-point rating, from 1=strongly disagree to 4=strongly agree. The overall score of each scale was calculated as the mean score of the 4-6 items (i.e., statements) that constitute the scale (2).</description>
