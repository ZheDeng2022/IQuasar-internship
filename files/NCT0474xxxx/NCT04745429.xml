    <textblock>
      In the past few years, research has provided evidence for a possibility of dampening immune&#xD;
      system by one's will after undergoing a specific training program. Aim of this study was to&#xD;
      verity the efficacy in affecting both mind and body by assessing psoriasis activity and&#xD;
      psychological functioning. Among the members of both of the groups intensity of skin lesions&#xD;
      and pruritus were assessed, consultation regarding treatment took place and multiple&#xD;
      questionnaires regarding sleep quality, mindfulness and depressive symptoms were distributed.&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected to asses intensity of inflammation, including interleukins.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a skin disease of an unknown origin. Current understanding of its&#xD;
      pathophysiology focuses on an undefined imbalance between the immune system and the nervous&#xD;
      system. In this study the researchers assessed the effects of a training program which was&#xD;
      proven to affect both. A group of psoriatic patients volunteered, and were randomized to&#xD;
      either the intervention (n = 19), or control group (n = 19). Subjects in the intervention&#xD;
      group were trained for 10 weeks in breathing techniques, exposure to cold and meditation. The&#xD;
      control group was not trained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After two weeks of the intervention, a full lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemics was&#xD;
      introduced. Modified protocol included exercises possible to conduct at home only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two study visits (before and after the intervention) took place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total count of variables analysed equaled 60. Primary endpoints regarded intensity of&#xD;
      psoriasis. This group included laboratory markers (hsCRP, WBC, LEU, MONO, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,&#xD;
      IL-17, TNFalpha) measured in serum and saliva, visual skin assessment performed by a health&#xD;
      professional using Psoriasis Area Severity Index, consultations regarding treatment, and&#xD;
      results of the questionnaires (Dermatological Life Quality Index, pruritus). Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints pertained comorbidities of psoriasis. These were also assessed using&#xD;
      questionnaires, and included Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Patient Health Questionnaire - 9&#xD;
      (depressive symptoms), Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale - 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is a specific combination of breathing exercises, meditation and cold&#xD;
      exposure. It has been previously proven to have an effect among healthy young males who were&#xD;
      able to drop febrile temperatures induced with an intravenously distributed LPS. That&#xD;
      phenomena was achieved using previously trained breathing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 10 weeks members of the intervention group were trained via popular social media&#xD;
      platform. Exercises included exposure to cold using regular, cold showers, performing&#xD;
      breathing exercises finished with a short meditation session. Length and general difficulty&#xD;
      were gradually built up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, total number of the subjects equaled 54. 31 for the intervention group and 23 for&#xD;
      the control group. Due to drop-out or meeting the exclusion criteria, final count for both of&#xD;
      the groups was 19 participants.&#xD;
