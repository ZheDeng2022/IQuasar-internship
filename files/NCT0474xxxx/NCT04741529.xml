  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 2 weeks of the Healthy Minds Program&#xD;
      (HMP) app Connection module in undergraduate students of a large, midwestern state university&#xD;
      in the United States during the spring of 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited via email and/or flyers and will first complete an online&#xD;
      screen. Eligible participants will complete baseline measures prior to attending an&#xD;
      introductory session via web conferencing. During this session, participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to condition. Participants in both conditions will be asked to use the HMP app for&#xD;
      20 minutes per either, either split over two 10-minute session (Spaced condition) or in one&#xD;
      20-minute session (Massed condition). Participants will complete daily survey measures during&#xD;
      the study and post-test measures after 2 weeks of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is primarily designed to assess feasibility and acceptability of 2 weeks of&#xD;
      Connection training and assignment to dosage condition. Study team will investigate&#xD;
      self-reported informal practice on the daily diary measure, measures of psychological&#xD;
      distress (composite of depression, anxiety) and loneliness.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Healthy Minds Program app</intervention_name>
    <description>The HMP app was developed by Healthy Minds Innovations at the UW Center for Healthy Minds, and is based on the work of Drs. Richard Davidson and Cortland Dahl. HMP is designed to promote and protect psychological well-being through sustainable skills training. The program is grounded in constituents of psychological well-being identified in empirical literature. HMP provides core content, with instruction administered through a curriculum of high-quality guided practices. HMP is based on research on eudaimonic well-being (e.g., environmental mastery, purpose) and brain-based skills that underlie these qualities (e.g., regulation of attention, mental flexibility). HMP has &gt;100 guided audio practices that address 4 constituents of well-being: awareness, connection, insight, and purpose.&#xD;
Participants in this study will receive 2 weeks of training in the Connection module of HMP.</description>
