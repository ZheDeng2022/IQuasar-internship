  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bridging of the gap between speech production and perception by the interlocutor would be&#xD;
      made possible by the use of a more suitable and automatic task. An acoustic-phonetic decoding&#xD;
      test (or DAP in French, i.e. the production of isolated pseudo-words in repetition or&#xD;
      reading), created within the framework of the InCA C2SI project, avoids the effects of&#xD;
      cognitive restoration by the interlocutor. An automatic score from the DAP would lead to an&#xD;
      overall score per patient, but also to scores specific to each phonetic segment, to be&#xD;
      correlated with the analytical scores from each anatomical oropharyngeal segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the automatic processing of an acoustic-phonetic decoding task&#xD;
      during the assessment in current practice is a valid and reliable tool for diagnosing&#xD;
      oropharyngeal analytical and dynamic deficits by highlighting deficient linguistic units.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifth cancer in terms of incidence in France, tumor pathologies of the upper aero-digestive&#xD;
      tract, due to their location, impact the speech abilities of affected subjects. Speech&#xD;
      therapy in paramedical clinical assessments consist of two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The analytical part to highlight the anatomical and dynamic deficits of segments&#xD;
           involved in speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The functional part characterizes the pathophysiological impact by means of an &quot;ear&quot;&#xD;
           assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The link between anatomy and functional speech deficit is very close in oncology (the&#xD;
      location and the size of the tumor, the structural changes due to the treatment who modify&#xD;
      the oropharyngeal dynamics and the mechanisms involved in the production of the speech), but&#xD;
      the correlation is weak between functional intelligibility scores and analytical motor&#xD;
      scores. Indeed, the perception of speech by a human listener is not a simple &quot;recording&quot; of&#xD;
      the production, but a representation of this production after implementation of individual&#xD;
      mechanisms for restoring the acoustic information linked to the lexicon or to the context by&#xD;
      the listener. The listener's degree of familiarity with the speaker or his pathology is also&#xD;
      a source of variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bridging of the gap between speech production and perception by the interlocutor would be&#xD;
      made possible by the use of a more suitable and automatic task. An acoustic-phonetic decoding&#xD;
      test (or DAP in French, i.e. the production of isolated pseudo-words in repetition or&#xD;
      reading), created within the framework of the InCA C2SI project, avoids the effects of&#xD;
      cognitive restoration by the interlocutor. An automatic score from the DAP would lead to an&#xD;
      overall score per patient, but also to scores specific to each phonetic segment, to be&#xD;
      correlated with the analytical scores from each anatomical oropharyngeal segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the automatic processing of an acoustic-phonetic decoding task&#xD;
      during the assessment in current practice is a valid and reliable tool for diagnosing&#xD;
      oropharyngeal analytical and dynamic deficits by highlighting deficient linguistic units.&#xD;
