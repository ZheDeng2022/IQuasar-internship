      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Find out the efficacy of using complete decongestive physiotherapy on limb volume in advanced&#xD;
      secondary upper and lower extremity lymphedema patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Find out the efficacy of compression bandaging on limb volume in advanced lymphedema&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted to compare between the efficacy of complete decongestive therapy&#xD;
      (CDT) and compression bandaging in advanced secondary lower extremity lymphedema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted at the department of plastic surgery, Kasr Al-Ainy hospital. Sixty&#xD;
      patients of both genders aged from 40 to 55 years old were participated in this study, and&#xD;
      they were randomly assigned to two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: Thirty patients received CDT (60 min of manual lymph drainage MLD, compression&#xD;
      bandaging, exercises, and skin care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II: Thirty patients received compression bandaging alone. The same bandaging scheme&#xD;
      used for both groups. The therapy included 12 interventions performed 5 days a week, during&#xD;
      the first two weeks in addition to another successive two sessions at the third week, i.e.,&#xD;
      for a total of twelve sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of limb volume using water volumetry and 4-cm truncated cone circumferential&#xD;
      measurements were done before treatment application, after 6 sessions (post 1) and after 12&#xD;
      sessions (post 2).&#xD;

    <description>Complete decongestive therapy (CDT) is also known as complex decongestive therapy. It involves a two-stage treatment protocol. The first stage consists of skin care, manual lymph drainage, exercises and compression with multi-layered bandages. The second stage aims to optimize and conserve the volume reduction obtained in stage one. This is achieved by using a low-stretch elastic garment in combination with skin care and exercises</description>

    <description>External compression is the mainstay of management for all stages of lymphedema. The efficacy of compression therapy alone, or combined with MLD, has been supported by randomized clinical trials</description>
