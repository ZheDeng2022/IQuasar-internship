  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to investigate the acute effects of real execution (RE) and motor&#xD;
      imagery (MI) of Fitts law tasks on near and far transfer of learning.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies show changes in alpha (7.5 - 15 Hz) and beta (15 - 30 Hz) frequencies before and&#xD;
      during motor tasks. However, researchers still disagree on the origin, timing, and direction&#xD;
      of this. The neurophysiological mechanisms of motor learning are not yet fully understood.&#xD;
      The authors note that event-related beta desynchronization is most commonly associated with&#xD;
      motor learning. Reduced beta wave power can be observed in motor cortex, but it is still&#xD;
      unclear whether this change is related to motor learning, performance, or movement&#xD;
      repetition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparative study of motor imagery and actual performance showed the occurrence of similar&#xD;
      neurophysiological processes in the motor cortex. All the mentioned studies were conducted on&#xD;
      adults and the results were mainly from the analysis of upper limb movements. In the present&#xD;
      study, the investigators will comprehensively evaluate the upper and lower limb movements of&#xD;
      children: from the recognition of visual stimuli to the generation of the motor program and&#xD;
      the execution itself (behavioral data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-five children (year 2009) will be recruited from local primary schools. In a&#xD;
      single-blinded design, children will be randomized into three groups (1st - real execution,&#xD;
      2nd - motor imagery, 3rd - control) and compared at baseline, immediately post-intervention&#xD;
      and at follow-up 24 hours post-intervention. At pre-, post-, and follow-up assessments,&#xD;
      participants will perform two different patterns of the Fitts Law task with the predefined&#xD;
      difficulty: lower limbs/whole body and upper limbs/hands on an interactive whiteboard. The&#xD;
      intervention period lasts approximately 10 minutes, during which participants perform the&#xD;
      Fitts law task with different difficulty according to the intervention group to which they&#xD;
      belong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the upper limb/hand tasks, brain activity will be recorded with electroencephalography&#xD;
      (EEG).&#xD;
