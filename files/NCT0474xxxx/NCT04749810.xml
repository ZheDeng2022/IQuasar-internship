  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a multicenter observational non-comparative study of the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      long-term pathogenetic Elizaria® therapy in patients with atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After screening, patients meeting all of the inclusion / non-inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      vaccinated against meningococcal infections were treated by Elizaria®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned to include at least 50 patients receiving Elizaria® for the aHUS&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, including, if necessary,&#xD;
      immunization with meningococcal vaccine, a treatment period of 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication will be prescribed in accordance with routine medical practice. Accordingly to&#xD;
      minimize the risks and subjectivity of assessments the methods adopted in the routine&#xD;
      practice of treating patients with aHUS will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators enroll patients with aHUS diagnosis who have indications for pathogenetic&#xD;
      therapy and who are receiving Elizaria® under the government program. Patients will receive&#xD;
      medication in accordance with the established requirements of national standards and&#xD;
      protocols for the treatment of patients with aHUS. The registration of the amount of the drug&#xD;
      used will be carried out on the basis of information in the Patient Diaries, as well as&#xD;
      primary documentation.&#xD;
