      This study will investigate the effect of peripheral acting opioid antagonist (PAMORA) on the&#xD;
      disease course of patients with acute inflammation of the pancreas (acute pancreatitis). The&#xD;
      study will be conducted by treating hospitalized patients with acute pancreatitis with a&#xD;
      PAMORA (methylnaltrexone).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the effects of peripheral acting µ-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORA) on&#xD;
      disease development and progression in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) will be&#xD;
      investigated. Patients with AP will be administered Methylnaltrexone (Relistor®)&#xD;
      intravenously. This medication is defined as the investigational product. Relistor® is&#xD;
      approved and sold on the Danish marked for treatment of opioid-induced constipation. This&#xD;
      PAMORA have not previously been investigated in patients with pancreatitis. The dose regimes&#xD;
      for this study will be according to label. It has previously been shown, in patients with&#xD;
      opioid-induced obstipation and healthy subjects, that opioid antagonism incl. PAMORA&#xD;
      treatment increases gut motility, relaxes gastrointestinal sphincters, increases the&#xD;
      intestinal water content and improves the immune response, without affecting analgesia. The&#xD;
      affinity of PAMORAs to the µ-opioid receptors is much stronger than opioid analgesics.&#xD;
      Therefore, they as antagonists have the potential to counteract the harmful effects of&#xD;
      opioids on the gut mucosa, bacterial translocation and inflammation despite the high levels&#xD;
      of exogenous opioids present in patients with pancreatitis. PAMORAs do not cross the&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier and consequently do not interfere with analgesia or other central effects&#xD;
      of opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that treatment with the PAMORA methylnaltrexone will antagonize the harmful&#xD;
      effects of opioids without reducing analgesia in patients with AP and hence reduce disease&#xD;
      severity and improve clinical outcomes. If successful, this sub-study will for the first time&#xD;
      document the effects of a targeted pharmacotherapy in AP with the potential benefit of&#xD;
      improved patient outcomes.&#xD;
