      This is a single center, open-labeled , single arm, prospective study which includes a safety&#xD;
      run-in phase. The primary endpoint is the overall response rate which includes complete&#xD;
      response (CR) and partial response (PR) at Week 12 and Week 24. The secondary endpoints&#xD;
      include progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events. There are&#xD;
      two phases of the study. The first phase is the 'safety run-in phase'which plans to enroll 6&#xD;
      patients who would be observed for safety issues for 12 weeks after study drug&#xD;
      administration. If no Grade ≥ 4 (CTCAE) adverse events (AE) occurs during this phase, the&#xD;
      study would enter the second phase; if Grade ≥ 4 (CTCAE) AE happens during this phase, the&#xD;
      study would be terminated. In the second phase of the study, another 24 patients would be&#xD;
      enrolled. All enrolled patients would receive the study drug until progression of disease,&#xD;
      intolerability of the drugs or Week 96 and would be followed every 4 weeks in the first 12&#xD;
      weeks, every 12 weeks until Week 48 and every 24 weeks until Week 96. The follow-up phase to&#xD;
      assess PFS and OS will last from initiation of study drug to 36 months after enrollment&#xD;
      (evaluation would be carried out every 24 weeks after Week 96). The total study duration will&#xD;
      be 4 years after the last patient starts study medication.&#xD;
