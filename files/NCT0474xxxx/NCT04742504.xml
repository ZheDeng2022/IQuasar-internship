  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators want to evaluation of the impact of benralizumab (Fasenra®,&#xD;
      Astra Zeneca) on different cell populations, including basophils and innate lymphoid cells,&#xD;
      and several biomarkers, such as miRNAs, cadena α dek receptor pra la interleukin % (IL5Rα)&#xD;
      and soluble IL5Rα in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. For this, basophil and innate&#xD;
      cells type 2 (ILC2) populations will be monitored in different point-time of treatment: 8&#xD;
      week (V1), 6 months (V2) and 1 year (V3) in blood and sputum samples. Also, follow-up IL5Rα&#xD;
      expression on a cell surface of eosinophils, basophils and ILC2 from peripheral blood and&#xD;
      sputum of patients treated with or or without benralizumab. Determination of IL5Rα levels&#xD;
      will be performed by flow cytometry&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigators will monitor basophil miRNAs changes with benralizumab analyzing miRNAS&#xD;
           profile of isolated basophil before and after benralizumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Also, in vitro characterization of benralizumab effects on functionality of human&#xD;
           basophils (isolated from allergic asthmatic patients) and human cell line KU812,&#xD;
           measuring apoptosis, activation, degranulation and histamine release will be performed.&#xD;
