  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim was to investigate whether remifentanil use in both infusion and bolus techniques&#xD;
      could provide sufficient sedation and analgesia without serious adverse effects for central&#xD;
      venous access device procedures under monitored anesthesia care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The insertion and removal of implantable venous access devices (port-a-cath type) requires&#xD;
      moderate level of sedation and monitored anesthesia care to prevent pain and anxiety of&#xD;
      patients during the procedure. According to the American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical&#xD;
      Status Score, monitored anesthesia care is a planned procedure where a patient undergoes&#xD;
      local anesthetic infiltration together with sedation and analgesia. Remifentanil is a potent&#xD;
      synthetic opioid with novel pharmacokinetic properties, including very rapid onset and an&#xD;
      ultra short duration of action, making it effective for pain relief in short procedures.&#xD;
      Remifentanil can be administered as either one of the techniques of intravenous continuous&#xD;
      infusion (CI) or intravenous bolus patient-controlled sedation analgesia (PCSA).In previous&#xD;
      studies, the insertion or removal of venous access procedures required either local&#xD;
      anesthesia or low doses of orally administered anxiolytic medication. The infusion of&#xD;
      remifentanil may cause respiratory depression and analgesic efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      administration of remifentanil infusion and/or bolus doses of remifentanil during the&#xD;
      administration of one of the techniques of either CI or PCSA in short term procedures has not&#xD;
      been well studied. The prospective trials that compare analgesic efficacy and adverse events&#xD;
      related to intravenous remifentanil consumption in sedation and analgesia of short procedures&#xD;
      are very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare level of pain and sedation, total amount of remifentanil&#xD;
      consumption, bolus doses of remifentanil, patient and surgeon satisfaction, hemodynamic data&#xD;
      and adverse events of two different techniques of intravenous remifentanil use such as;&#xD;
      intravenous continuous infusion (CI) or intravenous bolus patient-controlled sedation&#xD;
      analgesia (PCSA) in patients under moderate level of sedation for vascular access procedures.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, single-blinded randomized clinical study. The patients were divided into two groups with the method of one to one allocation and with the use of sealed envelope randomization.The first group was continuous infusion group (Group CI) and intravenous continuous remifentanil was infused after starting at a dosage of 0.1 µg/kg/min and the dose was raised incrementally up to 1µg/kg/min if required. The second group was intravenous bolus patient-controlled sedation analgesia (PCSA) and remifentanil infusion at a dose of 0.05 µg/kg, bolus of 0.1 μg/kg with lock-out time of three minutes was used. In both groups, a bolus dose of 0.1 µg/kg remifentanil was administered. The data evaluated include; level of pain and sedation, total amount of remifentanil consumption, bolus doses of remifentanil, use of a rescue medication, patient and surgeon satisfaction, hemodynamic data and adverse events.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>In our study, random allocation sequence was performed using a computer programme for each patient to prevent bias. For concealed allocation, patients were randomly allocated into one group using a numbered, opaque and sealed envelope. A randomized block design is as follows: code A was given to the first group, and code B was given to the second group. The participant, data collector and data analyzer were blinded. This study was a single-blinded controlled study because the sedation and analgesia were administered by anesthesiology residents who were unaware of the technique and the study protocol however, the protocol was known by the experienced anesthesiologist who was attending the case and collecting the data during the procedure. The preparation of remifentanil solutions and installation of the infusion devices were done by an anesthesiologist who was blinded for the study groups.</masking_description>

There is a comparison of pain scale scores as a decrease of pain relief in an amount of 30% from the pain at start between the two groups.</description>
