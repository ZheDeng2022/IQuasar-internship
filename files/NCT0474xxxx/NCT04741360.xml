  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The currently proposed study addresses a critical need in the clinical care of school-aged&#xD;
      children with TBI through the modification of an existing, proven efficacious treatment&#xD;
      protocol for learning and memory deficits in persons with moderate to severe TBI, the&#xD;
      modified Story Memory Technique (mSMT), as well as the conduct of a pilot double blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, RCT of this new pediatric adaptation of the mSMT. Over a decade of&#xD;
      research and development conducted at our center has demonstrated the mSMT to be effective&#xD;
      for improving new learning and memory in adults with TBI, across three realms of functioning:&#xD;
      objective behavior, brain functioning and everyday life. This convincing data provides Class&#xD;
      I evidence supporting the efficacy of the mSMT for improving new learning and memory in&#xD;
      adults with TBI. Clinical applications around the world have equally attested to its utility&#xD;
      in the clinical care of adults with TBI. This highlights the tremendous potential of the mSMT&#xD;
      to vastly improve the everyday lives and educational successes of children and adoles-cents&#xD;
      living with TBI and the resultant learning and memory deficits. The currently proposed pilot&#xD;
      work will begin to document that efficacy. The results of this study therefore have the&#xD;
      potential to change clinical practice, inform policy, and improve the lives of children and&#xD;
      adolescents living with TBI.&#xD;
