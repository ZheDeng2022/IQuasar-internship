      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are on antiretroviral therapy (ART).&#xD;
      Their cells have shown to age faster than expected. This puts them at higher risk for a range&#xD;
      of age-related diseases about 10 years sooner than people who do not have HIV. Low bone&#xD;
      mineral density (BMD) is common in people with HIV. This means their risk of fractures is&#xD;
      increased. People with HIV also have a higher risk for cancers caused by Kaposi's sarcoma&#xD;
      herpesvirus (KSHV) than people who do not have HIV. Much of the data on bone loss related to&#xD;
      cancer and cancer treatments has been gathered from people who do not have HIV. Researchers&#xD;
      want to learn more about the rate of bone loss in people with HIV/AIDS and KSHV associated&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn the factors that are linked to BMD loss in people with HIV and KSHV associated&#xD;
      cancers from imaging performed as part of NIH studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with HIV and Kaposi s sarcoma who got ART and cancer chemotherapy at NIH from 1/1/2005&#xD;
      to 12/1/2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' records will be chosen from studies that were conducted from 1/1/2005 to&#xD;
      12/1/2020. This study will include participants who had at least 2 CT scans. Some&#xD;
      participants may have opted out of the future use of their data. If so, their records will&#xD;
      not be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use data collected at NIH. Data taken from CT scans will be used to measure&#xD;
      BMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study results may be published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last about 2 years.&#xD;

      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Bone Mineral Density in People Living with HIV and KSHV Associated&#xD;
      Malignancies: A Retrospective Longitudinal Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective review that includes all participants with human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus (HIV) (PWH) affected by Kaposi sarcoma (KS), KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman&#xD;
      disease, and KSHV associated inflammatory cytokine syndrome enrolled on the tissue&#xD;
      procurement study (01-C-0038) and other treatment protocols within the HIV/AIDS Malignancy&#xD;
      Branch at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) from 1/1/2005 to 12/1/2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the factors that are associated with bone mineral density (BMD) loss in PWH and&#xD;
      KSHV associated malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients seen at the NIH from 1/1/2005 to 12/1/2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities conducting research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single site study initiated by the HIV/AIDS Malignancy Branch at the National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data abstraction to completion of data analyses will take about 2 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Subjects will not be recruited for this study; however, participants' records will be&#xD;
        selected from treatment protocols from 1/1/2005 to 12/1/2020 unless the subject opted out&#xD;
        of the future use of his/her data. These subjects enrolled to natural history and/or&#xD;
        treatment protocols within the HIV/AIDS Malignancy Branch on the basis of a diagnosis of&#xD;
        HIV and KSHV-associated conditions, such as KS alone, in combination with KSHV-MCD or KICS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As this is a retrospective longitudinal study, the investigators will review the data from&#xD;
        subjects who have at least two completed CT scans to measure bone mineral density.&#xD;
