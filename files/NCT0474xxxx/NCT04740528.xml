    <textblock>
      The concept personalized gene-based nutrition combines genetic information with specific&#xD;
      dietary intake that is crucial in managing obesity. Obesity experienced by adult women is&#xD;
      generally caused by inapproriate diet and sedentary lifestyle. Variations in the fat mass and&#xD;
      obesity-related gene (FTO) has been linked with susceptibility to obesity, but diet seems to&#xD;
      change the relationship. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the fat mass and&#xD;
      obesity-associated gene (FTO) is a potent predictor of human obesity. Higher protein diets&#xD;
      were more appropriate than standard protein diets, and frequently recommended as a weight&#xD;
      loss plan as it prevents the loss of lean tissue mass. Nevertheless, high intakes of proteins&#xD;
      may adversely affect metabolic functions. Multi studies have explored associated FTO&#xD;
      polymorphisms with obesity in different populations. However, the contribution of the FTO&#xD;
      common variants to obesity is controversial in Asian people, some studies showed rs1558902&#xD;
      was statistically associated with BMI, but other results reported FTO gene is not&#xD;
      statistically associated with obesity. Given the diversity of Asian populations, the&#xD;
      investigators generated a hypothesis whether relations between preference protein intake and&#xD;
      FTO rs1558902 gene polymorphism exist in selected Indonesian obesity women&#xD;

      The sample size was calculated based on the difference in the proportion of variation of the&#xD;
      gene FTO rs1558902 allele A between obese participants, which previous study estimated to be&#xD;
      approximately 6% for populations from Malaysia. Using a power of 80% and a level of&#xD;
      significance of 5%, the investigators required 100 obese participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMI and body fat which were assessed by SECA body analyzer (SECA 201). Blood samples were&#xD;
      collected after a 12-h minimum fast by Prodia Laboratory for DNA isolation and biochemical&#xD;
      analysis&#xD;
