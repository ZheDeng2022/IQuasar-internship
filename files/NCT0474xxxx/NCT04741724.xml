  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle atrophy and diaphragm dysfunction are common with prolonged mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      (PMV). Electrical stimulation has been shown to be beneficial in severe chronic heart failure&#xD;
      and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, its effect on PMV is unclear. This study&#xD;
      examined the effects of transcutaneous electrical diaphragmatic stimulation (TEDS) on&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength and weaning outcomes in patients with PMV.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects on ventilation for ≥21 days were randomly assigned to TEDS or control groups. The&#xD;
      TEDS group received muscle electrical stimulation for 30 min/session/day throughout the&#xD;
      intervention. Weaning parameters and respiratory muscle strength (Pimax, Pemax) were&#xD;
      assessed. The hospitalization outcome, including weaning rate and length of stay, was&#xD;
      followed up until discharge.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects received daily TEDS (30min/day, 5days/week ) until the end of the weaning trial.&#xD;
During TEDS, rectangular electrodes were placed on the parasternal region beside the xiphoid process; the sixth and seventh intercostal spaces in line with the mid-axillary line. TEDS was performed by applying biphasic waves at a stimulation frequency of 30 Hz, pulse width of 400 μs. TEDS intensity was gradually increased until visible muscle contraction was observed. Each session lasts for 30 min day.</description>
