      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions stay inflamed for very long periods of time. This type&#xD;
      of inflammation is not affected by any MS medications. These lesions can lead to slow&#xD;
      worsening of MS symptoms. Researchers want to see if a new drug can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if tolebrutinib can help clear inflammation in MS brain lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with MS who are on an anti-CD20 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under protocol #89-N-0045.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history. They will have physical and neurological exams.&#xD;
      They will have blood and urine tests. The progression of their MS will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have MRIs of the brain. The MRI scanner is shaped like a cylinder. It uses&#xD;
      a magnetic field and radio waves to take pictures of the body. During the MRIs, participants&#xD;
      will lie on a table that slides in and out of the scanner. Soft padding or a coil will be&#xD;
      placed around their head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have electrocardiograms to measure the heart s electrical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have lumbar punctures ( spinal taps ). A small needle will be inserted into&#xD;
      the spinal canal in the lower back. Fluid will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will take tolebrutinib pills by mouth once a day for at least 96 weeks.&#xD;
      They will stop their anti-CD20 therapy. They will have at least 10 study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will not take tolebrutinib. They will stay on their anti-CD20 therapy. They&#xD;
      will have 5 study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last at least 96 weeks.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this protocol is to test whether 48 weeks of treatment with tolebrutinib,&#xD;
      an investigational, orally available, brain-penetrant, Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK)&#xD;
      inhibitor, affects an imaging marker (the paramagnetic rim ) associated with chronically&#xD;
      inflamed white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS). In this rater-blinded but otherwise&#xD;
      open-label study, ten adults with MS who are on stable disease-modifying treatment with&#xD;
      intravenous anti-CD20 antibody therapy and are within 3 months of their most recent dose,&#xD;
      have at least one paramagnetic rim lesion on 7-tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and&#xD;
      have developed no new white matter lesions or clinical relapses for at least 6 months, will&#xD;
      initiate treatment with tolebrutinib 60 mg/day and agree to forego further anti-CD20 or other&#xD;
      disease-modifying therapy for the duration of the trial. Radiological, clinical, and&#xD;
      biological outcomes are measured at 24, 48 (primary), 72, and 96 weeks, with additional&#xD;
      interspersed visits for safety monitoring. Participants may subsequently continue on&#xD;
      treatment until tolebrutinib is marketed or commercial development halted. A comparison group&#xD;
      of 10 participants who meet inclusion criteria but choose to stay on anti-CD20 therapy will&#xD;
      also be enrolled. The primary outcome measure is disappearance of one or more paramagnetic&#xD;
      rims from white matter lesions identified at baseline. Secondary outcomes include safety and&#xD;
      tolerability and additional radiological outcomes. Exploratory clinical, radiological, and&#xD;
      laboratory measures will be obtained to investigate the mechanism of action of tolebrutinib&#xD;
      and for biomarker development, and to compare the tolebrutinib and anti-CD20 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To evaluate the effects of 48 weeks of tolebrutinib treatment on the&#xD;
      paramagnetic rim of chronically inflamed white matter lesions, as seen on 7-tesla MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: (1) To assess safety and tolerability of 96 weeks of treatment with&#xD;
      tolebrutinib following intravenous anti-CD20 antibody therapy. (2) To assess the possible&#xD;
      repair of chronically inflamed white matter lesions in which inflammation at the lesion edge&#xD;
      has been modulated by tolebrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Per-patient proportion of lesions in which the paramagnetic rim has&#xD;
      disappeared at the end of 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: (1) Adverse event tables. (2) Changes in T1 relaxation time within&#xD;
      paramagnetic rim lesions at the end of 96 weeks, relative to non-rim lesions. (3) Changes in&#xD;
      size of paramagnetic rim lesions at the end of 96 weeks, relative to non-rim lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 10 adults with multiple sclerosis, targeting at least 7 participants who complete 96&#xD;
      weeks of tolebrutinib therapy. Up to 10 adults with multiple sclerosis who meet inclusion&#xD;
      criteria but choose to stay on anti-CD20 therapy.&#xD;
