  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to determine the effect of adding Body-blade exercises to&#xD;
      traditional treatment on posture, scapular muscles strength, neck pain, and function in&#xD;
      individuals with forward head posture&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have proposed that the Body-blade may be a more effective tool for activating&#xD;
      the muscles employed during the training and rehabilitation of the shoulder and trunk than&#xD;
      traditional interventions such as cuff weights and Therabands. There is few literature which&#xD;
      studied the effect of Body-blade exercises on neck problems. So there is insufficient&#xD;
      evidence for their effectiveness on improving forward head posture.&#xD;

    <measure>cranio vertebral angle using the Autocad</measure>

    <measure>pain using visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is a self-reported scale consisting of a horizontal or vertical line, usually 10 centimeters long (100 mm) anchored at the extremes by two verbal descriptors referring to the pain status</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck function using the Neck Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The participants will be informed with the questionnaire10-items: pain intensity, personal care, lifting, work, headaches, concentration, sleeping, driving, reading, and recreation. and will be asked to fill the response to each item which is rated on a 6-point scale from 0 (no disability) to 5 (complete disability).The higher the final score the more severe the functional disability. Scores were divided into 0- 4 points for no disability, 5-14 points for mild disability, 15-24 points for moderate disability, 25-34 points for severe disability, and 35 or higher for complete disability</description>
