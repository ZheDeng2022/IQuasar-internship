  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective case-control study. In the study, the data of 304 patients who&#xD;
      were evaluated in our clinic between January 2017 and January 2020 with a pre-diagnosis or&#xD;
      diagnosis of postmenopausal osteoporosis were retrospectively reviewed. Lumbar 1-4 and&#xD;
      femoral neck bone mineral densitometry values T scores, ages, sedimentation, C-reactive&#xD;
      protein, neutrophil, leukocyte and platelet levels, and mean platelet volume values of the&#xD;
      patients were recorded. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was calculated by dividing the&#xD;
      neutrophil count by the lymphocyte count, and the platelet-lymphocyte ratio was calculated by&#xD;
      dividing the platelet count by the lymphocyte count. The systemic immune inflammation index&#xD;
      (SII) was calculated using the formula, SII = platelet count x neutrophil count / lymphocyte&#xD;
      count. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic value of the systemic immune&#xD;
      inflammation index in postmenopausal osteoporosis and to examine the SII, N / L, PLT / L,&#xD;
      MPV, sedimentation (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), femur and lumbar BMD values and their&#xD;
      relationships with each other.&#xD;
