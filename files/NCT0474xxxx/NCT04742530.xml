  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the appetite, energy intake, and exercise performance responses to a&#xD;
      bout of exercise completed in the evening after an extended period of fasting with a similar&#xD;
      bout of exercise completed in the evening and the morning, after consuming a&#xD;
      carbohydrate-containing meal.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular exercise is known to be a successful strategy for improving several facets of health&#xD;
      and maintaining body weight. However, many people are not engaging in enough exercise, and&#xD;
      some may not be achieving maximum benefits from the exercise that they already do. Performing&#xD;
      exercise in the overnight fasted state has been shown to reduce energy intake over the course&#xD;
      of a single day, without any compensatory reductions in free-living energy expenditure.&#xD;
      Despite these promising findings, it is likely that not every member of the population is&#xD;
      logistically able to perform exercise in the morning due to various work, family and social&#xD;
      commitments, and exercise in the evening may be a logical alternative for these individuals.&#xD;
      Whether the beneficial effects of overnight fasted exercise can be observed at an alternative&#xD;
      time of the day (i.e. the evening) is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators are interested in examining the compensatory appetite and energy&#xD;
      intake responses following a bout of evening exercise performed after an extended (7 hour)&#xD;
      period of fasting. Exercise performance will also be assessed as a marker of voluntary energy&#xD;
      expenditure, which if reduced, has the potential to compensate for the reduced energy balance&#xD;
      induced by fasted exercise.&#xD;

    <time_frame>15 minutes following the end of the exercise session.</time_frame>
    <description>A laboratory-based meal consisting of pasta, tomato sauce and olive oil will be provided to participants in excess of expected consumption. Participants will be permitted 20 minutes to eat as much or as little as they desire, until 'comfortably full and satisfied'.</description>

    <measure>Exercise Performance (Voluntary Energy Expenditure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within the 15-minute performance test component of the exercise session.</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum energy expenditure (Kilojoules) that can be completed within 15 minutes on a stationary bicycle ergometer. The participant will be able to alter their power output by selecting up or down on the ergometer control unit as they please.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 hours, 3 hours, 3.5 hours, 5 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours, 14 hours, and 24 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Time-course of subjective ratings of hunger between breakfast provision and one hour after consuming lunch, measured using an appetite visual analogue scale. The scale is divided into subscales of different appetite perceptions including: hunger, fullness, desire to eat and prospective food consumption. Each subscale is rated on a 100mm scale (i.e. from 0 - 100), with a rating of 100 fully supporting the perception and a rating of 0 fully opposing the perception.</description>

    <measure>Substrate Utilisation During Steady State Exercise.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within the 30-minute steady-state component of the exercise session.</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements of VO2 and VCO2 during a 30 minute steady state bout of cycling which precedes the 15-minute performance test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE).</measure>
    <time_frame>Within the 45-minute exercise session.</time_frame>
    <description>RPE will be measured at 5-minute intervals throughout the 45-minute exercise period (30 min steady state; 15 min performance test) on a 6-20 RPE scale. The participant will point to the value that corresponds to their current perceived exertion (6 being no exertion at all; 20 being maximal exertion).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Enjoyment of the Exercise Bout</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following the end of the exercise session.</time_frame>
    <description>A shortened version of The Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) will be completed to gauge enjoyment of the exercise sessions. A scale from 1-7 will be used for eight feelings. The participant will circle the value that corresponds to which (6 being no exertion at all; 20 being maximal exertion).&#xD;
The scale is divided into bipolar subscales of different feelings including: enjoyment, liking, pleasure, fun, pleasantness, interest, engagement and task absorption . Each subscale is rated on a 1-7 bipolar scale (i.e. from 1 - 7), with a rating of 1 fully supporting the feeling on the left-hand side of the subscale, and a rating of 7 fully supporting the feeling on the right-hand side of the subscale. For three subscales, a positive feeling is placed at 7, and for four subscales, a negative feeling is placed at 7 (reverse scored).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pre-exercise Subjective Feelings</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before the exercise session.</time_frame>
    <description>A single questionnaire to assess pre-exercise subjective feelings will be measured using a visual analogue scale. The scale is divided into subscales of different feelings including: motivation, readiness, tiredness, nausea, and energetic. Each subscale is rated on a 100mm scale (i.e. from 0 - 100), with a rating of 100 fully supporting the perception and a rating of 0 fully opposing the perception.</description>
