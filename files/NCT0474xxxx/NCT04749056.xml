  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Psychological burden in cancer patients may worsen quality of life and even&#xD;
      medical outcomes such as mortality. Nevertheless, many distressed patients are not recognized&#xD;
      by the treating clinicians and left untreated even though effective psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions exist. Existing screenings programs have multiple limitations such as the&#xD;
      necessity of time consuming training and involvement of clincial staff, conventional&#xD;
      screening instruments with limited diagnostic accuracy and the focusing on objective measures&#xD;
      of distress, thereby neglecting subjective supportive care needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To address some of the limitations outlined above, we developed an electronic&#xD;
      psycho-oncological adaptive screening program (EPAS) which separately assesses distress and&#xD;
      psychosocial care needs and provides immediate patient feedback with individualized&#xD;
      recommendations about psychosocial care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Patients of the intervention are compared to a control condition. All participants&#xD;
      are assessed at three measurement points (baseline, and at 3-months and 6-months follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Outcomes assess aspects related to psychosocial care services, well-being and&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Patients are recruited within suitable health care facilities within the&#xD;
      University Cancer Center Hamburg (UCCH) and other facilities in the competence network of the&#xD;
      UCCH. Patients are checked for eligibility via review of the medical chart and consecutively&#xD;
      recruited by research assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study: From start of recruitment, 2 years are planned until data analysis. 1&#xD;
      year is planned for recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: We conduct group comparisons in the study outcomes, both unconditional and&#xD;
      condcitional (controlled for care relevant co-variates).&#xD;

      Background: Psychological burden in cancer patients may worsen quality of life and even&#xD;
      medical outcomes such as mortality. Nevertheless, many distressed patients are not recognized&#xD;
      by the treating clinicians and left untreated even though effective psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions exist. Existing screenings in turn have multiple limitations: To be effective&#xD;
      in reducing distress, screening results need to be adequately interpreted and transformed&#xD;
      into individualized support plans. Most of current screening programs expect the clinical&#xD;
      staff to undertake this task, which in turn requires extensive and repeated training. Another&#xD;
      critical issue is the assessment: To limit the completion time to a minimum, conventional&#xD;
      screening instruments contain as few items as possible, which in turn limits their diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy. Finally, most screening programs assume that there is a clear link between reported&#xD;
      levels of distress and the individual need for psychosocial care. Accordingly, many current&#xD;
      screenings derive the need for psychosocial care exclusively from the level of distress&#xD;
      reported by the patients. However, self-reported distress and self-reported supportive care&#xD;
      need are not closely related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study: To address some of the limitations outlined above, we developed an&#xD;
      electronic psycho-oncological adaptive screening program (EPAS) which separately assesses&#xD;
      distress and psychosocial care needs and provides immediate patient feedback with&#xD;
      individualized recommendations about psychosocial care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Patients of the intervention are compared to a control condition. All participants&#xD;
      are assessed at three measurement points (baseline, and at 3-months and 6-months follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Outcomes assess aspects related to psychosocial care services, well-being and&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Our study aims to separately test for group differences (screening vs. no&#xD;
      screening) at t1 and t2. To detect an expected small to medium group difference in level of&#xD;
      information (effect size = 0.3) with a power of 80 %, sample sizes of 176 patients in each&#xD;
      group were needed. Given an expected drop-out rate of 30 % from t0 to t2, we initially&#xD;
      planned to recruit n = 251 per group (ntotal = 502).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Patients are recruited within suitable health care facilities within the&#xD;
      University Cancer Center Hamburg (UCCH) and facilities in the competence network of the UCCH.&#xD;
      Patients are checked for eligibility via review of the medical chart and consecutively&#xD;
      recruited by research assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: We applied a cross-over design: That is, all clusters received each intervention so&#xD;
      that a largely equal number of patients received each intervention in each cluster. Between&#xD;
      the changes of the conditions, recruitment was suspended for a certain amount of time to&#xD;
      avoid any overlap of patients in the two conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study: From start of recruitment, 2 years are planned until data analysis. 1&#xD;
      year is planned for recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: We conduct group comparisons in the study outcomes separately for t1 and t2.&#xD;
      Robustness of the analyses is checked by calculating both unconditional and conditional&#xD;
      (controlled for care relevant co-variates) models. In detail, we apply linear and logistic&#xD;
      regression analyses for continous and binary outcomes, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed description of the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General principle and procedure: The patients in the intervention arm undergo EPAS&#xD;
      (electronic psycho-oncological adaptive screening), a tablet-based screening application&#xD;
      consisting of three adaptive tests and one supportive care checklist. EPAS provides immediate&#xD;
      feedback via a printed results page, which presents and interprets the level of distress and&#xD;
      contains individualized recommendations for psychosocial services. The results pages are&#xD;
      printed by research assistants immediately after the screening on a mobile printer and given&#xD;
      to the participants together with a brochure containing information about all psychosocial&#xD;
      services available at the UCCH. The treating physicians also receive a slightly modified&#xD;
      results page, but are not expected to discuss these with the patient unless they are highly&#xD;
      distressed (see algorithm section). Before and during the screening, patients are explained&#xD;
      how to use the program by the research assistance and supported if needed. The whole&#xD;
      screening process including the conventional tests that are also assessed by the control&#xD;
      group takes about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures within EPAS: Three adaptive tests with varying response options are applied to&#xD;
      assess depression (D-CAT, 64 items), anxiety (A-CAT, 50 items) and distress/stress reaction&#xD;
      (S-CAT, 38/31 items). From the item pools, only items with highest information value are&#xD;
      selected according to both item characteristics and individual response pattern. The&#xD;
      presentation of items ends if (i) the standard error was â‰¤ 0.32 or (ii) a maximum of 10 items&#xD;
      is reached. Furthermore, patients fill in an internally developed checklist to report&#xD;
      supportive care needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structure and content of the results page: The results page contains (i) the extent of&#xD;
      distress and additional information to interpret these levels, (ii) a summary of the reported&#xD;
      supportive care needs and (iii) individualized recommendations for the use of psychosocial&#xD;
      services at the UCCH based on the care needs. As additional information to interpret the&#xD;
      levels of distress, categories derived from a psychosomatic population are provided for D-CAT&#xD;
      and A-CAT (low/medium/high). No such categories exist for the S-CAT, and thus the mean among&#xD;
      a population with burnout-syndrome is provided as a reference value. The patient and&#xD;
      physician versions slightly differ: Whereas patients are explicitly referred to the&#xD;
      information brochure they receive during the screening, the distress-categories in the&#xD;
      physician version are illustrated with colors (low = green; medium = yellow; high = red) and&#xD;
      contain specific information in case of highly distressed patients (see algorithm section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Algorithm for the results page: The supportive care needs reported in the respective list are&#xD;
      transformed into concrete recommendations to use the adequate psychosocial service at the&#xD;
      UCCH (e.g., a reported need for support to return to work results in a recommendation to use&#xD;
      the social service). Highly distressed patients, i.e., those falling in the category &quot;high&quot;&#xD;
      in the A-CAT or D-CAT, are recommended to use psycho-oncological service irrespective of&#xD;
      whether they have previously reported such a need in the check list. Physicians of highly&#xD;
      distressed patients are recommended on their results page to talk with the patient about&#xD;
      his/her psychosocial condition and further issues within such an appointment are suggested&#xD;
      (e.g., check for medical reasons for distress, encourage patients to use psycho-oncological&#xD;
      service).&#xD;
