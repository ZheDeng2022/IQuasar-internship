  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is common, but no psychological interventions have been tested to see if they work&#xD;
      for adults with severe intellectual disabilities. The research team recently successfully&#xD;
      completed a full-scale trial of a psychological intervention, BeatIt, for depressed adults&#xD;
      with mild/moderate intellectual disabilities. The aim of this study is to comprehensively&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of modifying BeatIt for depressed adults with severe intellectual&#xD;
      disabilities, collecting the information needed on likely recruitment, measures, and waiting&#xD;
      list control arm options, to design a full-scale study.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline on the Mood, Interest and Pleasure Questionnaire (MIPQ) at 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of the individuals mood and engagement in activities. The score range for each sub-scale is 0 - 24.&#xD;
Total score range is 0 - 48. Lower scores indicate lower mood and lower levels of interest and pleasure (within the last 2 week)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on Intellectual Disabilities Depression Scale (IDDS) at 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 38-item behavioural checklist derived from DSM-III-R criteria, designed to measure the frequency of identified depressive behaviours within a four-week period. Each item is scored on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 6 (always). All scores are summed to provide a total score, ranging from 0 to 228. Higher scores indicate a higher frequency of depressive symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on the Anxiety, Depression and Mood Scale at 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>This scale has been shown to be a reliable and valid measure of anxiety in adults with severe/profound intellectual disabilities. The 7 item 'generalised anxiety' sub-scale was used.&#xD;
Items are rated on a four-point Likert scale for frequency from 0 (never) to 3 (always) and for severity 0 (not a problem) to 3 (severe problem). Items are based on informants' observations in the last 2 weeks. Scores are summed. The possible score range for frequency of anxiety symptoms is 0-21, total score range for severity of anxiety symptoms is 0 - 21 and total score is 0 - 42. Higher scores indicate a higher frequency of anxiety symptoms and higher severity of anxiety symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on the Modified Index of Community Involvement (ICI) at 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>This scale provides a measure of participation in social and community-based activities during the previous 4 weeks. This is a 16-item scale, measuring participation in social activities (5 items), community activities (10 items) and going on holiday (1 item).&#xD;
The informant is asked to rate whether the participant has participated in any of these events in the last month (12 months for the item 'been on holiday'), and if so, how many times (once through to five times or more). All items are rated on a 6-point Likert scale (0 = not participated, 5 = participated 5x or more). All scores are summed. The possible score range for the social activities sub-scale is 0-25, the possible score range for the community activities subscale is 0-50 and the total scale score range is 0-80. Higher scores indicate a higher frequency of engagement in social and community activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on the Modified Index of Domestic Participation at 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures participation in 13 household tasks during the previous 4 weeks. All items are rated on a three-point Likert scale (0 - no participation, 1 - participation with help, 2 - independent participation). Scores are summed, with a possible score range of 0 - 26. Higher scores indicate higher levels of independent participation in domestic tasks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on the Emotional Difficulties self-efficacy scale at 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 10-item scale which measures the carer's confidence in supporting the person when they are feeling down. All item are scored on a 9-point Likert scale, where 0 indicates 'not at all confident' and 8 indicates 'extremely confident'. All scores are summed with a possible score range of 0 - 80. Higher scores indicate a higher level of self-confidence in supporting someone when they are feeling down.</description>
