      Radiation is a standard treatment option for patients with liver cancer. Unfortunately, the&#xD;
      tumour grows after radiation in many patients and radiation can harm normal tissues. A new&#xD;
      treatment using a specialized radiation procedure called Stereotactic body radiotherapy&#xD;
      (SBRT) may increase the chance to control liver cancer and reduce the chance of harm to&#xD;
      normal tissues. SBRT allows radiation treatments to be focused more precisely, and be&#xD;
      delivered more accurately than with older treatments. SBRT has become a routine treatment.&#xD;
      Further research has found that specialized computer programs can possibly guide the&#xD;
      selection of an appropriate SBRT dose. This is called radiobiological guidance. However, this&#xD;
      has not yet been proven to improve outcomes and/or reduce toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to find out if SBRT at standard dose versus SBRT&#xD;
      guided by radiobiological techniques is better for you and your liver cancer.&#xD;

      Primary and secondary (aka liver metastases) hepatobiliary cancer cause substantial morbidity&#xD;
      in an increasing number of patients primarily due to the fact that only a minority of&#xD;
      patients are suitable for curative treatment; a majority of patients have limited options and&#xD;
      have dismal survival rates. First, primary cancers of the hepatobiliary tract are one of the&#xD;
      most common malignancies internationally. Though they occur less frequently in the&#xD;
      industrialized world; however, the incidence of primary hepotobiliary cancer is one of the&#xD;
      fastest rising cancers in North America. Treatments for unresectable hepatobiliary cancer,&#xD;
      including chemotherapy and hepatic arterial embolization are associated with low response&#xD;
      rates and very poor survival. Second, metastatic disease to the liver is common and, like&#xD;
      primary hepatobiliary cancer, causes significant morbidity and mortality. Metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer to the liver is a common pattern of spread, sometimes as the only site of&#xD;
      metastatic disease. Autopsy studies have shown that 40% of colon cancer patients fail with&#xD;
      disease confined to the liver. Approximately 50% of metastatic deaths from breast and&#xD;
      prostate cancers are associated with liver metastases: 43,000 women and 34,000 men per year.&#xD;
      This has led to the hypothesis that not all metastases are diffuse and that &quot;oligometastasis&quot;&#xD;
      can occur where aggressive local therapy to the oligometastasis may lead to long-term control&#xD;
      of disease. This hypothesis is gaining support over the currently held belief that metastases&#xD;
      are always systemic. Evidence for the oligometastasis theory is found in surgical series of&#xD;
      treated oligometastases of the colon, sarcoma, melanoma and breast. If metastases were truly&#xD;
      confined to the liver, and if effective therapy for the localized intrahepatic disease&#xD;
      existed, aggressive local therapy may lead to cure in some patients. Given that patients with&#xD;
      liver lesions (both primary and secondary) currently have few options, the potential gains in&#xD;
      national cancer survival are substantial if an effective high-dose focal liver radiation&#xD;
      treatment regimen could be delivered safely and effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent technological advances have made it possible to deliver high doses of radiation&#xD;
      therapy precisely to small tumours while preserving function in critical structures&#xD;
      surrounding the lesion. With these techniques, control rates in excess of 80% have been&#xD;
      achieved in patients with metastasis from lung, breast, renal, and other cancers. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that similar control rates may be feasible using stereotactic radiotherapy for&#xD;
      liver cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External beam radiotherapy has long been considered to have a very limited role in the&#xD;
      treatment of liver tumours. This has historically been because minimum dose required for&#xD;
      local ablation exceeded the dose that would result in liver toxicity which can be morbid and&#xD;
      cause death. The technical development of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) renewed&#xD;
      interest in radiation for HCC. For SBRT, advanced techniques are used to very accurately&#xD;
      deliver a high total dose to the target in a small number of daily fractions while avoiding&#xD;
      dose delivery to surrounding healthy structures. This research in HCC was done mainly by two&#xD;
      groups, in Michigan and Stockholm, who demonstrated that the delivery of high doses of&#xD;
      radiation to limited volumes of the liver had promising results in terms of local control and&#xD;
      survival with acceptable toxicity. SBRT is offered as an ablative radical local treatment as&#xD;
      opposed to low palliative doses. In total as of 2015, eleven primary series reported on&#xD;
      tumour response and survival of around 300 patients who have been treated with stereotactic&#xD;
      body radiation therapy as primary therapy for HCC. The reported percentage of objective&#xD;
      responses defined as complete and partial was ≥64% in 7 of 8 series. Median survival between&#xD;
      11.7 and 32 months has been observed. Toxicity, based on multiple case series trials,&#xD;
      indicate that the treatment is considered safe. The most common CTC grade 3-4 toxicity was&#xD;
      elevation of liver enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is no accepted dose or dose regimen. The reason for a lack of liver SBRT's&#xD;
      acceptance into practice is this lack of a standard regimen and the fact that most dose&#xD;
      selection studies are based on anecdotal experience or small single institution dose&#xD;
      escalation studies. Furthermore, known risks of harm, including death, have been shown in&#xD;
      dose escalation studies. Given the relative heterogeneity of liver cancer patients, small&#xD;
      sample sizes and high risk of harm, a consensus dose regimen that can be tested remains&#xD;
      elusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One solution is to individualize dose selection to decrease the impact of heterogeneity of&#xD;
      patient anatomy, type of cancer, size of lesion and motion. The liver tolerance to external&#xD;
      beam irradiation depends on the volume treated and the fractionation schedule. Lawrence, et&#xD;
      al found that patients who developed grade III or IV radiation induced liver disease (RILD)&#xD;
      tended to receive a higher mean dose and have less sparing of normal liver than those who did&#xD;
      not. In the original analysis, none of the 45 patients who received a mean dose to the whole&#xD;
      liver of less than 37 Gy (in 1.5 Gy per fraction bid) developed RILD, while 9 of 34 patients&#xD;
      who received a mean dose of more than 37 Gy developed this complication. Another study from&#xD;
      the University of Michigan looked at 26 patients with hepatobiliary cancer treated with&#xD;
      radiation doses up to 72.6 Gy, in 1.5 Gy bid and concurrent intrahepatic fluorodeoxyuridine&#xD;
      administration. Patients treated with a component of 36 Gy whole liver radiation were more&#xD;
      likely to develop RILD compared to those treated with focal high-dose radiation with no whole&#xD;
      liver radiation. These studies indicate that by using modern conformal radiation planning it&#xD;
      is possible to deliver tumouricidal doses of radiation safely. More recently, we have&#xD;
      developed a better understanding of the relationship between dose, volume of liver irradiated&#xD;
      and RILD, based on an analysis of over 200 patients with hepatic malignancies treated at the&#xD;
      University of Michigan. This analysis demonstrates that for a small effective liver volume&#xD;
      irradiated, far higher doses of radiation can be prescribed than previously estimated. In&#xD;
      addition to the dose and volume irradiated, several other factors were significantly&#xD;
      associated with increased the risk of RILD, including use of BUdR chemotherapy (versus FuDR),&#xD;
      primary hepatobiliary cancer diagnosis (versus metastatic cancer diagnosis) and male sex.&#xD;
      Excluding 32 patients treated with BudR, leaving 169 patients treated with 1.5 Gy bid with&#xD;
      concurrent FudR, the mean liver dose associated with a 5% risk of RILD for patients with&#xD;
      metastases and primary hepatobiliary cancer were 37 Gy and 32 Gy, in 1.5 Gy bid. Assuming an&#xD;
      alpha/beta ratio for the liver of 2.5 Gy, the corresponding mean liver doses associated with&#xD;
      a 5% risk of RILD are 33 Gy and 28 Gy in 2 Gy per fraction, and 28.2 Gy and 25.1 Gy in 10&#xD;
      fractions, for metastases and primary liver cancer respectively. This radiobiological&#xD;
      guidance has been used at the London Regional Cancer Program since 2004 with a REB approved,&#xD;
      prospectively collected case series. This radiobiologically-guided individualized dose&#xD;
      selection is now used routinely in London, has shown a very good tolerability and can be&#xD;
      implemented immediately. Doses can be escalated and de-escalated to account for variation in&#xD;
      patient anatomy, tumour and normal tissue motion, comorbidities, size of lesion, number of&#xD;
      lesions and function of the normal liver. However, the value of this new technique relative&#xD;
      to palliative treatment is unknown. In particular, is there a survival advantage to dose&#xD;
      escalation based on the oligometastases theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For unresectable cases, SBRT has been shown to be a safe alternative for patients with few,&#xD;
      if any, options. However, neither the appropriate dose regimen nor impact on important&#xD;
      clinical endpoints, including survival has been determined; and no randomized trials have&#xD;
      been published to guide management. Individualized dose selection based on radiobiological&#xD;
      parameters promises a safe dose escalation or de-escalation for each patient. Therefore, a&#xD;
      phase III randomized clinical study comparing palliative external beam radiation and a&#xD;
      radiobiologically&#xD;
