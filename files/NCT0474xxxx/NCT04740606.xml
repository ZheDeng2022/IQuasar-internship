      The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Augmented Reality Navigation&#xD;
      System through intra-airway navigation system to guide bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      peripheral pulmonary nodules and explore the factors of diagnosis yield.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, prospective, Asian multicenter, Real World case Registry study.&#xD;
      Recruitment is expected to last up to 12 months, and each subject may be followed up for 12&#xD;
      months at most after surgery which depends on certain factors. The total duration of the&#xD;
      study is about 24 months.The research is planned to be carried out at more than 10 sites.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will assess the nodules based on the CT images of subjects before procedure. And then, the appropriate intra-airway path planned by the Augmented Reality Navigation System will be selected. The bronchoscopy with intra-airway navigation under the guidance of the Augmented Reality Navigation System will be performed and the following surgical information will be record.</description>
