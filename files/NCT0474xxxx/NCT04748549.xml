  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate whether the use of virtual reality (VR) during&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can facilitate reductions in intraoperative sedative&#xD;
      requirements while maintaining high levels of patient satisfaction as compared to both a&#xD;
      music and sham VR + usual care control.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a three-armed randomized controlled trial with the following&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate whether the use of VR during TKA can facilitate a reduction in&#xD;
      intraoperative propofol dose required for patient comfort as compared to music and sham VR +&#xD;
      usual care controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Patients in both the VR and music groups will demonstrate reductions in propofol&#xD;
      dose compared to sham VR + usual care controls. A reduction in propofol dose between the VR&#xD;
      and music group will be smaller in magnitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Assess the effect of VR during TKA on patient reported outcomes including&#xD;
      overall satisfaction, pain, and anxiety as compared to music and sham VR + usual care&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Patients in the VR group will report significantly higher satisfaction and better&#xD;
      control of pain and anxiety than those in the music group and usual care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Explore the potential effects of VR during TKA on other key secondary&#xD;
      outcomes of perioperative efficiency, postoperative cognition, and functional recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Patients in the VR group will have shorter post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU)&#xD;
      length of stay as compared to sham VR + usual care controls. The effect of VR on&#xD;
      postoperative delirium, postoperative cognitive decline, postoperative opioid use and&#xD;
      functional recovery will be exploratory endpoints.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in the Immersive VR group will don a VR headset connected to a software platform on a tablet, as well as noise cancelling headphones. Patients can choose their desired experience within the VR software from a selection of immersive environments and/or video content. Examples include sitting in a canoe on a river, on a peaceful meadow or in a forest. Patients also have the option to listen to guided meditation or select from a library of videos to watch on a web-based user interface.&#xD;
To reduce the influence of the anesthesia provider on the determination of sedative requirements, patients will administer their own sedation according to their needs for relaxation and comfort using a patient controlled system.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients randomized to the Music group will be equipped with VR headsets but won't view any content. They will also be equipped with noise cancelling headphones in the same fashion as the immersive VR group. A study team member will play from a library of music or other audible content (audiobook, podcast) that was preselected by the patient. Patients in the Sham VR group will also use patient controlled sedation.</description>

    <description>Subjects in the control group will wear VR headsets and headphones but will not view any content or listen to any audible content. They will undergo Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) according to a prespecified protocol targeting light or moderate sedation with a propofol infusion.</description>
