    <description>evolution of individual frailty during a multimodal intervention (physical and nutritional activity) according to the Fried's criteria</description>

    <measure>evaluation of predicitive variables of frailty syndrome reversion</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 0, 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The criterion determining the frail status is the Fried score classified into 3 categories: not frail; pre-frail; frail. A change from frail to pre-frail or to not frail will be considered as an improvement. Measurements of the Frailty score and other markers on nutrition and APA will be carried out at month 0 (basic measurements), then measured at month 6 (end of APA and nutritionist support) and at month12 (6 months after empowerment). All of health markers collected during the basic assessment, changes in parameters (month 6) and compliance with APA and nutrition support (from Month 1 to Month 6 then between Month 6 and Month 12) will be tested as variables potentially predictive of an improvement in the frailty syndrome.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 0, 6 and 12</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Month 0, 3, 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>nutritional parameters measured at each time frame for weight, VAS appetite score, MNA score, nutritional calculation (food survey and self-questionnaire), bio impedancemetry and biomarkers of nutrition (levels of albumin, prealbumin, C reactive protein, CBC, liver and kidney function)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure adherence to APA interventions and exercise practices</measure>
    <time_frame>between month 1 to 6 and between month 6 to 12</time_frame>
