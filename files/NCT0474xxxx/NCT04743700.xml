  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acceleration of orthodontic tooth movement persuades tremendous rise in the interest of&#xD;
      adolescents and aduts, as it not only shortens the treatment duration but also lessens the&#xD;
      incidence of white spot lesions, root resorption, periodontal and other soft tissue problems.&#xD;
      Minimal invasive techniques i.e.both piezocision and micro-osteoperforations had promising&#xD;
      results in accelerating tooth movement. Therefore current study will provide evidence for&#xD;
      better minimal invasive technique in terms of reducing treatment time and patient comfort.&#xD;

      Patients with Angle's Class II division 1 malocclusion meeting selection criteria and are&#xD;
      indicated for maxillary first premolar extraction, patients will be referred for extraction&#xD;
      of the maxillary first premolars , treatment will be initiated by bonding preadjusted MBT&#xD;
      0.022&quot; slot straight wire appliance(Patient will be instructed to report immediately in case&#xD;
      of breakage of appliance), after that, leveling and alignment will be done in all subjects,&#xD;
      after insertion of 0.019&quot;Ã— 0.025&quot; stainless steel arch wire, alginate impression and&#xD;
      periapical radiograph of canine and first molar region will be taken(Before the initiation of&#xD;
      canine retraction), randomisation and allocation of two sides of maxillary arch i.e. right&#xD;
      and left will be done and active interventions(piezocision and micro-osteoperforations) for&#xD;
      each side will be done, immediately maxillary canine retraction will be started with&#xD;
      mini-implant and closed NiTi coil spring, patient will be asked to fill pain and discomfort&#xD;
      assessment card immediately after initiation of canine retraction., subsequent impressions&#xD;
      records will be taken at 4th, 8th, 12th and 16th weeks for measuring rate of maxillary canine&#xD;
      retraction, data collection and interpretation of results, further pain assessment cards will&#xD;
      be filled after 24 hours, on 7th day and 28th day&#xD;

    <description>Piezocisions with the help of piezotome , mesial and distal to a canine (in a vertical line) with the help of piezotome. These piezocisions will be performed on the buccal cortical bone only, 2-3mm below the alveolar crest level, 2mm deep into the bone under local anaesthesia (2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine) and with standard asepsis, and gingival overlying will be incised first with blade number 15 in a Bard Parker handle . The exact location of incision will be determined by transgingival probing mesial and distal to the canine to know the alveolar crest level and to this measurement 2-3 mm is added and then 5mm incision is given in gingiva and overlying mucoperiosteum in a vertical line apically to expose the underlying bone.</description>

The exact location of first MOP will be determined by transgingival probing mesial and distal to the canine to know the alveolar crest level and to this measurement 2-3 mm is added.
