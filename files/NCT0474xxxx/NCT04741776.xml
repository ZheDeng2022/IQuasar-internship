  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depressed mothers (pregnant and post-delivery) make up a significant portion of Maternal,&#xD;
      Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) clients. Home visited mothers often&#xD;
      experience family conflict that precipitates or worsens their depressive symptoms. This study&#xD;
      uses an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 1 design with a pilot randomized trial to&#xD;
      test the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, safety, and preliminary effectiveness of&#xD;
      an innovative family therapy intervention that uses technology to bypass barriers to increase&#xD;
      access to treatment for this vulnerable population.&#xD;
