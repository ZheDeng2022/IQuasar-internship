      Introduction: Atherosclerotic Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is the leading cause of&#xD;
      mortality in the western world. To maintain homeostasis of the vessel wall, vascular cells&#xD;
      produce a high level of heat shock proteins (HSP), among which is Hsp70, to stimulate innate&#xD;
      immunity and face stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a clinical trial where 260 individuals were evaluated by a screening test&#xD;
      employing the Ankle-Arm Index (ABI), 220 of them were not within risk value (0.91 to 0.99&#xD;
      mmHg). In the clinical trial, 32 individuals were included. A control group and an&#xD;
      experimental group were formed. Aerobic exercise intervention was performed for 12 weeks. The&#xD;
      level of Hsp70 was evaluated, physical and clinical measurements were applied at the&#xD;
      beginning and at the end of the trial.&#xD;

      The objective of the study is to determine the level of serum expression of the HSP70 protein&#xD;
      in individuals at risk of atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease, after an intervention&#xD;
      of moderate exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atherosclerotic Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a systemic disease that causes&#xD;
      obstruction of arterial blood flow and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      worldwide 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PAD have a three times greater risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death&#xD;
      than those without the disease. However, more than 50% of patients are asymptomatic; so the&#xD;
      disease remains underdiagnosed. 2 It is estimated that 202 million people in the world are&#xD;
      affected with PAD, 45 million of them die from coronary or cerebrovascular disease in a range&#xD;
      of ten years. The current prevalence of PAD in Mexico is 10% of the general population.3 The&#xD;
      disease is strongly related to modifiable risk factors (blood pressure, sedentary lifestyle,&#xD;
      baseline glycemia, cholesterol, and obesity) and unhealthy lifestyle (tobacco, physical&#xD;
      inactivity, food and psychosocial stress), which increases the risk of acquiring the disease&#xD;
      up to 17.2 times 4, 5, 6 Increased membrane permeability leads to the accumulation and&#xD;
      modification of proteins, lipids and lipoproteins in the endothelium. The accumulation of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory molecules such as chemo-tactical monocyte protein 1 (MCP-1), intracellular&#xD;
      adhesion molecules (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion (VCAM-1) and higher nitro-tyrosine&#xD;
      content are also generated. 7 Macrophages are active in response to the spread of the&#xD;
      inflammatory response and bind to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors that had&#xD;
      internalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macrophages secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in the recruitment and activation of&#xD;
      additional immune cells at the site of the lesion, amplifying the immune response and&#xD;
      promoting the development of complex and advanced plaques that become mature atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaques.8 The Ankle Arm Index (ABI) is the non-invasive gold standard accepted for both the&#xD;
      diagnosis and evaluation of the severity of this disease. The cut-off point for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of PAD is an ABI of less than 0.90 at rest, regardless of the Framingham Risk Score, being&#xD;
      95% sensitive in the detection of PAD. 9, 10 To maintain homeostasis on the vessel wall,&#xD;
      vascular cells produce a high level of heat shock proteins (HSP) 11. These types of stress&#xD;
      proteins are cytoprotective agents that promote cell survival during stressors. 12 The&#xD;
      reduction of HSP intracellular expression is also related to PAD, cardiovascular diseases and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, where they are greatly diminished. 10 HSP are normally intracellular&#xD;
      proteins, but when released at an extracellular level, they exert an immune response.13 The&#xD;
      most thermo-sensitive and highly inducible HSP belongs to the 70 kilodalton (kDa) family, as&#xD;
      established by Mizzen et al., In 1998 (figure 1). It is believed that extracellular Hsp70&#xD;
      (eHsp70) stimulates innate immunity and acts as a danger signal. Serum Hsp70 has been&#xD;
      detected in the peripheral circulation of apparently healthy individuals and increases in&#xD;
      response to different stressors, including exercise. 12, 14&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 1. Schematic representation of the molecular structure of HSP70. Adapted from Carrasco&#xD;
      L. et al. 15 Exercise increases HSP levels primarily through reactive oxygen species (ROS),&#xD;
      elevated temperature, hormones, calcium fluxes or mechanical tissue deformation.16 It has&#xD;
      been shown that the concentration of Hsp70 increases after performing both acute and&#xD;
      long-term exercises, reaching levels that remain high, but once its protective action&#xD;
      decreases both at intra and extra-cellular levels.17 Exercise exerts beneficial effects&#xD;
      against atherosclerosis by increasing circulating endostatin, which inhibits the development&#xD;
      of atherosclerotic plaque by blocking angiogenesis in plaque tissue.18 Isotonic contractions&#xD;
      of the type of resistance exercise (aerobic) tend to lead to increases in Hsp70 levels, as&#xD;
      opposed to eccentric exercise. With repetitive exercise, an induced increase in this protein&#xD;
      is maintained, while the initial response of other HSPs to exercise decreases as training&#xD;
      progresses.16 Regular exercise initiates long-term processes of adaptation of muscle&#xD;
      metabolism, cardiovascular system and immuno-modulatory effects that are largely considered&#xD;
      beneficial; There is evidence that during exercise, Hsp70 is released into human circulation&#xD;
      in association with exosomes, specifically with aerobic exercise.19, 20 It has been shown&#xD;
      that Hsp70 directly inhibits inflammatory processes through the suppression of oxidative&#xD;
      stress, directly reduces apoptosis, hyperplasia, as well as decreasing the expression of&#xD;
      adhesion molecules that lead to leukocyte extravasation and the manifestation of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines.16 Higher serum levels of Hsp70 are associated with reduced thickening of the&#xD;
      atherosclerotic intima and a lower risk of coronary artery disease.21&#xD;
