    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      MT-201-GBM (pp65CMV antigen monocytes) that will be administered to patients newly diagnosed&#xD;
      with a type of brain tumor called glioblastoma (GBM) that has an unmethylated MGMT&#xD;
      (O[6]-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) (MGMT) gene promoter.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The investigational vaccine (MT-201-GBM) in this study is made from a type of immune cell&#xD;
      called monocytes, which have been engineered to express a cytomegalovirus (CMV) protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monocyte vaccines are made from the patient's own cells, which are collected through a&#xD;
      procedure called leukapheresis. During leukapheresis, the patient's blood is collected into a&#xD;
      machine that removes white blood cells and then returns the remainder of the blood back to&#xD;
      the individual. The leukapheresis procedure is not typically associated with any discomfort&#xD;
      or pain. The white blood cells collected from leukapheresis are used to generate the&#xD;
      patient's monocyte vaccine. After leukapheresis, patients receive standard radiation therapy&#xD;
      combined with temozolomide for about 6 weeks, followed by one cycle of temozolomide for 21&#xD;
      days. About 2 days later, patients will receive the first monocyte vaccine, followed by 2&#xD;
      more monocyte vaccines every 4 weeks.&#xD;
