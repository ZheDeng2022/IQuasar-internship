  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to resume physical activities, aerobic fitness and a healthy lifestyle without&#xD;
      symptoms after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains unclear because studies show high rates&#xD;
      of patient dissatisfaction. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether an individualized&#xD;
      goal-centered rehabilitation protocol leads to high patient-reported physical activities and&#xD;
      satisfaction after TKA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective study was conducted in patients who underwent primary TKA (Journey II, Smith &amp;&#xD;
      Nephew) from the same surgeon from July 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. Patients completed&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) before the operation and then at 1, 2, and 4 years&#xD;
      postoperatively.These included the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Joint Replacement&#xD;
      Survey (KOOS JR) 7-item score; questions from the Cincinnati Knee Rating System related to&#xD;
      the overall knee condition, pain, and swelling; selected questions from the Veterans RAND&#xD;
      12-Item Health Survey; questions about general fitness level; and questions regarding patient&#xD;
      expectations before and after surgery. Patients were asked to list all physical,&#xD;
      recreational, and work activities they participated in after surgery. An experienced research&#xD;
      associate interviewed the patients postoperatively, with data reduction and patient ratings&#xD;
      blinded to the treating surgeon and therapist.&#xD;
