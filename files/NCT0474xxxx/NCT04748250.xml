      The aim of this study to determine the effect of soy phytoestrogens and acupuncture on&#xD;
      osteoporosis in female athlete triad at adolescence age. It is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - There will be no statistical significant difference between the effects of soy&#xD;
      phytoestrogens and acupuncture on osteoporosis in female athlete triad at adolescence age.&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION: Do soy phytoestrogens and acupuncture have an effect on bone mineral&#xD;
      density in female athlete triad at adolescence age?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many female athletes don't depend only on physical training and exercising to obtain the&#xD;
      ideal slim and thin body. So that they follow harmful unhealthy diet to achieve the ideal&#xD;
      body shape they are seeking. These types of diet can lead to malnutrition, menstrual&#xD;
      disturbances, and bone loss, and these three components form a triad called female athlete&#xD;
      triad. A limited number of studies have examined the effect of acupuncture and soy products&#xD;
      on irregularities related to female athletes so the aim of this study is to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of both acupuncture in line with diet modification using soy products on osteopenia in&#xD;
      female athlete triad. Study Design: A prospective, randomized, single-blind, pre-post-test,&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty female athletes with ages ranged from 14 to 18 years, playing gymnastics and all&#xD;
      diagnosed and referred with female athlete triad resulting in decreased bone mineral density&#xD;
      and osteoporosis. All participants will be treated with soy products and acupuncture and will&#xD;
      be closely followed for six months. DEXA will be used to assess bone mineral density before&#xD;
      and after the treatment program.&#xD;
