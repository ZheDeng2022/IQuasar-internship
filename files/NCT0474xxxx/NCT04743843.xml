  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study serves as a validation study for the Omnyx Dynamyx software and Hamamatsu .ndpi&#xD;
      image file format, evaluating agreement of diagnosis between whole slide images (WSI) of the&#xD;
      Omnyx system (Omnyx scanned .rts images and Omnyx Dynamyx software) and the Omnyx Dynamyx&#xD;
      software with the Hamamatsu .ndpi images. The primary goal of this study is to demonstrate&#xD;
      concordance between the two systems to validate the Omnyx Dynamyx software with the non-Omnyx&#xD;
      .ndpi image file type.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall study design was to compare the diagnosis obtained by .rts WSI from the Omnyx&#xD;
      system (Omnyx scanner and Omnyx Software) and diagnosis obtained by .ndpi WSI of the&#xD;
      Hamamatsu S360 or similar scanner with the Omnyx Software. Pathologists read cases in the&#xD;
      Omnyx Dynamyx software with .rts images from an Omnyx scanner and complete a Preliminary&#xD;
      Surgical Pathology Consultant Report that includes a preliminary diagnosis. After a two-week&#xD;
      washout period, the pathologists read the same cases in the Omnyx Dynamyx software with .ndpi&#xD;
      images from a Hamamatsu scanner. The diagnosis from the Omnyx scanners are provided in the&#xD;
      Final Surgical Pathology Consultant Report. Pathologists then complete an Inspirata Whole&#xD;
      Slide Imaging Case Worksheet to determine confirmation of diagnosis - that is,&#xD;
      agreement/concordance between the WSI from the two scanners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to prove that the diagnosis of a case will be the same when using the&#xD;
      Omnyx .rts file type as the Hamamatsu .ndpi file type regardless of tissue or procedure type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All discrepancies between the two &quot;systems&quot; will be documented and reconciled. Discrepancies&#xD;
      categorized as Major or Minor. The Principal Investigator Discordance Review Form will be&#xD;
      utilized to document the Principal Investigator's review of those cases where discrepancies&#xD;
      were attributed to technical/technological aspects of WSI, such as sub-optimal image quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a deidentified, retrospective study to evaluate surgical pathology cases, excluding&#xD;
      frozen sections and cytology. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue from sixty (60) cases&#xD;
      across a range of three (3) subspecialist categories will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials for each case include the original pathology report and the complete set of&#xD;
      physical slides from each case at the time of diagnosis. Cases will be no more than two (2)&#xD;
      years older than the Date of Protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathology reports will be deidentified and the key to match the pathology reports with&#xD;
      the deidentified physical slides and deidentified Whole Slide Images (WSI) will be retained&#xD;
      and managed by the Study Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each slide will be scanned on the Omnyx VL120 scanner and Hamamatsu S360 scanner with 40x&#xD;
      magnification settings and standard compression ratings for each system. Whole slide image&#xD;
      data sets will be prepared by deidentified case number (for example, Case1- Case 60) and&#xD;
      distributed to at least three (3) pathologists with any pertinent information about the case&#xD;
      form the original pathology report EXCEPT the final diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the approximately 60 cases will be read in both the Omnyx system with Omnyx .rts&#xD;
      images and the Omnyx Dynamyx software with Hamamatsu .ndpi images with a two (2) week&#xD;
      wash-out period between the .rts and .ndpi case reads. Each case will only be read once (by&#xD;
      the same pathologist) in each of the two modalities. Therefore, if three (3) pathologists&#xD;
      participate, each pathologist will be responsible for reading twenty (20) cases in both image&#xD;
      formats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pathologist will review all Omnyx .rts images first and record the preliminary diagnosis.&#xD;
      The pathologist will then read the cases from the Hamamatsu .ndpi images in the Omnyx Dynamyx&#xD;
      software and determine concordance between WSI produced by the Omnyx VL 120 scanner and&#xD;
      viewed in the Omnyx Dynamyx software and images produced by the Hamamatsu S360 scanner and&#xD;
      viewed in the Omnyx Dynamyx software. If the pathologist determines discordance, the PI will&#xD;
      complete review of all discordant cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concordance will be reported by subspecialty and overall and will be reported between the&#xD;
      original pathology report and the .rts images and the .rts images and the .ndpi images.&#xD;
      Discordance must be significant as discerned by the adjudication pathologist. Minor&#xD;
      discordance will be measured but only significant discordance will be reported as a primary&#xD;
      endpoint of this study.&#xD;
