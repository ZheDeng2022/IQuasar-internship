    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about activity levels in children with pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
      Pulmonary hypertension is a condition where the pressure in the lungs is higher than normal.&#xD;
      This can affect the person's heart. The purpose of this study is to see if measuring activity&#xD;
      in children with pulmonary hypertension and comparing it to activity in children without&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension can give their doctor helpful information on how they are feeling and&#xD;
      how their treatment is working.&#xD;
