  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial was made to developing an individual counseling program to help&#xD;
      women cope with their fear of childbirth and testing the program for effectiveness.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fear of childbirth is a common problem among women and one that affects their health and&#xD;
      welfare before and during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The problem can lead to&#xD;
      adverse pregnancy outcomes and also cause a woman to experience psychological issues. Fear of&#xD;
      childbirth can also influence the determination of the mode of delivery and can amount to a&#xD;
      rise in cesarean rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healthcare provided by midwives and other healthcare professionals during pregnancy and&#xD;
      childbirth have the power to reduce or exacerbate childbirth fears. The most significant&#xD;
      midwifery intervention that can be used to diminish the fear of childbirth is counseling.&#xD;
      There is a need to develop and test individual counseling models that require the basic&#xD;
      training skills that midwives can use as part of their routine care to address women's fears&#xD;
      and expectations about childbirth. The individual counseling program developed in this&#xD;
      context may be an easy-to-implement and cost-effective method to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted for the purposes of developing an individual counseling program to&#xD;
      help women cope with their fear of childbirth and testing the program for effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was tested the hypotheses that there is no difference between the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups of pregnant women after the intervention in terms of fear of childbirth, childbirth&#xD;
      self-efficacy and state anxiety scores and childbirth outcomes (duration of labor, mode of&#xD;
      delivery, elective and emergency cesarean rates, postpartum hypertension and need for a blood&#xD;
      transfusion, the admittance of the newborn into the intensive care unit, preferences for&#xD;
      future births and duration of stay in hospital).&#xD;

    <measure>Fear of childbirth before intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>28-30 gestational weeks</time_frame>
    <description>assessed using the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire- Version A. This instrument contains questions on women's prenatal expectations to measure the nature of the fear experienced during and following childbirth. The instrument makes it possible to identify the nature of the fear of childbirth women feel before their delivery. This scale contain 33 questions. Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire- Version A is based on a 6-point Likert scale numbered 0-5. Zero corresponds to the response, &quot;Totally&quot; and five means &quot;none.&quot; The minimum possible score on the scale is a &quot;0&quot;; maximum is 165. Higher scores indicate greater levels of Fear of Childbirth.</description>

This instrument contains questions on women's postpartum experiences to measure the nature of the fear experienced during and following childbirth. The instrument makes it possible to identify the nature of the fear of childbirth women feel after their delivery. This scale contain 33 questions. Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire- Version-B is based on a 6-point Likert scale where the responses are numbered from 1-6 and one corresponds to the response, &quot;Totally&quot; and six means &quot;none.&quot; The total possible score on the scale varies between 33-198. Higher scores indicate greater levels of Fear of Childbirth.</description>

    <measure>Childbirth Self-Efficacy before intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>28-30 gestational weeks</time_frame>
    <description>assessed using the Childbirth Self-efficacy Inventory-Short Form. The instrument measure levels of self-efficacy during labor. The scale is comprised of two subscales-outcome expectancies and self-efficacy expectancies. In the outcome expectancies subscale, responses range from 1: &quot;not at all helpful&quot; to 10: &quot;very helpful,&quot; while in the self-efficacy expectancies subscale, the first 13 items are marked as 1: &quot;Completely sure,&quot; to 10: &quot;Not at all sure&quot; and items 14-16 receive a score of 1: &quot;Not at all sure&quot; to 10: &quot;Completely sure.&quot; All the responses to the inventory are based on a 10-point Likert-type scale. The lowest possible score on the Childbirth Self-efficacy Inventory is 32; the highest is 320. The higher the score, the more self-efficacy and confidence the pregnant woman has.</description>

    <description>The women in the intervention groups were administered a three-session intervention program in addition to the routine care they received.The program encompassed providing the women with an educational booklet, childbirth stories and childbirth videos that were created to reduce their fears of childbirth.The interviews were held a total of three times, in gestational weeks 28-30, 31-33 and 34-36. The duration of the intervention at each visit was 60-80 minutes. Depending on the woman's own preference, she was invited to visit the delivery room at the second or last session and meet the midwives there. The women who did not wish to go to the delivery room were alternatively provided with photographs of the delivery room so they could take a look. Again as part of the education program, the women were given the links to the selected childbirth videos and given the opportunity to watch them.</description>
