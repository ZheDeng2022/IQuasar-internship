  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent publications evaluating scapular kinematics after stroke, it is emphasized that&#xD;
      scapular muscles, which affect the performance of upper limbs in daily life, should not be&#xD;
      ignored. When the literature is analyzed for these reasons, the studies in which scapular&#xD;
      training was added to the treatment plan of upper limb rehabilitation of stroke individuals&#xD;
      are inadequate and the existing studies have methodological deficiencies. Also, it is seen&#xD;
      that studies which investigate the effects of these exercises on scapular kinematics, the&#xD;
      parameters of periscapular muscle thickness and shoulder subluxation are not included. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to examine the effects of scapular training on scapular kinematics,&#xD;
      periscapular muscle thickness, shoulder subluxation and upper extremity functionality in&#xD;
      stroke individuals. The study was planned to include 2 groups, 1 treatment and 1 control&#xD;
      group. The control group will receive Neurodevelopmental Treatment - Bobath exercises, while&#xD;
      the treatment group will receive exercises for the muscles around the scapula in addition to&#xD;
      Neurodevelopmental Treatment - Bobath exercises. Muscle thickness of periscapular muscles,&#xD;
      shoulder subluxation, 3D scapular kinematics, upper extremity and trunk performance, pain,&#xD;
      activities of daily living and quality of life will be assessed before and after 8 weeks&#xD;
      treatment program. As a result; effectiveness of scapular training in addition to&#xD;
      Neurodevelopmental Treatment and relationship between scapular kinematics, periscapular&#xD;
      muscle thickness, shoulder subluxation, and upper extremity performance will be examined.&#xD;

    <time_frame>change from baseline in muscle thickness of periscapular muscles at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of muscle thickness of bilateral serratus anterior and lower trapezius muscles with ultrasonography will be performed by a physician using a 5-10 MHz linear probe (Diasus Dynamic Imaging Ltd, Livingston, Scotland,UK) in resting position.

    <description>The evaluation of shoulder subluxation with ultrasonography will be performed by a physician using a 5-10 MHz linear probe (Diasus Dynamic Imaging Ltd, Livingston, Scotland,UK). It will be performed while the individual is sitting on a chair, the shoulder is in neutral rotation, with the elbow at 90 degrees of flexion and the forearm in pronation. The fore-arms will rest on a pillow placed on the patient's lap. The subluxation would be expressed as centimeters.</description>

    <description>FMA-UE is a stroke-specific assessment tool to measure the upper limb motor impairment [61], which included shoulder-arm, wrist, hand, coordination and reflexes. There were 33 items, which scoring on an ordinal scale from 0 to 2. The total score was ranged from 0 to 66.</description>

    <measure>Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in upper extremity performance at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ARAT is a performance-based test that evaluates upper extremity function of grasping, gripping, pinching and gross arm movement. This ordinal scale consists of 19 items. The quality of the performance on each item was rated from 0 to 3 points. The total score was ranged from 0 to 57.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in trunk performance at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Trunk Impairment Scale is a reliable and valid scale measuring trunk performance and sitting balance in stroke patients. It evaluates posture and selective movements of the trunk and contains of three subscales; static and dynamic sitting balance and coordination. The Trunk Impairment Scale version 2.0. including only dynamic sitting balance and coordination will be used for measuring trunk performance. The total score for Trunk Impairment Scale version 2.0. ranges between 0 and 16. Higher scores indicate better trunk performance.</description>

    <description>Visual Analog Scale is one of the most commonly used methods in determining pain in the literature. It will be scored by the patients during an activity and the measurement of 3D scapular kinematics and also in resting position. The pain scores will be recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain.&quot;</description>
