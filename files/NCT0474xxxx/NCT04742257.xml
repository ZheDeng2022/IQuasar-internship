  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind (patient and evaluator), sham-controlled&#xD;
      study to be conducted in stroke patients with upper-extremity spasticity. The main objectives&#xD;
      of this study are to evaluate the performance and safety of the MyoRegulator® device in&#xD;
      active- versus sham-treated patients after 5 consecutive days of treatment. The MyoRegulator®&#xD;
      device is a non-significant risk (NSR) investigational non-invasive neuromodulation device&#xD;
      that uses multi-site direct current (multi-site DCS) stimulation for the treatment of muscle&#xD;
      spasticity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the U.S. and a leading cause of serious&#xD;
      long-term disability. There are over 7.5 million patients in the U.S. living with stroke, and&#xD;
      an estimated 795,000 additional cases of stroke occur annually in the U.S. Of these cases,&#xD;
      approximately 610,000 represent initial attacks and 185,000 represent recurrent stroke&#xD;
      according to the CDC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spasticity is a common finding in patients with stroke, arising in about 30% of stroke&#xD;
      patients, and occurring usually within the first few days or weeks. It is a disorder of motor&#xD;
      function that results from injury to the spinal cord or brain, and causes decreased motor&#xD;
      performance as well as pain, discomfort and muscle weakness that greatly interferes with&#xD;
      functional recovery. Spasticity can range from mild to severe and can cause striking&#xD;
      impairments in functional movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial clinical trial of safety and feasibility suggests that five sessions of treatment&#xD;
      with the MyoRegulator® device temporarily reduces spasticity and overall stiffness of the&#xD;
      affected extremity with optimal reductions in spasticity occurring 2-3 weeks post stimulation&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MyoRegulator® is a non-significant risk (NSR) investigational non-invasive neuromodulation&#xD;
      device using multi-site direct current stimulation (multi-site DCS) for the treatment of&#xD;
      spasticity. Multi-site DCS utilizes trans-spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) paired&#xD;
      with transcutaneous peripheral direct current stimulation (pDCS). This study was designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of MyoRegulator® in the treatment of post-stroke upper-limb&#xD;
      spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary performance endpoint is defined as the reduction in wrist joint spasticity as&#xD;
      measured using the Modified Ashworth Scale and will use a responder analysis. The study will&#xD;
      be considered to have a successful outcome if a significant number of actively treated&#xD;
      subjects respond to MyoRegulator® treatment as compared to the sham treated subjects between&#xD;
      2 and 6 weeks post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoint is defined as the incidence of device-related serious adverse&#xD;
      events. The safety of the device will be demonstrated if there are no incidents of serious&#xD;
      adverse events caused or contributed to by the device treatment that are clinically&#xD;
      unacceptable in light of the treatment benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the relationship between response to treatment and BDNF genotype,&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to provide a saliva sample and give consent for BDNF genotyping.&#xD;
