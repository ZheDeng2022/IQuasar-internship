    <textblock>
      This prospective, longitudinal study aims to identify modifiable predictors of return to work&#xD;
      after back surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background | Over the past decade, the number of back surgeries in Belgium has substantially&#xD;
      increased. However, even after an anatomically successful surgery, 10% to 40% of the patients&#xD;
      continue to report pain complaints, causing personal suffering and an enormous economic&#xD;
      burden. The specific factors that can predict individual trajectories in postoperative pain,&#xD;
      recovery, and work resumption are currently largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim | The aim of this study is to identify modifiable predictors of work resumption after&#xD;
      back surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods | In this multisite, prospective, longitudinal study, 300 individuals undergoing back&#xD;
      surgery will be followed one-year post-surgery. Prior to surgery, the participants will&#xD;
      perform a behavioral computer task to assess fear of movement-related pain and avoidance&#xD;
      behavior, and their generalization. In addition, participants will complete questionnaires to&#xD;
      assess preoperative fear of movement-related pain, avoidance behavior, optimism, expectancies&#xD;
      towards recovery and work resumption, and the duration and severity of the pain before the&#xD;
      surgery. Immediately after surgery, as well as six weeks, three months, six months, and&#xD;
      twelve months postoperatively, sustainable work resumption, pain severity, disability, and&#xD;
      quality of life will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis | The primary hypothesis is that generalization of fear of movement-related pain&#xD;
      and avoidance behavior will negatively affect sustainable work resumption after back surgery.&#xD;
      Second, the investigators hypothesize that generalization of fear of movement-related pain&#xD;
      and avoidance behavior, negative expectancies towards recovery and work resumption, longer&#xD;
      pain duration, and more severe pain before the surgery will negatively affect work&#xD;
      resumption, pain severity, disability, and quality of life after back surgery. In contrast,&#xD;
      positive expectancies towards recovery and work resumption and optimism are expected&#xD;
      positively influence work resumption, pain severity, disability, and quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators make a distinction between being fit for work, work resumption, and sustainable work resumption. Being fit for work will be operationalized by not receiving disability benefits. Work resumption will be operationalized by being at work without receiving disability benefits, and time to relapse. Time to relapse is defined as the time for participants to be in sick leave again after being fit for work. Sustainable work resumption will be operationalized by being at work for at least three consecutive months without receiving disability benefits. In addition, the duration of work resumption will be measured.</description>

    <measure>Self-reported ratings of how much pain the participants experiences, assessed by one question of the short Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire (ÖMPSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Pain severity will be operationalized as the intensity of the pain, and will be assessed by one questions of the short ÖMPSQ (Linton et al., 2011). Participants are requested to answer this item (i.e., How would you rate the pain that you have had during the past week?) on a numerical rating scale with labels from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as it could be. The score on this item will be used as a measure of pain severity before and immediately after the surgery (as baseline measures) and six weeks, three months, six months and twelve months post-surgery.</description>

    <measure>Self-reported ratings of the extent that pain interferes with functioning, assessed by Pain Disability Index (PDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Disability will be operationalized as the degree to which pain interferes with functioning, and will be assessed by the Pain Disability Index (PDI) questionnaire (Pollard, 1984). The PDI is a self-report questionnaire that measures the degree to which pain interferes with functioning in seven areas: i.e., family/home responsibilities, recreation, social activity, occupation, sexual behavior, self-care, and life-support activity (Tait et al., 1990). Ratings for each item range from 0 = no disability to 5 = total disability. A total score will be calculated as a reliable and valid (Tait et al., 1990) measure of degree of disability before and immediately after the surgery (as baseline measures) and six weeks, three months, six months and twelve months post-surgery.</description>
