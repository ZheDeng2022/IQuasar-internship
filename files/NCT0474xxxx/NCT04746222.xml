  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double-blinded, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a single&#xD;
      dose of oral capsule-administered faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for&#xD;
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) intestinal decolonisation compared with&#xD;
      placebo. Primary outcome is the proportion of patients successfully decolonised of CPE&#xD;
      intestinal carriage at 12 weeks after FMT treatment compared with placebo.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Study subjects will be randomised to either FMT-capsules or placebo (subject and investigator-blinded) immediately prior to capsule administration. Subjects who are randomised to FMT by capsule will receive 30 FMT-containing capsules under direct-observed therapy. Subjects who are randomised to placebo capsules will receive 30 placebo capsules under direct-observed therapy.</masking_description>

    <measure>Proportion of patients successfully decolonised of CPE intestinal carriage at 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Decolonisation is determined by the following test outcomes:&#xD;
i. Negative PCR result (CP genes undetected) for rectal swab sample subjected to direct PCR (Xpert Carba-R) ii. Negative PCR result (CP genes undetected) for rectal swab sample subjected to culture on ChromID CARBA SMART media followed by PCR for suspected CPE colonies (Xpert Carba-R) iii. Negative PCR result (CP genes undetected) for stool sample subjected to direct PCR (Xpert Carba-R) iv. Negative PCR result (CP genes undetected) for stool sample subjected to culture on ChromID CARBA SMART media followed by PCR for suspected CPE colonies (Xpert Carba-R)&#xD;
At least two of the four tests must be evaluable (clear positive or negative result obtained). Subject not meeting these criteria will be considered not-decolonised.&#xD;
If any one of the PCR results are positive, the subject is considered not-decolonised.</description>
