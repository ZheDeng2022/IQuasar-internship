  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal and early childhood home visits have been proposed as an effective strategy to&#xD;
      improve the health and development of disadvantaged children. In South Korea (hereafter,&#xD;
      Korea), a maternal and early childhood home visit program has been implemented since 2013 in&#xD;
      Seoul, and then was adopted in 2019 by the central government as a national policy for child&#xD;
      health and development. In 2020, a new national home visit program where nurses (with social&#xD;
      workers) make multiple home visits to vulnerable families starting prenatally and continuing&#xD;
      until the child reaches the age of 2 years, was newly developed and launched throughout the&#xD;
      country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled community trial conducted in Korea to examine the&#xD;
      impact of targeted home visits led by nurses in the prenatal and early childhood period on&#xD;
      children's health and development and maternal health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Korea Early Childhood Home-visiting Intervention (KECHI) encompasses 25-29 home visits,&#xD;
      group activities, and community service linkage by social workers from the prenatal period&#xD;
      until the child reaches the age of 2 years; as such, it is a complex intervention involving&#xD;
      various domains to address a wide range of outcomes. Pregnant women with two or more risk&#xD;
      factors who are deemed to have difficulties in raising children are eligible for the targeted&#xD;
      multiple nurse home visits. Each home visit is implemented based on the family's needs, and&#xD;
      individualized interventions are provided to improve parenting and the home environment in&#xD;
      order to promote children's health and development and maternal health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a superiority trial with two parallel groups from pregnancy until the child&#xD;
      reaches 2 years of age. Pregnant women with two or more risk factors will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in the study after they provide informed consent. Participants will then be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the intervention or control group with a 1:1 allocation through an&#xD;
      independent web-based random allocation system. We expect a total of 800 families (400&#xD;
      families in each group) to be recruited. The intervention group will receive the KECHI&#xD;
      program and the control group will receive existing maternal and child health services (usual&#xD;
      care), but not multiple home visits by nurses. Both groups will receive gift cards of 30,000&#xD;
      Korean won (about 27 USD) for each round of surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention and control groups will be surveyed on the outcome variables of home&#xD;
      environment, child development, breastfeeding, maternal health, child hospital visits due to&#xD;
      injuries, and community service linkage at four home visits by trained research nurses at&#xD;
      baseline and at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after birth. Telephone contact will also&#xD;
      be made at 6 weeks and 18 months after birth for both groups. Outcome measurements by&#xD;
      research nurses and data management by statistical analysts will be performed with blinding&#xD;
      regarding the random allocation.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The research management staff, home visit nurses (intervention teams), and study participants will be aware of the allocation results. However, the research nurses making outcome assessments will be blinded to the randomization, and families will be asked not to disclose their group status during the surveys. The research nurses (outcome assessors) will only be notified of the survey schedules (6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months) of both groups so that the outcome indicators can be measured with blinding maintained. Statistical analysts will not be able to access the randomization variable until all 2 years of data are collected.</masking_description>

    <description>The KECHI encompasses 25-29 home visits, group activities, and community service linkage by social workers from the prenatal period until the child reaches the age of 2 years; as such, it is a complex intervention involving various domains to address a wide range of outcomes. Pregnant women with two or more risk factors who are deemed to have difficulties in raising children are eligible for the targeted multiple nurse home visits. Each home visit is implemented based on families' needs, and individualized interventions are provided to improve parenting and the home environment in order to promote the child's health and development and maternal health. The program includes educational materials for parents, such as a booklet covering issues on prenatal care, child development, postnatal child care, parent-child attachment, play, communication, safety, and goal-setting.</description>
