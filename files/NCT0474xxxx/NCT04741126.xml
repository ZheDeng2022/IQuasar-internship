  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effectiveness of manually assisted cough technique on peak cough flow and&#xD;
      pulmonary functions in patients with incomplete cervical spine injury. Previous studies were&#xD;
      designed to target only a small sample. Level and American Spinal Cord Injury Association&#xD;
      (ASIA) scale were not specified so this study covers this aspect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The previous studies show that the partial control of the muscle necessary for cough, which&#xD;
      varies with motor level, proportionately improves the patient's ability to cough&#xD;
      volitionally. Spinal cord injury also affects mucus clearance, the peak flow meter was used&#xD;
      to assist the ability of cough and they also measure the peak cough flow (PFC).In the&#xD;
      literature for the airway clearance, the following techniques were used, incentive&#xD;
      spirometer, balloon, and blowing exercise, manually assisted cough technique active cycle of&#xD;
      breathing exercise, postural drainage, autogenic drainage, positive expiratory pressure.&#xD;
      There is increasing interest in strategies such as interval training that may provide a&#xD;
      tolerable training load while maintaining an effective stimulus for adaptation. Manually&#xD;
      assisted cough technique is used to enhance the cough strength, to help with mucus secretion&#xD;
      it can be carried out in lying, side-lying, or sitting positions.it is important that clear&#xD;
      secretion in order to maintain clear and healthy lungs, the risk of repeated chest infection&#xD;
      and complication can be reduced which improve the quality of life. Manually assisted cough is&#xD;
      a technique using strong arms to assist cough. This may be providing help in neuromuscular&#xD;
      disease or spinal cord injury with weak respiratory and abdominal muscle.&#xD;

    <description>Changes from the baseline will be measured after 4 weeks through a small, hand-held device which is used to monitor a person's ability to breathe out air. It measures the airflow through the bronchi of the lungs and thus indicates the degree of obstruction in the airways. Peak flow readings are higher health airways and decreases in obstructive airways.</description>

The result of the peak cough flow meter and incentive spirometer will be check pre and post only.3 sets will be given in one session and 2-time session will be recommended per day. The session will be given three days in a week. The Result of the Peak Cough flow meter and incentive spirometer will be check pre and post only.</description>
