  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although attention is thought to have a definitive functional role in mindfulness meditation&#xD;
      training and its salutary mechanisms of action, extant empirical evidence is mixed and&#xD;
      limited. In the proposed study, we propose to test whether 6 to 7-days mindfulness meditation&#xD;
      retreats (N=90), relative to a wait-list control condition (N=45), will impact internal&#xD;
      attentional processes or attention to internal experience (e.g., thoughts and bodily&#xD;
      sensations); and whether these internal attentional change processes predict salutary&#xD;
      outcomes of mindfulness meditation retreats. Participants will complete tasks designed to&#xD;
      measure attention to internal experience before and then immediately following the retreat,&#xD;
      as well as self-report measures of salutary outcomes before and 2-weeks post-retreat. Matched&#xD;
      controls will complete the tasks at parallel time-points in the lab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Broadly, the investigators first aim is to assess whether mindfulness meditation retreat will&#xD;
      yield significant improvement at post-relative to pre-retreat, compared to matched control,&#xD;
      in each of these internal attentional processes: (i) enhanced ability to disengage from&#xD;
      negative self-referential thoughts; (ii) reduced selection bias to negative self-referential&#xD;
      thoughts; (iii) enhanced interoceptive attention and sensibility to a broader range of&#xD;
      locations, intensities and hedonic tones of bodily sensations in response to negative and&#xD;
      neutral self-referential thoughts; as well as (iv) enhanced mindful awareness during&#xD;
      mindfulness meditation as expressed in the objects and temporal dynamics of mindful&#xD;
      awareness. Second, the investigators will assess whether each of the aforementioned internal&#xD;
      attentional change processes from pre- to post-retreat, will predict change from pre- to&#xD;
      2-weeks post-retreat in mindful awareness in daily living, mindfulness-related processes&#xD;
      (e.g., decentering), and mental health. Third, investigators will assess whether previous&#xD;
      meditation experience moderates these effects.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Simulated Thought Paradigm - Digit Categorization Task</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Simulated Thought Paradigm integrated into the Digit Categorization Task will be used to measure change, from pre-intervention to post-intervention, in internal attentional disengagement from simulated negative and neutral self-referential thoughts to a digit categorization (odd or even) task. Attentional disengagement will be computed via difference in reaction time to respond to digit target between negative and neutral self-referential thoughts. A positive score reflects greater difficulty to disengage from negative vs. neutral stimuli.</description>
