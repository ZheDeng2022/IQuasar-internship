  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Commercially available fruit juices are obtained after applying industrial technologies to&#xD;
      preserve and extend the shelf-life by inactivation of microorganism and enzymes. These are&#xD;
      traditional thermal treatment (eg. pasteurization, sterilization) that causes losses of&#xD;
      nutritional and bioactive compounds, changes physicochemical properties (colour, flavor and&#xD;
      texture) and can modify their bioavailabilities. Thus, the traditional thermal processing is&#xD;
      being replaced by less intense thermal technologies (e.g. low-temperature pasteurization /&#xD;
      refrigerated storage) and non-thermal treatments such as the high-pressure processing (HPP)&#xD;
      and the pulsed electric fields (PEF) as an alternative to enhace food safety and shelf-life&#xD;
      without compromising organoleptic qualities (retain the flavour, color healthiness of fresh&#xD;
      foods) and keeping their health-promoting capacity. The beneficial health effect derived from&#xD;
      the orange juice intake is partly related to the bioavailability of their bioactive&#xD;
      compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the intake of freshly squeezed orange juice&#xD;
      (Citrus sinensis L.) and processed orange juice elaborated with different treatments (low&#xD;
      pasteurization / refrigerated storage, high-pressure processing, pulsed electric fields) on&#xD;
      the main serum carotenoid concentrations in a cross-over study in apparently healthy subjects&#xD;
      using multiple dosis.&#xD;

      Methods Twelve healthy subjects (6 men), age 20-32 y, were enrolled in a cross-over study, to&#xD;
      consume 500 mL of orange juice/day during 14 days periods. All volunteers consumed the LP and&#xD;
      HPP, six consumed PEF or FS-orange juice. Fasted blood was collected at baseline and on days&#xD;
      7 and 14. Carotenoid concentrations in serum and orange juice were analyzed by high&#xD;
      performance liquid chromatogry (HPLC).&#xD;
