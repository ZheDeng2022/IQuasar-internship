  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy (FA) derives from an abnormal immunological response to dietary antigens. On the&#xD;
      basis of the immunological mechanism, FA are divided into the following forms: IgE-mediated,&#xD;
      non-IgE-mediated and mixed. Prevalence, persistence and severity of pediatric FA have&#xD;
      significantly increased over the past 2 decades. The treatment of FA is based on a rigorous&#xD;
      elimination diet and on the correct management of acute allergic reactions, induced by the&#xD;
      accidental ingestion of food allergens, with antihistamines, cortisones and adrenaline.&#xD;
      Ensuring a strict exclusion of the allergen from the diet can be problematic, with the risk&#xD;
      of nutritional deficiencies, accidental exposure, cross-contamination or caused by incorrect&#xD;
      labeling of processed food products. At the same time, the daily management of a correct&#xD;
      elimination diet and a possible allergic reaction, entail a significant burden and high&#xD;
      levels of anxiety and stress associated with uncertainty about the management of anaphylaxis,&#xD;
      in the parents of children with FA, particularly in mothers, resulting in an impact on&#xD;
      Quality of Life (QoL). The availability of a multidisciplinary team made up of pediatricians,&#xD;
      allergists and dietitians / nutritionists with experience in the field of FA could reduce the&#xD;
      stress and anxiety of parents, while improving their QoL. Currently, for the evaluation of&#xD;
      the quality of life of the parent of a child with AF, specific questionnaires for food&#xD;
      allergies developed and validated in English are used: the food allergy self-efficacy scale&#xD;
      for parents (FASE-P) and the Food Allergy Quality of Life - Parental Burden Questionnaire&#xD;
      (FAQL-PB).&#xD;

    <description>The transversal validation of the Italian version of the scale will be evaluated by calculating the correlation between PHASE-P and FAQLQ-PF.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in QoL in the two cohorts will be evaluated by comparing the mean total scores of the three specific questionnaires for food allergies administered to the patient's mother (PHASE-P, FAQL-PB and FAQLQ-PF) and stratifying according to variables evaluated in the questionnaires and clinical data and demographics present in the patient's medical record.</description>
