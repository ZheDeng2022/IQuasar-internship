      This study is a quasi-experimental between-group design. Using a prospective two-arm&#xD;
      controlled exploratory study, data will be collected on an initial assessment of the effects&#xD;
      of a specific neurological sample after thrombotic infarction (PCA infarction) who lost the&#xD;
      ability to dream due to the infarction (experimental group) compared to a specific&#xD;
      neurological sample after thrombotic infarction (PCA infarction) without loss of the ability&#xD;
      to dream (comparison group) in terms of subjective and objective sleep quality and memory&#xD;
      consolidation. Besides the importance to further elucidate the role of dreaming for sleep&#xD;
      architecture and memory consolidation, the results of the evaluation are of great clinical&#xD;
      relevance in a further scientific investigation regarding the treatment of a specifically&#xD;
      neurological sample with acute thrombotic infarction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the biological function of dreams, which differs from&#xD;
      that of REM (rapid eye-movement) sleep. People spend almost a third of every day asleep.&#xD;
      About a fifth of this time they dream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why do dreams occupy such a significant part of human life? What is the biological function&#xD;
      of dreams? The physiological function of dreaming for humans has been investigated in&#xD;
      extensive studies. However, these are predominantly in the area of memory research and&#xD;
      address the question of whether dreaming is conducive to memory consolidation. However, other&#xD;
      biological functions of dreaming, such as their influence on the restorative effects of&#xD;
      sleep, remain virtually unexplored to date. Therefore, the planned DFG (Deutsche&#xD;
      Forschungsgemeinschaft) study will investigate the effect of dream activity on the objective&#xD;
      and subjective quality of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solms was able to show that damage to the parieto-occipital brain region leads to a complete&#xD;
      loss of dream recall in a large number of clinical cases (in 44 of 361 cases). This discovery&#xD;
      holds the possibility of relating the biological function of dreaming to neuroanatomical&#xD;
      structures. Obviously, the loss of dream memory must be related to the specific damage of the&#xD;
      brain, or its biological functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further studies also show that acute thrombotic infarction of the occipital lobe in the&#xD;
      current area of the posterior cerebral artery can lead to complete loss of dream activity&#xD;
      with simultaneous maintenance of REM sleep. The authors Bischof &amp; Bassetti noticed, seemingly&#xD;
      by chance and without grasping the theoretical implications of the discovery, that their&#xD;
      patient was suffering from insomnia with difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these observations, Solms conducted a pilot study comparing the sleep patterns of&#xD;
      five dreaming and five nondreaming patients with thrombotic infarcts in the same arterial&#xD;
      territory-as observed by Bischof &amp; Bassetti . Solms and his research group observed that&#xD;
      within the non-dreaming group there was a striking decrease in absolute sleep duration, as&#xD;
      well as a more frequent number of nocturnal awakenings, more arousals, as well as&#xD;
      microarousals (previously unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of populations that have forfeited the ability to dream with preserved REM sleep&#xD;
      makes it possible to test not only the classical theory on the function of dreams, but also&#xD;
      such theories that deal with the role of dreams in memory consolidation during sleep. In&#xD;
      recent years, there has been increased interest in the hypothesis that sleep contributes to&#xD;
      and significantly influences memory processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, dreaming is postulated to play a specific role in memory processing during&#xD;
      sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several hypotheses regarding the role of dreaming in memory consolidation. For&#xD;
      example, Stickgold et al. found that during REM sleep, limbic forebrain structures are&#xD;
      activated along with the amygdala, while there is concomitant inhibition of hippocampal&#xD;
      signalling, which presumably prevents re-activation of episodic memory content. Accordingly,&#xD;
      dreams would mainly occur via weak neocortical associations available during REM sleep. The&#xD;
      authors hypothesize that this feature reflects the brain's attempts to recognize and evaluate&#xD;
      new cortical associations in the context of emotions mediated by limbic structures. They&#xD;
      concluded that one function of REM sleep was to enhance or attenuate specifically activated&#xD;
      associations with regression to pictorial imaginings to compensate for the relative loss of&#xD;
      motor activity during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, it has been postulated that the occurrence of memories in dreams promotes learning&#xD;
      by, first, reactivating memory elements in their original perceptual state and, second, that&#xD;
      linking a wide variety of memory elements strengthens and consolidates them and, third, that&#xD;
      dreaming newly learned material facilitates later recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance and research questions of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through a specific choice of sample of neurological patients with posterior cortical lesions&#xD;
      who are at risk of losing the ability to dream due to the lesion, the proposed project is&#xD;
      particularly aimed at understanding the biological function of dreaming as distinct from REM&#xD;
      sleep. Based on the neuropsychoanalytic theory of Solms, as well as neuropsychological&#xD;
      findings that REM sleep and dreaming are doubly dissociable phenomena, the central hypothesis&#xD;
      that dreams serve to maintain sleep (Sigmund Freud's hypothesis) will be investigated. By&#xD;
      this, Freud meant that dreams serve to respond to sometimes highly affect-laden impulses to&#xD;
      action with hallucinatory wish fulfillment, so that they do not lead to premature awakening.&#xD;
      Secondly, it will be investigated whether dreams influence affective memory consolidation.&#xD;
      This will be investigated using two groups of neurological patients with thrombotic&#xD;
      infarction in the posterior stream area, i.e., the posterior cerebral artery (PCA infarction)&#xD;
      during preserved REM sleep (i) who have lost the ability to recall dreams, and (ii) in whom&#xD;
      the ability to recall dreams has been preserved. This has far-reaching implications not only&#xD;
      for sleep medicine and neuroscience, but also for clinical neurology. Sleep pathologies have&#xD;
      not yet been considered clinically-scientifically as a consequence of PCA infarction and,&#xD;
      accordingly, have not yet been studied, but could provide significant clues for the clinical&#xD;
      management of such patients. Similarly, findings on memory consolidation after PCA infarction&#xD;
      during preserved REM sleep are significant because an important aspect of memory processing&#xD;
      during sleep is examined with the distinction between preserved and nonsustained dreaming,&#xD;
      which also has not been considered in scientific studies to date but is of clinical&#xD;
      relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses Our hypotheses are that patients who have lost the ability to dream during&#xD;
      preserved REM sleep will have (i) poorer sleep quality and (ii) poorer emotional declarative&#xD;
      memory and non-declarative motor memory consolidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-dreamers vs. dreamers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis (H0):&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no difference in terms of loss of ability to dream during preserved REM sleep,&#xD;
      related to poorer sleep quality, as well as poorer emotional declarative and non-declarative&#xD;
      motor memory consolidation between the experimental group and the comparison group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis (H1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a difference in loss of ability to dream with preserved REM sleep related to worse&#xD;
      sleep quality and worse emotional declarative and non-declarative motor memory consolidation&#xD;
      between experimental group and comparison group&#xD;
