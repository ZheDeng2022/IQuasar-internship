      A Phase 2 study investigating the addition of cRIT 131I-omburtamab to irinotecan,&#xD;
      temozolomide, and bevacizumab for patients with recurrent medulloblastoma. A feasibility&#xD;
      cohort is included to assess the feasibility of incorporating cRIT 131I-omburtamab for&#xD;
      patients with recurrent ependymoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct intraventricular delivery of radiolabeled tumor-specific antibodies may aid in both&#xD;
      the detection and treatment of recurrent disease for these highly specific pediatric patients&#xD;
      with recurrent tumors.&#xD;

      Stratum 1: This is a phase 2 single-arm open-label study that will define event-free survival&#xD;
      (EFS) and overall survival (OS) following therapy with irinotecan, temozolomide, bevacizumab,&#xD;
      and compartmental (intraOmmaya) radioimmunotherapy (cRIT) 131I-omburtamab in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent medulloblastoma. Patients with recurrent medulloblastoma will undergo surgery if&#xD;
      feasible prior to study entry, followed by Induction Chemotherapy with irinotecan,&#xD;
      temozolomide, and bevacizumab on study as per the Children's Oncology Group (COG) trial&#xD;
      ACNS0821. Following 2 or 4 courses of chemotherapy and if radiographic disease status is&#xD;
      stable or improved, patients may continue to Radioimmunotherapy to receive 2 therapeutic&#xD;
      doses (50 mCi each) of cRIT 131I-omburtamab. Following Radioimmunotherapy, patients may&#xD;
      resume to Maintenance Chemotherapy with irinotecan, temozolomide, and bevacizumab for up to&#xD;
      12 total courses of chemotherapy or until disease progression, whichever occurs sooner. The&#xD;
      primary comparison for this study will be the medulloblastoma cohort treated on ACNS0821 on&#xD;
      the irinotecan + temozolomide + bevacizumab arm (N=52).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum 2: This is a feasibility cohort. The primary objective is to assess feasibility of&#xD;
      incorporating cRIT 131I-omburtamab for patients with recurrent ependymoma and to assess&#xD;
      dosimetry. Patients must have progressed after initial surgery, radiation therapy, or other&#xD;
      therapies. Patients will undergo surgery (if feasible) prior to study entry with the goal of&#xD;
      achieving stable or better disease. Tumors (archived or new) will be tested for B7H3 prior to&#xD;
      enrollment. If positive, patients will enroll on Stratum 2 and receive one dosimetry dose (2&#xD;
      mCi) of cRIT 131I-omburtamab with nuclear medicine scintigraphy using SPECT during the&#xD;
      Dosimetry Course (14 days in length). Following the Dosimetry Course and within 2 weeks of&#xD;
      the dosimetry dose, patients may continue to Radioimmunotherapy to receive 2 therapeutic&#xD;
      doses (50 mCi each) of cRIT 131I-omburtamab.&#xD;

             underlying medical conditions or declined by patient/family. Patients must have&#xD;
             experienced no more than two recurrences of medulloblastoma or have refractory&#xD;

             any acute toxicity potentially related to the agent and received their last dose of&#xD;
             the investigational or biologic agent ≥ 7 days prior to study enrollment. For agents&#xD;
             that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this&#xD;
             period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known to&#xD;
             occur.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Craniospinal irradiation, whole brain radiation, total body irradiation, or&#xD;
                  radiation to &gt;= 50% of pelvis or spine 24 weeks prior to study enrollment. Tumor&#xD;
                  designated as &quot;measurable&quot; for protocol purposes must not have received radiation&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with neurological deficits should have deficits stable for a minimum of 1&#xD;
             week prior to enrollment. A baseline detailed neurological exam should clearly&#xD;
