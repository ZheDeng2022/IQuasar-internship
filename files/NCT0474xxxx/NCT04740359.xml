      The study is to examine the effect of functional trunk training on trunk control and upper&#xD;
      extremity functions in patients with autosomal recessive ataxia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary ataxias are a group of genetic diseases characterized by slow progressive gait&#xD;
      disturbance. In addition, coordination disorders can be seen in extremities, speech and eye&#xD;
      movements. Atrophy is common in the cerebellum. Friedreich's ataxia, ataxia telangiectasia,&#xD;
      ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, infantile-onset spinocerebellar atrophy and&#xD;
      Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome are autosomal recessive hereditary ataxias. The constant main sign&#xD;
      of autosomal recessive ataxia is progressive ataxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trunk has an important role on dynamic stabilization for postural reactions and limb&#xD;
      movements. A good trunk support enables movements in other parts of the body to occur more&#xD;
      regularly. Trunk stabilization is important to support upper and lower extremity movements,&#xD;
      to meet the loads, and to protect the spinal cord. The relationship between upper extremity&#xD;
      function, daily living activities and trunk functions has been emphasized in many studies but&#xD;
      comparative studies about the rehabilitation were very less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to evaluate the effect o functional trunk training in patients with autosomal&#xD;
      recessive ataxia.&#xD;

The strengthening exercises were applied on the mat (3x10 for the first 4 weeks and 3x15 repetition for the last 4 weeks). Eyes open-closed perturbation training was performed for trunk control in sitting and standing positions (10 min.).</description>
