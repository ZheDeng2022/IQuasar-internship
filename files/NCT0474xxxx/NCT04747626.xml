  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-center, non-blind, non-randomized safety and feasibility study of the&#xD;
      hybrid repair of thoracic aortic pathologies requiring repair of the aortic arch proximal to&#xD;
      the origin of innominate artery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) is to assess the safety and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of the simplified hybrid frozen elephant trunk repair technique Branched&#xD;
      Stented Anastamosis Frozen Elephant Trunk Repair (B-SAFER) which involves a physician&#xD;
      modified endovascular stentgraft to treat the proximal aorta in subjects with aortic disease&#xD;
      involving multiple segments. The study will also evaluate the device functionality when using&#xD;
      this operative technique for device implantation including multiple components.&#xD;
