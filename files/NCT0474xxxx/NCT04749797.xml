    <textblock>
      This study compares the standard of care to the standard of care plus the administration of&#xD;
      bupivacaine or liposomal bupivacaine in patients receiving craniotomies.&#xD;

      Objective: To assess the effectiveness of analgesia by scalp nerve block with various agents&#xD;
      in the first 72 hours following elective craniotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will employ a randomized, single-blinded, prospective study design.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized 1:1:1 into one of three treatment groups: Bupivacaine,&#xD;
      Liposomal Bupivacaine, and Saline.&#xD;

    <masking_description>On the morning of the procedure, participants will be assigned sequentially to the lowest unassigned randomization number. The surgeon performing the procedure and operating room staff will not be blinded to the intervention, since they will see whether the patient is receiving liposomal bupivacaine, bupivacaine or saline. However, all providers obtaining post-operative data from the patients will be blinded as to which treatment the patient received, in addition to the patient themselves.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the effectiveness of analgesia by scalp nerve block with various agents in the first 72 hours following elective craniotomy.</measure>
    <time_frame>48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Glasgow Coma score (GCS) (Teasdale &amp; Jennett, 1974) will also be assessed at the above time points. Patients with GCS verbal score of &lt;4 will be excluded from statistical analysis because of inability to respond to questions after extubation.&#xD;
The cumulative doses of narcotics during this time period will also be measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total narcotic usage, GCS and ICU length of stay</measure>
    <time_frame>48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome variables are the subjects' cumulative narcotic requirement, Glasgow Coma Score, the duration of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), the duration of time in the hospital until discharge, and the duration of time from the end of surgery to the first administration of narcotic analgesic. This will be obtained from the medical record.</description>

    <description>The surgeon will administer injectable saline as a cranial block according to a technique previously described by Pinosky et al (Pinosky et al., 1996). The supraorbital, supratrochlear, zygomaticotemporal, auriculotemporal, postauricular lesser and greater occipital nerve branches on the ipsilateral side of the operation will be blocked with 5-10 cc of solution (with a maximum of 60 cc at all sites) by needle infiltration. This process generally takes 1-2 minutes. Following this, the general anesthesia is lightened and the patient is extubated in usual fashion.</description>

    <description>The surgeon will administer Exparel (liposomal bupivacine) as a cranial block according to a technique previously described by Pinosky et al (Pinosky et al., 1996). 20 mL of Exparel will be diluted with saline to constitute 60 mL total. The supraorbital, supratrochlear, zygomaticotemporal, auriculotemporal, postauricular lesser and greater occipital nerve branches on the ipsilateral side of the operation will be blocked with 5-10 cc of solution (with a maximum of 60 cc at all sites) by needle infiltration.
