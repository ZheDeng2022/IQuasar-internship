  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a life threatening condition. In PH, pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension (PAH) and chronic thrombo-embolic chronic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) are two&#xD;
      rare diseases requiring specific and complex drug management. In France ,a part of these&#xD;
      treatments ,only available in hospital pharmacies, are generally unknown from community&#xD;
      health care professionals despite the high risk of drug-interactions and side effects.&#xD;
      Anticipating medication errors at the begging of the disease is therefore important, and&#xD;
      could be done through medication reconciliation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medication reconciliation (MR) will be done for patients hospitalized in the French referral&#xD;
      center for PH for PAH or CTEPH. Detected medication errors will be tracked and fixed by the&#xD;
      physician before the end of hospitalization. A synthesis of new/stopped and modified&#xD;
      treatments will be given to the patient as well as his related healthcare professionals&#xD;
      (community pharmacist and general practioner) to ensure the maintaining of the new&#xD;
      therapeutic management and the understanding of drugs modification. To compare the potential&#xD;
      decrease of medication errors promoted by MR, a retrospective MR will be also done for&#xD;
      patients without MR at 1st hospitalization but at the next one (3 to 6 months after).&#xD;

    <description>MR will be performed directly upon entering the patient's hospital for a first PAH or HTP-Thrombo embolic assessment, just after inclusion. Information regarding the treatments taken by the patient at the time of admission will be retrieved. The entry medication assessment will then be compared with the first medical prescription in order to identify whether medications have been forgotten, prescribed at a different dosage or prescribed when not indicated, etc. All of these differences will be considered medication errors if the reason for the discrepancy is not entered in the patient medical file.</description>

    <description>After inclusion of the patient, the MR will be carried out retrospectively, that is to say that the information concerning the treatments taken by the patient at the time of the first assessment will be retrieved during the period of the first reassessment (therefore with a delay of 3 to 6 months depending on the deadline for the first assessment). All these discrepancies will be considered medication errors if the reason for the discrepancy was not entered in the patient's computerized medical record (IMR).</description>
