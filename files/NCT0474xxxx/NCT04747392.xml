  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, open label, single-dose, the original drug controlled,&#xD;
      crossover design, two sequence, two periods, Phase Ⅰclinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      64 qualified subjects will be randomly assigned to two administration sequences (sequence A&#xD;
      and sequence B) at the ratio of 1∶1, with 32 subjects in each sequence. Each period will be&#xD;
      given subcutaneous injection once, and the washout period will be 72 hours, and each subject&#xD;
      will be given subcutaneous injection twice. Sequence A: the test drug (SAL001) is injected in&#xD;
      the first period, and the reference drug (FORSTEO) is injected in the second period. Sequence&#xD;
      B: the reference drug (FORSTEO) is injected in the first period, and the test drug (SAL001)&#xD;
      is injected in the second period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the geometric mean ratio (GMR) 90% confidence interval of the major pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      indexes (AUC0-t, Cmax) for SAL001 and FORSTEO is between 80.00% and 125.00%, the two drugs&#xD;
      are considered to be bioequivalent.&#xD;
