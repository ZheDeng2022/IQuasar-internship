  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the present study is to compare the effect of a 12-week physical activity&#xD;
      program on body weight gain and body composition changes between normal weight and&#xD;
      constitutionally lean individuals. The second objective will be to question the potential&#xD;
      additional effect of a protein supplementation coupled to the physical training intervention&#xD;
      on body wright and body composition in constitutionally lean women.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a medical inclusion visit, the participants will realize a maximal aerobic test at the&#xD;
      university hospital as well as a body composition analysis, a blood sample will be taken,&#xD;
      their resting metabolic rate will be assessed as well as their energy metabolism during a&#xD;
      rectangular cycling exercise. Their muscle strength and architecture will be assessed. Their&#xD;
      energy intake and eating habits will also be assessed as well as their diet-induced&#xD;
      thermogenesis in response to a fixed and an ad libitum meal. Their sleep metabolism will also&#xD;
      be assessed using the Dreem technology. Questionnaires will be used to evaluate their daily&#xD;
      free living energy intake and accelerometers used to assess their daily physical activity&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will then perform a 12-week physical activity intervention with 15 of the 30&#xD;
      constitutionally lean one receiving a protein supplementation (randomly assigned). All the&#xD;
      measures will be replicated at the end of the intervention as well as 6 weeks after&#xD;
