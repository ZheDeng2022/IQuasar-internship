  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of muscle energy technique on Femoral meralgia paraesthesia in a&#xD;
      postpartum female. BACKGROUND: meralgia paraesthesia is one of the serious disorders in the&#xD;
      postpartum female which results in pain and less physical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ………HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      muscle energy technique will have a significant effect on Femoral meralgia paraesthesia in&#xD;
      postpartum female&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty meralgia paraesthesia postpartum females will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will randomly be divided into two equal groups; the control group received the&#xD;
      conventional selected exercise program and the study group received the same exercise&#xD;
      training program in addition to muscle energy technique, three times per week for four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation methods by Femoral nerve conduction velocity will be measured via the&#xD;
      Neuropack S1 MEB9004 EMG device before the exercise program and after finishing the exercise&#xD;
      program, and also the Pelvic compression test and Pain numeric rating scale&#xD;
