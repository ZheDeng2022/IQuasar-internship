  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The realization of this project will generate an important advance in knowledge regarding one&#xD;
      of the most important comorbidities in cancer patients: malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, comprehensive treatments of cancer patients recognize the importance of the&#xD;
      assessment of nutritional status, and the impact it has on the prognosis, quality of life and&#xD;
      toxicity generated by cancer treatment. Due to this, it is imperative to offer diagnostic&#xD;
      tools that identify patients in a timely manner and, in addition to this, offer therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies for the improvement of nutritional status, in an adjuvant manner to their&#xD;
      oncological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is widely recognized that the cachexia-anorexia syndrome (CACS) is present in 30 to 80% of&#xD;
      cases in cancer patients and this proportion increases as the disease progresses, with weight&#xD;
      loss being a powerful predictor of shorter survival. Unfortunately, current therapies&#xD;
      available to treat anorexia and / or cancer-associated cachexia offer only partial results,&#xD;
      mainly because the intervention is late and the development of an earlier and more effective&#xD;
      intervention is still sought. Mirtazapine has recently gained attention not only because of&#xD;
      its antidepressant effect, but also because of its potential benefit in patients with&#xD;
      anorexia and weight loss, recently reported in a phase II study. Therefore, it is important&#xD;
      to continue its evaluation through a randomized, double-blind clinical trial in which the&#xD;
      effect of mirtazapine is compared and it is determined if it is superior compared to placebo&#xD;
      to increase appetite in patients with NSCLC who present with anorexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of strategy is a relevant therapeutic option in those patients in whom nutritional&#xD;
      counseling by itself is not sufficient to counteract the damage caused by anorexia and to&#xD;
      cope with or prevent the development of cachexia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Mexico and the world. One of the&#xD;
      comorbidities most commonly associated with this type of malignancy is malnutrition, which&#xD;
      occurs in approximately 40-50% of newly diagnosed cases. In addition to its high incidence,&#xD;
      malnutrition in patients with cancer is of great relevance due to the negative effect that&#xD;
      this entails on the quality of life and the prognosis of patients, as well as the increase in&#xD;
      toxicity associated with oncological treatment. Malnutrition is a pathological state in which&#xD;
      the deficiency in the adequate contribution of energy contributes to its development,&#xD;
      producing a systemic catabolic state; Its etiology is variable, however, in most patients&#xD;
      malnutrition is associated with a lack of appetite, which is called anorexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic antidepressant which has been widely used for the treatment of&#xD;
      depression. Several clinical studies have proven its efficacy in this indication, with more&#xD;
      than 5000 patients endorsing its clinical effect compared to placebo, other tetracyclic&#xD;
      antidepressants and trazodone. In addition to its effect on mood, it has been observed that&#xD;
      mirtazapine, used in standard doses, induces weight gain, increasing appetite and food&#xD;
      consumption compared to patients receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increase in appetite with consequent weight gain and increased food intake may be due to&#xD;
      the blocking of 5HT1b, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, H1 receptors, involved in the regulation of appetite. A&#xD;
      pilot study of 2 doses of mirtazapine (15 or 30 mg per day) in ambulatory cancer patients&#xD;
      with pain and other discomforts suggests that it provides a significant improvement in&#xD;
      quality of life, particularly in weight and energy intake. Recently, another phase II study&#xD;
      observed that 57% of oncology patients, ambulatory, non-depressed, increased their appetite&#xD;
      and body weight when treated with mirtazapine for 4 weeks. Despite these encouraging data,&#xD;
      the study included a small sample of patients, so it is not possible to generate robust&#xD;
      conclusions from these data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to conduct a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the effect of Mirtazapine on appetite, nutritional status and quality of&#xD;
      life in patients with anorexia associated with lung cancer. The sample would include 86&#xD;
      patients, 43 patients with Mirtazapine and 43 sith placebo for 8 weeks, with an inducing dose&#xD;
      of 15 mg to a máximum of 30 mg. The methodology for conducting this study consists of&#xD;
      recruiting patients diagnosed with anorexia according to the anorexia-cachexia (ACS) scale,&#xD;
      which has a cut-off point specifically validated for lung cáncer. Once the patient is&#xD;
      selected, they are invited to participate in the study and an informed consent is requested.&#xD;
      Subsequently a subjective global evaluation is performed, a 24-hour reminder of energy&#xD;
      consumption, evaluation of anthropometric measures (weight, height,% weight loss, body mass&#xD;
      index), evaluation of body composition (% fat, fat-free mass and phase angle), common&#xD;
      gastrointestinal adverse effects of chemotherapy according to CTCAE, an evaluation of anxiety&#xD;
      and depression (HADS) , as well as determination of quality of life through the questionnaire&#xD;
      &quot;The European organization for research and treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
      (QLQ) -C30 and (QLQ) LC-13&quot;, validated for Mexican population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All determinations will be made at baseline, at 4 and at 8 weeks. All the variables are going&#xD;
      to be evaluated inside each groups and between groups. It´s going to be considered&#xD;
      significant p ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
