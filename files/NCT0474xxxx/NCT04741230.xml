  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cornea ectatic conditions such as keratoconus and post-LASIK (Laser In situ Keratomileusis)&#xD;
      ectasia are disorders of the eye that are notorious for its uncontrolled progression over&#xD;
      time, leading to loss of vision. There are valuable treatment options for controlling disease&#xD;
      progression in mild to moderate stages of such disease. However in advanced cases and / or&#xD;
      when contact lenses cannot be worn, surgery remains the only treatment option to rehabilitate&#xD;
      vision. Most treatment options are highly invasive and represent significant risks. This&#xD;
      study evaluates a novel corneal implant, Gebauer™ Lenticule to treat severe keratoconus or&#xD;
      post-LASIK ectasia. This implant is derived from porcine collagen and intended for&#xD;
      intra-stromal insertion. The Gebauer™ Lenticule is expected to improve the stability of the&#xD;
      cornea while not impairing the vision. The procedure is an additive procedure after other&#xD;
      treatment options have been exhausted. The procedure is reversible with removal of the&#xD;
      implant (in the unexpected case of an adverse reaction), and vision may be restored to&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well the implant is tolerated, it's safety&#xD;
      profile, and how effective this new treatment option is in the treatment of keratoconus or&#xD;
      post-LASIK ectasia.&#xD;

    <description>The Gebauer™ Lenticule corneal implant device is a custom-made device intended for patients suffering from keratoconus or post-LASIK ectasia. The device is expected to reinforce and stabilize the patient's cornea, so that a more consistent refraction is induced and a penetrating human cornea donor transplantation may be avoided or postponed.</description>
