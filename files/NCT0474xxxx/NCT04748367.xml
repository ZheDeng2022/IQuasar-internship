  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paediatric immunization is often associated with significant fear and anxiety among children&#xD;
      and their parents. Their distress can greatly affect their future adherence to the&#xD;
      immunization schedule and the acceptance of recommended vaccines by physicians. This pilot&#xD;
      was a single-centre, open label, randomised controlled trial to examine the use of VR&#xD;
      analgesia in childhood immunization in primary care.The study primarily aimed to determine&#xD;
      the feasibility of using immersive virtual reality (VR) during immunization in children by&#xD;
      assessing the response rate of the participants during recruitment. The secondary outcome of&#xD;
      the study was to determine the effectiveness of immersive VR in alleviating pain and anxiety&#xD;
      among children during immunization compared to usual care without VR. It also aimed to&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of immersive VR in reducing anxiety among the parents and nurses&#xD;
      during immunization procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study primarily aimed to determine the feasibility of using immersive VR during&#xD;
      immunization in children. The response rate of the recruitment was the feasibility assessment&#xD;
      on whether children and parents were acceptable to the VR usage during immunization. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome mainly focused on the clinical and safety outcomes of using immersive VR&#xD;
      during immunization in preparation towards a larger randomized control trial. The secondary&#xD;
      outcome of the study was the change in children's pain and anxiety scores using the Faces&#xD;
      Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) and Children's Fear Scale (CFS) pre- and post-immunization. The&#xD;
      other secondary outcome were the change in parent's and nurse's anxiety score using the&#xD;
      Anxiety visual analogue scale (VAS).The nurses' acceptability, simplicity and willingness to&#xD;
      use VR during immunization were also assessed in the study. Adverse events such as premature&#xD;
      termination due to VR side effects in the children were also reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot was a single-centre, open label, randomised controlled trial that was&#xD;
      conceptualized as a proof of concept study to examine the use of VR analgesia in childhood&#xD;
      immunization in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting and Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted at a regional public primary care clinic (polyclinic) in Sengkang,&#xD;
      which serves a population of about 240,000 inhabitants - of which children under the age of 9&#xD;
      years old account for 14.5% of them (second highest paediatric population in Singapore).The&#xD;
      study populations included multi-ethnic Asian children aged 4 to 10 years, their parents and&#xD;
      the registered nurses who administered their immunization at the polyclinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Julious SA recommends a sample size of 12 per group as a rule of thumb for a pilot study. We&#xD;
      recruited 30 children for this pilot study, with 15 in the intervention group (VR) and 15 in&#xD;
      the control group to allow for estimated 3 children who may fail to use the VR during the&#xD;
      immunization for whatever reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was performed a-priori using a computer generated randomization system. The&#xD;
      randomization sequences were concealed in a numbered, opaque envelope. Blinding of the&#xD;
      subject was not possible in this study due to the nature of the intervention. After obtaining&#xD;
      the consent and assent, the study team member retrieved the randomization envelopes to reveal&#xD;
      the group assigned to the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrument to assess feasibility outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response rate of the recruitment of children and parents on this study was assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments to assess clinical outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are various self-reported measurement tools for pain assessment in children. We&#xD;
      selected the FPS-R scale which is a validated and well-established psychometric test,&#xD;
      recommended by various literature and International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP).&#xD;
      FPS-R has strong positive correlations with the visual analogue scale (VAS) across the age of&#xD;
      4-16 years old.To date, there is no gold standard self-reported tools to measure children's&#xD;
      anxiety during a needle procedure. We used the Children's Fear Scale (CFS) which was adapted&#xD;
      from Faces Anxiety Scale that originally used in adult. Support was found for construct&#xD;
      validity, test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability for CFS during needle procedure&#xD;
      among children. Anxiety VAS was used to assess anxiety in parents and nurses. The nurses'&#xD;
      acceptability, simplicity and willingness to use VR during immunization were also assessed in&#xD;
      the study, using a scale of 1 to 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VR equipment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VR equipment comprises an Oculus Quest headset (Facebook Technologies) which measures 8.7&#xD;
      x 7.6 x 4.1 inches and weighs 0.57kg. The field of angle is 100Â° with adjustable&#xD;
      inter-pupil-distance (IPD) ranging from 58 to 72mm. The VR headset has an adjustable strap&#xD;
      which can fit various head sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VR software:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence suggests that if the VR environment is individually tailored to user's age, gender,&#xD;
      ethnicity, the VR analgesic effect will be enhanced. The VR software named SILVER (Soothing&#xD;
      Immunization Leveraging on Virtual Reality Experience) was co-created by the two&#xD;
      investigators with software engineers and virtual artist team from Yoozoo Games Co., Ltd in&#xD;
      Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical research coordinator (CRC) screened the appointment list of eligible children&#xD;
      scheduled for their influenza or other childhood immunizations at the study site. When the&#xD;
      child turned up for their immunization appointment, the CRC provided the parent or legal&#xD;
      guardian with the study information and clarified their doubts before seeking their consent.&#xD;
      They also spoke to the child on the potential use of the gadget used in the VR to seek their&#xD;
      assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent from the parent or legal guardian and assent from children were&#xD;
      obtained prior to their study enrolment. The registered nurses involved also endorsed their&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study. The study was conducted from September to December 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children in both groups rated their anticipatory pain score using the FPS-R scale and&#xD;
      their anticipatory anxiety score using CFS. Their parents and respective attending nurses&#xD;
      rated their anticipatory anxiety level using the Anxiety VAS before the immunization. The&#xD;
      immunization room is cleared of any audio-visual equipment as a distraction in immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After revealing the allocation, the children allocated to the intervention group were briefed&#xD;
      on the cartoon animation before they don the head-set. After the children entered the&#xD;
      immunization room, the attending nurses completed their pre-procedure anxiety level using&#xD;
      Anxiety VAS. The children donned the VR headset and viewed the VR animation. The animation&#xD;
      can be viewed by the attending nurse via a tablet. At a specific juncture during the VR&#xD;
      animation, the nurse administered the vaccine to the child. The duration of the storyline is&#xD;
      about 2 minutes. At the end of each immunization, the VR headset will be cleaned and&#xD;
      sanitized with standard infection control procedure in our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children in control group underwent immunization as per usual care following our&#xD;
      institution standard operating protocol. The nurse explained the immunization procedure to&#xD;
      parents and children before the administration of the vaccine. The children in control group&#xD;
      were not forbidden to use any distractions during immunization. Parents or additional nurses&#xD;
      might be instructed to hold the child during the immunization procedure depending on the&#xD;
      children's anxiety level to ensure accurate administration of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 25.0. Both Intention to treat (ITT) and&#xD;
      Per Protocol (PP) analysis were performed. Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the&#xD;
      difference in the change in anxiety and pain score in children, change in nurse's anxiety&#xD;
      assessment and change in parent's anxiety assessment. Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test&#xD;
      were used to assess the difference in the demographics of the two groups. Wilcoxon signed&#xD;
      rank test was used to assess the difference in the nurses' experience of using the VR&#xD;
      application. A p-value of less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.&#xD;
