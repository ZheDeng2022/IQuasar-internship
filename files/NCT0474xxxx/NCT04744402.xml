      This open-label, phase 2 study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      pellet-type extracellular matrix-associated autologous chondrocytes (CartiLife®) compared&#xD;
      with microfracture surgery in adults with articular cartilage defects due to trauma or&#xD;
      degeneration of the knee. It is hypothesized that CartiLife® treatment will demonstrate&#xD;
      structural regeneration and improvement in function and pain at Week 48 compared to baseline.&#xD;

    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) is a widely used, proprietary set of standardized questionnaires used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints (Jose M. 2006).

    <time_frame>Week 24 and 48 (post-operation)</time_frame>
    <description>MOCART provides a reliable, reproducible, and accurate method of assessment of cartilage repair tissue. The total score is determined by adding the following subscale scores :&#xD;
Volume fill of cartilage defect (0~20 points, 20:Complete filling, 0:&lt;25% filling of total defect volume)&#xD;
Integration into adjacent cartilage (0~15 points, 15:Complete integration, 0:Integrated cartilage interface ≥50% of repair tissue length)&#xD;
Surface of the repair tissue (0~10 points, 10:Surface intact, 0:≥50% surface irregularity)&#xD;
Structure of the repair tissue (0~10 points, 10:Homogenous, 0:Inhomogenous)&#xD;
Signal intensity of the repair tissue (0~15 points, 15:Normal, 0:Severely abnormal)&#xD;
Bony defect or bony overgrowth (0~10 points, 10:No bony defect or overgrowth, 0:Bony defect, depth ≥ thickness or overgrowth ≥50% of adjacent cartilage)&#xD;
Subchondral changes (0 ~ 20 points, 20:No major changes, 0:Subchondral cyst ≥5 mm in longest diameter OR osteonecrosis-like signal)</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of T2 mapping</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24 and 48 (post-operation)</time_frame>
    <description>In vivo, the visualization of collagen architecture, and possibly the maturation of this architecture over time in cartilage repair tissue, can be seen when assessing the spatial variation of T2 values. Histologically validated animal studies report this increase in zonal T2 as an indicator of hyaline or ''hyaline-like'' cartilage composition. T2 evaluation is more sensitive in revealing changes in articular cartilage and cartilage repair tissue compared to morphological analysis using thickness measurements or the MOCART score.
