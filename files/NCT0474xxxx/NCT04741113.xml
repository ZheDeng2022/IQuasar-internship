  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although scientific bodies have recognized obesity as a disease, obese people are often&#xD;
      stigmatized, facing discrimination, and accusations that they are responsible to their&#xD;
      condition due to their lack of willpower by healthcare professionals. However, experimental&#xD;
      research to reduce weight bias among healthcare professionals is lacking, and published&#xD;
      studies to date are methodologically flawed, including lack of randomization, lack of control&#xD;
      group and small sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to evaluate the effect of a comprehensive online education module on&#xD;
      knowledge about obesity and weight bias in a convenience sample in a private hospital&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an interventional study conducted among all Assuta Medical Centers healthcare&#xD;
      employees including physicians, bariatric surgeons, nurses, dietitians, social workers,&#xD;
      physiotherapists, pharmacists, imaging department technicians, laboratory workers, patient&#xD;
      services assistants and medical secretariats. Participants who will confirm their consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study, will be randomized into two arms: intervention vs. control (with no&#xD;
      intervention). The study intervention will include an online 15-minute educational module&#xD;
      which will be based on relevant literature and expert opinion and will include four sections:&#xD;
      a) Knowledge about obesity; b) Weight bias definition and impact; c) Strategies to reduce&#xD;
      weight bias; d) A short quiz. At baseline, one week and one-month post intervention, both&#xD;
      groups will respond to an anonymous on-line survey on knowledge about obesity and weight&#xD;
      stigma. Moreover, data on demographic parameters of study participants will be collected.&#xD;
