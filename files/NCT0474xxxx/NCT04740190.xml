  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In view of the strong biological rationale of employing PARP inhibition in high grade glioma,&#xD;
      the current study purposes testing of talazoparib in a biomarker-enriched group of glioma.&#xD;
      Carboplatin will be added to sensitize the tumor to PARP inhibition, and low dose radiation&#xD;
      therapy will be applied to increase talazoparib drug penetration through blood-brain barrier.&#xD;
      The goal is to estimate the effect size of such combinational treatment approach in recurrent&#xD;
      high-grade glioma with DNA damage repair deficiency (dDDR)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent high grade glioma with dDDR, defined by genomic aberrations associated including&#xD;
      IDH mutation, PTEN mutation and &quot;BRCAness&quot; signature as defined by next-generation-sequencing&#xD;
      (NGS) based comprehensive genomic profiling, will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment in 7-day cycle. D1-4: Oral talazoparib 0.75mg daily; D1:&#xD;
      Carboplatin (AUC 1.5). On cycle 1 day 1 low dose whole radiation radiation therapy will be&#xD;
      given to increase drug penetration. Primary outcome is 6-month progression free survival&#xD;
      (PFS-6) by RANO criteria. The study intended to recruit 33 subjects&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histopathologically proven diagnosis of WHO grade 3-4 glioma&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Tumor with one or more putatively pathogenic mutations or homozygous deletion in the&#xD;
             genes associated with DDR or genomic instability, as listed below, will be eligible&#xD;
             for the study. Genetic analysis on tumor tissue should be performed with&#xD;
             next-generation-sequencing (NGS) based analysis to screen for the following genomic&#xD;
             aberrations, which included,&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. IDH mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. PTEN mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. &quot;BRCAness&quot; signature (ATM, ATR, BAP1, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCA,&#xD;
                  FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, PALB2, NGS1, WRN, RAD50, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D,&#xD;
                  MRE11A, BLM, BRIP1) The molecular profiling results will be considered eligible&#xD;
                  for screening only if they are performed in laboratories accredited by the&#xD;
                  College of American Pathologists (CAP) and certified to meet Clinical Laboratory&#xD;
                  Improvement Amendments (CLIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients will be eligible if the original histology was lower-grade glioma and a&#xD;
             subsequent diagnosis of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who did not have recent surgery for their glioblastoma must have shown&#xD;
             unequivocal radiographic evidence for tumor progression by contrast-enhanced MRI scan&#xD;
             (or CT scan for patients with non-compatible devices) within 21 days prior to&#xD;
             registration. Patients who did have surgery with a post-operative contrast-enhanced&#xD;
             scan falling outside the 5-week window prior to registration, must have a repeat MRI&#xD;
             scan (or CT scan for patients with non-compatible devices) within 21 days prior to&#xD;
             registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have passed an interval of 6 months or greater between completion of&#xD;
             prior radiotherapy and registration. If patients have not passed an interval of at&#xD;
             least 6 months, they may still be eligible if they meet one or more of the following&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. New areas of tumor outside the original radiotherapy fields as determined by the&#xD;
                  investigator, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Histologic confirmation of tumor through biopsy or resection, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Nuclear medicine imaging, MR spectroscopy, or MR perfusion imaging consistent&#xD;
                  with true progressive disease, rather than radiation necrosis obtained within 28&#xD;
                  days of registration AND an interval of at least 90 days between completion of&#xD;
                  radiotherapy and registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients unable to undergo MR imaging because of non-compatible devices can be&#xD;
             enrolled provided CT scans are obtained and are of sufficient quality. Patients&#xD;
             without non-compatible devices may not use CT scans performed to meet this&#xD;
             requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior history of standard dose CNS radiation of 50-60Gy in 25-30 fractions, or 40Gy in&#xD;
             15 Fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy, and there must&#xD;
             be a minimum time of 28 days prior to registration from the administration of any&#xD;
             investigational agent or prior cytotoxic therapy with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. 14 days from administration of vincristine&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. 42 days from administration of nitrosoureas&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. 21 days from administration of procarbazine&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients having undergone recent resection of their high-grade glioma (within 5 weeks&#xD;
             prior to registration) must have recovered from the effects of surgery. For CNS&#xD;
             related core or needle biopsies, a minimum of 7 days must have elapsed prior to&#xD;
             registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Residual disease following resection of recurrent glioblastoma is not mandated for&#xD;
             eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease&#xD;
             post-operatively, a post- operative or intra-operative MRI scan (or CT scan for&#xD;
             patients with non-compatible devices) must be performed prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. At least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status 0-2 with no deterioration over the&#xD;
             previous 2 weeks and a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks&#xD;

                  exception of &lt;2.9 mg/dL for patients with Gilbert's disease, ALT (SGPT) and AST&#xD;
                  (SGOT) ≤2.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Renal: Serum/plasma creatinine (sCr) ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal, or creatinine&#xD;
                  clearance (CrCl) ≥50 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Serum/plasma albumin &gt; 3.0 gm/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. For female patients of childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner)&#xD;
             to use a highly effective form(s) of contraception that results in a low failure rate&#xD;
             (&lt; 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, and to continue its use for 5&#xD;
             months after the last dose of study treatments. Such methods include: combined&#xD;

             intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized&#xD;
             partner (on the understanding that this is the only one partner during the whole study&#xD;
             duration), and sexual abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
