      This intervention study is designed to evaluate short-term effects (within one hour) of prone&#xD;
      position on vital signs in infants under 12 months of age with acute RSV bronchiolitis. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to investigate whether respiratory rate changes in prone position.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are changes in oxygen saturation (SpO2), transcutaneous carbon dioxide&#xD;
      partial pressure (pCO2), heart rate, and respiratory symptoms assessed by the Modified Tal&#xD;
      Score (MTS).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted by pediatric physical therapists (PPT). Before the start of the&#xD;
      study, the procedure of the study as well as the recording of the measurement data in the&#xD;
      secuTrial® database, in the Excel file and the MTS will be explained to the PPT. The ward&#xD;
      staff will be informed about the pilot study at an early stage in order to ensure a smooth&#xD;
      procedure parallel to the clinic activities and to initiate a physiotherapy prescription for&#xD;
      infants with acute bronchiolitis as quickly as possible. After new registration of a physical&#xD;
      therapy prescription of an infant, the PPT in charge will obtain informed consent from the&#xD;
      parent or legal guardian. Each study participant will be evaluated once and preferably at the&#xD;
      beginning of the hospitalization. If the first trial is discontinued (see discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria), a second trial will be conducted a few hours later. Because supine positioning is&#xD;
      promoted to prevent sudden infant death syndrome, parents are informed that prone positioning&#xD;
      is only a measure to speed recovery from the current RSV infection and that infants are&#xD;
      monitored throughout data collection (pulse and oxygen saturation monitors). Parents will&#xD;
      also be informed that prone positioning should not be performed at home without monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the intervention, the PPT obtain the following personal data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date and time of hospital admission and physiotherapy prescription received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of birth (DD.MM. YY), age (birthday to day of intervention), sex (m/f), gestational&#xD;
           age (gestational week), birth weight (g), ethnicity (white/other), sectio (yes/no),&#xD;
           secondary diagnoses, positive family history (first-degree relatives) for asthma&#xD;
           (yes/no), positive family history (first-degree relatives) for allergies (yes/no),&#xD;
           passive smoke exposure (yes/no), breastfed (yes/no/partial), care (home, nursery,&#xD;
           other).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evidence of other viruses (not tested; which virus), number of days since onset of&#xD;
           symptoms, drug therapy, oxygen requirements, time of last feeding, type of feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date and time of onset of intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospitalization (hospital admission to start of intervention)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Position of infant when encountered prior to start of intervention (supine, lateral&#xD;
           right, lateral left, prone, being fed, on parent's arm or lap)&#xD;
&#xD;
      If infants require oxygen administration, it is documented as high flow or low flow with the&#xD;
      associated percent of oxygen content and liters/minute. Furthermore, the first time of oxygen&#xD;
      administration during the hospital stay (DD.MM.YY, HH:MM), the current cycle of oxygen&#xD;
      administration (continuous or intermittent), and the duration of oxygen administration&#xD;
      received will be recorded. During the more than one hour of data collection, the setting of&#xD;
      oxygen administration will not be changed by the nursing staff. The nursing staff will be&#xD;
      informed of this prior to the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the infant's position encountered will be noted and the first data collection of vital&#xD;
      signs (baseline, T0) will be recorded. The infant is then positioned in the prone position in&#xD;
      a standardized manner. One to two folded towels are placed lengthwise under the infant,&#xD;
      depending on body size. Both arms are placed cranially in a U-position towards the head. The&#xD;
      head is placed according to any tolerance of the infant. To initially acclimate the infants&#xD;
      to the repositioning, reassurance techniques are used by the PPT. These are individualized to&#xD;
      the infant and involve the head, chest, and pelvis regions of the body. The calming&#xD;
      techniques consist of gentle mobilization of the pelvis, light touching and contact&#xD;
      breathing. The latter elicits tactile stimuli by placing the PPT's hands on various areas of&#xD;
      the thorax and can thereby target and direct the infant's respiratory movement. After one&#xD;
      minute, a second data collection occurs, which is labeled T1. After T1, contact with the&#xD;
      infant is avoided by the PPT until the next measurement time points (T2 + T3). No contact is&#xD;
      allowed to other persons during the entire data collection unless an urgent nursing or&#xD;
      medical action is necessary due to the infant's condition (see termination criteria). After&#xD;
      an additional 9 minutes, measurement time point T2 (T0 + 10 minutes) is collected. The last&#xD;
      data collection occurs 60 minutes (range 45-75 minutes) after T0 and is designated T3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the infant turns away from the prone position, he will be repositioned to the prone&#xD;
      position at the arrival of T1 or T2. If he turns away again after T2, T3 will not be&#xD;
      evaluated and the trial will be terminated after T2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Termination criteria before the start of intervention are the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the infant is already in the prone position. Subsequently, the infant is positioned in&#xD;
           the supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if the infant is encountered while eating, the parents or nursing staff are instructed&#xD;
           to position the infant in the supine position after the infant has finished eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both cases, the nursing staff and the parents are then informed that the infant should not&#xD;
      be positioned in prone position for the next few hours so that the PPT can perform the second&#xD;
      test run a few hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters are recorded in analogous order at each measurement time point, that&#xD;
      is, T0 to T3. The primary outcome is the change in infant respiratory rate after intervention&#xD;
      has occurred. This parameter is determined first and for a precise result by auscultation&#xD;
      with the help of a stethoscope by the respective PPT. In this process, the breaths are&#xD;
      counted in the period of one minute. Secondarily, the oxygen saturation SpO2(%) and heart&#xD;
      rate (beats/minute) are measured using the pulse oximeter Philips IntelliVue MP70 Neonatal ®.&#xD;
      Transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) is measured using a transcutaneous&#xD;
      pCO2 probe on the infant's thorax and can be read on the TCM4 Series ® radiometer. In&#xD;
      addition, evaluation is performed by Modified Tal Score (MTS) and recording of cough. If&#xD;
      coughing occurred between T1 and T3, it is noted whether it was productive or non-productive&#xD;
      and occurred at the momentary measurement time or between the measurement time points. The&#xD;
      feasibility regarding the parents is recorded externally by the secuTrial® database using an&#xD;
      Excel file. For each infant, the following is documented in the Excel file:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Did the parents consent to study participation? Yes/ No&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Did the parents request discontinuation during data collection? Yes/ No&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Did the parents independently terminate the intervention by their own actions (e.g., by&#xD;
           picking up the infant)? Yes/ No&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other incidents can be noted in free text&#xD;
&#xD;
      Termination criteria: Prone positioning is terminated if the SpO2 value drops below 80% over&#xD;
      a period of 15 seconds or below 85% over a period of one minute. Other discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria include vomiting, massive coughing fit, apnea, incessant crying, turning away from&#xD;
      the prone position after T2, and discontinuation after parental request. If abortion from the&#xD;
      prone position is necessary, depending on the PPT's time availability, another attempt at&#xD;
      data collection will be made a few hours later. If the second test run is aborted, time &quot;T&quot;&#xD;
      and reason for abortion will be documented. If discontinuation of both intervention runs was&#xD;
      necessary, the first test run will be included in the data analysis. Nevertheless, the&#xD;
      results of both intervention runs are saved so that any subsequent analyses can be performed.&#xD;
