      Our goal is to compare the serum biomarker changes of joint disease that occur in response to&#xD;
      partially off-loaded (50%) walking exercise to regular (100%) walking exercise while on a&#xD;
      Lower Body Positive Pressure (LBPP) treadmill. Secondly we are determining the relationship&#xD;
      between changes in the concentration of these serum biomarkers and participant reported knee&#xD;
      pain while walking on a LBPP treadmill.&#xD;

      The morphology and composition of healthy mature articular cartilage is optimized to its&#xD;
      primary function of load transfer and distribution. In the osteoarthritic state however,&#xD;
      homeostasis of the knee joint is significantly altered, such that as load is placed on the&#xD;
      joint there is progressive worsening of cartilage damage over time. Altered joint mechanics&#xD;
      and intra-articular biological processes are thought to play pivotal roles in the initial&#xD;
      breakdown and potentiation of cartilage damage which is the hallmark finding in knee OA&#xD;
      leading to knee pain. Walking or running with weight support on a lower-body&#xD;
      positive-pressure (LBPP) treadmill is a novel training and rehabilitation modality for&#xD;
      individuals with lower extremity pathologies due to its ability to limit pain. This treadmill&#xD;
      provides a controlled off-loading of the lower extremities with significant benefit being&#xD;
      shown after 12 weeks of training in overweight individuals with knee OA on knee pain,&#xD;
      function and muscle strength. Although this methodology alters the joint mechanics, the&#xD;
      intra-articular biological effect on joint disease remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study from our laboratory compared walking exercise on a regular treadmill at a&#xD;
      defined speed with and without rest breaks in 27 participants with knee OA and demonstrated&#xD;
      that one-hour rest breaks had significant benefits. This conclusion was based on reduction in&#xD;
      knee joint contact force and decreased levels of a serum marker commonly associated with&#xD;
      cartilage degradation (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, COMP) at 45 minutes of walking.&#xD;
      This investigation assessed patterns of walking, but the impact of varying knee joint contact&#xD;
      force, such as by walking on a LBPP treadmill on the biological profiles of joint disease is&#xD;
      not known. The present study will establish the conditions and parameters for a future&#xD;
      longer-term clinical trial that aims to individualize the amount of joint loading during LBPP&#xD;
      treadmill training in participants with knee OA based on their biomarker profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Compare the serum biomarker changes of joint disease that occur in response to&#xD;
      partially off-loaded (50%) walking exercise to regular (100%) walking exercise while on a&#xD;
      LBPP treadmill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Determine the relationship between changes in the concentration of these serum&#xD;
      biomarkers and participant reported knee pain while walking on a LBPP treadmill.&#xD;
