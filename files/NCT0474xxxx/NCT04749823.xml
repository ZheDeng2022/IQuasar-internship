  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Nexercise-trial is a blended treatment program for patients with chronic non-specific&#xD;
      neck pain. We will investigate whether a blended treatment approach, combining specific neck&#xD;
      exercises and general aerobic exercises, has better outcome (on medical impact for the&#xD;
      patient and socio-economic impact) than a specific neck exercise program alone or a general&#xD;
      aerobic exercise program alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic non-specific neck pain is a common musculoskeletal complaint in which several&#xD;
      biopsychosocial factors can be involved. This condition is associated with a high&#xD;
      socio-economic burden. The standard of care treatment for chronic neck pain in clinical&#xD;
      practice is a combination of advice, passive manual treatment techniques and neck exercises.&#xD;
      The implementation of exercise for the treatment of chronic neck pain is indeed recommended&#xD;
      in several clinical guidelines. Nevertheless, exercise programs show positive though limited&#xD;
      effects, which can be explained by its biomechanical and physiological effects on muscles and&#xD;
      joints, but a current lack of taking into account important biopsychosocial and&#xD;
      neurophysiological factors. For instance, specific local exercises can lead to acute pain&#xD;
      flare-ups, hampering patient satisfaction and the adherence to exercise programs. While it is&#xD;
      shown that general aerobic exercise leads to decreased generalized pain sensitivity, also in&#xD;
      the affected body parts, both immediately and on the longer term, although on the longer term&#xD;
      the effects on local pain sensitivity are better for specific local exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can be hypothesized that a blended treatment program in which local specific neck&#xD;
      exercises are combined with general aerobic exercise in counteractive amount will avoid pain&#xD;
      flare-ups and maladaptive exercise perceptions, positively influencing treatment adherence&#xD;
      and generating the most optimal clinical outcome due to the local and general effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the aim of this project is to investigate the effect of a blended treatment program&#xD;
      (I) to a specific exercise program alone (C1) and to a general aerobic exercise program alone&#xD;
      (C2) on pain intensity and cost effectiveness (primary outcome measures), and also on Global&#xD;
      Perceived Effect, other pain-related outcomes, quality of life and functionality, lifestyle&#xD;
      factors, and health-economic measures (secondary outcome measures) (O) in chronic&#xD;
      non-specific neck pain patients (P).&#xD;

    <description>Pain intensity by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The BPI includes four ratings of pain intensity (items 3-7), and seven other ratings on the impact of pain. Intensity is recorded on numerical scales from zero (no pain) to ten (pain as bad as you can imagine). Also, intensity is rated at the time of completing the questionnaires (pain now) as well as its worst, least, and average over the past day or week. The BPI also records the location of the pain on a diagram of a human figure. Patients are also asked to select words that best describe their pain and to indicate the extent and duration of pain relief obtained from analgesics.</description>

    <description>Central sensitivity by the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) questionnaire. The CSI is a two-part questionnaire that contains a 25-item survey that assesses the frequency of health-related symptoms associated with central sensitivity syndromes.

    <description>This program includes an individual, patient-tailored exercise program with the aim of retraining the neck musculature. A detailed exercise programme will be constructed in which all exercises are listed with the amount of repetitions and series of each exercise. Strength exercises will be performed by means of dumbbells with different weights and elastic bands with different degrees of resistance. The amount of weight or resistance, and the amount of series and repetitions will be evaluated during the first session. This exercise programme will be re-evaluated repeatedly during the course of the program. Specific strength neck exercises will be performed for 30 minutes. Nine supervised sessions will be supplemented with 1 to 3 weekly unsupervised home exercise sessions.</description>
