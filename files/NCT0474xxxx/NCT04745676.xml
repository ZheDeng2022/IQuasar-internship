  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the usability and feasibility of a telehealth-delivered&#xD;
      advance care planning intervention among 20 older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), their caregivers, and oncologists.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with AMLamd MDS are more likely to receive aggressive care and less likely to&#xD;
      utilize hospice at the end-of-life. Advance care planning (ACP) intervention delivered&#xD;
      through telehealth may improve patient-reported outcomes and end-of-life care in this&#xD;
      population. This pilot study seeks to evaluate the usability and feasibility of a&#xD;
      telehealth-delivered advance care planning intervention. We will adapt the Serious Illness&#xD;
      Care Program.&#xD;
