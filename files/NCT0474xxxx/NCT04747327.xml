  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are conducting online experiments to systematically manipulate exposure to health-related&#xD;
      messages in a series of controlled, randomized studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one set of experiments, the goal is to test effects of various vaccine policies on&#xD;
      vaccination decisions and strength of intention. Embedded within the survey experiment, we&#xD;
      will compare different methods of measuring the outcome. Another experiment is designed to&#xD;
      compare the effects of financial and social incentives (when deciding to enroll in&#xD;
      health-related research, such as a RCT to increase exercise).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are conducting randomized, controlled experiments that are embedded within a survey. The&#xD;
      studies will enroll national samples recruited through MTurk and/or Prolific platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are randomized to control and experimental conditions for the following experiments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparing vaccine incentives, penalties and mandates to each other and a control condition:&#xD;
      This experiment first tests a relatively large and small financial incentives. We will&#xD;
      separately test the effects of 10 experimental conditions, with a counter-balanced&#xD;
      experimental manipulation using an FDA approval message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing mandate message effects: This experiment tests the effects of mandatory vaccination&#xD;
      versus freedom language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors influencing the decision to participate in research: In this experiment, the study&#xD;
      outcome will be interest in RCT enrollment for behavior change. We will test whether those&#xD;
      who are most motivated to change behavior are also most likely to enroll in a (hypothetical)&#xD;
      RCT and compare the effects of offering financial versus social incentives for behavior&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our experiments, socio-demographic variables, including age, gender, race, ethnicity,&#xD;
      political affiliation, education, income, and financial stress will be measured for&#xD;
      descriptive purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommended data cleaning procedures: Attention checks can identify those who should be&#xD;
      excluded from the main analyses. (Regardless of performance on the attention check, all&#xD;
      participants will be compensated for their time.) It is also recommended that the final&#xD;
      analyses exclude duplicate IDs, those with a high fraud score, and those who finished the&#xD;
      fastest (fastest 5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Replication studies will include the same study design and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic plans for vaccine message experiments (testing financial incentives, penalties, and&#xD;
      mandates):&#xD;
&#xD;
      As noted above, this survey experiment involves randomizing individuals to a control&#xD;
      condition or one of 10 experimental conditions that expose subjects to messages about&#xD;
      different COVID-19 vaccine policies. The control group, with no vaccine policy presented will&#xD;
      be compared to: cash incentives for $1000, $200, or $100; a $1,000 tax credit; lotteries for&#xD;
      $100,000, $200,000, or $1 million; $1,000 tax on the unvaccinated; and mandates by employers&#xD;
      or airlines, bars, and restaurants. The main outcome is whether they would want to get&#xD;
      vaccinated soon given the hypothetical vaccine policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Those assigned to the employer mandate condition will be excluded from the final analyses if&#xD;
      they report being unlikely to have an employer.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OLS specification will be our main result and the other measures are provided as robustness&#xD;
      checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OLS model can exclude all the demographic controls and run the binary dependent variable&#xD;
      on the treatment variables. (Note that this approach is legitimate because the treatments are&#xD;
      being randomized across respondents.) The treatments include the financial policies&#xD;
      (incentives and penalties of different amounts and types) and mandates (of different types)&#xD;
      being noted in a message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Type of model: We will perform pairwise t tests of percent of respondents answering &quot;Yes&quot;&#xD;
      comparing those treated with an incentive to the control group. We will perform these&#xD;
      pairwise tests on subsets by race, gender, income, education, and other socio-demographics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, we will conduct these pairwise tests on by type of treatment. Comparing lottery&#xD;
      to cash incentive, comparing positive incentive vs. penalty, comparing size of incentive, and&#xD;
      comparing employer mandates against the control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also conduct regression analyses on the pooled dataset where the left-hand side&#xD;
      observations are individual responses where those answering &quot;Yes&quot; will be coded as 1 and&#xD;
      those answering, &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Unsure&quot; will be coded zero. We will include a set of controls&#xD;
      (race, gender, income, education, etc) as well as an indicator variable reflecting whether&#xD;
      the respondent received a treatment. Regression models will include ordinary least squares,&#xD;
      probit, nearest neighbor matching, and propensity score matching. We will also run these&#xD;
      regressions where the treatment variable is split up into several indicator variables&#xD;
      reflecting the type of treatment provided as well as an indicator for FDA approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will estimate a model-alternatively using ordinary least squares and logistic&#xD;
      regression-with a binary-outcome dependent variable (equal to one if the respondent wanted to&#xD;
      be vaccinated, and otherwise equal to zero). For explanatory variables, we include dummy&#xD;
      variables for each of the ten treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Criteria for statistical significance: We will use .05 as our threshold for statistical&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embedded within, we will test if methodological differences in the response option for the&#xD;
      primary outcome effect the percent reporting &quot;yes&quot;. To do this, we will test 2 (Yes and No)&#xD;
      vs 3 (Yes, No and Unsure) level response options and randomly order both sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation for the survey experiment comparing 10 different vaccine policies: We&#xD;
      estimate that if the final sample sizes for each condition include at least 300 subjects, we&#xD;
      can detect about 5% or larger difference. We plan to double the allocation for the control&#xD;
      and $1000 conditions to allow for planned comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodological experiment: This experiment will examine whether the proportion responding&#xD;
      &quot;yes&quot; to the same question (about whether they want to vaccinate soon) varies depending on&#xD;
      the order of response options and whether they include a maybe/unsure option. We will run&#xD;
      cross tabs and chi-square tests for the 2 vs 3 response levels and the order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiments testing the effects of relatively large and small financial incentives on&#xD;
      vaccination decisions will report point estimates and 95% CIs for the overall sample and&#xD;
      demographic sub-groups. We will also report summary statistics for all the overall sample and&#xD;
      sub-populations. We will test whether, compared to a control condition, either of the&#xD;
      financial incentives increase, decrease, or have no effect on the percentage who want to&#xD;
      vaccinate. In a fourth study arm, subjects will receive an educational message that will also&#xD;
      be compared to the control condition.&#xD;
