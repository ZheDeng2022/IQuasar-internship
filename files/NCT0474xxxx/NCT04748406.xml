      Investigator could not find a study comparing ESWT(Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy) and&#xD;
      Peloidotherapy methods in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis in the literature.&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, it was planned to investigate the difference in effectiveness&#xD;
      between Peloidotherapy and ESWT in the treatment of Lateral Epicondylitis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The frequency of lateral epicondylitis (LE), one of the most common causes of elbow pain, has&#xD;
      been reported to be 1-3%. It is usually seen between the ages of 40-50 and the dominant side&#xD;
      is more frequently affected. The most common cause of elbow lateral pain in adults is LE&#xD;
      (1,2). Pain that occurs in LE and radiates to the humerus and forearm is characteristic of&#xD;
      this disease. (3). The diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis is usually made clinically.&#xD;
      Dorsiflexion of the wrist against resistance, pressure on the lateral epicondyle and firm&#xD;
      grip of an object causes pain radiating to the forearm. (4). With appropriate conservative&#xD;
      treatments, 75-90% relief has been reported in patients with LE (1). Chronic symptoms develop&#xD;
      in 5-10% of the patients. Various treatments have been tried to reduce the pain of the&#xD;
      patient and increase the functions in LE, which restricts daily life activities. Although&#xD;
      many treatment methods are used in the treatment of LE disease, it is controversial which is&#xD;
      the most effective method. Extracorporeal Shock Wave therapy (ESWT), peloidotherapy, NSAID,&#xD;
      corticosteroid injection, cold application, fascia loosening, electrotherapy applications,&#xD;
      kinesio band, iontophoresis, splint, orthosis, acapuntur, ultrasound therapy, deep friction&#xD;
      massage, exercise, manipulation, mobilization, laser, Botulinum toxin injection, tenotomy,&#xD;
      and autologous blood injections are among the recommended treatments (4-9). Although there&#xD;
      are so many different treatment methods in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis, there is&#xD;
      no consensus on which one is the most effective and successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peloids (medicinal mud) are organic or inorganic substances formed as a result of geological&#xD;
      and / or biological events. They can be found in nature as fine particles, or they are made&#xD;
      into small, fine particles by some pre-preparation processes. (10). Peloidotherapy is a&#xD;
      special balneotherapy method made with natural muds (11). It is especially used in the&#xD;
      treatment of diseases such as degenerative joint diseases, soft tissue rheumatism, lumbar&#xD;
      discopathy, cervical discopathy, chronic back and neck pain, joint pain. Scientific studies&#xD;
      on peloid treatment both in Turkey and abroad have shown that patients have reduced pain&#xD;
      (12), improved physical functions, increased quality of life, and decreased pain medication&#xD;
      use (12-15). A recent study demonstrated the effectiveness of peloidotherapy in LE. (16).&#xD;
      Ökmen et al. In this study, the effectiveness of peloidotherapy and elbow bandage in the&#xD;
      treatment of LE was compared. (16). This study remains the only one investigating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of peloidotherapy in the treatment of LE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shock wave therapy (extracorporeal shock wave therapy, Extracorporeal Shock Wave&#xD;
      Therapy-ESWT) is a new orthopedic treatment method based on focusing high amplitude sound&#xD;
      waves on the desired area of the body and providing treatment there. (17). ESWT creates a&#xD;
      cavitation effect in deep tissue by creating capillary microrupture, chemical mediator&#xD;
      leakage, and neovascularization in damaged tissue with low or high energy options (18).&#xD;
      Successful results have been reported with ESWT treatment in 48-73% of cases with recurrent&#xD;
      LE with non-surgical methods (19). Due to its non-invasive nature and low complication rates,&#xD;
      the use of ESWT in LE treatment is gradually increasing (20). Some authors state that ESWT&#xD;
      has lateral LE effect (20). Some authors reported that ESWT is not in the treatment of LE&#xD;
      (21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator did not find a study comparing ESWT and Peloidotherapy methods in the treatment&#xD;
      of LE in the literature. In this thesis, our aim is to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      peloidotherapy and ESWT methods used in the treatment of LE with a prospective clinical&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>All evaluations will be applied one time by the same investigator in both groups, at the beginning of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were questioned about age, gender, body mass index (BMI), education level, occupation, the extremity affected by the dominant, duration of complaints, previous treatments and when the last treatment was administered.</description>

    <description>The grip strength of the hand is accepted as the most objective criterion of the functional integrity of the upper extremity. Hand grip strength also provides convenience and objectivity in evaluating the treatment. (26). It is known that hand grip strength measurements with the Jamar hand dynamometer, which is one of the methods used for this purpose, give reliable results (22, 26, 27). Jamar dynamometer will be used in hand grip strength measurements.</description>

    <description>Pain interrogation using a 0-10 point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) will be used to detect pain and disability caused by the disease. The questions were pain at rest, pain during straining, pain relief effectiveness, subjective work failure, difficulty in lifting 2 kg objects, inability during hobby activities and sleep disturbance. Patients were asked to answer each question as 0 (no pain or disability) 10 (worst possible pain or disability) on a scale of 0-10 cm. The total pain score, which is the sum of 7 different sub-scores, will be calculated for each patient. In addition to 0-10 point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the severity of pain during maximum hand grip.</description>

    <description>&quot;Roles and Maudsley Scoring&quot; will be used to measure the treatment satisfaction level of the patients. The &quot;Roles and Maudsley Scoring&quot; is a measure of whether patients with lateral epicondylitis benefit from treatment. It is scored between 1 and 4 points. 1 point indicates that satisfaction with treatment and benefit from treatment is high. As the score level increases, the level of satisfaction and benefit from treatment decreases. 4 points show that he did not benefit from the treatment at all and he was not satisfied.</description>

    <description>Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Questionnaire; The field-specific outcome measurement DASH questionnaire has been developed to evaluate functional status and symptoms in musculoskeletal disorders occurring in the upper extremity.The DASH questionnaire consists of 3 parts. The first part consists of 30 questions; 21 questions assess the patient's difficulties during daily life activities, 5 questions evaluate symptoms (pain, activity-related pain, tingling, stiffness, weakness), and each of the remaining 4 questions assess social function, work, sleep and patient self-confidence.</description>

    <description>Patient-Rated Forearm Evaluation Questionnaire(PRFEQ), a Turkish validated scoring system, is designed to assess arm pain and functions over a 1-week period. It questions how much pain and difficulty you have had with your arm over the past week. Pain is assessed with 5 questions and functions with 10 questions. The subtitles of PRFEQ related to pain are scored between 0 (no pain) and 10 (worst possible pain) on a 0-10 cm VAS scale.</description>

It is filled by the patient himself. It has eight subgroups (general health, physical function, physical condition, pain, life functions, social functions, emotional state, mental health) and 2 summary scales (mental health and physical health). It is scored between 0 and 100, with 0 reporting the worst health condition, 100 the best health condition.</description>
