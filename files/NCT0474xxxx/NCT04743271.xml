      The goals of this study are to uncover the influence of diet on the human circadian timing&#xD;
      system. The protocol is a 46-day (28 outpatient days, 18 inpatient days over two 9 day&#xD;
      visits) randomized cross-over study designed to elucidate the speed of entrainment in&#xD;
      response to a high-fat diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Synchronization of the timing of biological processes and behaviors with the 24-hour&#xD;
      light-dark cycle is fundamental to almost every physiological process, cognitive function,&#xD;
      and overall health. As the average circadian period in humans is ~9 min longer than the 24-h&#xD;
      day, and artificial lighting allows a further delay in the clock, circadian entrainment must&#xD;
      occur every day. This makes the process of circadian entrainment of the internal clock with&#xD;
      the external environment a commonly overlooked process, but one that has serious&#xD;
      ramifications if impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In rodent models, high-fat diets have been shown to disorganize the circadian timing system.&#xD;
      There has been limited examination, however, of how composition of diet acts on the circadian&#xD;
      timing system in humans. The ability to entrain to a new light schedule has been briefly&#xD;
      examined after a high-fat diet in rodent models.When mice are exposed to a 6-h shift in the&#xD;
      light-dark cycle and fed a diet composed of ~50% fat for 3 weeks, they experience a 20%&#xD;
      slower rate of re-entrainment to the new light cycle as compared to mice fed a low-fat diet.&#xD;
      Further, these mice had an attenuated response to a phase-advancing light pulse. Moreover,&#xD;
      simply providing a high-fat diet to mice results in a lengthened circadian period and a shift&#xD;
      in ad libitum eating patterns into the typical rest phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are to uncover the influence of diet on the human circadian timing&#xD;
      system. The protocol is a 46-day (28 outpatient days, 18 inpatient days over two 9 day&#xD;
      visits) randomized cross-over study designed to elucidate the speed of entrainment in&#xD;
      response to a high-fat diet. Participants will be provided 3 weeks of a high-fat diet&#xD;
      (2-weeks outpatient, 1-week inpatient) of 50% calories from fat. The protocol includes two&#xD;
      types of data collection; ambulatory monitoring on strict sleep-wake schedules with either&#xD;
      high-fat or low-fat meals provided by the study team and precise in-laboratory measurements&#xD;
      of circadian timing, entrainment, and other physiological markers of sleep and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ambulatory Monitoring: Participants will maintain a consistent 14-day at home 8h sleep&#xD;
           schedule at habitual times before both laboratory visits to ensure 1) subjects are not&#xD;
           sleep restricted and 2) that they are obtaining the same light-dark schedule prior to&#xD;
           each laboratory visit for stable entrainment; verified by actigraphy, sleep logs, and&#xD;
           call-ins to a time stamped recorder. Drugs, medications, caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine&#xD;
           will be proscribed during this time and toxicology analysis will be performed upon&#xD;
           in-laboratory admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Outpatient diet: For 2-weeks prior to each protocol, participants will consume an&#xD;
           outpatient isocaloric diet designed to meet individual daily energy requirements; diet&#xD;
           designed and prepared by investigators. Diets will either be designed to be high in&#xD;
           calories from fat (50% fat, 35% carbohydrate and 15% protein; 33% of each mono, poly and&#xD;
           saturated fat) or low-fat (30% fat, 55% carbohydrate and 15% protein)&#xD;
           (randomized-crossover design). The diet will consist of a breakfast, lunch, dinner, and&#xD;
           snack and participants will either come to the laboratory ~3 days or staff will deliver&#xD;
           meals. Participants will be instructed to only consume the food provided during these&#xD;
           14-days. Adherence to the diet will be captured via tracking meals using a mobile food&#xD;
           tracking application (MealLogger AppTM (Wellness Foundry, New York)).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inpatient Protocols: Participants will be admitted to an individual room free of&#xD;
           external time cues (e.g., clocks, radios, computers, visitors and sunlight). Room&#xD;
           temperature is maintained at 21 - 22.2 °C and light intensity set at ≤5 lux during&#xD;
           scheduled constant posture procedures, room light (400 lux) during entrainment&#xD;
           wakefulness and 0 lux (darkness) during scheduled sleep opportunities. Participants will&#xD;
           be instrumented for full polysomnography (PSG), electrocardiogram, and a rectal&#xD;
           thermistor for continuous core body temperature measurement. An 18-gauge IV catheter&#xD;
           will also be inserted into the forearm and connected to a triple-stopcock manifold via&#xD;
           an IV loop with a 12- foot small-lumen extension cable through which blood sampling can&#xD;
           continue in the next room without disturbing sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After instrumentation, participants will be given a sleep opportunity and will awakened to&#xD;
      dim-lighting and maintaining a constant posture protocol for accurate assessment of circadian&#xD;
      phase, resting metabolic rate, and other physiological outcomes. After the constant posture&#xD;
      protocol, participants' light-dark cycle will be changed for 6 identical days, followed by a&#xD;
      second constant posture protocol for re-assessment of circadian phase. This protocol will be&#xD;
      repeated while participants are provided the other cross-over meal. Investigators/nurses will&#xD;
      be present in the lab or in a central control room 24 h per day to monitor subject health,&#xD;
      data acquisition, provide meals, collect biologic specimens, perform tests, and record sleep.&#xD;
      A physician is always on call when a participant is in the laboratory. An extensive series of&#xD;
      protocols and checklists and team practices are used to ensure uniformity in execution of&#xD;
      standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Energy content of diets will be designed to meet individual daily energy requirements.&#xD;
      Dietitians will prepare isocaloric meals containing macronutrient contents of high or low-fat&#xD;
      diet and no caffeine. Caloric intake will be the same caloric and macronutrient composition&#xD;
      for each day of laboratory study and will be provided as miniature snacks frequently during&#xD;
      each constant posture protocol (e.g., ¼ turkey &amp; cheese sandwich, juice and water).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Speed of entrainment</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 18 days</time_frame>
    <description>Entrainment will be determined as a stable phase angle between sleep and both melatonin onset. Blood and/or saliva will be assayed for melatonin using standardized assays. Melatonin onset will be calculated using the linear interpolated time at which melatonin levels reach 25% of a fitted peak-to-trough amplitude. This will be analyzed using phase angle between sleep and melatonin onset.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Phase Angle of entrainment</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 18 days</time_frame>
    <description>Phase angle will be calculated as dim-light melatonin onset minus sleep onset during each constant posture protocol. Differences in phase angle of entrainment between sleep and melatonin onset will be first examined using planned comparison dependent t-tests between the high-fat and low-fat visits. The study will use planned comparison dependent t-tests to compare phase angle of entrainment from constant posture day 1 vs constant posture day 2 to uncover potential differences in phase angle in response to an advance in light exposure under differing diet conditions</description>
