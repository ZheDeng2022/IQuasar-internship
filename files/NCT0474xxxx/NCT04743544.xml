    <textblock>
      Voriconazole is a drug used to treat invasive fungal infections. The amount of voriconazole&#xD;
      in a person's blood helps to determine how effectively it treats an infection, and how safe&#xD;
      it is. Patients respond differently when receiving the same dose - some clearly benefit,&#xD;
      other patients experience side effects, and others see limited improvement in their&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voriconazole is broken down in the liver mainly by an enzyme called CYP2C19, before being&#xD;
      excreted from the body. The activity of CY2C19 differs between people because of variation in&#xD;
      the DNA that encodes the body's instructions to make CYP2C19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If CYP2C19 activity is very high, voriconazole blood levels may remain below the target range&#xD;
      when a patient receives a standard dose of voriconazole, which may be insufficient to treat&#xD;
      their infection. Besides, children tend to have faster voriconazole metabolism regardless of&#xD;
      the genetic makeup, mainly because of higher liver mass/body proportion. That's why, younger&#xD;
      patients needs higher doses and it is harder for them to reach target range. Having a high&#xD;
      CYP2C19 activity and being young combined may cause to consider choosing an alternative drug.&#xD;
      By contrast, decreased CYP2C19 activity due to genetic variation may result in excessively&#xD;
      high voriconazole blood levels, predisposing to serious side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, knowing a patient's CYP2C19 genetic makeup is very important for predicting their&#xD;
      response to voriconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we aim to determine the influence of genetic variation in CYP2C19 on the frequency and&#xD;
      severity of side effects related to voriconazole, and on the effectiveness of voriconazole&#xD;
      for treating serious fungal infections. The findings from this study will contribute to&#xD;
      determining the optimal dose of voriconazole that patients with different genetic variants in&#xD;
      CYP2C19 should be started on, and will take us one step closer to both understanding the&#xD;
      genetic structure of CYP2C19 in the Turkish population, and to 'personalised medicine'.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Invasive fungal infections are the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in immune&#xD;
      compromised children. Aspergillus species are reported to be the most common molds that cause&#xD;
      invasive infections among pediatric patients both in the United States and in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voriconazole is recommended as the first line therapy for invasive Aspergillosis. The major&#xD;
      proportion of the drug undergoes hepatic metabolism via cytochrome enzymes. The hepatic&#xD;
      cytochrome enzyme that mainly involves in the metabolism of voriconazole is CYP2C19, which is&#xD;
      known to be highly polymorphic. So far, more than 30 variant alleles have been defined in the&#xD;
      gene that codes CYP2C19 enzyme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polymorphisms in CYP2C19 gene are associated with alterations in voriconazole metabolism. It&#xD;
      is postulated that only 35-50% of the populations has normal metabolic activity for this&#xD;
      drug. The carriers of defective alleles (*2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3) in CYP2C19 gene have slower&#xD;
      metabolic activity for voriconazole, while the carriers of *17 allele have increased enzyme&#xD;
      activity and higher metabolic capacity for the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voriconazole has a narrow therapeutic window. When the therapy is initiated with standard&#xD;
      doses, interpersonal differences in CYP2C19 activity make it difficult to remain in the&#xD;
      optimal therapeutic range. Furthermore, it is reported that voriconazole concentrations in&#xD;
      pediatric patients can exhibit up to 3-fold variation among individuals and it is extremely&#xD;
      hard to reach and remain therapeutic concentration in younger children. As low serum&#xD;
      concentrations cause decreased efficacy, supratherapeutic concentrations may cause&#xD;
      voriconazole toxicity which also leads to significant morbidity, mortality and high treatment&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure desired efficacy and safety of voriconazole treatment, therapeutic drug monitoring&#xD;
      (TDM) is recommended, but unfortunately, it is not a part of routine clinical care in many&#xD;
      hospitals, due to frequent blood sampling and analysis requirements and the high analysis&#xD;
      costs. On the other hand, starting the therapy with standard doses and adjusting it with&#xD;
      subsequent TDMs may cause delay in selecting optimal voriconazole dose and providing&#xD;
      effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is reported that, pediatric patients those are initiated voriconazole therapy with&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic-guided dose selection reaches targeted serum voriconazole concentration&#xD;
      4-fold faster than the patients those are given standard doses and undergoes subsequent dose&#xD;
      adjustments according to TDM results. Thus, CYP2C19 genotyping is essential in reaching the&#xD;
      optimal voriconazole concentration in shorter times. Genotype-guided first dose selection&#xD;
      would make it easier to reach the targeted serum voriconazole concentration, minimize&#xD;
      frequent TDM requirement, prevent the treatment failure and lead to better clinical outcomes.&#xD;
      On the other hand, pharmacogenetic analysis results can also be used for adjusting dose of&#xD;
      other drugs that is metabolized by the same enzyme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We could only located one conference proceeding reporting the effect of CYP2C19 polymorphisms&#xD;
      on safety of voriconazole use in 6 patients in Turkish population. Current literature is&#xD;
      limited and the guidelines does not make a clear recommendation about the&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic-guided dose selections. Thus, to build safe pharmacogenetic- guided dose&#xD;
      selection algorithms, more data in that field is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to prospectively determine the influence of CYP2C19 polymorphisms on&#xD;
      frequency and severity of voriconazole related adverse event reactions during the study&#xD;
      follow up period and on the efficacy of voriconazole treatment/ prophylaxis. Samples for&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic analysis will be stored for further studies depending on participant's and&#xD;
      the parents' discreation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD This is a multi centre, observational cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged between ≥2 years and &lt;18 years hospitalized in pediatric hematology clinics in&#xD;
      research centers (Dokuz Eylul University Hospital, Ege University Hospital, Izmir University&#xD;
      of Health Sciences Tepecik Training and Research Hospital) due to a hematological malignancy&#xD;
      (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia) and receiving voriconazole as part of&#xD;
      invasive fungal infection prophylaxis or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and sample collection 1.1.1.Data collection: At baseline, demographics and clinical&#xD;
      information will be recorded from all patients directly and complemented from their medical&#xD;
      records. All patients will be followed up by the research team daily for the first 7 days&#xD;
      following voriconazole initiation, and then on days 14, 30 and 60. All follow up will be&#xD;
      initially via assessment of medical records, with additional data input from the patient&#xD;
      directly. The medical records include: the electronic hospital record system (PROBEL),&#xD;
      paper-based patient records and other patient follow-up- documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During routine clinical care, ADRs are monitored daily by a pediatric hematology fellow&#xD;
      and/or pediatrician. On days one to seven following voriconazole initiation, the&#xD;
      investigators will record these clinical evaluations daily; they will also capture these data&#xD;
      on days 14 and 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants that had either started voriconazole active treatment before they were&#xD;
      recruited, or were recruited during the maintenance phase of their voriconazole regimen, the&#xD;
      research team will assess their medicals records retrospectively between the point of&#xD;
      recruitment and day one of their active voriconazole treatment to detect ADRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 30 and 60, patient survival will be recorded by review of patient records only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment response (efficacy) will be determined based on the EORTC/MSG consensus criteria.&#xD;
      These data will be obtained at all follow up points (from day one to seven, and days 14, 30&#xD;
      and 60).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2.Sample collection: 1.1.2.1.Samples fo PGx analysis: All pediatric patients with a&#xD;
      hematologic malignancy (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia) hospitalized&#xD;
      aforementioned study centers and their parents will be informed of the study. Those agree to&#xD;
      participate in will donate 2 mL blood sample collected into an EDTA&#xD;
      (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid) tube on day one whilst blood samples are being taken from&#xD;
      the patient for daily routine clinical purposes (without requiring any other needle&#xD;
      insertion). Samples for PGx analysis will be coded and stored securely in Dokuz Eylul&#xD;
      University Hospital, Department of Medical Pharmacology. The samples will be stored -80&#xD;
      celcius degree until used up. PGx analysis will be performed in the Department of Medical&#xD;
      Genetics at Dokuz Eylul University Hospital at the end of the study. Participants and&#xD;
      physicians will not be informed of the participant's genotype during the study period. The&#xD;
      participant's clinical care will not be affected in any way by taking part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2.2.Samples for voriconazole concentration determination: The patients those start using&#xD;
      voriconazole as part of invasive fungal infection prophylaxis or treatment will The second 2&#xD;
      mL blood sample will be collected into a red cap tube on the fifth day (9th dose) of&#xD;
      treatment before the morning voriconazole dose, again whilst blood is being collected as part&#xD;
      of routine clinical care (without requiring any other needle insertion) to determine the&#xD;
      trough voriconazole concentration at steady state. This blood sample will be centrifuged and&#xD;
      the serum stored in the Department of Medical Pharmacology at the Dokuz Eylul University&#xD;
      Faculty of Medicine. When follow up is completed for a given patient, this serum sample will&#xD;
      be transferred to an accredited laboratory in Istanbul, Turkey, with maintenance and&#xD;
      assurance of the cold chain during sample transportation to guarantee sample integrity.&#xD;
