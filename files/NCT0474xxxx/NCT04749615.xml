  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kim et al (2019) have shown that addition of ACB/IPACK to PAI improves analgesic outcomes&#xD;
      (the nerve blocks reduced pain with ambulation and reduced opioid consumption). TKA patients&#xD;
      receiving PAI + ACB/IPACK (along with a comprehensive multimodal analgesic program) had low&#xD;
      pain scores with ambulation on POD1: 1.7 +/- 1.4 (mean +/- SD, NRS, 0-10 scale). The opioid&#xD;
      consumption in the first 24 hours was 40.6 +/- 32.1 (mg oral morphine equivalents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not clear if the PAI component is necessary, given the theoretically nearly complete&#xD;
      analgesic effects of the ACB/IPACK block. Additionally, anecdotal evidence indicates that&#xD;
      some surgeons at HSS routinely use the PAI and some do not, without obvious large differences&#xD;
      in analgesic outcomes. While there may be a 'belt and suspenders' advantage to using PAI in&#xD;
      addition to ACB/IPACK, it is not desirable to perform unnecessary procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we seek to compare the efficacy of ACB/IPACK with and without PAI in TKA&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <description>The NRS (numeric rating scale) is a questionnaire that measures pain on a numeric scale, 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). The questionnaire will focus on pain during movement. and will be asked post operative discharge, 48 hours post operative discharge, and 3 months post operative discharge.</description>

    <description>The NRS (numeric rating scale) is a questionnaire that measures pain on a numeric scale, 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). The questionnaire will focus on pain without movement involved and will be asked post operative discharge, 24 hours post operative discharge, 48 hours post operative discharge, and 3 months post operative discharge.</description>

    <measure>PAIN OUT questionnaire (POD 0, POD1, 2 weeks, 3 months)</measure>
    <time_frame>post surgical discharge, 24 hours post surgical discharge, 2 weeks post surgical discharge, and 3 months post surgical discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The PAIN OUT questionnaire has multiple numeric scale questions on pain relief as well as pain intensity, along with Yes/No questions. There are also questions asking which pain relief techniques were used (multiple choice). A higher pain relief score is a better result than that of a lower score. While a higher pain score a negative result when compared to a lower score. This questionnaire will be asked post operative discharge, 24 hours post operative discharge, 2 weeks post operative discharge, and 3 months post operative discharge.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Recovery (QOR9) (POD1)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours post surgical discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>( Quality of Recovery) This questionnaire has three options for scale (not at all, some of the time, most of the time). The questions focus on the overall well being of the patient. The questionnaire will be asked 24 hours post surgical discharge.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Side effects: Opioid-Related Symptom Distress score (POD1)</measure>

    <time_frame>24 hours post operative discharge.</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is a numeric scale from 0 (strongly dissatisfied) to 10 ( strongly satisfied). A higher number dictates a better outcome. This will be asked 24 hours post operative discharge.</description>
