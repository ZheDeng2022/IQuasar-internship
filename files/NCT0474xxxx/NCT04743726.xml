  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dissolution and absorption of oral drugs in the gastrointestinal tract is a complex&#xD;
      process, which is affected by physiological factors such as transporters, metabolic enzymes,&#xD;
      gene phenotypes, gastrointestinal diseases, intestinal flora and so on. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators are planning to collect gastrointestinal mucosa tissues, gastric juice, saliva&#xD;
      , feces and blood samples to investigate (1) the activity and abundance of metabolism&#xD;
      enzymes/transports in different section of gastrointestinal tract, (2) the composition and&#xD;
      physicochemical properties of gastric juice; (3) the distribution and abundance of bacterial&#xD;
      in gastrointestinal mucosa, saliva, gastric juice and feces; (4) the composition and content&#xD;
      of bile acid in gastrointestinal mucosa, gastric juice and plasma in Chinese volunteers who&#xD;
      planning to undergo digestive endoscopy.&#xD;

      This is a single-center, open-labelled study. Twenty four Chinese adult volunteers who&#xD;
      schedule for gastrointestinal endoscopy will be enrolled and will be not allowed to take&#xD;
      products containing grapefruit, fruit juice, tea, coffee, wine and other foods or drinks&#xD;
      containing caffeine, xanthine and alcohols at least 14 days before the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopes. In addition, smoking is also prohibited. Screen will be performed any day between&#xD;
      3 and 14 days prior to the gastrointestinal endoscopes. Feces, saliva and 4 ml whole blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected from these participants 3 days before gastrointestinal endoscopes&#xD;
      for the detection of bacterial diversity, metabolic enzymes, transporter-related genotypes&#xD;
      and bile acids. Afterwards, participants will undergo painless gastroscopy. Meanwhile,&#xD;
      gastric juice, mucosal tissue from stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon will be&#xD;
      collected. The total number of mucosal tissue no more than 10.&#xD;
