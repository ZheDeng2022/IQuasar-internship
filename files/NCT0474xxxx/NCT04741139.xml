  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single hospital system, single-arm year-long pilot to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of enrolling children with ITP who are receiving IVIG for treatment of disease to&#xD;
      a scheduled post-infusion medication for 72 hours following IVIG infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This year-long feasibility pilot will test the (1) feasibility of enrollment and the&#xD;
      willingness of families to participate in a scheduled medication regimen and (2) adherence of&#xD;
      patients and families to the scheduled medication regimen. Clinical outcomes, as defined by&#xD;
      rates of headache or nausea/vomiting or other adverse event following IVIG, return to medical&#xD;
      care, and need for further laboratory or imaging studies, will be collected. These rates will&#xD;
      be compared to retrospective, historical data from Texas Children's Hematology Center from&#xD;
      2010 to 2019. However, due to the rate at which these events occur following IVIG, this&#xD;
      feasibility pilot is not fully powered to detect differences in clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the most common acquired immune cytopenia in childhood,&#xD;
      affecting 4-6 in 100,000 children. The pathophysiology of ITP is highly complex and&#xD;
      incompletely understood. Accepted mechanisms include immune dysregulation caused by an often&#xD;
      unidentified trigger leading to the formation of anti-platelet antibodies and&#xD;
      antibody-mediated reticuloendothelial clearance. Cell-mediated platelet destruction and&#xD;
      disruption of T cell homeostasis are also well described. ITP is also characterized by&#xD;
      impaired platelet production due to antibody effect in the bone marrow and subsequent&#xD;
      megakaryocyte ultrastructural abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with ITP generally present with a sudden onset of symptoms. Bleeding tendency is&#xD;
      variable, but the vast majority of children will experience cutaneous bleeding symptoms&#xD;
      including bruising and petechiae. More extensive bleeding ranging from extensive oral&#xD;
      bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia, or other significant bleeding necessitating&#xD;
      urgent medical intervention develops in up to 20% of patients.8 Intracranial hemorrhage&#xD;
      (ICH), the most feared and devastating complication of ITP, occurs in approximately 0.5% of&#xD;
      pediatric patients. Bleeding phenotype is unable to be reliably predicted at diagnosis. In&#xD;
      children who present with mucosal or more significant bleeding, treatment is indicated to&#xD;
      achieve rapid hemostasis by increase in platelet count. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is&#xD;
      a commonly utilized first line agent to reduce bleeding symptoms and improve the platelet&#xD;
      count to a hemostatic range within 24-48 hours of administration. The mechanism of action of&#xD;
      IVIG in ITP is currently incompletely understood and likely involves multiple&#xD;
      immunomodulatory mechanisms. Previous data has suggested IVIG leads to a rise in platelet&#xD;
      count via blockade of Fc receptors on phagocytic cells within the reticuloendothelial system.&#xD;
      Another hypothesis suggests IVIG upregulates the expression of the inhibitory IgG Fc receptor&#xD;
      2B encoded by FCGR2B gene, thus leading to decreased cell mediated destruction and decreased&#xD;
      anti-platelet antibody production.14 Following IVIG administration, an improvement in&#xD;
      clinical bleeding and an associated rise in platelet count is seen in approximately 75% of&#xD;
      children with ITP&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVIG is a polyclonal antibody preparation developed from pooled donor plasma from 15,000 to&#xD;
      60,000 donors depending on the preparation utilized. The safety and efficacy of IVIG in&#xD;
      patients with ITP has been demonstrated in multiple clinical trials, and IVIG is considered a&#xD;
      first line therapy for the treatment of children with ITP. Overall, IVIG is well tolerated&#xD;
      across patients with a spectrum of diseases. The majority of reported adverse events are&#xD;
      mild, transient, and infusion related. The most commonly reported immediate adverse events&#xD;
      include headache, fever, nausea/vomiting, malaise, back pain, flushing, and chills. In&#xD;
      comparison to other patient populations who receive IVIG, patients with ITP carry the unique&#xD;
      risk for intracranial hemorrhage due to profound thrombocytopenia. Mild side effects such as&#xD;
      headache and nausea/vomiting can easily be attributed to recent IVIG administration in&#xD;
      non-thrombocytopenic populations. However, these symptoms overlap with the heralding symptoms&#xD;
      of an intracranial hemorrhage which, due to high morbidity and mortality, must not go&#xD;
      undiagnosed in patients with ITP. To decrease the percentage of patients experiencing these&#xD;
      immediate, infusion associated symptoms, patients with ITP at most pediatric centers are&#xD;
      routinely pre-medicated with a single dose of acetaminophen and diphenhydramine prior to IVIG&#xD;
      infusion.21 However, post-infusion medication regimens differ amongst providers and pediatric&#xD;
      centers and frequently utilized acetaminophen and diphenhydramine as these symptoms arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peak IgG concentration following IVIG administration occurs in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
      between 24-48 hours after infusion. The common events of headache, nausea, and vomiting often&#xD;
      peak during this time, when most patients have already been discharged from medical care.&#xD;
      Headache and associated nausea/vomiting are particularly worrisome in patients with ITP given&#xD;
      the risk for ICH and overlap of symptoms at presentation. Aseptic meningitis, a rare and&#xD;
      serious adverse event following IVIG infusion, presents with headache, nausea/vomiting,&#xD;
      nuchal rigidity, and fever. The development of aseptic meningitis is hypothesized to be dose&#xD;
      dependent and has been noted to cluster within patients who suffer from migraines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Texas Children's Hospital, most children prescribed IVIG receive Gamunex-C, which has a&#xD;
      reported incidence of headache in 30-50% of patients. At the onset of symptoms, patients&#xD;
      typically remain severely thrombocytopenic and at highest risk of ICH. Many of these patients&#xD;
      will develop symptoms severe enough to necessitate return to medical care, additional&#xD;
      laboratory studies, and computed tomography (CT) of the head to rule out ICH. Texas&#xD;
      Children's Hematology Center data reveals 28% of the 473 IVIG infusions administered to&#xD;
      patients for ITP between 2010 and 2016 resulted in the report of headache or nausea/vomiting.&#xD;
      Seventy-seven percent (103/133) of these infusions resulted in the patient developing&#xD;
      symptoms sufficiently severe to cause re-evaluation by a medical provider. Subsequent urgent&#xD;
      visits often come at significant expense. Of the 133 infusions resulting in the report of&#xD;
      headache and/or nausea/vomiting, 45% (60/133) required additional lab work and 27% (36/133)&#xD;
      required imaging via CT to rule out ICH ( please see Figure 1 in the full protocol). These 36&#xD;
      patients who required urgent head CTs represent 7.6% of all IVIG infusions administered for&#xD;
      ITP between 2010 and 2016 (American Society of Hematology Conference Abstract 2018; further&#xD;
      cohort data analysis in process).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of these neurologic IVIG-associated adverse events is not well understood. It is&#xD;
      currently hypothesized that central nervous system (CNS) symptoms ranging from headache to&#xD;
      aseptic meningitis following IVIG administration may represent a spectrum of symptoms&#xD;
      secondary to IgG-mediated meningeal inflammation. This hypothesis is based off cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (CSF) analysis in patients who developed aseptic meningitis following IVIG. CSF&#xD;
      demonstrated the presence of allogeneic IgG as well as pleocytosis with neutrophil&#xD;
      predominance. As the pathophysiology underlying the development of these adverse events is&#xD;
      currently not fully understood, it is reasonable to trial the safe pediatric medications that&#xD;
      are already employed in premedication regimens. It is for this reason the investigators&#xD;
      propose the use of acetaminophen and diphenhydramine for the post-IVIG infusion medication&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no evidence-based guideline exists for the administration of prophylactic&#xD;
      medications following IVIG infusions as these specific IVIG side effects are of less concern&#xD;
      in non-thrombocytopenic patients. The 2011 American Society of Hematology ITP Clinical&#xD;
      Practice Guidelines found insufficient evidence to recommend or oppose routine premedication&#xD;
      prior to IVIG. The newly released 2019 Guidelines note that headache can be particularly&#xD;
      problematic, however they do not recommend a specific avoidance strategy. While providers&#xD;
      often pre-medicate, post-infusion medication practices are entirely physician dependent and&#xD;
      frequently involve the use of acetaminophen and diphenhydramine as symptoms arise. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that an alternative approach to post-infusion practices may alter&#xD;
      IVIG-related symptomatology, particularly those symptoms most alarming in a patient with&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia and at risk for ICH. Scheduled post-infusion medication with acetaminophen&#xD;
      and diphenhydramine may decrease the rate of worrisome symptoms in patients with ITP and&#xD;
      subsequently decrease the need to return to medical care where additional laboratory and&#xD;
      imaging studies are often performed to further assess for ICH. The ability of routine&#xD;
      post-infusion medication to decrease the rate of adverse events and subsequent return to&#xD;
      medical care has yet to be studied in patients with ITP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown whether families of children with ITP are willing to enroll in a clinical trial&#xD;
      to evaluate the effects and potential benefits of scheduled post-infusion. Additionally, it&#xD;
      is unknown to what degree adherence to scheduled post-infusion medication can be achieved. In&#xD;
      order to determine if enrollment and adherence can be achieved, the investigators plan to&#xD;
      conduct a year-long feasibility study in patients in whom IVIG is indicated for treatment of&#xD;
      bleeding symptoms and/or risk associated with ITP (Figure 2). The results of this feasibility&#xD;
      study will assess the ability to successfully conduct future comparative randomized control&#xD;
      trials (RCTs). This single-arm feasibility study with comparison to Texas Children's&#xD;
      Hematology Center historical data will also provide preliminary clinical data regarding rates&#xD;
      of return to medical care and additional medical interventions. Further RCTs will be critical&#xD;
      to determine if the number of patients who must return to care and undergo further testing&#xD;
      can be decreased with a scheduled post-infusion medication regimen. These data will inform&#xD;
      future clinical practice guidelines.&#xD;
