    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that is EGFR-mutated, who&#xD;
      have received at least 8 and not more than 12 weeks of treatment with osimertinib without&#xD;
      demonstrating disease progression, will receive APL-101 in combination with osimertinib until&#xD;
      progression. Dosing of APL-101 will be escalated until the maximum tolerated dose is&#xD;
      determined, at which point 10 additional patients will be enrolled at that dose in the&#xD;
      expansion cohort.&#xD;

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS) (Phase II only)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. Patients who neither progress nor die by the data cutoff date will be censored at the last follow up date.&#xD;
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.</description>

    <time_frame>Through completion of cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) for all Phase I participants (estimated to be 19 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective response rate as measured by the proportion of participants achieving a confirmed complete response or partial response (Phase II only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.&#xD;
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <measure>Duration of response (DOR) (Phase II only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-Measured from the time measurement criteria are met for complete response, partial response or stable disease (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS) (Phase II only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 1 year follow-up</time_frame>

             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with osimertinib in the metastatic setting (outside of osimertinib&#xD;
             given immediately prior to and during the enrollment period). Prior treatment with&#xD;

             disease-free interval between completion of adjuvant therapy with EGFR directed&#xD;
             therapy and initiation of osimertinib is more than or equal to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease refractory to osimertinib, given immediately prior to and during enrollment&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  malignancies for which all treatment was completed at least 1 year before&#xD;
                  registration and the patient has no evidence of disease; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  known indolent malignancies, or malignancies that do not require active treatment&#xD;
                  and are unlikely not alter the course of treatment of metastatic NSCLC per&#xD;

             CNS symptoms (unable to taper steroids). Patients with treated brain metastases are&#xD;
             eligible. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases prior to initiation of&#xD;
             osimertinib will be eligible to receive combination therapy as long as their disease&#xD;
             is shown to be responsive to osimertinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to APL-101, osimertinib, or other agents used in the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Decompensated heart failure or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (&lt;50%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 30 days prior to first day of study treatment (osimertinib +&#xD;
             APL-101).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poorly controlled diarrheal or gastrointestinal disorders (grade 2 or higher diarrhea,&#xD;
             nausea, or vomiting at baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unresolved grade 2 or higher treatment-related toxicities (with the exception of&#xD;
             endocrine abnormalities as a result of immunotherapies that are being managed with&#xD;
             hormonal supplementation). However, if the treating physician is under the impression&#xD;
             that the toxicity under question is unlikely to affect study participation, patient&#xD;
             eligibility can be discussed with the PI on a subject by subject basis. After&#xD;
             enrollment to this study, osimertinib-related toxicities must resolve to ≤ grade 1&#xD;
             before patient may begin combination therapy.&#xD;
