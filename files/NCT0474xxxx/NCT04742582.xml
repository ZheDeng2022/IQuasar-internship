  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial, with parallel&#xD;
      groups and reference group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the hypothesis that an immunonutritional strategy, based&#xD;
      on use of Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74-fermented formula, prevents or limits the&#xD;
      development of late-onset-sepsis in preterm infants.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      15-20% of infant born weighing less than 1500 grams develop late-onset-sepsis. The prevention&#xD;
      of sepsis is based on hygiene measures, on the prudent use of invasive procedures, on drug&#xD;
      management and on early diagnosis. However, no intervention is fully effective in reducing&#xD;
      the burden of the disease, prolonged hospitalizations in neonatal intensive care units, high&#xD;
      costs or delayed neurodevelopmental impairment. The immunonutrition is defined as the&#xD;
      potential to modulate the activity of the immune system throught use of specific nutrients.&#xD;
      Many immunonutritional approaches in pediatric age act in part with a modulation of the&#xD;
      microbiota. Functional foods derived from fermentation with probiotic strains can be used and&#xD;
      their activity is considered specific for each strain and dose dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new functional food derived from fermentation of cow's milk with Lactobacillus paracasei&#xD;
      CBA L74 has recently been de-veloped. The fermentation was started in the presence of 106&#xD;
      bacteria, reaching 5.9 X 109 colony-forming units/g after a 15-h incubation at 37 C°. After&#xD;
      heating at 85 C° for 20 s in order to inactivate the live bacteria, the formula was&#xD;
      spray-dried. Thus, the final fermented milk powder contained only bacterial bodies and&#xD;
      fermentation products and no living microorganisms. Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74 was&#xD;
      registered in the Belgian Collection BCCM/LMG and was included in the EFSA list be-tween the&#xD;
      &quot;Qualified Presumption of Safety microorganisms&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical studies showed anti-infective and anti-inflammatory properties of this new&#xD;
      fermented food. More recently, a similar effect for the L. paracasei supernatant was noted&#xD;
      after 24 and 6 h before the LPS treatment. The supernatant protects against the release of&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators IFN-ɣ and IL-12p40 and increases the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized controlled clinical trial, the daily supplementation of this fermented food&#xD;
      was shown to protect children from infectious diseases and induces immunoregulatory effects.&#xD;
      These clinical results are supported by the significant inverse correlation between the&#xD;
      concentrations of alpha-defensins, betadefensins, cathelecidins and the secretory levels of&#xD;
      IgA with the number of infectious diseases. In another clinical trial it was shown that a&#xD;
      daily supplementation of this new fermented food in healthy full-term infants can stimulate&#xD;
      the production of innate and acquired immune peptides. Finally, it was reported that milk&#xD;
      fermented by L. paracasei CBA L74 stimultes the immune and non-immune defense mechanisms&#xD;
      against sepsis, through a direct interaction with human enterocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although currently available data suggest a positive impact on morbidity, mortality and costs&#xD;
      related to neonatal sepsis, there is little knowledge on the use of this fermented functional&#xD;
      food in neonatal age. In particular, there are no studies on the effects of this&#xD;
      immunonutritional approach on pre-term infants.&#xD;
