      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Balance pro(SBT-330:trunk&#xD;
      stabilization training device) for stroke patients reduced balance ability&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      after being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will undergo a 1-week screening period to determine eligibility for study&#xD;
      entry. Subjects who pass the screening test will randomize in a 1:1 ratio to experimental&#xD;
      group(conventional rehabilitation + trunk stabilization training device, 30min each, 20days)&#xD;
      or control group(conventional rehabilitation + conventional rehabilitation, 30min each,&#xD;
      20days). And then, They receive a registration number within 7 days and proceed with the&#xD;
      pre-intervention test.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Berg Balance Scale at week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg Balance Scale(BBS) is the quantified cutoff values for the four basic gait-related activities of stroke patients. It consists of a total of 14 items, and each item is divided into 5 levels, ranging from 0 to 4 points, with a total score of 56 points. Interpretation of exercise state according to score is 0-20: Wheelchair bound. 21-40: Walking with assistance. 41-56: independent.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go test(TUG) starts with sitting in a chair and measures the time it takes to get up and walk 3 meters back to sitting on the chair.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Ambulation Category</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Ambulation Category(FAC) is a 7-point scale to evaluate the gait and mobility of patients with nervous and musculoskeletal injury. A higher score is interpreted as having higher independence of walking, and a score of 3 or less is considered difficult to move independently. It is a tool to evaluate not only balance ability but also actual mobility ability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Korean version of Modified Barthel Index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Korean version of Modified Barthel Index(K-MBI) is a tool to evaluate the patient's level of independence in daily living activities, including basic daily living activities and instrumental daily living activities. It consists of 5 to 15 points depending on the item, and the perfect score is 100 points. The higher the score, the higher the patient's level of independence from daily activities is considered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment(L/E)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment(FMA)(L/E) is an exercise ability scale to evaluate the motor function of stroke patients, and it is a tool to evaluate motor function of the healthy and injured upper and lower limbs. Each exercise item is evaluated on a 2-point scale and 3-point scale, with a perfect score of 100. In this study, lower limb evaluation items are implemented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Trunk Impairment Scale(TIS) is for the motor impairment of the trunk of a stroke patient.&#xD;
As an optimal test method, it measures static and dynamic balance and coordination between the body in a sitting position. There are a total of 17 items with 3 items for static balance ability in a sitting position, 10 items for dynamic balance ability, and 4 items for trunk coordination, and minimum 0 to maximum 23 points.</description>
