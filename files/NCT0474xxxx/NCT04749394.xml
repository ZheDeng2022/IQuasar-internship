  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-Label, multi-centre study to determine the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Camrelizumab plus apatinib in participants with unresectable Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung&#xD;
      Cancer (NSCLC), who have not progressed following platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation&#xD;
      therapy (cCRT) or sequential chemoradiation therapy (sCRT). This study will be conducted in&#xD;
      China mainland.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab plus apatinib in&#xD;
      participants with unresectable stage III NSCLC who have not progressed following definitive,&#xD;
      platinum-based cCRT or sCRT. The primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) in the&#xD;
      intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The secondary endpoints are as follows: 1) Overall survival&#xD;
      (OS); 2) 1, 2, 3-year OS rates; 3) PFS rates at 12-monthand 18-month; 4) Objective response&#xD;
      rate (ORR), 5) Duration of response (DoR); 6) Time to death or distant metastasis (TTDM); 7)&#xD;
      Adverse effects (AEs) and severe adverse effects (SAEs) ;8) Quality of life (QoL).Exploratory&#xD;
      objective is to explore potential biomarkers associated with efficacy.&#xD;
