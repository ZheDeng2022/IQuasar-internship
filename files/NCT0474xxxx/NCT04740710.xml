      The purpose of this research study is to see if breathing and attention training (BAT)&#xD;
      treatments improve pain symptoms and well-being in people who have chronic low back pain&#xD;
      (cLBP). For this breathing intervention, you will be randomly assigned to either standard or&#xD;
      focused BAT. The standard BAT includes instructions on deep breathing and relaxation. The&#xD;
      focused BAT is similar to the standard BAT in most ways but includes extra instructions to&#xD;
      help you focus and alter your breathing patterns.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the proposed pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to examine&#xD;
      the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of a 5-day breathing and attention training (BAT)&#xD;
      in a sample of 30 adults with cLBP. The secondary objective is to explore preliminary&#xD;
      clinical efficacy and potential mechanisms of the breathing interventions (focused-BAT and&#xD;
      standard-BAT), by examining changes in clinical pain outcomes and potential pain-related&#xD;
      psychological, physiological, and behavioral mediating variables. Both interventions will be&#xD;
      delivered via an audio recording in order to standardize the interventions across&#xD;
      participants and to enhance treatment fidelity. Results from this study will inform the&#xD;
      successful design and implementation of a larger RCT and provide preliminary evidence&#xD;
      regarding the potential efficacy of this breathing intervention for people with cLBP.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic low back pain consistent with recommendations of the NIH task force on cLBP&#xD;
             (i.e., participants with cLBP of at least moderate impact that has persisted on more&#xD;
             days than not over the past 3 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18-65&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic rheumatic disease/condition (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus&#xD;
             erythematosus, fibromyalgia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asthma, breathing problems, or a respiratory disorder (e.g., chronic obstructive&#xD;
             pulmonary disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Daily use of opioids. We will exclude patients using opioids daily as both continued&#xD;
             use and temporary withdrawal from these medications this could affect pain perception&#xD;
             and response to interventions. Other medications being used will be recorded and&#xD;
             controlled in statistical analyses as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (i.e. SBP/DBP of &gt; 150/95), orthostatic hypotension,&#xD;
             cardiovascular or peripheral arterial disease. These exclusions are in place primarily&#xD;
             for safety reasons, however, uncontrolled hypertension can also affect pain&#xD;
             perception, which is another reason for excluding these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurological disease (e.g. Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, vasovagal&#xD;
             syncope) or evidence of previous brain injury, including stroke and traumatic brain&#xD;
             injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious psychiatric disorder requiring hospitalization within the past 12 months or&#xD;
             characterized by active suicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current substance use disorder or history of hospitalization for treatment of&#xD;
             substance use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant comorbidities that, in the opinion of the investigators, could&#xD;
             interfere with the study or lead to deleterious effects for the patient.&#xD;
