  <brief_summary>

      The primary protocol objective is to assess the impact of substituting pulsed reduced dose&#xD;
      radiotherapy (pRDR) for standard radiation therapy in the upfront treatment of glioblastoma&#xD;
      (GBM) on disease progression.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single-center phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy of pulsed&#xD;
      reduced dose-rate radiotherapy in the initial treatment of maximally safely resected&#xD;
      glioblastoma. The primary endpoint will be progression-free survival at six months. Patients&#xD;
      with pathologically confirmed GBM who are planned for six weeks of adjuvant chemoradiation&#xD;
      followed by six to12 months of adjuvant chemotherapy will be screened and enrolled after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is&#xD;
