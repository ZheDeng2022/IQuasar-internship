  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are nearly one million veterans being treated with long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) for&#xD;
      chronic pain. Numerous short and long-term harms associated with LTOT and mounting evidence&#xD;
      suggest they have modest or no benefit. Yet, currently available resources to support&#xD;
      veterans to taper are inadequate. Primary care, where most LTOT in VHA is prescribed, is&#xD;
      overburdened and straining to meet the challenge of caring for patients with chronic pain. A&#xD;
      scalable, relatively inexpensive tapering intervention to support primary care and/or to&#xD;
      extend the reach of resource-intensive specialty clinics would be of great benefit to&#xD;
      veterans who are not deriving sufficient benefit from LTOT. As such, the goal of this study&#xD;
      is to develop and test an interactive, theory-informed, multi-component mobile website to&#xD;
      enable veterans to safely taper opioids while managing their pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a 9-month, randomized, two-arm, parallel, open-label,&#xD;
      feasibility trial of the multicomponent mobile website called SUMMIT. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to SUMMIT versus a pain monitoring app. Outcome measures will be collected&#xD;
      over 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure rigor and successful future implementation, the investigators will: 1) develop an&#xD;
      evidence based program with features proven to maximize engagement and retention; 2) ensure&#xD;
      that the program includes mechanisms to address the diverse obstacles veterans report when&#xD;
      consider opioid tapering (e.g. fear of pain flares and abandonment by the system); 3) employ&#xD;
      a User Centered Design - with meaningful input from veterans and primary care providers&#xD;
      throughout the development and testing phases; and 4) adhere to recently published guidelines&#xD;
      for mobile health interventions.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to the experimental intervention will participate in a Motivational Interviewing (MI) session lasting between 30 and 60 minutes with study psychologist. All MI sessions will be audiotaped using a VA-approved digital recorder and transcribed verbatim. Participants will subsequently be shown how to access SUMMIT via a set of unique anonymized login credentials and to navigate the components of SUMMIT on one or more devices, depending on their preference. They will then be trained on how to complete the outcome surveys.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the control intervention will use an eHealth comparator: My Pain Diary: Chronic Pain Management (iPhone, Android). This app includes a pain monitoring functioning only, and thus will only minimally overlap, if at all, with SUMMIT's components. Control participants will not participate in a MI session. Participants will download the app and be shown how to use the My Pain Diary app and trained how to complete the outcome surveys</description>
