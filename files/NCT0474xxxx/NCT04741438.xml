  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized open label study, with 2 arms treatments conducted in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic or unresectable advanced sarcoma of rare subtype; previously treated by&#xD;
      anthracycline-based regimen except for whom standard therapy does not exist or is not&#xD;
      considered appropriate by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the experimental arm, patients will receive the combination of Nivolumab + Ipilimumab for&#xD;
      a maximum of 12 months, whereas in the control arm, patients will receive Pazopanib alone for&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to know if the combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab can be more&#xD;
      efficient than Pazopanib in terms of Progression-Free Survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized open label, comparative, prospective, multicentre phase III study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned (1:1) into one of&#xD;
      the following treatments groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental arm: Nivolumab + Ipilimumab (12 months maximum)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control arm: Pazopanib alone (12 months maximum)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomization procedure will be used to obtain a balanced distribution of stratifications&#xD;
      factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of previous lines of treatment in advanced/metastatic setting: ≤1 line or &gt;1&#xD;
           line (a treatment line is defined as a treatment initiation whatever the reason)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The lymphocytes count at baseline: &lt;1 g/L or ≥1 g/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After their eligibility has been confirmed, patients will be treated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The combination of Nivolumab + Ipilimumab for 4 cycles. After completion of 4 cycles&#xD;
           with Ipilimumab, patients continue receiving nivolumab IV (480 mg Q4W) in the absence of&#xD;
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A cycle is defined as a 6-weeks period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Or Pazopanib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The planned treatment&#xD;
           duration in both arm is maximum 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of treatment, patients will be followed up within 30 days after the last&#xD;
      study treatment administration. The survival and disease status will be updated for all&#xD;
      patients at the time of the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall end of the study will be the Last Patient Last Visit (LPLV), defined as the End&#xD;
      Of Treatment (EOT) visit of the last active patient.&#xD;
