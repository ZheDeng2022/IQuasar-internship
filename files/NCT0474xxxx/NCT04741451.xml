  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the most common cause of non-traumatic disability in adults and ranks second among&#xD;
      causes of dementia and third among causes of death. In France, stroke affects around 140,000&#xD;
      patients each year and entails enormous economic costs. Given the average age of onset of&#xD;
      stroke, its prevalence is expected to increase with increasing life expectancy and the&#xD;
      advancing age of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, depending on the region of the brain affected, stroke results in a sudden and&#xD;
      abrupt onset of sensorimotor, cognitive, emotional and / or behavioral manifestations,&#xD;
      associated with variable recovery from patient to patient. Stroke has psychological, social&#xD;
      and family consequences. Indeed, its occurrence could affect patients on a physical and&#xD;
      psychological level (direct physical and cognitive sequelae of stroke, decrease or even&#xD;
      absence of autonomy and dependence of the entourage, associated psychological changes) and&#xD;
      generate repercussions on the dynamics. family or that of the couple (ie, changes in&#xD;
      activities, redistribution of tasks, changes or even inversion of roles, alteration of the&#xD;
      intimate sphere), as well as professional and social life. This could hamper the quality of&#xD;
      life of patients and their loved ones and cause collateral damage to their social or family&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge from the hospital, the patient's relatives will play a major role in taking&#xD;
      charge of home care (e.g. household activities and personal care around hygiene, food,&#xD;
      mobility and administration. treatments) as well as in the community (eg purchase of clothes&#xD;
      or food, accompaniment to medical visits), although these helpers do not have the&#xD;
      professional knowledge and skills in care. Despite the positive effects that caregivers can&#xD;
      have in connection with the care they provide (ie, feeling of accomplishment and usefulness,&#xD;
      development of a sense linked to this helping role, better self-esteem, improvement of&#xD;
      personal skills), their continued investment in their sick relatives could deprive them of&#xD;
      their resources, making them &quot;hidden or invisible patients / victims&quot;. In addition, the gap&#xD;
      between caregiver capacities to provide care and the health needs of patients could result in&#xD;
      caregiver burden (i.e., caregiving burden). Caregivers of stroke patients experience an&#xD;
      impaired quality of life, neglect of their own health, reduced work and leisure activities,&#xD;
      as well as psychological suffering involving feelings of abandonment, loneliness and&#xD;
      helplessness. uncertainty. In the context of a stroke, caregivers may be overwhelmed by the&#xD;
      emotions of their ill loved ones as well as their own emotions. Emotional regulation is&#xD;
      essential in such a context rich in emotional experience; it is the set of strategies that&#xD;
      enables individuals to influence the emotions they feel, when they appear, and how they&#xD;
      experience and express them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reviews of the literature have highlighted the lack of studies addressing the burden on&#xD;
      caregivers and the need for research to identify those at risk and implement appropriate&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No French study has specifically addressed the notion of the burden of caregivers of stroke&#xD;
      patients, their coping strategies, their experiences or emotional regulations. This type of&#xD;
      study would however constitute a step towards the design and implementation of personalized&#xD;
      care (eg: psychotherapies), by strengthening effective / adaptive strategies and modifying&#xD;
      those which are less effective / poorly adaptive. This could improve the well-being of&#xD;
      caregivers and their sick relatives, and direct health policies to reduce the economic impact&#xD;
      of this aid.&#xD;
