  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study will test the effectiveness of a simplified approach to delivering Hepatitis C&#xD;
      Virus (HCV) care in a street-based mobile medical clinic among people who inject drugs in&#xD;
      increasing treatment initiation, retention, and cure. Rates of HCV treatment initiation,&#xD;
      retention, and cure will be compared between patients offered the simplified approach to&#xD;
      delivering HCV care in a mobile medical clinic versus those who are linked to a community&#xD;
      clinic delivering a current practice of usual care. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      simplified approach to delivering HCV care in a street-based mobile medical clinic will&#xD;
      result in higher treatment initiation, retention, and cure than the current practice of usual&#xD;
      care in community clinics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With as many as 2.4 million Americans affected by chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), it is one&#xD;
      of the most common blood-borne diseases in the United States. Nationwide, rates of new&#xD;
      infections have risen dramatically among young adults in their 20s and 30s, the same cohorts&#xD;
      most affected by the opioid epidemic, with as many as 70% of new infections related to&#xD;
      injection drug use. Local/regional rates of new infection mirror these national surveillance&#xD;
      findings. In San Diego, between 2011 and 2016, women aged 20-29 experienced a 62.2% increase&#xD;
      in new HCV infections, while new infections among men aged 20-29 spiked 46.6%, with injection&#xD;
      drug use cited as the most common form of transmission. Expanded prevalence estimates&#xD;
      indicate a population prevalence rate for HCV of 2.0% to 2.7% in San Diego County, suggesting&#xD;
      that approximately 65,000 to 88,000 individuals in the region are likely HCV-infected. These&#xD;
      alarming increases in new HCV infections demand effective treatment delivered to populations&#xD;
      that historically have been difficult to reach and are characterized by disparities in HCV&#xD;
      screening, linkage to care, and treatment access due to a constellation of barriers to care.&#xD;
      Advances in HCV treatment and care (e.g., the development of highly effective direct-acting&#xD;
      antivirals--DAAs) show promise for treating these populations and have led to worldwide HCV&#xD;
      elimination goals, as well as local/regional elimination campaigns. While the American&#xD;
      Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases Society of America&#xD;
      (AASLD/IDSA)'s guidelines have long been considered the gold standard for HCV diagnosis,&#xD;
      workup, and treatment (and remain appropriate for HCV specialists, especially in complex&#xD;
      cases of HCV infection) recent World Health Organization (WHO) HCV guidelines and published&#xD;
      consensus statements call for implementation of streamlined and simplified algorithms for HCV&#xD;
      care, delivered in an integrated primary care setting. They highlight that most patients,&#xD;
      particularly younger people who inject drugs (PWID), have a low risk of cirrhosis, do not&#xD;
      require genotyping if treated with pangenotypic regimens, and may be lost to follow-up due to&#xD;
      overly complex, time-intensive, and costly evaluations. Furthermore, emerging evidence&#xD;
      indicates that PWID achieve the same high cure rates as non-injection drug user patients when&#xD;
      treated with DAAs. While research indicates that DAAs have high efficacy and safety and can&#xD;
      now be used by primary care providers to treat HCV there are still groups, especially PWID,&#xD;
      who experience treatment disparities due to access and treatment barriers. Limited evidence&#xD;
      exists to support the effectiveness of expanding screening and treatment access via the use&#xD;
      of mobile medical clinics co-located with services for PWID. Only one study to date has shown&#xD;
      that point of care testing in a mobile medical clinic resulted in significantly higher rates&#xD;
      of HCV infected patients being linked to HCV treatment in 30 days compared to standard&#xD;
      phlebotomy HCV testing. Therefore, the proposed study will test the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      simplified HCV algorithm with integrated care (including the offer of buprenorphine&#xD;
      prescriptions and abscess care), in a street-based mobile clinic setting among PWID, in&#xD;
      increasing treatment initiation and retention rates. Rates of HCV treatment initiation and&#xD;
      retention will be compared between patients offered a simplified HCV care in a mobile medical&#xD;
      clinic versus those who are linked to the current practice of usual care in community&#xD;
      clinics.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A pragmatic quality improvement randomized controlled trial will be conducted among 200 people who inject drugs (PWID) with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), age â‰¥18 years, recruited from Family Health Centers of San Diego's mobile clean syringe exchange program (CSEP). Patients will be recruited to undergo HCV testing. Patients with a positive HCV Ab rapid finger stick test will be randomly allocated (ratio 1:1) to receiving treatment immediately in a mobile medical clinic (n=100) or in a community clinic (n=100, this will serve as a concurrent control group).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, international normalized ratio, HCV RNA, hepatitis B virus (HBV) serologies, point of care HIV test, and point of care liver fibrosis measurement. HCV genotype if required by patient's insurance for prior authorization. Care for opioid use disorder and skin infection is offered. Completion of the initial visit workup is sufficient to initiate a prior authorization request for DAAs from payers and an appointment for MAT follow-up in a community clinic if indicated. Patient coordination; authorization with insurance companies; scheduling appointments, follow-up, and ancillary support services will be conducted by a Patient Navigator. Patients are seen every 2-4 weeks for monitoring and adherence support. HCV treatment regimens are at the discretion of the treating provider in accordance with AASLD/IDSA guidelines and insurance requirements. Twelve weeks after HCV therapy completion, SVR12 HCV RNA and SVR12 CMP tests will be obtained.</description>
