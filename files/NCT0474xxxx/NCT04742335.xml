  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the pain, occupational fatigue, sleep and quality of life&#xD;
      in nurses and the relationships between them. 102 participants working as nurses were&#xD;
      included in the study. Data on age, gender, height, weight, working year in the profession,&#xD;
      weekly working hours, hand dominance, diagnosed diseases and marital status of the&#xD;
      participants were collected. Subsequently, the questions included in the Nordic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal questionnaire, occupational fatigue / burnout / recovery scale (OFER), sleep&#xD;
      hygiene index (SHI) and World Health Organization quality of life scale (WHOQOL-BREF)&#xD;
      questionnaires were answered by the participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire: It is a scale that evaluates whether symptoms of pain,&#xD;
      pain and discomfort have been experienced in the neck, shoulder, elbow, hand-wrist, waist,&#xD;
      back, hip-thigh, knee-foot-ankle regions during the last 12 months and whether ordinary&#xD;
      indoor and outdoor activities are hampered by these symptoms and whether there has been pain&#xD;
      in the mentioned body areas for the last 7 days. It consists of 27 items and each item is&#xD;
      answered as yes / no.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational Fatigue Exhaustion Recovery Scale: It is a scale developed to measure&#xD;
      occupational fatigue. It consists of 15 items in total and 3 sub-dimensions evaluating&#xD;
      chronic fatigue (questions 1-5), acute fatigue (questions 6-10) and recovery (questions&#xD;
      11-15). Each item is scored between 0-6 points (0 = Strongly Disagree, 1 = Disagree, 2 =&#xD;
      Somewhat Disagree, 3 = Neither agree nor disagree, 4 = slightly agree, 5 = Agree, 6 =&#xD;
      Strongly Agree) by the participants. High scores in the chronic and acute fatigue&#xD;
      sub-dimensions mean higher occupational fatigue, and higher scores in the recovery&#xD;
      sub-dimension mean better recovery between working periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Hygiene Index: It is a scale that evaluates sleep hygiene. The frequencies of sleep&#xD;
      hygiene-related behaviors are questioned in a total of 13 items with a Likert-type scale&#xD;
      where each item is scored between 0 and 4 (0 = never, 1 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5&#xD;
      = always). Higher scores indicate worse sleep hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHOQOL-BREF-TR: It is a scale that evaluates the well-being of individuals in 4 sub-areas in&#xD;
      which physical health, psychological status, social relations and environmental conditions&#xD;
      are questioned, and their general quality of life and health status with one question. Each&#xD;
      item is scored on a 1-5 Likert-type scale. Sub-domain scores represent the quality of life in&#xD;
      their field independently of each other. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.&#xD;
