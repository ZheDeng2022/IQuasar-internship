  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HIP ATTACK-2 trial is a multicentre, international, parallel group randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to determine whether accelerated surgery for hip fracture in patients with acute&#xD;
      myocardial injury is superior to standard care in reducing death at 90 days after&#xD;
      randomization. The trial will also assess secondary outcomes at 90 days after randomization:&#xD;
      inability to independently walk 3 metres, time to first mobilization (first standing and&#xD;
      first full weight bear), composite and individual assessment of major complications (e.g.,&#xD;
      mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, acute congestive heart failure, and stroke),&#xD;
      delirium, length of stay, pain, and quality of life.&#xD;

The PHRI believes the dissemination of clinical research results is vital and sharing of data is important. PHRI prioritizes access to data analyses to researchers who have worked on the trial for a significant duration, have played substantial roles, and have participated in raising the funds to conduct the trial. PHRI balances the length of the research study, and the intellectual and financial investments that made it possible with the need to allow wider access to the data collected.
