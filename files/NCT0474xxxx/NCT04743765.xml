  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HIP ATTACK-2 trial is a multicentre, international, parallel group randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to determine whether accelerated surgery for hip fracture in patients with acute&#xD;
      myocardial injury is superior to standard care in reducing death at 90 days after&#xD;
      randomization. The trial will also assess secondary outcomes at 90 days after randomization:&#xD;
      inability to independently walk 3 metres, time to first mobilization (first standing and&#xD;
      first full weight bear), composite and individual assessment of major complications (e.g.,&#xD;
      mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, acute congestive heart failure, and stroke),&#xD;
      delirium, length of stay, pain, and quality of life.&#xD;
