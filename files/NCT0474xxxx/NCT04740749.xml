  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the treatment of malignant bone tumors, it may be necessary to remove large areas of the&#xD;
      femur. To replace these large parts of missing bone, a prosthesis can be used. One innovative&#xD;
      technology developed by Biomet is the Compress速 Compliant Pre-Stress System (CPS;&#xD;
      Zimmer-Biomet, Warsaw, USA). This fixation device uses compression, via a short traction bar,&#xD;
      to stimulate osteointegration at the bone-prosthetic interface, promote hypertrophy of the&#xD;
      loaded bone, and avoid stress bypass of the host bone around a stiff intramedullary stem.&#xD;
      Young patients cured of tumors have a long life expectancy and a compelling need for&#xD;
      prosthetic fixation that is equally durable. Good bone fixation is a prerequisite for implant&#xD;
      longevity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the initial results are encouraging, there is a need for additional mid- to&#xD;
      long-term survival data from larger patient series showing longevity of the system, as well&#xD;
      as reporting of functional outcome. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no study&#xD;
      examining the survival of the device using prospective data already exists. In addition, no&#xD;
      studies were found examining the quality of life of the patients with the CPS system.&#xD;

      longevity. Since 1999, the CPS has been routinely placed on the orthopedics - UZ Leuven&#xD;
      service and, as a result, more than 100 patients have been treated in this way. However,&#xD;
      there are only few studies reporting on long-term performance of this system. In addition,&#xD;
      limited data reporting functional outcome were found.&#xD;
