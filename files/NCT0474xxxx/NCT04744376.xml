  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical operations and recovery after anesthesia is a complex process. Studies examining the&#xD;
      interventions performed in the preoperative period often focus on classical clinical outcomes&#xD;
      such as postoperative organ dysfunction, morbidity or complications. Postoperative recovery&#xD;
      of the patient is rarely considered the most important outcome variable in interventional&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the Quality of recovery 15 (QoR - 15) questionnaire that measures the recovery&#xD;
      score, and the American college of surgeons surgical risk calculator have been used to&#xD;
      compare the predictive values of patient's preoperative condition on postoperative recovery&#xD;
      period and possible morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

      Surgical operations and recovery after anesthesia is a complex process. Studies examining the&#xD;
      interventions performed in the preoperative period often focus on classical clinical outcomes&#xD;
      such as postoperative organ dysfunction, morbidity or complications. Postoperative recovery&#xD;
      of the patient is rarely considered the most important outcome variable in interventional&#xD;
      studies. In this study, the effects of both preoperative patient condition and postoperative&#xD;
      recovery on morbidity and mortality are investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the ability of QoR - 15 to predict postoperative complications patients&#xD;
      who underwent major abdominal surgery, patients answer the Quality of Recovery 15&#xD;
      questionnaire both in the preoperative and postoperative periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the risk of postoperative complications is calculated in the preoperative period&#xD;
      with the American college of surgeons (ACS) surgical risk calculator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, postoperative complications of all patients are recorded according to Clavien Dindo&#xD;
      classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal is to understand the predictive value of the QOR15 score on postoperative&#xD;
      complications. Secondarily, it is to compare of predictive values of QoR15 with ACS risk&#xD;
      calculator on morbidity and mortality. Another secondary aim is to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      preoperative conditions of patients on postoperative recovery.&#xD;
