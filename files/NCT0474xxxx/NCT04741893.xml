  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Faecal incontinence (FI) is characterized by involuntary loss of rectal content through the&#xD;
      anal canal. FI is psychologically and socially debilitating problem that can dramatically&#xD;
      affect patient's quality of life, often in otherwise healthy individual. FI can occur as a&#xD;
      result of obstetric sphincter injury, surgery, irradiation, anorectal malformations as well&#xD;
      as neurological, connective tissue or endocrine disorders. Currently management options for&#xD;
      these patients are limited, partly due to the fact that control of defaecation and continence&#xD;
      is multifactorial but also due to the fact that FI is difficult to identify the exact cause&#xD;
      of patients' incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current assessment of patients with FI include endoscopic assessment to rule out intraluminal&#xD;
      organic cause for patients' symptoms, endoanal ultrasound scan / MRI to assess their pelvic&#xD;
      floor anatomy and anorectal manometry to assess anorectal function. Anorectal manometry is a&#xD;
      simple test to perform but Anorectal manometry is susceptible to measurement artifacts, with&#xD;
      a high inter-individual variation with significant overlap between healthy asymptomatic and&#xD;
      symptomatic patients with FI. Harris et al in 1966 suggested that the anal sphincter's&#xD;
      resistance to distension that may be of importance for sphincter competence, not how tight&#xD;
      anal sphincter can squeeze.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoluminal Functional Lumen Imaging Probe (EndoFLIP©) is a novel technology used to measure&#xD;
      the dimensions and function of a hollow organ. Limited publication so far has shown that&#xD;
      EndoFLIP© provides a new way of assessing anal sphincter competence. The study is to assess&#xD;
      the use of EndoFLIP© to assess anal sphincter function in Hong Kong population. Firstly to&#xD;
      evaluate whether age has an effect on the distensibility of the anal sphincter and its&#xD;
      function and secondly to compare between symptomatic patients with faecal incontinence and&#xD;
      asymptomatic healthy subjects.&#xD;
