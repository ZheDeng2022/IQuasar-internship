  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the SPF of two test materials ChapStick Moisturizer,&#xD;
      Classic Flavor and ChapStick Moisturizer, Strawberry Flavor using the methodology described&#xD;
      in the International Standard Test Method. This static methodology also meets the&#xD;
      requirements of the Australia/New Zealand standard.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-center, randomized, evaluator blind, intra-individual comparison, no treatment and&#xD;
      positive controlled clinical study to determine the SPF of two ChapStick sunscreen-containing&#xD;
      lip balms as per ISO 24444:2010. For each participant, 4 test sites will have a random&#xD;
      assignment number for up to two test materials, control standard, and minimal erythemal dose&#xD;
      of unprotected skin (MEDu), with at least 3 of the test sites being utilized for application.&#xD;
      All three test sites will be exposed to UV radiation at the expected MED and subsequently&#xD;
      evaluated for erythema 16-24 hours after UV exposure.&#xD;

    <measure>Arithmetic Mean of Individual Sun Protection Factor (SPFi) Values</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours post UV exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Arithmetic mean of all valid SPFi values of each product on each participant will be calculated from the individual Minimal Erythemal Dose (MED) on product treated (MEDp) test sites in relation to unprotected (MEDu) test sites 16-24 hours after exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. SPFi = MEDp/MEDu. No inferential statistical analysis will be performed for this outcome. The MED is defined as the lowest dose of UV radiation that produces the first perceptible unambiguous erythema with defined borders appearing over most of the field of UV exposure. The exposure shall be increased in geometric progression with 25% dose increment in relation to the expected SPF values. All individual SPF values will be converted arithmetically to calculate SPF of test material (or control standard).</description>
