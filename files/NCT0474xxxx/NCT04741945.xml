    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 single-arm pilot study of the efficacy and safety of metformin in patients&#xD;
      with clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS) or lower-risk myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome (MDS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research plan is divided into three work packages (WP):&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP0, Bone Marrow Adipose Tissue (BMAT) in CCUS and LR-MDS Patients: The primary objective of&#xD;
      WP0 is to determine if patients with CCUS or LR-MDS have increased BMAT compared to&#xD;
      age-matched healthy controls. To investigate this, we will include 12 elderly (≥60 years)&#xD;
      healthy controls who will have their BMAT measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).&#xD;
      These will be compared to the BMAT measurements from baseline of patients described in WP1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP1, The efficacy of metformin in CCUS and LR-MDS: In WP1, 24 patients with either CCUS or&#xD;
      MDS will receive metformin 2000 mg/daily for 12 months with a slow-up-titration of the dose&#xD;
      14 days prior to full-dose treatment. Outcomes of WP1 are listed in the outcome section on&#xD;
      this site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP2, The efficacy of metformin compared to placebo and vitamin C: The primary objective of&#xD;
      WP2 is to compare the effect of metformin in CCUS and LR-MDS to the effect of placebo or&#xD;
      vitamin C treatment. To investigate this, we will include data and samples from 48 historical&#xD;
      controls from our EVI-2 study (NCT03999723. Half of the controls received placebo for 12&#xD;
      months and the other half received vitamin C for 12 months.&#xD;
