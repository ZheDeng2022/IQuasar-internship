  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic alkalosis (MA) is the most common acid-base disorder and when it's severe it can&#xD;
      have effects on cellular function and contribute to an increase in mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MA is a common complication of heart failure (HF) especially when patients are treated with&#xD;
      diuretics, but few studies have analyzed the prevalence of acid-base disorders in patients&#xD;
      with HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these studies have shown that MA is more common in patients with HF in more advanced&#xD;
      stages and that the use of diuretics increases the prevalence of MA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis, based on clinical experience and the few data that exist in the&#xD;
      scientific literature, is that MA is a frequent analytical disorder in patients admitted for&#xD;
      decompensated HF and that its presence entails a worse short-term vital prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ALCALOTIC study is an observational cohort and prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the study are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the prevalence of MA in patients admitted for decompensated HF&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To analyze if there are differences in patients admitted for HF according to the&#xD;
           presence of MA on admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if the presence of MA has an influence on the short-term prognosis in&#xD;
           patients admitted for decompensated HF&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient admitted for decompensated HF (main admission diagnosis), who meet the&#xD;
             diagnostic criteria of the 2016 European HF Guidelines and who sign the informed&#xD;
             consent to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must give their written consent to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose main reason for admission is not decompensated HF. Those patients who&#xD;
             are admitted for another reason and who also have decompensated HF secondarily cannot&#xD;
             be included&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who do not strictly meet the diagnostic criteria for HF of the European HF&#xD;
             Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients for whom analytical values are not available in relation to acid-base balance&#xD;
             at the time of admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a pathological history that can clearly justify metabolic alkalosis,&#xD;
             such as primary or secondary hyperaldosterism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who were taking sodium bicarbonate prior to admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with factors present at admission that may justify the presence of metabolis&#xD;
             alkalosis: vomiting, diarrea, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who do not give their consent to participate in the study&#xD;
