    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to find the effects of Positional Release Technique (PRT) on&#xD;
      pain, range of motion and neck disability index in patients with myofascial trigger points&#xD;
      (MTRPs) of the upper trapezius with forward head posture (FHP). A Randomized control trial is&#xD;
      conducted at Tehsil Head Quater (THQ) Civil hospital Wazirabad. The sample size is calculated&#xD;
      through open epi tool is 32. The subjects are divided in two groups, 16 participants in&#xD;
      experimental group and 16 in control group. The study duration is of six months. Sampling&#xD;
      technique applied is purposive non probability sampling technique. Only 18-45 years&#xD;
      participants with myofascial trigger points of the upper trapezius is included. Tools used in&#xD;
      the study are Visual analog scale (VAS), Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT), active cervical&#xD;
      contra-lateral flexion (ACLF), Cranio vertebral angle (CVA) and neck disability index (NDI).&#xD;
      Data analyzed through Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Muscular and skeletal structures can change into an incorrect shape due to a reduction in&#xD;
      physical activity and inappropriate posture habits in daily living. Kong YS et al defined&#xD;
      Forward head posture (FHP) as a posture that adopts upper cervical extension and lower&#xD;
      cervical flexion. The center of gravity of the head in this posture is positioned at the&#xD;
      front rather than the vertebral body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FHP weakens the deep cervical flexor muscle, the mid thoracic rhomboid muscle for scapular&#xD;
      retraction, and the mid and lower trapezius muscles. FHP also shortens the pectoralis major&#xD;
      and neck extension muscles. Upper trapezius muscle activity is increased more in FHP than in&#xD;
      correct anatomic positions, and most patients complain of pain from muscle overuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The craniovertebral angle (CVA) is defined as an angle made by the intersection of a line&#xD;
      joining the midpoint of the tragus of ear to the skin overlying the C7 spinous process and a&#xD;
      horizontal line passing through the C7 spinous process. There is a correlation between FHP,&#xD;
      neck pain, and CVA. One of the studies reported that subjects having smaller CVA had FHP and&#xD;
      were prone to have increased severity of neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D'souza CJ et al stated that positional Release Therapy (PRT) is a noninvasive treatment&#xD;
      which can be used in conjunction with several electrical modalities. In this technique, in&#xD;
      order to facilitate restoration of normal tissue length and to treat excessive muscle tension&#xD;
      or spasm, tissues are placed in a Position of comfort for a brief period (90 sec) to resolve&#xD;
      the associated dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2017 a study conducted which shows that PRT has beneficial effects on myofascial trigger&#xD;
      points (MTrPs). In this regard, Kelencz et al. reported that PRT is effective in reducing&#xD;
      pain and muscle tension among patients with upper-trapezius MTrPs. Amini A et al studied on&#xD;
      30 female university students, who were identified with latent MTrPs of the upper trapezius,&#xD;
      according to the results, both Manual Passive Muscle Shortening (MPMS) and PRT were effective&#xD;
      techniques in immediate pain relief of upper-trapezius MTrPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kojidi MM et al concluded that Positional Release Therapy was found to be effective in&#xD;
      reducing pain and increasing Pressure pain threshold in three treatment sessions in 19-45&#xD;
      year-old female computer users with at least 2 h of work and with latent upper trapezius&#xD;
      trigger points. Mohamadi M et al state that PRT is a potential treatment option with no&#xD;
      reported side effects for patients with Tension Type Headache (TTH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, PRT and Therapeutic Massage were both successful at decreasing MTrP sensitivity&#xD;
      and stiffness. However, there appeared to be a slight benefit for pain reduction with PRT up&#xD;
      to 2 days post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Varshney K et al concluded that the patients who received positional release therapy along&#xD;
      with moist heat pack has more impact on pain and disability as compared to those received&#xD;
      deep transverse friction massage along with moist heat pack follow-up 4 weeks protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study concluded that the difference from 1st to 21th day in VAS &amp;NDI score which shows that&#xD;
      Positional release therapy (PRT) is more effective than conventional Physiotherapeutic&#xD;
      intervention in order to decrease pain and disability in patients with no-specific neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manzoor S et al treated a 62 year female who was suffering tension type headache from last 14&#xD;
      months was treated by combined positional release therapy and ischemic compression in 6&#xD;
      sessions, concluded that combination of positional stretch and Ischemic compression is&#xD;
      effective treatment for patients with trigger points in cervical muscles, most commonly upper&#xD;
      trapezius and sternocleidomastoid causing cervicogenic headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is poor evidence regarding the effects of PRT on MTRPs with forward head posture on&#xD;
      Cranio-vertebral angle. So this study aims to find the effectiveness of PRT for myofascial&#xD;
      trigger points of the upper trapezius with forward head posture as there is less literature&#xD;
      available about the gender based effect of PRT, as most of the studies have done on female&#xD;
      population, basically this study will target the effect of PRT on male computer users with&#xD;
      FHP on Pain, ROM, disability and Cranio vertebral angle.&#xD;

    <description>Changes from base line Northwick disability index was developed first in Northwick Park hospital, England. It was designed to measure the neck pain and disability over time. It consists of 10, five parts sections. At the end, score is calculated by dividing the obtained score by total (50) multiplied by 100. Each section is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No pain' and 5 means 'Worst imaginable pain'.</description>
