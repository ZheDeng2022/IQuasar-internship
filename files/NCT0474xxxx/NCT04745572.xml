  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 16-week study will use an experimental approach called the Sequential Multiple&#xD;
      Assignment Randomized Trial to help determine which combination and sequence of weight loss&#xD;
      program features are most effective in people who are at risk for type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Participants in the study will be initially randomized to consume either a high or reduced&#xD;
      carbohydrate diet. After 4 weeks, participants will be identified as Responders (6% weight&#xD;
      loss) or Non-Responders (&lt;6% weight loss). Responders will continue with their initial&#xD;
      randomized group for the remainder of the trial. Non-responders will be re-randomized to 2nd&#xD;
      stage interventions of either including additional exercise counseling and training or&#xD;
      beginning a time restricted eating protocol for the remainder of the trial.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to this group will participate in the State of Slim (SOS) weight management program and consume a high carbohydrate (HC) diet. Because this protocol uses a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design, response will be assessed at week 4. Responders will continue with their 1st stage assignment for the remainder of the study. Non-responders will be randomized to 2nd stage intervention of either combine HC diet with time-restricted eating (TRE) or HC diet with structured exercise counseling sessions (2 days per week).</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this group will participate in the State of Slim (SOS) weight management program and consume a reduced carbohydrate (RC) diet. Because this is a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design, response will be assessed at week 4.
