      The investigators will investigate the existence of alcohol drinking among children living&#xD;
      under adult supervision and care, living within the communities. The investigators will focus&#xD;
      on the age group 6-13 years overlapping with the recommended age for primary school&#xD;
      attendance. The project is approaching the research topic using quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      methods. The TREAT C-AUD research project will therefore document to which degree alcohol&#xD;
      drinking is a problem among children in Mbale, Eastern Uganda.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uganda has as many other sub-Saharan countries high alcohol consumption per capita and&#xD;
      traditions for home brewing. The TREAT C-AUD research project, with partners from Makerere&#xD;
      University in Uganda, University of Bergen and Norwegian University of Science and Technology&#xD;
      in Norway, will investigate the existence of alcohol drinking among children living under&#xD;
      adult supervision and care, living within the communities. The investigators will focus on&#xD;
      the age group 6-13 years overlapping with the recommended age for primary school attendance.&#xD;
      The project is approaching the research topic from comprehensive perspectives including a&#xD;
      large cross-sectional study, interviews with parents and carers, children and stakeholders in&#xD;
      the communities, schools and in the health system. The investigators have been including&#xD;
      community representatives, expert groups, user groups and stakeholders in the development of&#xD;
      screening tools and will do so in interpreting and disseminating the results. The&#xD;
      investigators have to take the Covid-19 situation into account both with regard to its effect&#xD;
      on the research question at stake and the methods used. The TREAT C-AUD research project will&#xD;
      therefore document to which degree alcohol drinking is a problem among children in the&#xD;
      communities in Mbale District, Eastern Ugandan. The data collection is capturing cofactors&#xD;
      such as other substance use, mental health, parenting, trauma, nutrition and growth. The&#xD;
      development of alcohol assessment tools can be used by the health- and school-system for&#xD;
      detection and handling of children having problems with alcohol. The investigators will&#xD;
      collaborate closely with services in case of identification of children suffering severe harm&#xD;
      and adhere to Good Clinical Practice guidelines for ethical conduct, the consent procedure,&#xD;
      follow-up and referral.&#xD;
