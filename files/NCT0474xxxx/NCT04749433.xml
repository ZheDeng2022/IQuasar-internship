      The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety of using the&#xD;
      [5-cyano-N-(4-(4-[11C]Methylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-(Piperidin-1-yl)Phenyl)Furan-2-carboxamide]&#xD;
      ([11C]CPPC) radiotracer in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of people with&#xD;
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The investigators are also interested to see whether use&#xD;
      of this radiotracer reveals imaging differences between patients with ALS and healthy&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study of safety and tolerability of an investigational radiotracer drug&#xD;
      called&#xD;
      [5-cyano-N-(4-(4-[11C]Methylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-(Piperidin-1-yl)Phenyl)Furan-2-carboxamide]&#xD;
      ([11C]CPPC). A radiotracer is a substance that chemically marks certain structures in the&#xD;
      body. In this case, [11C]CPPC highlights structures expressing colony stimulating factor&#xD;
      receptor (CSF1R), a receptor that is expressed on microglial cells. A safety and tolerability&#xD;
      study is looking to see if there are any unanticipated, possibly harmful, effects of the use&#xD;
      of the radiotracer in humans. However, ultimately, the investigators would like to know if&#xD;
      this drug can be used to make better images of the brain for patients with amyotrophic&#xD;
      lateral sclerosis (ALS), which could help doctors better understand the disease and help take&#xD;
      care of patients with ALS. This study will use a radiotracer to look for a chemical receptor&#xD;
      which ALS patients have more of in the brain. After receiving the radiotracer, participants'&#xD;
      brains will be scanned with a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging machine.&#xD;
