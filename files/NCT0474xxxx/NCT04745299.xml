    <textblock>
      ALSUMMIT is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, parallel, phase III&#xD;
      clinical trial to evaluate and confirm the efficacy and long-term safety of repeated&#xD;
      Lenzumestrocel (Neuronata-R® inj.) treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by&#xD;
      selective and progressive loss of motor neurons. Disease progression leads to death within&#xD;
      2-4 years, but there exists no definite treatment so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on phase I/II clinical trial(NCT01363401), twice intrathecal autologous bone&#xD;
      marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Lenzumestrocel) injections showed significant&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit lasting at least six months with safety in patients with ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the switch from pro- to anti-inflammatory conditions, which was indicated from&#xD;
      the inverse correlation between TGF-β1 and MCP-1 levels after Lenzumestrocel injections in&#xD;
      the good responder, has been considered a plausible beneficial action mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to investigate the following. First, to reconfirm and evaluate the&#xD;
      long-term efficacy of twice injections (single cycle) of Lenzumestrocel, group 1 will receive&#xD;
      a single cycle injection with a 26-day interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of Lenzumestrocel repeated injections,&#xD;
      group 2 will receive a single cycle injection a 26-day apart followed by three times&#xD;
      injections every three-month interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 will receive comparator injections.&#xD;

    <description>Joint rank score is derived from Combined Assessment of Function and Survival. Functional assessment is based on ALSFRS-R scores and survival assessment is based on the period from randomization to physical death. Joint rank score will be calculated with ALSFRS-R score data and survival. For each pairwise comparison, a study participant is assigned a score and then the summed scores are ranked for all participants.&#xD;
The higher ranking, the higher score, and the lower ranking, the lower score. And the average rank score is then calculated for each treatment group. A higher mean rank score indicates that participants in that treatment group, on average, fared better.&#xD;

    <time_frame>at 12 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>ALSFRS-R is an instrument designed to evaluate functional status of subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease), such as gross motor activity, fine motor activity, bulbar function and respiration function. It consists of 12 items; 3 items for mouth functions, 4 items for upper limb and overall fine motor functions, 2 items for lower limb functions and 3 items for respiration functions. Each item is evaluated in 5-point scale (0~4). A higher score means a better functional status.&#xD;
