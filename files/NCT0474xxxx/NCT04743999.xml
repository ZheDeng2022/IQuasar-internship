      Background: Patients with FIGO stage III endometrial carcinoma often require multimodality&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy to improve survival and recurrence rates; however, the optimal adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy sequence is yet to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have tried to answer this question including RTOG 9708, PORTEC-3, and GOG&#xD;
      258. Collectively, these studies show that concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (chemoRT)&#xD;
      with cisplatin followed by additional chemotherapy (CT) and CT alone are acceptable regimens.&#xD;
      However, both strategies show that distant recurrence remains a problem when CT is delayed&#xD;
      after RT, and local control is compromised without RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective study from Washington University included women with advanced endometrial&#xD;
      carcinoma who received carboplatin/paclitaxel concurrent with RT. Thirty-four patients&#xD;
      experienced grade 3-4 toxicities. They found a median PFS of 42.8 months, median OS of 44.9&#xD;
      months, and 3-year OS of 80%. This study suggests that this regimen is safe with favorable&#xD;
      response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building off the above studies, we wish to prospectively assess outcomes of women with&#xD;
      advanced endometrial carcinoma who receive concurrent chemoRT with a&#xD;
      carboplatin/paclitaxel-based regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A total of 60 patients with FIGO stage III uterine carcinoma will be prospectively&#xD;
      enrolled after undergoing surgical staging (currently accruing). CT will start approximately&#xD;
      4 weeks after surgery. Patients will receive 6 cycles of carboplatin (AUC 6) and paclitaxel&#xD;
      (175 mg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT will be given during CT cycles 1-3. External beam RT will be given via intensity-modulated&#xD;
      RT in once-daily fractions of 1.8-2.0 Gy for a total dose of 44-45 Gy to the pelvis (vaginal&#xD;
      cuff, pelvic LN, and para-aortic lymph nodes). If there is grossly visible nodal disease seen&#xD;
      at the time of treatment planning, a boost to 54 Gy will be given to those areas. If the&#xD;
      patient has cervical stromal invasion, we will recommend that she receive a brachytherapy&#xD;
      boost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on OS and PFS endpoints. Data will also be collected on provider- and&#xD;
      patient-reported treatment toxicity. Patients will receive a series of questionnaires at&#xD;
      baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. These are prospectively-validated&#xD;
      questionnaires and include FACT-G, FACT-En, FACT/GOG-NTX, and FACT-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistical analyses, continuous and categorical variables will be analyzed. Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      survival estimates will be calculated for local control and survival end points. For each&#xD;
      patient, disease characteristics and adjuvant treatment will be placed in a simple logistic&#xD;
      regression model for predicting survival endpoints. A multivariate analysis will be performed&#xD;
      for exploratory purposes. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. Tests&#xD;
      will be considered significant at p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;

      Purpose: To prospectively determine patients' quality of life (QOL) and treatment-related&#xD;
      toxicity outcomes with adjuvant multimodality treatment (chemotherapy and radiation&#xD;
      treatment) in women with advanced endometrial carcinoma after surgical staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To prospectively determine QOL after adjuvant treatment using the&#xD;
           prospectively-validated FACT questionnaires at baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after&#xD;
           surgical staging&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To prospectively determine the rate of any grade 2 or higher treatment-related side&#xD;
           effects: mainly bone marrow suppression, lymphedema, diarrhea, and others. Additionally,&#xD;
           we will collect information about the rate of completion of planned adjuvant treatment&#xD;
           (number of chemotherapy cycles, dose reduction or chemotherapy delay, radiation&#xD;
           treatment interruption, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To prospectively collect survival outcome endpoints after adjuvant treatment&#xD;
           (recurrence-free, disease-specific and overall survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction and Rationale: Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in&#xD;
      the United States and ranks second in gynecologic cancer mortality following only ovarian&#xD;
      cancer. More than 84% of patients present with International Federation of Gynecology and&#xD;
      Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I-II disease. By definition, patients with advanced-stage uterine&#xD;
      carcinoma (FIGO stages III-IV) are those with extrauterine disease and are at significant&#xD;
      risk of dying from uterine cancer. They constitute a very heterogeneous group of patients&#xD;
      with varying risk factors yielding highly variable clinical outcomes. Within the same FIGO&#xD;
      stage, patients with disease involving multiple extrauterine sites fare worse compared to&#xD;
      patients with involvement of a single site (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, patients with advanced stage disease often require adjuvant therapy(s) to&#xD;
      reduce the chance of tumor recurrence with the potential to improve survival. However, the&#xD;
      optimal adjuvant therapy is yet to be established with several options available for adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for multimodality treatment with chemotherapy and radiation treatment (CMT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment recommendations for advanced stage endometrial cancer consist of multiple&#xD;
      approaches including chemotherapy alone, radiotherapy (RT) alone, or combined modality&#xD;
      treatment (CMT) (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOG 122 study, which was a phase III trial, randomized patient with advanced endometrial&#xD;
      carcinoma to adjuvant chemotherapy alone versus whole abdomen RT (WART). Outcomes of this&#xD;
      study showed that the chemotherapy arm had an improved 5-year progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      and overall survival (OS) compared to RT alone. However, this trial showed that if&#xD;
      chemotherapy is given alone, that rate of local recurrence approaches 20% (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of CMT with concurrent chemotherapy and RT (chemoRT) was explored in RTOG 9708,&#xD;
      which was a phase II trial that evaluated outcomes in patients receiving concurrent chemoRT.&#xD;
      All patients received adjuvant pelvic RT (45 Gy) concurrent with cisplatin followed by four&#xD;
      additional cycles of cisplatin and paclitaxel. The 4-year OS and PFS for patients with stage&#xD;
      III disease were 77% and 72%, respectively. Rates of grade 1 toxicity were found in 16% of&#xD;
      patients, grade 2 in 41%, grade 3 in 16%, and grade 4 in 5%. This study demonstrated that&#xD;
      concurrent chemoRT is safe with excellent local control (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recent studies have sought to compare chemoRT to chemotherapy or radiation alone.&#xD;
      PORTEC-3 was a phase III randomized trial comparing adjuvant RT alone to concurrent chemoRT.&#xD;
      The RT dose was 48.6 Gy in 27 fractions and chemotherapy was concurrent cisplatin followed by&#xD;
      an additional 4 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel. For women with stage III disease, the&#xD;
      addition of chemotherapy to radiation treatment showed benefit in terms of improvement in&#xD;
      FFS. An analysis of toxicity outcomes found that 60% of patients in the chemoRT arm&#xD;
      experienced a grade 3 or greater adverse event compared to 12% in the RT alone arm (p&lt;0.0001)&#xD;
      (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOG 258 study was recently published and was similar to PORTEC-3 except that it compared&#xD;
      concurrent chemoRT to adjuvant chemotherapy alone. Patients were randomized to receive&#xD;
      concurrent chemoRT (45 Gy in 25 fractions concurrent with cisplatin followed by 4 cycles of&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel) or chemotherapy alone. The results of this study showed that&#xD;
      chemoRT was associated with a lower 5-year incidence of vaginal and regional lymphatic&#xD;
      recurrence. However, distant recurrence rates were higher in the chemoRT arm compared to&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above studies helped to establish concurrent chemoRT with cisplatin followed by adjuvant&#xD;
      carboplatin/paclitaxel as a valid adjuvant treatment approach for women with advanced&#xD;
      endometrial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective review from Washington University included 51 women with stage III-IV&#xD;
      endometrial carcinoma who received CMT with carboplatin/paclitaxel-based regimen concurrent&#xD;
      with RT and assessed survival and toxicity outcomes. The chemotherapy regimen given was&#xD;
      carboplatin/paclitaxel for 4-6 cycles and RT was 48-51.2 Gy. Patients also received a vaginal&#xD;
      brachytherapy boost. They found that 48 patients (94%) completed chemotherapy and 16 patients&#xD;
      (30%) required chemotherapy dose-reduction. Thirty-four patients experienced grade 3-4&#xD;
      toxicities, most of which were hematologic. Over 80% of patients required leukocyte growth&#xD;
      factor injections. There were seven late grade 3-4 toxicities (4 GI, 2 GU, and 1 ongoing&#xD;
      neuropathy). They found a median PFS of 42.8 months, median OS of 44.9 months, and 3-year OS&#xD;
      of 80% (7). This study suggests that concurrent chemoRT using a carbotaxol-based regimen has&#xD;
      favorable outcomes, a tolerable side effect profile, and the potential to reduce overall&#xD;
      treatment duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building off of the results of the above retrospective study as well as the aforementioned&#xD;
      randomized trials, we wish to prospectively assess outcomes of women with advanced&#xD;
      endometrial carcinoma who receive the same concurrent chemoRT with a&#xD;
      carboplatin/paclitaxel-based regimen.&#xD;
