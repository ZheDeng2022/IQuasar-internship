      The goal of this study is to perform a quantitative assessment of the psychometric properties&#xD;
      of the Vulvovaginal Atrophy Questionnaire (VVAQ), a novel patient reported outcome measure&#xD;
      (PROM), through a REDCap survey of menopausal women with and without symptomatic vulvovaginal&#xD;
      atrophy (VVA)/genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bothersome vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, urinary symptoms, and related sexual and quality of&#xD;
      life sequelae are common problems for women during and after the menopausal transition. These&#xD;
      genitourinary symptoms adversely affect the lives of menopausal women, impacting daily&#xD;
      activities, emotional wellbeing, sexual function, and interpersonal relationships.&#xD;
      Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) describes anatomical changes and bothersome&#xD;
      symptoms associated with menopausal estrogen deficiency involving the labia, vagina, urethra,&#xD;
      and bladder. Symptoms must be bothersome and not accounted for by another diagnosis.&#xD;
      Vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is a component of GSM. Despite effective and safe therapeutic&#xD;
      options for symptomatic VVA/GSM, many women remain untreated. Although vulvovaginal symptoms&#xD;
      are commonly reported in community-based studies of menopausal women, the lack of a validated&#xD;
      measure of symptomatic VVA/GSM has limited our ability to accurately quantify its prevalence,&#xD;
      predictive factors, and associated outcomes. Using ad hoc or non-validated survey questions,&#xD;
      past studies have reported vulvovaginal symptoms in 27-85% of menopausal women. Despite the&#xD;
      broad sampling and diverse populations included in these studies, the absence of a validated&#xD;
      measurement tool limits our understanding of the true prevalence and predictors of this&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new patient reported outcome measure (PROM), the Vulvovaginal Atrophy Questionnaire (VVAQ),&#xD;
      is under development in a collaboration between the Massachusetts General Hospital Midlife&#xD;
      Women's Health Center and the North American Menopause Society (NAMS) to provide a validated&#xD;
      measure for assessing symptomatic VVA/GSM. Significant advances in research and improved&#xD;
      patient care are anticipated from availability of a brief, validated PROM for evaluating&#xD;
      symptomatic VVA/GSM in menopausal women. Self-administered questionnaires and brief symptom&#xD;
      scales for other common problems affecting women, including vasomotor symptoms, insomnia,&#xD;
      overactive bladder, and sexual dysfunction have greatly impacted the way research studies are&#xD;
      performed and clinical problems addressed in midlife women. The VVAQ is being developed for&#xD;
      use both in clinical and epidemiological research and patient care settings, with the goal of&#xD;
      advancing knowledge about symptomatic VVA/GSM and improving the care of menopausal women. A&#xD;
      validated measure for assessing symptomatic VVA/GSM and response to treatment interventions,&#xD;
      freely available in the public domain, will provide a critical research tool for&#xD;
      epidemiologic studies and efficacy assessment in clinical trials of new therapies. A&#xD;
      validated PROM will provide clinicians from multiple specialties and researchers from a wide&#xD;
      range of fields with a practical and efficient means for assessing symptomatic VVA/GSM in&#xD;
      midlife women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational psychometric validation study through a REDCap survey of&#xD;
      approximately 200 menopausal women age 45 years or older with and without symptomatic&#xD;
      VVA/GSM. No medications or treatments will be administered. Appropriate Human Research&#xD;
      Committee review and approval was obtained prior to study initiation. Potential study&#xD;
      participants will be identified during regularly scheduled office visits for routine clinical&#xD;
      care by a select group of approximately 20 clinicians with expertise in the care of&#xD;
      menopausal women. These clinicians all will be members of the North American Menopause&#xD;
      Society (NAMS) who have agreed to serve as NAMS VVAQ Referring Clinicians. Appropriateness&#xD;
      for referral to the study will be confirmed by the NAMS VVAQ Referring Clinician at the time&#xD;
      of routine patient care visits. At the end of a clinic visit, a NAMS VVAQ Referring Clinician&#xD;
      will determine if a patient is eligible to be referred to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Participants informed about the study by a NAMS VVAQ Referring Clinician will then&#xD;
      log in to the study's secure REDCap website and review information about the study. If&#xD;
      interested, participants will consent to study participation and complete the study&#xD;
      questionnaires. Participants will be informed that researchers associated with the North&#xD;
      American Menopause Society (NAMS) and the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Midlife&#xD;
      Women's Health Center are studying the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), a condition&#xD;
      that affects women after menopause and includes vaginal dryness and pain with sexual&#xD;
      activity. To learn more about GSM, researchers will be studying menopausal women both with&#xD;
      and without this problem. Women are eligible to participate if they are menopausal, age 45&#xD;
      years or older, and have been referred to the study by their health care provider after an&#xD;
      office visit that included a pelvic exam. Participation involves completing questionnaires at&#xD;
      home through a secure website on a computer within 2 weeks of their office visit. Completing&#xD;
      the questionnaires will take approximately 25 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be informed that they will be identified only by a study identification&#xD;
      number on the questionnaires. No identifying information will be collected, including name or&#xD;
      date of birth. As researchers will need to know whether a participant's clinician saw&#xD;
      evidence of vulvovaginal atrophy on a recent pelvic exam, participants will enter into the&#xD;
      secure study website information provided to the participant by the NAMS VVAQ Referring&#xD;
      Clinician regarding pelvic exam findings, including degree of vulvovaginal atrophy and&#xD;
      evidence of a urogenital condition unrelated to menopausal estrogen deficiency. Participants&#xD;
      who complete the survey will be given the option of completing the questionnaires a second&#xD;
      time 2 weeks later. This option will end after 50 participants have completed the &quot;re-test'&#xD;
      part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analyses and tests outlined below will be used to assess the psychometric&#xD;
      properties of the VVAQ. If the VVAQ is found to be multi-dimensional (i.e., having multiple&#xD;
      factors or independent domains), analyses will be performed separately on each factor or&#xD;
      domain, in addition to comparisons for the overall scale. A quantitative scoring algorithm&#xD;
      will be developed and tested for sensitivity and specificity. Comparisons across groups&#xD;
      (women with and without symptomatic VVA) will be performed to establish discriminant&#xD;
      validity. Inter-item and test-retest reliability will be ascertained from responses in&#xD;
      participants with and without symptomatic VVA. Factor analysis will be performed in the group&#xD;
      of women with symptomatic VVA and for all participants combined (to ensure adequate sample&#xD;
      size), and discriminant validity testing will be done across all items and factor scores.&#xD;
      Convergent validity will be assessed by examining correlations between item and factor&#xD;
      scores, as well as factor and item scores. Statistical Analyses: 1) Item Analysis, 2) Item&#xD;
      Reduction, 3) Scoring Algorithm, 4) Exploratory Factor Analysis, 5) Item Response Theory&#xD;
      Analysis, 6) Internal Consistency, 7) Factor Structure &amp; Final Scoring Algorithm, 8)&#xD;
      Test-Retest Reliability, 9) Convergent/Divergent Validity, 10) Discriminant (Known Groups)&#xD;
      Validity.&#xD;
