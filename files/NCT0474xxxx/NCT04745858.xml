      The aim of this research is to find and compare the effect of Bowen's technique and Muscle&#xD;
      energy technique on intensity of pain, active knee extension, limited forward bending and&#xD;
      active straight leg raise on hamstrings tightness in patients with chronic non-specific low&#xD;
      back pain. A randomized control trial is conducting at Railway General Hospital, Rawalpindi&#xD;
      and Al-Ain Hospital, Wah Cantt. The sample size is calculated through open epi is 24. The&#xD;
      subjects are divided in two groups, 12 subjects in Bowen's technique group and 12 in Muscle&#xD;
      energy technique group. Study duration is of 6 months. Sampling technique applied is&#xD;
      non-probability convenient sampling for recruitment and group randomization using sealed&#xD;
      envelope method. Only 18-35 years individuals of hamstrings tightness with chronic&#xD;
      non-specific low back pain are included. Tools used in the study are Numeric pain rating&#xD;
      scale (NPRS), Active knee extension, Sit and reach test, Active straight leg raise and&#xD;
      Goniometer. Data will be analyzed through SPSS 21.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hamstring muscles are well known for their immense tendency to tightness which is due to&#xD;
      their multi-joint function, their tonic postural character, and considerable amount of&#xD;
      tensional forces to which they are constantly submitted. The ability of the muscle to&#xD;
      lengthen allowing one joint (or more than one joint) to move through the range of motion is&#xD;
      due to the flexibility of the muscle. If a muscle has good flexibility it will allow muscle&#xD;
      tissue to accommodate to imposed stress more easily and allows efficient and effective&#xD;
      movement and will assist in preventing or minimizing injuries and enhance performance of the&#xD;
      muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of the hamstring muscles is considered to play an essential role in both the&#xD;
      effectiveness and efficiency of fundamental human movements such as walking and running.&#xD;
      Particularly in the field of rehabilitation, flexibility of the muscle is important in&#xD;
      postural balance, complete maintenance of the range of motion of knees and hips, injury&#xD;
      prevention and optimization of musculoskeletal function. Tight hamstrings have been involved&#xD;
      in lumbar spine dysfunction and shows strong positive correlation between low back pain and&#xD;
      reduced hamstring flexibility. Hamstring muscle tightness leads to decreased range of motion&#xD;
      of lumber flexion and pelvic tilt. This can alter the biomechanics of lumbar spine and may&#xD;
      lead to back pain. Mainly hamstrings flexibility may prevent acute and chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injuries, low backache problems, postural deviations, gait limitations and&#xD;
      chances of fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low back pain (LBP) is described as the pain located in the lower part of the spine&#xD;
      (lumbo-sacral region), coming from this area and optionally radiating to one or both lower&#xD;
      limbs. It occurs in a great amount of the population, in about 80% of people and it has a&#xD;
      different intensity. Non-specific LBP (low back pain) is defined as low back pain not&#xD;
      attributable to a known cause there is no pathology within the spine such as cancer,&#xD;
      osteoporosis, trauma or fracture. It represents 90-95% of the cases of Low back pain. There&#xD;
      are several factors which are responsible for development of Low back pain. Various factors&#xD;
      include increased lumber lordosis, reduced abdominal muscle strength, and decreased back&#xD;
      extensor muscle endurance, back extensor muscle flexibility, length of iliopsoas and&#xD;
      hamstring muscle flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle energy technique (MET) is a manual technique developed by osteopaths that is now used&#xD;
      in much different manual therapy professions. It is gentle manual therapy technique for&#xD;
      restricted motion of the spine and extremities and is an active technique where the patient,&#xD;
      not the clinician, controls the corrective force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the two techniques is 'Post-isometric relaxation technique (PIRT)' which uses&#xD;
      controlled, voluntary isometric contractions up to 20% of a target muscle group. MET is&#xD;
      claimed to be useful for lengthening a shortened muscle, improving range of motion at a joint&#xD;
      and increasing drainage of fluid from peripheral regions. This approach which targets&#xD;
      primarily the soft tissue is also known as 'active muscular relaxation'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bowen's technique (BT) was developed by Thomas Bowen in the 1950s in Geelong, Australia which&#xD;
      is a dynamic system of muscle and connective tissue therapy. Bowen's Technique is a&#xD;
      technique, based on a delicate movement and a series of manipulation of soft tissues. It is a&#xD;
      soft tissue therapy, in which therapist uses fingers or thumb to apply gentle rolling moves&#xD;
      over muscles, tendons, and other connective tissues in specific parts of the body. Minimum of&#xD;
      2 minutes will be allowed between moves to allow the body to respond and then the whole&#xD;
      procedure will be repeated again. Sequence of receiving bilateral moves are applied over&#xD;
      segments of erector spinae ,latissimus dorsi, gluteals,the hamstrings muscles proximally and&#xD;
      distally, Tenser fascia latae, hip adductors are many more. A classic Bowen's technique&#xD;
      session usually lasts from 15 to 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, the mechanism of action of Bowen's Technique is based mainly on the concept of&#xD;
      proprioception. The skin is innervated tissue and has various types of receptors that detect&#xD;
      changes during the position of touch, pressure, vibration, temperature or pain. The fascia&#xD;
      also plays the role of a system for collecting, transmitting and processing information.&#xD;
      There is even less data on the physiological effects of Bowen's Therapy. There are largely&#xD;
      unsubstantiated claims that it acts through effects on fascia, muscle, and cutaneous sensory&#xD;
      receptors that give rise to a rebalancing of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, muscle&#xD;
      relaxation, altered myofibroblast activity, and changes in the type of collagen. Adipocytes&#xD;
      and fibroblasts, on the other hand, are responsible for mechano-transduction and lead to a&#xD;
      wide range of sensory sensations and communication signals. Therefore, it has been suggested&#xD;
      that the contact of the therapist's hands with the patient's skin initiates communication&#xD;
      with structures lying deeper. Bowen's studies provide implications of fascially induced&#xD;
      following stimulation of mechanoreceptors. The effect of rolling moves that are&#xD;
      characteristic of this method is muscular and fascial loosening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been many studies done to check the effectiveness of stretching techniques to&#xD;
      increase the flexibility of Hamstrings amongst the most common is MET. Bowen's technique is a&#xD;
      specific form of therapy and the concept of treatment of patient according to Bowen's is&#xD;
      significantly different from the commonly known methods. There are no studies done pertaining&#xD;
      to the comparison of MET and Bowen's Technique for hamstrings flexibility in patients with&#xD;
      non-specific low back pain and hence the need of the study arises to check for the more&#xD;
      superior form of technique in the treatment of hamstrings flexibility. Until now, the effects&#xD;
      of Bowen's Technique therapy have been most often described in the form of a case study. It&#xD;
      is difficult to find research conclusions from such works only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research was conducted in 2020 entitled as &quot;The effect of muscle energy technique on&#xD;
      flexibility of hamstring muscle in Futsal Players&quot; and concluded that Muscle energy technique&#xD;
      increased flexibility of hamstrings among futsal players by improving ranges of knee&#xD;
      extension. This study also shows the implacability of Muscle Energy Technique in a clinical&#xD;
      setting, where it can be performed as a treatment technique for patients who come in for&#xD;
      physiotherapy relating to reduced hamstring flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research was conducted in 2018 entitled as &quot;Bowen Technique for patients with low back&#xD;
      pain&quot; concluded that there were clearly noticeable results in the severity of pain, the range&#xD;
      of motion and the degree of disability of respondents referring Oswestry standardized scale.&#xD;
      It can be concluded that subsequent treatments would still eliminate pain and improve the&#xD;
      health of patients as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research was conducted in 2017 entitled as &quot;Effect of Bowen Technique versus Muscle Energy&#xD;
      Technique on Asymptomatic Subjects with Hamstring Tightness&quot; concluded that 3 sessions on&#xD;
      alternate days for a week proved to be effective in improving popliteal angle and sit and&#xD;
      reach test for flexibility measurements in both Bowen technique as well as muscle energy&#xD;
      technique but Bowen technique has shown more improvement in hamstring flexibility and ROM&#xD;
      than muscle energy technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research was conducted in 2013 entitled as &quot;Comparative study between the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Bowen technique and dynamic soft tissue mobilization in increasing hamstrings flexibility&quot;&#xD;
      concluded that there was a significant improvement following the application of Bowen&#xD;
      Technique than compared to Dynamic Soft Tissue Mobilization in improving flexibility of&#xD;
      hamstring muscle as determined by Active Extension Test.&#xD;
