  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to Japanese adults with different types of advanced cancer that are&#xD;
      positive for NRAS/KRAS mutations. This is a study in people for whom previous treatment was&#xD;
      not successful or no standard treatment exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of BI 3011441 that Japanese people with&#xD;
      advanced cancer can tolerate. BI 3011441 is a medicine that may turn off a signal by&#xD;
      NRAS/KRAS that makes tumours grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants take BI 3011441 as capsules once a day. Participants can stay in the study as&#xD;
      long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it. The doctors collect information on&#xD;
      any health problems of the participants.&#xD;
