  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vision at twilight and night is more difficult and dangerous for the entire population, even&#xD;
      more so for the elderly and especially for the elderly with degenerative disease. Multiple&#xD;
      worldwide laboratories have demonstrated the ability to raise macular pigment optical density&#xD;
      with dietary carotenoids. This proposal further evaluates the relationship between macular&#xD;
      re- pigmentation and vision under stressed conditions simulating twilight and night driving.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the physiological function of the eyes at night. However, the risk of&#xD;
      automobile injury or fatality (driver, passenger or pedestrian) associated with motor vehicle&#xD;
      accidents has been determined to increase with age, as a result of the complex interplay of&#xD;
      age-related declines in vision, motor and cognitive functioning. However, basic visual&#xD;
      function is the foundation for higher order processing whether it is visual spatial or&#xD;
      cognitive. Four recent studies reflect the cost of poor vision on driving.&#xD;
      (www.visionimpactinstitute.org). For example, visual impairment among European drivers was&#xD;
      examined in 2422 drivers from 5 European countries. Visual acuity, visual field, contrast&#xD;
      sensitivity, glare sensitivity, and useful field of view were tested. Visual functions not&#xD;
      included in the current licensing standards were found to be more impaired among drivers&#xD;
      (compared to those functions legally required). Elderly drivers are particularly vulnerable&#xD;
      to sensory visual impairment when driving at night, as they suffer declines in both Contrast&#xD;
      sensitivity (CS), Glare Disability (GD) and Glare Recovery (GR).6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for study involving humans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotenoid science is well developed with respect to the safe utilization of dietary lutein&#xD;
      (L) /zeaxanthin (Zx) as studied by the National Institute of Health (NEI). The recently&#xD;
      published NEI AREDS2 study- May 2013, further substantiated the safety and usefulness of&#xD;
      prescribing the carotenoids (10 mg L / 2 mg Zx) in patients at high risk of AMD. 7&#xD;
      Significantly, the average American and veteran population are typically low dose consumer of&#xD;
      these carotenoids (1 to 2 mg/day for the average American).&#xD;

Gel caps will be supplied in a single 180 count bottle. 1 gel cap per day will be taken with a meal. Subjects will be called by telephone to improve compliance. Supplement compliance will ultimately be gauged by the number of tablets returned.</intervention_model_description>
