      To compare the effectiveness and safety of double balloon catheter and vaginal insert&#xD;
      Prostaglandin E2 in cervical ripening prior to Induction of Labor in low-risk women from 39+0&#xD;
      to 40+6 weeks of gestation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction of labor (IOL) is a technique to establish vaginal delivery when the risks for&#xD;
      continuing the pregnancy for mother or baby are higher than the risks of delivery. In case&#xD;
      the cervix is unripe, cervical ripening before the onset of labor is needed. The two main&#xD;
      mechanisms of cervical ripening can be categorized as mechanical or pharmacological.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cochrane systematic review and other recent meta-analysis have shown that cervical ripening&#xD;
      with a balloon is probably as effective as induction of labor with vaginal Prostaglandin E2.&#xD;
      However, this conclusion is based on low to moderate quality evidence. Only a limited number&#xD;
      of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been conducted. Many of those suffering from small&#xD;
      sample sizes and different study subjects, i.e. high-risk subjects only, and mixed&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In current practice, induction of labor is not only used in high-risk patients with clear&#xD;
      indications for pregnancy termination. The ARRIVE trial has shown a significant benefit of&#xD;
      labor induction over expectant management among the low-risk population. Based on this&#xD;
      evidence, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has suggested: &quot;It's&#xD;
      time to induce of labor at 39th week of gestation&quot;. Since then, there is a trend in favoring&#xD;
      elective induction before the due date over expectant management. Besides, more and more&#xD;
      pregnant women want to shorten the duration of pregnancy or to time the birth of the baby due&#xD;
      to the convenience of the mother and/or healthcare workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This makes the optimal method of Induction of Labor in terms of effectiveness and safety for&#xD;
      both mothers and their babies even more important. In this study, the investigators will&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness and safety of double-balloon catheter and Prostaglandin E2 for&#xD;
      elective labor induction in low-risk pregnancies.&#xD;

    <description>Sweeping the membranes by UTAH CVX-RIPE® (Utah Medical Products, Inc, 7043 South 300 West, Midvale, Utah 84047 USA). The catheter will be inserted manually until the proximal balloon is in the cervical canal, the distal balloon should be intrauterine and in the extra-amniotic space. The intrauterine balloon is inflated with 40mL saline and retracted so that it rests against the internal oz. The proximal balloon should now be outside the external oz and is inflated with 20mL saline. If the balloons are correctly situated on both ends of the cervix, they can be inflated with up to 80mL saline each.&#xD;
Cardiotocograph will be performed 30min, 2 hours after insertion and every 6 hours. The balloon is placed for a maximum of 24 hours.&#xD;
If it is expelled in the first 12 hours and the patient has no contractions or still shows an unfavorable cervix, another balloon is placed for a maximum of another 24 hours.&#xD;
The patients will be examined in case of extremely painful or membranes ruptured.</description>
