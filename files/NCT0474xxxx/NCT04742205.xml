  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracerebral hemorrhage is increasingly becoming a major burden in the society because of&#xD;
      significant morbidity as well as mortality. Hematoma volume at the time of presentation as&#xD;
      well as hematoma expansion and re-bleed or ongoing bleed further deteriorates the patient&#xD;
      making a poor prognosis, however at present no therapy targets this pathological process.&#xD;
      Though clinical studies do report benefit of using tranexamic acid in spontaneous&#xD;
      intracerebral hemorrhage by reducing hematoma expansion rate as well as decreasing ongoing&#xD;
      bleed, large randomized controlled trials have not shown any convincing advantage owing to&#xD;
      various limitations in their design and methods. However, they uniformly did not find any&#xD;
      significant side effect with the use of tranexamic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that intravenous tranexamic acid is superior&#xD;
      to placebo by reducing hematoma expansion when given within 24 h of spontaneous intracerebral&#xD;
      hemorrhage.&#xD;

      Patients and Methods: Data will be collected (after Nepal Health Research Council approval)&#xD;
      for 1 year as patient gets admitted with Intracerebral haemorrhage. 160 spontaneous&#xD;
      intracerebral haemorrhage patients presenting within 24 hours of ictus or last known well&#xD;
      will be taken in the study. Outcomes of these patients will be calculated to establish a&#xD;
      relationship between hematoma expansion, underlying pathology and outcome of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Primary outcome i.e. radiological improvement (CT scan): Difference between hematoma&#xD;
      volume with perilesional edema from baseline and 48-hour post treatment scan, hematoma&#xD;
      location, and new infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: Neurological impairment (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) at&#xD;
      day 7, Outcome: Dependency (modified Ranking Scale), Cognition (Telephone Interview Cognition&#xD;
      Score-Modified), and mood (Zung Depression Scale) at days 10 and 90 and 180. Similarly,&#xD;
      costs: Length of stay in hospital, readmission, ability to return back to daily activities.&#xD;
      Also, Safety endpoints recorded until day 90: Death (cause), venous thromboembolism confirmed&#xD;
      by ultrasound, vascular occlusive events (stroke/transient ischemic attack/myocardial&#xD;
      infarction/peripheral artery disease), seizures. Serious adverse events (AEs) in first seven&#xD;
      days will be analyzed and calculated.&#xD;
