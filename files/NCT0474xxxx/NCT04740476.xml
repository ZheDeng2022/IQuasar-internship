  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stoke Therapeutics is evaluating the long-term safety &amp; tolerability of repeated doses of&#xD;
      STK-001 in patients with Dravet syndrome who previously participated in studies of STK-001.&#xD;
      Change in seizure frequency and overall clinical status, and quality of life will be measured&#xD;
      as secondary endpoints in this open-label study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, open-label, multiple-dose, safety extension study for patients&#xD;
      who have completed another study of STK-001 and meet study eligibility criteria. STK-001 is&#xD;
      an investigational new medicine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. STK-001 is an antisense&#xD;
      oligonucleotide (ASO) that is intended to increase the level of productive SCN1A messenger&#xD;
      RNA (mRNA) and consequently increase the expression of the sodium channel Nav1.1 protein.&#xD;
      This RNA-based approach is not gene therapy, but rather RNA modulation, as it does not&#xD;
      manipulate nor insert genetic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STK-001 is designed to upregulate Nav1.1 protein expression from the nonmutant (wild-type)&#xD;
      copy of the SCN1A gene to restore physiological Nav1.1 levels. Nav1.1 levels are reduced in&#xD;
      people with Dravet syndrome. Stoke has generated preclinical data demonstrating&#xD;
      proof-of-mechanism for STK-001.&#xD;
