    <textblock>
      This study examines the rehabilitation results when low-level laser therapy is applied in&#xD;
      zone 5-8 extensor tendon injuries. Rehabilitation results will be evaluated with both&#xD;
      objective measurements and patient reported outcome measures. The study was planned as a&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, two-arm study. Participants in both treatment&#xD;
      groups will be given exercise therapy in accordance with the early active mobilization&#xD;
      protocol and appropriate splint will be given to be used while exercising.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in visual analog scale (VAS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, immediately after the intervention, eighth week</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is a scale used to assess pain. Minimum value of the scale is 0 and maximum is 10. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in metacarpophalangeal joint circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, immediately after the intervention, eighth week</time_frame>
    <description>It will be used to evaluate edema in the dorsum of the hand. Measurement will be made with the help of a tape measure. The measured value will be recorded in milimeters.</description>

    <measure>Change in quick disabilities of arm, shoulder and hand (QuickDASH) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, immediately after the intervention, eighth week</time_frame>
    <description>A scale used for measuring physical function and symptoms of upper extremities. Minimum value of the scale is 0 and maximum is 100. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in short form-36 (SF-36) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, immediately after the intervention, eighth week</time_frame>
    <description>A scale used for determining quality of life. This form evaluates the quality of life under 9 different headings. Minimum value of all headings is %0 and maximum is %100. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
