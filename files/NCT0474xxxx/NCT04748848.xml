    <textblock>
      CC-90011-AML-002 is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter study to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of CC-90011 given concurrently with Venetoclax and&#xD;
      Azacitidine. This study will include 3 parts: a dose escalation part in R/R AML, a dose&#xD;
      escalation part in ndAML (treatment-naïve participants with AML who are ≥ 75 years of age or&#xD;
      are ≥ 18 to 74 years of age and otherwise not eligible for intensive induction chemotherapy),&#xD;
      and a randomized dose expansion part in ndAML of Venetoclax and Azacitidine with or without&#xD;
      CC-90011.&#xD;
