  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to mount an effective immune response declines with age, leaving the elderly&#xD;
      increasingly susceptible to infectious diseases and cancer. Rapamycin, an FDA approved drug&#xD;
      to prevent transplant rejection, increases the lifespan and healthspan of mice and&#xD;
      ameliorates age-related declines in immune responsiveness, cancer survival, and cognition in&#xD;
      laboratory animals. Investigators are conducting a translational trial to test whether&#xD;
      rapamycin also improves life functions in humans focusing on elderly persons (aged 70-95).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy E will evaluate the Rapamycin and Cardiac Function.&#xD;

      The main study has completed and results are reported (NCT02874924)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of Sub-study E - Rapamycin and cMRI to evaluate cardiac function:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The over-arching hypothesis is that RAPA treatment will effect simultaneous improvement in&#xD;
      parameters known to be negatively impacted by aging. For example, systemic inflammation is&#xD;
      higher in older individuals and contributes to the development of age-related pathologies&#xD;
      affecting both the heart and the vasculature. In particular, evidence indicates that&#xD;
      aging-associated alterations in inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways are critically&#xD;
      involved in the etiology of age-related declines. The study team hypothesize that mTOR&#xD;
      antagonism with RAPA will improve detrimental age-related pathologies affecting the heart in&#xD;
      elderly humans.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  70-95 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be in good general health with all chronic diseases (hypertension,&#xD;
             coronary artery disease, etc.) clinically stable. Selected subjects will be in good&#xD;
             health (Per the World Health Organization good health will be defined as complete&#xD;
             physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or&#xD;
             infirmity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For our purposes all diseases or infirmities will be clinically stable whether managed&#xD;
             by medications or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All ethnicities will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For cardiac and brain imaging by MRI, a pre-MRI screening questionnaire will be used&#xD;
             to assess MRI safety and neurological health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes, (with A1c â‰¥6.5 or if treated with medication affecting glucose homeostasis&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Treatment (&gt;30days of therapy or long term) with a systemic immunosuppressant&#xD;
             (prednisone, etc.) within the last year,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of recent (within 6 months) Myocardial Infarction or active Coronary Disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of recent (within 6 months) intestinal disorders,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria for MRI scan: known claustrophobia, metal implants in soft tissue&#xD;
             of the body including pacemakers, aneurysm clips, ferrous metal fragments not anchored&#xD;
             to bone (bullets, BBs, shrapnel, metal shavings), implanted medication pumps, and&#xD;
             oral-facial metal appliances that are permanently secured but may result in low image&#xD;
             quality. Participants may also be excluded for history of severe head trauma, brain&#xD;
             injury, brain surgery, inflammation of the brain, or history of seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female (Studies with mTOR antagonists show that there are often substantial&#xD;
             differences in responses by sex, sometimes favoring females, other times males. Our&#xD;
             initial pilot study was done in males for this reason and shows trends toward improved&#xD;
             cardiac parameters. We will study males in Substudy E, an extension of our prior&#xD;
             trial, to generate statistically significant results while obviating potential&#xD;
             confounding by differing pharmacodynamics sex effects. Statistically significant&#xD;
             results will be used to support larger trials in both sexes.)&#xD;
