  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, open-label, multicenter study to compare the efficacy and safety of Combination&#xD;
      of High-dose Dexamethasone and Tacrolimus versus High-dose Dexamethasone for the first-line&#xD;
      treatment of adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a parallel group, multicenter, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      of 100 adults with ITP in China. Patients were randomized to tacrolimuis plus high-dose&#xD;
      dexamethasone and high-dose dexamethasone monotherapy group. Platelet count, bleeding and&#xD;
      other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
