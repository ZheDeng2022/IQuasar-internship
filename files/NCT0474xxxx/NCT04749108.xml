  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Locally advanced rectal carcinoma raise the issue of both the oncological control, local and&#xD;
      general, and the therapeutic morbidity. Surgery alone can cure only one out of two patients,&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy improves the local control but the metastatic risk remains about 30% with&#xD;
      enhanced postoperative morbidity and poor functional results. The tumor response to&#xD;
      preoperative treatment is the major prognostic factor which revealed the aggressiveness of&#xD;
      the tumor. To this day, there are no biologic predictive markers for tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to tailor the management according to the early tumoral response&#xD;
      after short and intensive induction chemotherapy. MRI volumetric tumor response will be used&#xD;
      to distinguish between good responders and bad responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Very good&quot; responders will be randomized to either immediate surgery or radiochemotherapy&#xD;
      followed by surgery (Standard arm: Cap 50).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer of the rectum is a common disease. It affects nearly 15,000 new people each year, with&#xD;
      more men (53%) than women (47%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In more than 9 out of 10 cases, it occurs after 50 years. Three types of treatments are used&#xD;
      to treat rectal cancer: surgery, radiotherapy and drug treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancers (LARC) is multidisciplinary,&#xD;
      combining chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. The usual treatment in this situation is&#xD;
      called induction chemotherapy administrated before radiochemotherapy. This phase of treatment&#xD;
      taking place before surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, treating all cancers of the locally advanced rectum with the same neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment exposes patients who are good responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with possible&#xD;
      toxicity to radiotherapy and patients who are poor responders to ineffectiveness of&#xD;
      conventional radiotherapy with surgery and so to a mutilating ineffective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short- and long-term toxicity of pelvic radiation may be the most compelling reason to&#xD;
      reconsider reflexive neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (NA-RCT) and to move toward a more&#xD;
      individualized approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large North American trial is currently evaluating the suppression of preoperative&#xD;
      radiation therapy in patients selected as a good responder to induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first trial called GRECCAR-4 (Surgical Research Group on Rectum CAncer) with induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy by 5 Fluorouracil + Irinotecan + Oxaliplatin and personalized radiochemotherapy&#xD;
      reported the following results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-dose induction chemotherapy is well tolerated and reproducible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early assessment after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy makes it possible to discriminate&#xD;
           between good and bad responders without a negative impact on surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personalized management of LARC according to the early tumor response to chemotherapy is&#xD;
           possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In good responder patients, a resection rate of 100% was achieved (even in the arm&#xD;
           without radiotherapy), but due to poor recruitment, it is not possible to draw a formal&#xD;
           conclusion regarding these promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The oncological results at 5 years show a local recurrence rate of 0% for the good&#xD;
           responders and 4.8% for the poor responders. The 5-year overall survival was 86.7% with&#xD;
           a 5-year progression-free survival of 75.0%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GRECCAR 14 is the only French trial to question the feasibility of appropriate management of&#xD;
      non-metastatic LARC. Its main objective is to evaluate, in good responder patients,&#xD;
      personalized management after preoperative CT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GRECCAR-14 will try to confirm this strategy taking into account the 1st results of GRECCAR&#xD;
      4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will initially focus on 200 patients to assess the surgical quality of this&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy and then on 230 additional patients to assess the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      personalized treatment on survival without recurrence.&#xD;
