  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of treating knee osteoarthritis (OA) is to improve or maintain quality of life,&#xD;
      mobility and function, pain relief, and improve inﬂammation. The diﬀerent treatment options&#xD;
      for knee OA have been extensively studied and implemented, but the optimum treatment is still&#xD;
      undecided. There is a belief that anti-inﬂammatory sleeve technology may be beneﬁcial in&#xD;
      treating knee OA. The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical eﬀects of Reparel™&#xD;
      knee sleeve regarding mobility, functionality, and pain outcomes in managing knee OA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard knee compression sleeves have been described throughout literature to provide&#xD;
      beneﬁts in pain and functional outcomes through support of the ligamentous structures.&#xD;
      Bracing is both an eﬀective and economical treatment for osteoarthritis and serves as a&#xD;
      crucial option in the treatment of knee OA to aid in both delaying surgery and as options for&#xD;
      young patients, or patients that are not ideal surgical candidates. Although knee sleeves are&#xD;
      commonly utilized treatment modalities, there is a signiﬁcant paucity of literature on the&#xD;
      eﬀects of thermo-active braces in the treatment of knee OA. This investigation will examine&#xD;
      this non-operative treatment modality and study it eﬀect for the treatment of knee OA&#xD;
      specifically by investigating the Reparel Knee Sleeve. The Reparel Knee Sleeve is a Class I&#xD;
      Medical Device (510(k) exempt) and used in general sports medicine practice for the&#xD;
      alleviation of knee pain. The authors expect that the Reparel thermos-active knee sleeve will&#xD;
      have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on pain relief from knee OA.&#xD;

    <description>Patients who are recommended for non-operative management of knee osteoarthritis and have been consented in clinic to participate in the study will be given a Reparel™ knee sleeve to wear for knee osteoarthritis management. Each device will be numbered and recorded in the patient's REDCap entry for future reference if needed. Following administration of the Reparel™ knee sleeve, patients will be given instructions on how to use/wear the sleeve while performing activities of daily living or sports that had previously resulted in knee pain and also be asked to do the follows: wear the sleeve as much as they possibly can; not change their usual activities and diet during the time they are on this study; record in a diary the number of hours sleeve was worn per day; record any adverse eﬀects or discomfort due to sleeve use; refrain from altering treatment for knee osteoarthritis.</description>
