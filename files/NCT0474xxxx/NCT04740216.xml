  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trismus is traditionally considered being a late effect of cancer therapy with functional&#xD;
      deficits becoming clear in the first year after completing radiation therapy. These deficits&#xD;
      can rapidly progress to a state of functional impairment. The most common treatment for&#xD;
      trismus is physical therapy comprising an active range of motion (ROM) exercises, hold and&#xD;
      relax techniques. Once trismus has developed, it may be hard to reverse. Thus, prevention&#xD;
      with a program of self-care is important for managing this side effect. This study want to&#xD;
      test the effect with adjunctive devices plus exercise to prevent trismus.&#xD;
