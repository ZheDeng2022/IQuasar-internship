  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to test the methodological procedures and obtain preliminary results&#xD;
      regarding the therapeutic and cost-effectiveness of enhanced mirror therapy relative to&#xD;
      standard mirror therapy for improving brain reorganization and upper limb function in&#xD;
      individuals with stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is among the leading causes of mortality and disability, worldwide. Muscle weakness&#xD;
      and other complications associated with stroke can result in decreased quality of life and&#xD;
      significant declines in the activities of daily living. Mirror therapy has been shown to have&#xD;
      a moderate effect, facilitating the functional recovery among individuals who have&#xD;
      experienced a stroke. A prototype for a computerized, mirror therapy device was developed and&#xD;
      found to be feasible. Recently, the investigators published a critical review and an&#xD;
      activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis analysing the widespread reports of&#xD;
      brain activity associated with mirror therapy. Observations using functional near-infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy (fNIRS) to evaluate a group of people with stroke (n = 14) and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers (n = 18) revealed that performing complex tasks during the mirror therapy paradigm&#xD;
      enhanced top-down motor facilitation in the ipsilesional/ipsilateral hemisphere relative to&#xD;
      the moving limb. An important next step in this series of studies is to evaluate the training&#xD;
      effects associated with the performance of complex tasks during mirror therapy among stroke&#xD;
      patients, using the designed computerized mirror therapy device to deliver the enhanced&#xD;
      mirror therapy training. The results of this study will help the investigators to understand&#xD;
      the underlying mechanisms through which mirror therapy facilitates motor rehabilitation and&#xD;
      will add to the body of literature describing the best, evidence-based practices for mirror&#xD;
      therapy during stroke rehabilitation. The investigators propose a pilot study (n = 30) to&#xD;
      test the methodological procedures and obtain preliminary results for a fully powered,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial (RCT), combined with economic evaluation, to compare the&#xD;
      therapeutic and cost-effectiveness between standard mirror therapy and enhanced (complex task&#xD;
      and blurred image) mirror therapy.&#xD;

    <description>The Euro quality of life (EuroQol, 5 dimensions and 5 levels 62) survey, will assess the quality-adjusted life years (QALY) for the cost-effectiveness estimation. The EQ-5D-5L response will be converted into utility scores, which will be used to estimate gains or losses in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over the follow-up period. The higher the score obtained better the quality-life-adjusted-years due to the intervention.</description>
