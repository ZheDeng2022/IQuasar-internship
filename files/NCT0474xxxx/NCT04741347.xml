  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acetabulum fractures are complex, relatively rare lesions linked to a more or less good&#xD;
      functional prognosis and therefore represent a real surgical challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, it is accepted that surgical delay, among other things, negatively impacts&#xD;
      the quality of surgical reduction. However, this reduction must be a major priority since it&#xD;
      is one of the factors conditioning the functional result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, we wish to analyze a particular type of fracture, less studied, or with small&#xD;
      series, that are the transverse fractures (+/- posterior wall), known for their difficulty of&#xD;
      reduction. The reduction is even greater as the fracture line often passes through the&#xD;
      acetabular bearing zone, compromising the functional prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of surgical approach for this type of fracture is controversial. More and more, a&#xD;
      single approach, usually posterior, without compulsory fixation of the anterior component of&#xD;
      the transverse fracture is preferred over the traditional double approach anterior and&#xD;
      posterior, and this in particular to reduce the morbidity of this surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But this one-size-fits-all approach does not always achieve a good reduction and it is&#xD;
      believed that the time to surgery may play a role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is accepted that the surgical delay before reduction in osteosynthesis of an acetabular&#xD;
      fracture is involved in the quality of the reduction and therefore the functional result in&#xD;
      these patients, the question asked is whether this delay should condition the choice of a&#xD;
      double approach, anterior and posterior, for this type of fracture (transverse +/- posterior&#xD;
      wall).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, with increasing surgical time, the risk of scar tissue formation and early callus&#xD;
      increases, making bone fragments less mobile, reduction more difficult and indirect reduction&#xD;
      techniques (which are used when single approach is chosen) less efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, most of the studies evaluating the quality of reduction of acetabular fractures&#xD;
      use a radiographic score, that of Matta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it has been shown that the CT scan was more efficient than the x-rays in detecting a&#xD;
      residual displacement of the fracture. Also, in this study, we want to analyze the quality of&#xD;
      reduction thanks to the scanner, which is rarely done in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work aims to determine the predictive factors of the quality of reduction of transverse&#xD;
      fractures +/- posterior wall of the acetabulum, evaluated on the postoperative CT scan.&#xD;
