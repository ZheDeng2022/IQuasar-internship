  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no universally accepted, comprehensive, or standard systematic way to&#xD;
      teach the epidural block. Typical teaching of epidural catheter placement consists of a&#xD;
      combination of didactic education and hands-on experience, where apprentice and master&#xD;
      approached the task together in the clinical setting, with live patients as the learning&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The learning curve is one of the most common tools to assess how the physician in training is&#xD;
      progressing at a skill, and it is defined as a curve generated by plotting the success or&#xD;
      failure against the number of attempts. More complex learning curves using an acceptable and&#xD;
      unacceptable failure rate can be constructed. To perform these more complex learning curves a&#xD;
      statistical tool such as the Cumulative Sum Technique (CUSUM) may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CompuFlo Epidural Trainer can differentiate tissue types by pressure signatures that are&#xD;
      imperceptible to touch. This allows the trainee to accurately identify the needle location&#xD;
      and discriminate between false and true loss of resistance. Having displayed, recorded and&#xD;
      printed a graph illustrating the procedure, may also lead to a greater appreciation of the&#xD;
      anatomy of the structures the needle must pass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye-tracking is the process of measuring either the point of gaze or the motion of an eye&#xD;
      relative to the head. This method has been successfully used for proficiency assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study will be to investigate whether the use of a Structured Didactic Model&#xD;
      (SDM) including standardized video lessons, construction of a 3D epidural module, practical&#xD;
      training by using an epidural simulator with CompuFlo Trainer instrument, eye tracking&#xD;
      assisted technique, may affect the CUSUM learning curve for lumbar epidural block in novice,&#xD;
      inexperienced trainees and their eye-tracking patterns.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Researchers will enroll 15 PGY3 trainees who have never performed an epidural block and are&#xD;
      about to begin their obstetrics rotation. After having had the usual standard front-lecture&#xD;
      on anatomy and technique, they will be randomized into two groups to receive (study group) or&#xD;
      to not receive (control group) the additional SDM (Structured Didactic Model). The additional&#xD;
      SDM will consist in two standardized video lessons (anatomy and technique), construction of a&#xD;
      3D epidural plastic module, practical training by using an epidural simulator with the&#xD;
      CompuFlo Trainer instrument, and practical training with the eye-tracking assisted technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the randomization and before their practice on the patients, all the trainees will&#xD;
      undergo eye-tracking measurement of their visual patterns while performing the epidural block&#xD;
      on an epidural simulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All trainees will perform lumbar epidural anesthesia under the supervision of their&#xD;
      instructors in accordance with local Institutional policy and practice, with the standard&#xD;
      routine equipment and monitoring. Every time the trainee will perform an epidural technique,&#xD;
      the number of attempts, needle redirections, and effectiveness of the epidural block will be&#xD;
      noted and used to construct the corresponding CUSUM curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When enough epidurals will be performed by each trainee to reach competence according to the&#xD;
      CUSUM curve, a post hoc Power Analysis will be carried out to verify the 95% significance&#xD;
      level and the 80 % test power. To study and compare the evolution of the success rate in each&#xD;
      group a linear regression model will be applied.&#xD;
