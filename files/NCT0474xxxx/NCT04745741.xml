    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate its rationality in real-world data and provide&#xD;
      clinical evidence for the refinement of nodal CTV delineation in nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      carcinoma(NPC).&#xD;

      Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has gradually replaced two-dimensional radiation&#xD;
      therapy as it offers improved target conformity. Xerostomia is still the most common side&#xD;
      effect of radiotherapy in patients with NPC treated with IMRT. Most stimulated saliva is&#xD;
      secreted by the parotid glands (PGs), while the submandibular glands (SMGs) produce most of&#xD;
      the unstimulated saliva and mucins, which may influence the degree of a dry mouth&#xD;
      sensation.There are still differences in the understanding of nasopharyngeal cancer experts&#xD;
      at home and abroad on the delineation of clinical target volumes., suitable criteria for&#xD;
      elective irradiation of neck level Ib need to be re-evaluated.Therefore, we conducted a&#xD;
      retrospective study to assess the feasibility of recommendation to level Ib in the&#xD;
      International Guideline for Delineation of Clinical Target Volumes.&#xD;

    <description>The gross tumor volume of the nasopharynx and neck nodes (GTVnx and GTVnd) were delineated according to the tumor extension. The CTVnx was defined as GTVnx + nasopharynx mucosa + 8mm +corresponding anatomical structure without the delineation of CTV1. The CTVnd was defined as GTVnd plus the elective neck area. The prescribe doses of GTVnx/GTVnd, CTVnx, CTVnd were 66-70Gy,54-56Gy and 50-54Gy in 31-35 fractions, respectively.</description>
