      Single center pilot study examining the effect of Natrox topical oxygen therapy on chronic&#xD;
      wounds along with the introduction of remote monitoring and telehealth for home care&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a wealth of evidence to support the benefits of oxygen therapy on wound healing.&#xD;
      Oxygen is required for all major processes of wound healing and wound hypoxia is common. Skin&#xD;
      wounds can receive oxygen from the blood stream via perfusion and from oxygen uptake through&#xD;
      the skin. Yet, both wound perfusion and blood oxygen levels are frequently insufficient in&#xD;
      patients with chronic wounds due to poor circulation, vascular disruption, and&#xD;
      vasoconstriction, thereby reducing the wound's capacity to heal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic ulcers, vascular ulcers (venous or arterial), and pressure injuries are all chronic&#xD;
      wounds. The pathologies underlying chronic wounds can differ widely. However, common shared&#xD;
      features include prolonged or excessive inflammation, persistent infections, and the&#xD;
      inability to respond to reparative stimuli. Adults with vascular disease and/or diabetes are&#xD;
      at highest risk for chronic leg and foot wounds. The ischemic (reduced tissue perfusion) and/&#xD;
      or hypoxic lower limb conditions which result from these conditions reduces availability of&#xD;
      both oxygen and nutrients, making these wounds especially hard to heal. These wounds last on&#xD;
      average 12 to 13 months, but this varies widely; many will remain open for years or never&#xD;
      heal, and up to 30% of DFUs go onto amputation. Even when they do heal, wounds recur in&#xD;
      60-70% of patients, decrease quality of life, and are a significant cause of morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for telehealth and remote patient monitoring in the current climate is critical and&#xD;
      reinforces the VA's strategy to protect and care for Veterans, their families, heath care&#xD;
      providers and staff in the face of this pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VA's tactic to shift outpatient care to a &quot;telehealth&quot; mode, with phone, video and/or&#xD;
      electronic communication to meet the needs of the ambulatory patient is difficult to achieve&#xD;
      in wound care as clinicians rely heavily on the visual appearance of the wound to direct&#xD;
      their therapy decisions. Thus, it is imperative to validate a remote monitoring tool that&#xD;
      offers standard telehealth care as well as accurate, consistent, and simple wound measurement&#xD;
      and imagery. Having the ability to manage complex wounds accurately should enable quick&#xD;
      identification of early warning signs that the wound is deteriorating thus facilitating&#xD;
      appropriate triaging of patients that need urgent face to face medical review.&#xD;
