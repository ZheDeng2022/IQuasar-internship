  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The estimated prevalence of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in Singapore will be&#xD;
      approximately 20% and 25% respectively by the year 2035. Therefore, effective population&#xD;
      based interventions are urgently warranted to halt this burden. Lifestyle intervention is the&#xD;
      cornerstone of diabetes prevention and even remission. For example, dietary patterns such as&#xD;
      the Mediterranean diet, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet etc. have all&#xD;
      been shown to reduce risk of type 2 diabetes incidence. Therefore, given the successful&#xD;
      utility of various dietary patterns, this randomized controlled trial will investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a food based dietary intervention, within an Asian dietary context, using&#xD;
      legumes, low glycemic index (GI) starches (i.e., rice, noodles etc.), healthier vegetable oil&#xD;
      blend as well as herbs and spices to improve various markers metabolic health, including&#xD;
      glucose homeostasis in individuals with prediabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes has increased by more than two-fold over the past&#xD;
      three decades, with ~60% of diabetics in the world currently living in Asian countries. Type&#xD;
      2 diabetes occurs at a younger age and at lower body mass index (BMI &lt; 22 kg/m2) in Asians as&#xD;
      compared other ethnic groups. Among the various evidence based approaches to diabetes&#xD;
      prevention, diet plays one of the most important roles. In particular, food based&#xD;
      interventions are beginning to emerge as superior strategies in the prevention of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes compared to nutrient based approaches. It is important of course to align food based&#xD;
      interventions to the cultural and region specific aspects of food choice and eating behavior&#xD;
      if such lifestyle pattern is to be implemented in a given population. To this effect, the&#xD;
      investigators will investigate the effects of a multiple food components in combination on&#xD;
      metabolic health outcomes, within an Asian dietary context. This proposed study will be&#xD;
      undertaken in prediabetics who are at greater life-time risk of developing type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      than their normoglycemic counterparts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the current evidence, the investigators will design a food based intervention&#xD;
      consisting of a diet rich in legumes, low GI starches (such as rice, noodles),healthier&#xD;
      vegetable oil blends (such as rice bran, peanut, sesame seed and sunflower oils) as well as&#xD;
      certain herbs and spices. As part of this study, each volunteer will be provided with 2 of&#xD;
      their 3 meals per day, consisting of the above mentioned foods, for a period of 16 weeks. The&#xD;
      control group will also be provided 2 meals per day, matched for the total calorie contents.&#xD;
      The total calorie content of each provided meal will be approximately 500 kcal for males and&#xD;
      400 kcal for females. The difference in the calorie contents between the genders will be made&#xD;
      up by using prepacked snacks. There will also be further differences in the snack types&#xD;
      between the two intervention (treatment vs control) groups. While the treatment group will&#xD;
      consist of healthier snacks such as seeds and wholemeal crackers, the control group snack&#xD;
      ingredients will be made from refined flour biscuits etc. The remaining foods (free choice)&#xD;
      during the day will be monitored regularly by the study dietitian to ensure a small calorie&#xD;
      deficit that should lead to an approximately 5% weight loss in both intervention and control&#xD;
      groups. Therefore, while it is expected that even the control group will achieve some&#xD;
      metabolic health benefits during this 16 week dietary intervention (indirectly due to weight&#xD;
      loss), the investigators anticipate that the treatment group will attain greater benefits as&#xD;
      compared to the control group, due to the differences in their food constituents. The effects&#xD;
      of dietary interventions on metabolic health will be assessed at every 4-8 week intervals.&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures will include several markers of glucose homeostasis (including&#xD;
      HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and a 2-hr oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]). The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will include blood lipid profile, fructosamine, adiponectin, markers of&#xD;
      oxidative stress and chronic inflammation.&#xD;
