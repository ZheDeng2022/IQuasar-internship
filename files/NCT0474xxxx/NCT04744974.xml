  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN) is a chronic blood cancer without cure. The major clinical&#xD;
      issues in MPN are 1) an increased risk of blood clots 2) symptoms thought to be driven by&#xD;
      chronic inflammation which in some cases can be debilitating and 3) progression to acute&#xD;
      leukemia. Our current management of MPN focuses on preventing blood clots and relieving&#xD;
      symptoms. However, treatments that reduce symptoms such as JAK inhibitors are limited to late&#xD;
      stage MPN patients and have significant side effects including immunosuppression, reduction&#xD;
      in platelets, and increased risk of skin cancer. Therefore, low risk interventions are sorely&#xD;
      needed for MPN patients that can reduce symptoms. Diet represents a low risk way to reduce&#xD;
      inflammation, specifically a Mediterranean diet has been found to reduce inflammation in&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. We recently completed a clinical trial that demonstrated MPN patients&#xD;
      can adopt a Mediterranean diet if given dietician counseling and curriculum. However, in&#xD;
      order to reach a larger group of people a fully remotely administered study is necessary. We&#xD;
      are now moving on to a fully online dietary intervention to determine the impact of a&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet on symptom burden among MPN patients. However, first we must establish&#xD;
      that our fully online intervention and curriculum can be feasibly administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here we describe our pilot study as a preparatory study designed to test the performance&#xD;
      characteristics and capabilities of study designs, measures, procedures, recruitment&#xD;
      criteria, and operational strategies that are under consideration for use in our subsequent,&#xD;
      larger study.&#xD;
