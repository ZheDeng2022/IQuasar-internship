  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Prisoners have complex mental health needs, and there is a disproportionately&#xD;
      higher incidence of mental health problems compared with the general population. Although&#xD;
      research indicates that psychological interventions are effective in treating prisoners with&#xD;
      anxiety and depression, medication is often the only treatment available in prisons. Living&#xD;
      Life To The Full (LLTTF) is a life skills programme teaching skills to cope with life&#xD;
      stresses, and has been shown to reduce anxiety and depression in individuals in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will prisoners take part in and engage with LLTTF?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do LLTTF booklets need to be adapted for prisoners?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does LLTTF show an effect of reducing anxiety and/or depression?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does history of HI reduce responsivity to LLTTF?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Does LLTTF reduce number of breaches of prison rules?&#xD;
&#xD;
      What did the study involve?: Prison Officers in HMP Shotts were invited to take part and&#xD;
      attend LLTTF training. Male prisoners aged 21 and above in HMP Shotts were recruited using&#xD;
      posters. Assessment of anxiety, depression, perceived functioning, and history of head injury&#xD;
      was carried out. Prisoners' work attendance and breaches of prison rules for the month prior&#xD;
      to and month during LLTTF was collected. Prison Officers and prisoners provided feedback of&#xD;
      LLTTF at end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Six (6%) Prison Officers attended LLTTF training and two (33%) withdrew prior to&#xD;
      prisoner recruitment. 6% (n=15) of prisoners invited to take part volunteered and were&#xD;
      eligible. Seven prisoners completed LLTTF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There was a sign of a treatment effect with reductions in depression following LLTTF. Anxiety&#xD;
      reduced at the last session and increased at post-treatment, which reflects the deterioration&#xD;
      in a minority of prisoners. Due to the small sample size, history of HI and responsivity was&#xD;
      not explored. Prisoners were not on report the month prior to LLTTF, therefore impact on&#xD;
      breached rules was not explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback from Prison Officers and prisoners indicated materials required adaptation for&#xD;
      prison, such as including activities feasible in prison. Prison Officers highlighted&#xD;
      practical barriers to delivery of LLTTF, including limited time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: Guided self-help in prison is worth pursuing. Revision of materials with Prison&#xD;
      Officers and prisoners is recommended, and evaluated in future research. Due to practical&#xD;
      barriers reported by Prison Officers, designated guided self-help workers may be better&#xD;
      placed to deliver this intervention.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Eligible prisoners were adult males (aged 21+) at HMP Shotts who experienced mild-severe&#xD;
        levels of psychological distress (defined as PHQ score of 5+), were prepared to attend four&#xD;
        sessions of the guided self-help, able to read and write, and able to engage in the guided&#xD;
        self-help.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prisoners were excluded if deemed, by Prison Officers or healthcare staff, to pose a direct&#xD;
        risk of harm to the field researcher (or were at risk of imminent and significant&#xD;
        self-harm).&#xD;
