  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in adult participants diagnosed with advanced tumours to&#xD;
      characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and activity of FS222. This is&#xD;
      a Phase 1, multi-center, open label, multiple-dose, first in human study, designed to&#xD;
      systematically assess safety and tolerability, and to identify the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for FS222 in participants with advanced tumours.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and response will also be assessed.&#xD;

    <description>The initial cohorts will enroll sequentially as single participant cohorts. If no DLT or ≥Grade 2 study drug related adverse event is observed, then dosing will proceed in a 3+3 design. Additional participants will be recruited into the PK/PD expansion cohorts at dose levels deemed safe during dose escalation. Once a tolerated dose has been established participants will be recruited into tumour-specific expansion cohorts.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced,&#xD;
             unresectable or metastatic solid tumours for whom standard therapy has proven to be&#xD;
             ineffective, intolerable or is considered inappropriate. This criterion does not apply&#xD;
             to the PK/PD expansion cohort, where tumour-specific criteria will apply instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No more than 1 line of prior therapy with ICB treatment. Exceptions as defined in&#xD;
             protocol for PK/PD expansion cohorts will apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received prior ICB, or any concurrent chemotherapy,&#xD;
             radiotherapy, investigational, biologic or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment may&#xD;
             be eligible for enrolment following a washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received prior anti-PD-L1 therapy are eligible if PD-L1 therapy&#xD;
             was discontinued ≥6 months prior to entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have failed a prior ICB regimen should document it.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease. Exceptions as defined in protocol for PK/PD expansion cohorts will&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants with active autoimmune disease.&#xD;

             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of uncontrolled intercurrent illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical conditions that do not permit&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Judgment by the investigator that the participant is unsuitable to participate in the&#xD;
             study, and the participant is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions&#xD;
             and requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant laboratory abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled CNS metastases, primary CNS tumours with CNS metastases as only&#xD;
             measurable disease. Exceptions as defined in protocol for PK/PD expansion cohorts will&#xD;
             apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of any Grade ≥3 irAE that has not improved to Grade ≤1, except for&#xD;
             endocrine deficiencies that are managed by HRT; significant treatment-related cytokine&#xD;
             release syndrome; systemic inflammatory response syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of immunosuppressive agents, prior organ transplantation requiring&#xD;
             immunosuppression, hypersensitivity or intolerance to mAb or their excipients, or&#xD;
             persisting toxicity related to prior therapy of Grade &gt;1 NCI CTCAE Version 5.0 .&#xD;
