  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases&#xD;
      (IBD) of unknown etiology. The pathophysiology of IBD relates to the mucosal immune response&#xD;
      to antigenic stimulation from the gut microbiota secondary to environmental influence, on a&#xD;
      background of genetic susceptibility. IBD represents an important public health problem&#xD;
      because it affects mostly young people at an age when they are most active in their private&#xD;
      and professional life, and a management challenge because of its unpredictable relapsing&#xD;
      nature. During the last few decades the incidence of IBD has changed in many ways. Incidence&#xD;
      rates of traditionally high incidence areas such as the United States and Europe is remaining&#xD;
      relatively stable or even decreasing, while the diseases have become more prevalent in&#xD;
      previously low incidence areas, including Asia. Our latest systematic review has demonstrated&#xD;
      that the highest reported prevalence of IBD was still in Europe and North America, however,&#xD;
      the incidence of IBD has been rising in newly industrialized countries since 1990.&#xD;

      Investigators aim to study the incidence, demographic factors, and disease outcomes of IBD&#xD;
      patients and environmental factors associated with IBD in 29 regions globally. Via the web&#xD;
      registration, investigators intend to form a new prospective, uniformly diagnosed,&#xD;
      population-based inception cohort of patients with IBD. Physicians, gastroenterologists,&#xD;
      family doctors, surgeons and pathologists in the study area will be notified repeatedly about&#xD;
      the study by letter, telephone, internet, personal visit of the investigators, and encouraged&#xD;
      to inform investigators of every possible new case of IBD. Endoscopic, pathology and&#xD;
      radiology records will be canvassed repeatedly for likely cases, both electronically and&#xD;
      manually. By these methods, investigators intend to capture over 90% of possible cases. All&#xD;
      patients are required to meet the diagnostic criteria for IBD on the basis of clinical&#xD;
      symptoms, endoscopic or radiological evidence or mucosal biopsies. Infectious&#xD;
      gastroenteritis, tuberculosis, entamoeba and cancer have to be ruled out. The web-based&#xD;
      database application will be used for online registration of the various registration forms&#xD;
      and questionnaires and the database is located on a central secured server. With the data&#xD;
      collected, an online interactive atlas will be created which allows the community to&#xD;
      visualize the most up-to-date epidemiology of IBD with the aims to promotes knowledge&#xD;
      translation and research endeavours of stakeholders and provide infrastructure, resources,&#xD;
      and expertise to define Crohn's disease burden in regions of the world where the disease is&#xD;
      emerging.&#xD;
