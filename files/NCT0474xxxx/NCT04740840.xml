  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 200 inpatients or outpatients in the Department of cardiovascular medicine of the&#xD;
      third people's Hospital of Mianyang City from April 2021 to October 2021, who met the&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria of ish2020 international hypertension practice guidelines, were selected&#xD;
      and randomly divided into control group and experimental group, with 100 cases in each group.&#xD;
      The control group was treated with amlodipine and the experimental group was treated with&#xD;
      levoamlodipine. The changes of blood pressure and serum inflammatory factors were observed&#xD;
      before and after treatment.&#xD;

    <description>According to the inclusion criteria of the trial, those who met the diagnosis of hypertension were randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group was treated with 2.5mg levamlodipine to lower blood pressure. Abdominal blood was emptying before the start of the trial and at the first and third month of medication.Data on CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, Lp-PLA2 and ATP were collected.</description>

    <description>According to the inclusion criteria, patients who met the diagnosis of hypertension were randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group was given 5mg amlodipine to lower blood pressure. Fasting blood was collected before the trial and during the first and third months of treatment. CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, Lp-PLA2 and ATP data were collected.</description>
