      This project aims to enhance the support for patients with breast and bowel cancer after&#xD;
      treatment. Current follow-up care includes either self-management with patient-initiated&#xD;
      contacts (breast cancer) or scheduled hospital visits for scans/tests for recurrence (bowel&#xD;
      cancer). Building on extensive experience with online patient self-reporting of symptoms&#xD;
      during treatment, the study will develop, implement and evaluate satisfaction with an&#xD;
      improved electronic system to engage breast and bowel cancer survivors to self-report&#xD;
      symptoms/problems online from home and get immediate tailored advice for self-management or&#xD;
      hospital contact. The reports are displayed real-time in the hospital records alongside&#xD;
      scans/tests to inform clinical management.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A structured plan of development, evaluation and implementation is proposed, based on the&#xD;
      Medical Research Council (MRC) complex interventions framework and the principles of Action&#xD;
      Research model (namely; Purpose choice on solving practical problems; Contextual focus; Data&#xD;
      that helps track changes and sense making; Participation in research process and Knowledge&#xD;
      diffusion). Action research is suited to identifying problems in clinical practice and&#xD;
      helping develop potential solutions in order to improve practice. The study will use an&#xD;
      experimental action research approach incorporating the action research cycle (Plan Do Study&#xD;
      Act).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness evaluation of patient/clinician acceptance, feasibility, patient&#xD;
      benefits/satisfaction will be performed using a non-randomised 'Before-After study' approach,&#xD;
      followed by immediate implementation in practice for faster patient benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcomes measured will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient-Reported Outcomes questionnaires: quality of life, symptom control, and&#xD;
           self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical measures: number of hospital contacts, recurrence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Process measures: survivors compliance with self-reports, clinical tests attendance;&#xD;
           using online self-management resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be structured in four phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 1 (Months 0-12): Develop the content of the surveillance toolkits for breast and bowel&#xD;
      (colorectal) cancers and setup on the electronic system. This will include the selection of&#xD;
      cancer-specific symptoms for patient self-reporting, collating the existing evidence on&#xD;
      side-effects management and the development of patient advice corresponding to severity&#xD;
      levels. Once the two toolkits for breast and bowel (colorectal) cancers are completed, they&#xD;
      will be set up on the electronic system. Printed booklets can also be produced from these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer survivors and caregivers will be invited from outpatient surveillance clinics or by&#xD;
      telephone by the cancer team if discharged recently from secondary care, and by public&#xD;
      advertising for breast and colorectal cancer survivors volunteers. Purposive sampling will&#xD;
      represent a variety of age groups, cancer recurrence risk, time post treatment,&#xD;
      socio-economic background, expecting a sample of 8-10 survivors/carers per cancer site.&#xD;
      Participants will be invited for an interview conducted over the telephone or at St James's&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare professionals (HCP) involved in breast and colorectal cancer care at St James's&#xD;
      Hospital will also be invited to participate in interviews. This is done face to face at the&#xD;
      hospital followed up by a phone call or an individual email depending on the previous&#xD;
      conversations had between the researchers and the HCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be transcribed verbatim and subjected to thematic content analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Select questions for self-reporting&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine severity thresholds&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine content of the self-management guidance&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Describe the current usual care after treatment by cancer type and how to modify it to&#xD;
           incorporate remote surveillance&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Identify potential improvements to the electronic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 2:&quot;Before study&quot; (Months 6-30; 12-months recruitment,12-months follow-up)The before&#xD;
      study will be a structured audit of current practice, running in parallel with Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who consent will complete outcome measures at baseline, 3, 6 and 2 months on&#xD;
      paper. Demographic data will be collected after consent and clinical data will be collected&#xD;
      via the EPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include recruitment over 12 months of all consecutive eligible patients with a&#xD;
      follow-up of 12 months. The estimated numbers are 120 new bowel (colorectal) cancer patients&#xD;
      per year and 300 breast cancer patients. The study anticipates 70% consent rate, giving&#xD;
      approximately 85 bowel (colorectal) and 210 breast cancer participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish data on current practice using clinical and patient outcomes and best methods&#xD;
           for collecting them&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provide 'Before' data to compare to &quot;After study&quot; to estimate the effects of the new&#xD;
           intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish prospectively what proportion of eligible patients would consent to a remote&#xD;
           monitoring study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 3:&quot;After study&quot;(Months 18-42;12-months recruitment, 12-months follow-up) Participants&#xD;
      will be completing the intervention for 12 months. The 'After study' will start when Phase 1&#xD;
      is completed, including a successful usability testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who consent will complete outcomes measures at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months on&#xD;
      paper (same as Phase 2). In addition, they will also complete the intervention: online&#xD;
      symptom reporting questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data will be collected after consent and clinical data via the Electronic patient&#xD;
      records (EPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on current experience of other studies conducted 15% of breast and 20% of bowel&#xD;
      (colorectal) patients will not use online resources. Therefore, the estimated number of full&#xD;
      participants will be about 170 in breast and 70 in bowel (colorectal) cancer clinics. The&#xD;
      remote monitoring will only be available to participants classed as being moderate to lower&#xD;
      risk by their clinical team. The intervention is an additional service for patients conducted&#xD;
      along side their standard cancer care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the effects of the intervention in terms of participants' quality of life at&#xD;
           baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine survivors' engagement with the intervention - acceptability, feasibility and use&#xD;
           of the online system and respective advice&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine clinicians' engagement&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Monitor the safety i.e. diagnoses of recurrences and psychological morbidity, how were&#xD;
           those detected&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluate impact on participants' self-efficacy in managing cancer consequences and fear&#xD;
           of recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evaluate participants' satisfaction with care&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Compare use of National Health Service (NHS) resources in Before and After phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention (as developed in Phase 1) will be implemented following the relevant staff&#xD;
      and participant training. The frequency of participants' completions will be determined in&#xD;
      Phase 1. Participants will be asked to complete the online symptom monitoring from home, with&#xD;
      the possibility to complete the questions more often, if they experience any symptoms they&#xD;
      may wish to report. Text message or email reminders will be sent to the participants (based&#xD;
      on their preferred contact method) as a prompt to complete the online monitoring symptom&#xD;
      questions, and where relevant to attend for the blood tests or surveillance scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providers are expected to review and respond to any notifications for significant symptoms,&#xD;
      in line with the agreed thresholds and are expected to review the self-reports during the&#xD;
      clinic visits, discuss them with the patient and take any actions, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and staff interviews will be conducted during and at the end of Phase 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 4: (starting month 30, with specific launch activities 42-48): Roll-out and&#xD;
      implementation in practice. Following the principles of the Action research model (Act&#xD;
      phase), the aim is to start roll-out immediately after completion of the 12-month recruitment&#xD;
      in the &quot;After&quot; study. This will involve further work to apply the learning from Phase 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Simplify patient approach and consent to integrate it into the routine clinics flow&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify appropriate clinic staff to approach patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Modify, if needed, the self-reported questions, the thresholds or the content of the&#xD;
           advice.&#xD;
