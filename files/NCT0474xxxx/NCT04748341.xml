  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtually 10% of newborns suffer respiratory distress at birth thus need intervention from&#xD;
      proficient health professionals. Pakistan is one of the top ten countries that carry&#xD;
      two-thirds of the global burden of neonatal deaths. It is suggested that most of these deaths&#xD;
      can be prevented through the provision of trained emergency birth attendants, in which&#xD;
      education plays an integral role. Since its inception in the neonatal resuscitation program,&#xD;
      we are still in the struggle to find out the best strategies to disseminate NRP knowledge,&#xD;
      training, and guidelines that promise the best outcome. Hence, little published data on this&#xD;
      phenomenon is available regarding undergraduate students. That determines the best way to&#xD;
      educate them in performing the skills that urgently require an infrequent needed such as&#xD;
      neonatal resuscitation. Therefore, this study intended to address this gap in the education&#xD;
      of neonatal resuscitation through two different approaches. One is a traditional 2-step&#xD;
      method and the other is an adapted Pedagogical framework (Lean, See, Practice, Prove, Do and&#xD;
      Maintain).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, nurses are the largest workforce in the healthcare system that are directly engaged&#xD;
      in the provision of newborn care. They should be conversant and competent in neonatal&#xD;
      resuscitation. However, the majority of nurses are not skillful in the respective field. The&#xD;
      situation is not very different when we are talking about nursing students. Who are our&#xD;
      future workforce, hence are found incompetent in emergency newborn management and neonatal&#xD;
      resuscitation. It is well documented that effective educational programs in preservice&#xD;
      settings such as schools of midwifery, nursing, and medicine, established more active forms&#xD;
      of lifelong learning to improve the quality of care. While the transformation of theoretical&#xD;
      knowledge into clinical practice requires effective teaching in the field of resuscitation is&#xD;
      a vital element for all undergraduate students. However, like many other developing countries&#xD;
      in Pakistan, mostly traditional methods are following in nursing education. While the&#xD;
      traditional method of teaching is insufficient to meet the educational demands of nursing&#xD;
      students in clinical practice. Hence, Nursing students often are unprepared and lacking&#xD;
      confidence in simple, yet life-saving procedures such as neonatal resuscitation. Therefore,&#xD;
      incorporating an effective model and framework in nursing education is needed that could&#xD;
      enhance nursing students' skills and improve clinical outcomes. The &quot;Learn, See, Practice,&#xD;
      Prove, Do, and Maintain&quot; (LSPPDM) pedagogy is one of such frameworks synthesized after&#xD;
      intensely reviewing the literature. This framework is acting as a guiding path for educators&#xD;
      in teaching and learning procedural skills. As Knowledge is considering a prerequisite for&#xD;
      competence in skill performance and to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational program&#xD;
      self -efficacy measurement is an important tool. Thus, the important variables knowledge,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and skill have been selected for this study. Thus, the study objective will&#xD;
      be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the knowledge, skill, and self-efficacy among undergraduate nursing students&#xD;
      learning of neonatal resuscitation through &quot;Learn, See, Practice, Prove, Do, Maintain&#xD;
      pedagogy&quot; as compared to those who will learn through the traditional method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will contribute essentially to determine the effectiveness of an adapted&#xD;
      pedagogical framework in the teaching and learning of neonatal resuscitation skills,&#xD;
      especially in a resource-limited society. Moreover, the study findings will help the&#xD;
      organization to develop strategies for improving nursing education.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study design is a Single-blind randomized control trial conducted in the College of Nursing, Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore, Pakistan. A sample size of 72 nursing students (36 in each group) will be taken through simple random sampling. The students allocated from each professional in group A and group B through the Lottery method. Allocation of participants was concealed using envelop method. A total of 6 weeks of intervention will be provided to both groups. Group A will be taught through the two steps traditional method (2 lectures/week + 1 skill lab/week). On the contrary Group B will learn through the 6-step method constituted 2 lecture/week + video + 2skill lab/week (1 session under instructor + 1 session for skill maintenance).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The data will be collected at two points in time. 1st-time data will be collected as a pre-test before the educational intervention. The 2nd-time data will be collected after 6 weeks of educational intervention. Two facilitator evaluators will be trained regarding the scoring of each scale in a two-hour workshop before data collection. All the students were allotted code after allocation. Only the principal investigator knows the allocation status of each student code. The skill was tested through simulation scenarios in the skill lab. The facilitators, who assessed the student's skills, endure uninformed regarding the student's allocation status and sequence of the scenario in the pre-and post-data collection.</masking_description>
