  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has prolonged&#xD;
      the survival substantially for selected patients with peritoneal metastases from colorectal&#xD;
      cancer.Bleeding and thromboembolic disease have been reported as postoperative complications&#xD;
      related to this advanced open surgical treatment. However, perioperative changes in&#xD;
      coagulation and fibrinolysis are only sparsely reported in the literature.The mainstay of&#xD;
      treatment with curative intend of none-advanced colorectal cancer is minimally invasive&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The approach is considered associated&#xD;
      with a lower risk of thromboembolic disease than open surgery. Despite differences in extent&#xD;
      of surgery and thromboembolic risk the same extended thromboprophylaxis regimen for 28 days&#xD;
      is currently prescribed to patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC as well as&#xD;
      minimally invasive rectal cancer resection. This study aims to investigate all parts of the&#xD;
      coagulation system and fibrinolysis, and thereby thromboembolic risk and potential bleeding&#xD;
      in two groups of patients with different extent of surgical trauma: 1) Colorectal cancer&#xD;
      patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC and 2) rectal cancer patients undergoing&#xD;
      minimal invasive rectal cancer resection. Our hypothesis is that patients undergoing&#xD;
      cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC are exposed to more aggravated alterations of coagulation&#xD;
      and fibrinolysis than patients undergoing minimally invasive rectal cancer resection.&#xD;
