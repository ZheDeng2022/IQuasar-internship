  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of MRG002 in patients with HER2-low locally advanced or metastatic BC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two parts. The first part is efficacy exploration and the&#xD;
      second part is efficacy verification. During the course of efficacy exploration, 33 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled to preliminarily evaluate the safety and efficacy of MRG002. The second part&#xD;
      will be adjusted according to the result of the first part. 29 subjects are planned to be&#xD;
      enrolled. Considering the dropout rate of 10%, approximately 33 subjects are planned to be&#xD;
      enrolled. A total of 66 subjects are planned to be enrolled in efficacy exploration and&#xD;
      verification.&#xD;
