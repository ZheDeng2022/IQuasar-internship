  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Space maintainers are used to preserve the space after premature loss of teeth but they could&#xD;
      effect some factors that play a role in caries formation. The research aimed to assess the&#xD;
      impacts of removable and fixed space maintainers on the salivary pH, flow rate, and&#xD;
      Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus carriage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the usage of space maintainers can reduce the severity of problems that arise from&#xD;
      the early loss of teeth, there are concerns regarding the impact of fixed and removable&#xD;
      appliances on factors that can lead to dental caries. All space maintainer appliances are&#xD;
      plaque retentive since bands and brackets increase the retention of plaque and food on tooth&#xD;
      surfaces, reduce the clearance of plaque by saliva and make conventional oral hygiene for&#xD;
      plaque removal more difficult, therefore, they may cause caries development.Space maintainers&#xD;
      can favor caries formation by changing the oral microflora. patients aged between 4-10 years,&#xD;
      each of whom had an indication for a fixed (n=19) or removable space maintainer (n=19), were&#xD;
      enrolled in this research. The salivary pH, saliva flow rate, Streptococcus mutans and&#xD;
      Lactobacillus counts in saliva were measured just prior to the application of space&#xD;
      maintainers (baseline-T0) and in the course of the follow-up; at the 1st (T1), 3rd (T2), and&#xD;
      6th (T3) months. The Wilcoxon, Mann-Whithney U test and Friedman tests were used for&#xD;
      statistical analyses.&#xD;
