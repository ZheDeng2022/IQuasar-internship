      The purpose of this study is to determine whether advancing the timing of home parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition from overnight to daytime regimens leads to improved glucose profiles and sleep&#xD;
      quality, and other changes in plasma metabolic signatures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence suggests that considering the time-of-day in clinical care may optimize&#xD;
      health, partly through limiting sleep disruption and circadian misalignment. Acute sleep and&#xD;
      circadian rhythms disturbances are associated with cardiometabolic derangements, including&#xD;
      persistent hyperglycemia, a significant contributor to life-threatening complications.&#xD;
      However, it is currently considered standard practice for patients on parenteral nutrition to&#xD;
      be fed for 12-hour periods overnight. Current guidelines lack explicit guidance regarding the&#xD;
      time-of-day when nutrition support should be administered. Thus, the overall objective of the&#xD;
      clinical trial is to comprehensively examine a novel dimension of clinical nutrition by&#xD;
      determining whether advancing the timing of home parenteral nutrition from overnight to&#xD;
      daytime regimens leads to improved glucose profiles and sleep quality, and other changes in&#xD;
      plasma metabolic signatures. The study is a 2-week controlled cross-over feeding trial where&#xD;
      20 short bowel syndrome patients will follow their usual overnight parenteral nutrition&#xD;
      regimen for one week, and then advance their feeds to daytime for a second week. Patients&#xD;
      will be assessed objectively using non-invasive, novel technologies and 'omics techniques.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that advancing the timing of home parenteral nutrition feeds to&#xD;
      a daytime regimen is a cost-efficient, effective, and feasible nutrition timing&#xD;
      countermeasure against metabolic derangements, fragmented sleep, and decreased quality of&#xD;
      life. Results of this study may provide evidence-based, cost-efficient, and effective&#xD;
      nutrition support countermeasures against hyperglycemia and sleep disruption, and could&#xD;
      potentially modify current widespread clinical nutrition support practice.&#xD;

    <description>Sleep will be objectively measured from actigraphy.

    <description>Glucose will be continuously measured using continuous glucose sensors. Area under-the-curve of blood glucose during the 12-hour feeds will be calculated using the trapezoid method and adjusted for baseline glucose values. Area under-the-curve of glucose will be averaged for each of the two 1-week feeding regimens (nighttime and daytime).</description>
