    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of radiation therapy with&#xD;
      hormone therapy (ADT) and chemotherapy as an investigational study treatment for prostate&#xD;
      cancer. This is a phase 2 study to deliver focal radiation with pulsed systemic therapy of&#xD;
      Abiraterone, ADT and Lynparza (olaparib) in men with castration sensitive oligometastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma (pure small cell or pure&#xD;
             neuroendocrine prostate cancer are not allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radical prostatectomy OR external beam radiation with curative intent (e.g. HiFU&#xD;
             or partial gland therapies are not acceptable) delivered to prostate. Patients with&#xD;
             prior radical prostatectomy with positive margins must have undergone salvage or&#xD;
             adjuvant radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have newly diagnosed oligometastatic prostate cancer based on molecular imaging (e.g.&#xD;
             68Ga-PSMA PET/CT or Axumin, excludes FDG-PET). Oligometastatic prostate cancer is&#xD;
             between 1 and ≤ 5 radiation treatment sites. A site can be up to 5 cm and contain&#xD;
             multiple lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newly diagnosed oligometastatic disease requires that no prior image guided radiation&#xD;
             was given to sites outside of the prostate bed or pelvic lymph nodes that are&#xD;
             typically treated in the salvage or adjuvant radiation setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a PSA &gt;0.2 ng/mL (confirmed ≥4 weeks later with subsequent rise)&#xD;
             for those who underwent radical prostatectomy. For those with prior curative&#xD;
             radiotherapy, they must meet the Phoenix criteria for progression (nadir of PSA + 2&#xD;
             ng/mL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically fit for radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All molecular positive disease is within an anatomic distribution that (in the view of&#xD;
             the radiation oncologist) can be treated safely per standard radiation oncology&#xD;
             principles&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidate for androgen deprivation therapy (e.g. leuprolide, goserelin, degarelix)&#xD;

             insert for guidance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have normal organ and bone marrow function measured within 28 days prior&#xD;
             to administration of study treatment as defined per protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Androgen deprivation therapy with or without second generation androgen receptor&#xD;
             inhibitors or abiraterone (when given to optimize focal therapies like surgery or&#xD;
             radiation) in the curative setting are allowed as long as testosterone has recovered&#xD;
             to above 150 ng/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Androgen deprivation therapy (with or without second generation androgen receptor&#xD;
             inhibitors or abiraterone) for metastatic disease is allowed up to 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             registration. If previous ADT was used in curative setting, testosterone recovery must&#xD;
             be documented (testosterone &gt;150 ng/dL) OR &gt;1 year elapsed from last administration of&#xD;
             curative attempt ADT before recent ADT was resumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG ≤1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must use a condom during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             olaparib or abiraterone when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a&#xD;
             woman of childbearing potential. Female partners of childbearing potential of patients&#xD;
