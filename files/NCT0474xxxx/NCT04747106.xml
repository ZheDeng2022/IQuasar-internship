  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past ten years, the extracorporeal liver support system has been widely used in&#xD;
      clinical practice as a first-line treatment of liver failure. Plasma exchange (PE) can remove&#xD;
      toxic substances in ACLF patients, reduce liver damage, and replenish coagulation factors,&#xD;
      albumin and immunoglobulins, thereby improving the liver's microenvironment and accelerating&#xD;
      liver regeneration and functional recovery. The ACLF study showed that PE can improve the&#xD;
      symptoms of patients and improve the short-term prognosis of patients, but there are still&#xD;
      studies showing that PE does not significantly improve the short-term prognosis of patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, the therapeutic effect of PE on ACLF is still controversial. We consider that some&#xD;
      people may benefit from plasma exchange, and new indicators are needed to guide disease&#xD;
      stratification treatment. Our multi-center prospective data show that plasma exchange has a&#xD;
      tendency to improve survival in ACLF-2. After stratifying with ADP inhibition rate in ACLF-2,&#xD;
      patients with ADP inhibition rate greater than 30% will be treated 28 days after PE&#xD;
      treatment. The prognosis is improving. Therefore, we consider that PE is expected to reduce&#xD;
      the mortality of patients with ACLF 2 with an ADP suppression rate greater than 30%, but&#xD;
      prospective large-sample clinical studies are still needed.&#xD;
