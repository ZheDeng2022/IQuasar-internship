  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conduct a feasibility pilot RCT of a newly developed colorectal cancer screening (CRC)&#xD;
      decision aid (DA) including 66 LHL adults 76-85 years recruited from community health&#xD;
      centers. Hypotheses: Patients in the intervention group will be more likely to change their&#xD;
      intentions to be screened with fewer patients with &lt;10 year LE and/or those with &gt;10 year LE&#xD;
      and no risk factors intending to be screened and more with &gt;10 year LE and risk factors for&#xD;
      CRC and/or those who have never been screened intending to be screened (primary outcome). The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are that the patients in the intervention group will have 1. increased&#xD;
      knowledge of CRC screening options and the benefits and risks of these options; 2. increased&#xD;
      SDM engagement; and 3. find the DA acceptable. Investigators also anticipate that at least&#xD;
      50% of eligible participants will choose to participate in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will recruit and survey 66 adults (to reach a goal of 60 with complete data),&#xD;
      75-85 years with low health literacy LHL (30 per arm) over 24 months to learn the effects of&#xD;
      the newly developed CRC DA pamphlet on older adult's screening intentions, knowledge of&#xD;
      options and the benefits and harms, and SDM from community health centers. Investigators&#xD;
      collect baseline data over the phone prior to the visit. Patients who are eligible and&#xD;
      willing to participate will come to a regularly scheduled visit with their primary care&#xD;
      physician (PCP) early to answer the pretest questions. Stratifying by sex, 30 participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive the CRC DA pamphlet and 30 will be randomized to receive the&#xD;
      home safety information at the visit in case they cancel their appointment and reschedule.&#xD;
      The home safety information is 2 pages, and was designed by AGS Health in Aging Foundation.&#xD;
      It has been used successfully in prior studies of DAs as a control intervention.&#xD;
      Investigators chose this pamphlet for the control arm because it is written at &lt;7th grade&#xD;
      reading level and reading about home safety should not affect screening decisions. Providing&#xD;
      the control group the home safety pamphlet to read reduces response bias since it helps keep&#xD;
      participants blinded to the intervention of interest and compensates for the time and&#xD;
      attention required by the intervention group to read the DA. At the visit, participants will&#xD;
      review the DA or the home safety pamphlet. The revised CRC DA pamphlet is expected to take&#xD;
      5-10 minutes to read as well as the home safety pamphlet. After completing the pre-survey&#xD;
      questionnaire before the visit the patient will have their PCP visit. The post-test will be&#xD;
      asked after the PCP visit in person or over the phone (depending on the participant's&#xD;
      preference, access to a phone, and ability to stay after their appointment for enough time to&#xD;
      complete the post-visit questionnaire). Investigators will conduct a chart review at 6 months&#xD;
      to see if a CRC screening discussion occurred and the outcome (i.e., qualitative trends in&#xD;
      use of CRC screening). Investigators will also call each patient at 6 months to ask about&#xD;
      their CRC screening intentions.&#xD;
