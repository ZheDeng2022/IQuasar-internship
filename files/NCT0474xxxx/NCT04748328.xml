  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was a prospective observational study analysis of cases having complete ACL tear.&#xD;
      Study conduct between February 2021 to December 2023. All the patients attending the&#xD;
      emergency or Out Patient Department (OPD) of those hospitals with knee injuries were&#xD;
      evaluated for an ACL tear. Patients who meet inclusion criteria and give consent for&#xD;
      participation in the study will observe for two years. Patient in Arifin Achmad Hospital&#xD;
      Pekanbaru will follow rehabilitation treatment and optional delayed reconstruction after 12&#xD;
      weeks, while patient in Gatot Subroto Army Hospital Jakarta will performed early&#xD;
      reconstruction treatment. After taking informed consent, all subjects were provided a&#xD;
      self-administered patient questionnaire containing International Knee Documentation Committee&#xD;
      (IKDC) score, ACL-RSI, Lysholm, and Tegner Activity Level (TAL) scores. These questionnaires&#xD;
      will be measured at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 96 weeks. Besides that, all subjects were provided&#xD;
      SF12 for measuring utility value by converting to SF6D. Clinical value of the Lachman test,&#xD;
      pivot shift test will be performed. One independent orthopedic surgeon will keep all records&#xD;
      and evaluate the results. All costs for the treatment will be accounted for.&#xD;
