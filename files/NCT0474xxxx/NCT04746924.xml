    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) between Arm A&#xD;
      (ociperlimab in combination with tislelizumab) and Arm B (pembrolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      placebo) as assessed by investigators according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) and to compare overall survival (OS) between Arm A and Arm&#xD;
      B.&#xD;

    <measure>Health-related Quality Of Life (HRQoL): European Organization For Research And Treatment Of Cancer Quality Of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 7 days after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL will be assessed via patient-reported outcomes (PRO) using the EORTC QLQ-C30.&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3) uses for the questions 1 to 28 a 4-point scale. The scale scores from 1 to 4: 1 (&quot;Not at all&quot;), 2 (&quot;A little&quot;), 3 (&quot;Quite a bit&quot;) and 4 (&quot;Very much&quot;). Half points are not allowed. The range is 3. For the raw score, less points are considered to have a better outcome.&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3) uses for the questions 29 and 30 a 7-points scale. The scale scores from 1 to 7: 1 (&quot;very poor&quot;) to 7 (&quot;excellent&quot;). Half points are not allowed. The range is 6. First of all, raw score has to be calculated with mean values. Afterwards linear transformation is performed to be comparable. More points are considered to have a better outcome</description>

The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer 13 (EORTC QLQ-LC13) A score of 1-4 will be administrated for each item in QLQ-LC13. The higher scores will indicate the worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>HRQoL: The 5 Level EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 7 days after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL will be assessed via PRO using the EQ-5D-5L. EQ-5D-5L - Is the EuroQol 5D-5L a descriptive system that comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time To Deterioration (TDD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 7 days after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>TDD will be analyzed using the global health status of QLQ-C30 and will be defined as worsening scores for 2 consecutive assessments or 1 assessment followed by death from any cause.</description>
