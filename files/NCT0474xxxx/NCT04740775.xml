  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post market study is to evaluate the performance and safety of LiquiBand®&#xD;
      Exceed™ for closure of surgical incisions associated with abdominal surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LiquiBand® Exceed™ is the &quot;study&quot; device. The study device is an adhesive used to close&#xD;
      surgical wounds. When the adhesive is applied to the skin, it polymerizes (forms a chemical&#xD;
      bond) within minutes due to the moisture on the skin's surface and allows the wound edges to&#xD;
      remain in the correct position. The use of the study device is not &quot;investigational&quot;&#xD;
      (experimental) because it is already cleared for doctors to use for surgical wound closure in&#xD;
      the United States of America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, LiquiBand® Exceed™ will be used to close surgical wounds following general&#xD;
      abdominal surgery. Subjects will be followed up for 14-days post surgery, and safety and&#xD;
      performance of the study device will be evaluated.&#xD;

This will be modified to a 6-point scale with one point assigned to any of the following observed wound appearances: step-off borders, contour irregularities, margin separation, edge inversion, excessive distortion, and overall appearance of wound. A HWES of 0 will indicate an optimal wound appearamce, with each point between 1 and 6 indicating a less adequate appearance of the wound.</description>
