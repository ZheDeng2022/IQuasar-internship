  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) accounts for 70-90% of brain injuries, with 600 cases of&#xD;
      mTBI per 100 000 people in the united states, but only 100-300 mTBI patients per 100 000&#xD;
      people receive hospital-based care. Symptoms reported immediately after injury tend to&#xD;
      diminish over the following 10 days and are generally resolved by 3 months. However, in&#xD;
      15-25% of cases , problems persist, and may even worsen, at 3 months. Physical, emotional,&#xD;
      and behavioral factors can be affected. Physical disorders include pain and fatigue. Sleep&#xD;
      disorders are also common. Persistent symptoms can affect patient outcomes (affecting all&#xD;
      aspects of life) and increase public healthcare costs .In a previous study (NCT03811626,&#xD;
      Efficacy of Psychoeducation and Cognitive Rehabilitation After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury&#xD;
      for Preventing Post-concussional Syndrome in Individuals With High Risk of Poor Prognosis: A&#xD;
      Randomized Clinical Trial. The investigators were able to demonstrate that early&#xD;
      multidisciplinary management improved the outcome and prognosis of patients by statistically&#xD;
      significantly reducing the percentage of patients with Post traumatic syndrome distress at&#xD;
      six months (6% for the treated group versus 52% for the control group, p &lt; 0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems important to verify that if this short-term improvement (6 months after the trauma)&#xD;
      persists in the long term, and therefore at a distance from the end of the initially proposed&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;

      80 mTBI patients included in the previous study (NCT03811626) will be contacted by phone and&#xD;
      an assessment consisting of questionnaires (QOLIBRI, SF-36, Posttraumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      Checklist Scale (PCLS ) , ProQol) will be offered to them.&#xD;

    <description>quality of life questionnaire QOLIBRI (Quality of Life after Brain Injury). The QOLIBRI is a comprehensive questionnaire with 37 items covering six dimensions to assess health-related quality of life. Each items has to ba scaled from 1 (Not at all affected) to 5 (Very).The subscale scores can be used separately, or can be combined to give a profile of quality of life. All item responses can also be summed to give a total score.</description>

    <description>quality of life questionnaire SF-36 : The 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) is an oft-used, well-researched, self-reported measure of health. It stems from a study called the Medical Outcomes Study[1].&#xD;
It comprises 36 questions which cover eight domains of health. Scores for the different domains are converted and pooled using a scoring key, for a total score indicating a range of low to high quality of life</description>
