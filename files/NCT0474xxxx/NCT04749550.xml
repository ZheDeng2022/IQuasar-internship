  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2017, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) were the leading cause of death worldwide. Most&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by changing risk behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CVDs are distributed within a population along a socio-economic gradient. This is true within&#xD;
      a country, but also between countries with different income levels. People living in a&#xD;
      high-income country have better CVD health status than those living in a low-income country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that community-based primary prevention of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      can be effective. Other studies have shown that champions positively influence the&#xD;
      implementation of health promotion strategies at the community level. These champions are&#xD;
      people in the community who contribute to the implementation of new health programs by&#xD;
      involving their local networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPICES project (Scaling-up Packages of Intervention for Cardiovascular disease prevention&#xD;
      in selected sites in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa) is an international study that aims to&#xD;
      implement and evaluate a community-based cardiovascular disease prevention and control&#xD;
      program. It involves 5 low, middle and high income countries, including populations in urban,&#xD;
      semi-rural and rural areas. The study focused on four sets of interventions: health&#xD;
      promotion, cardiovascular risk profiling, management and self-management and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, the territory of Central West Brittany (CWB) was chosen to participate in the&#xD;
      SPICES project because of the vulnerability of its population to cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is in this context that a type 1 hybrid study is being set up in the CWB territory as part&#xD;
      of the SPICES project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the quantitative part of the protocol (NCT03886064), a randomized controlled trial took&#xD;
      place simultaneously to evaluate the effectiveness of a behavior change program led by&#xD;
      community champions. Resident volunteers were selected based on their non-laboratory&#xD;
      Interheart score. Those with a moderate risk were included in the trial. They were then&#xD;
      distributed at random to an intervention group and a control group. The control group&#xD;
      received minimal counseling. Those in the intervention group were brought together in support&#xD;
      groups, with follow-up by champions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a type 1 hybrid trial, qualitative data on implementation are gathered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative study will seek to better understand the profile of these champions. A&#xD;
      qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews and focus groups was used. The&#xD;
      objective is to explore the barriers and facilitators to their participation in support&#xD;
      groups for the primary prevention of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
