      A quasi-experimental non-randomized pre/post with control group trial of two models of cancer&#xD;
      survivorship care in early-stage colorectal and breast cancer survivors cared for in a&#xD;
      community-based, integrated health care setting. The trial will test the efficacy of an&#xD;
      embedded primary care provider (PCP) model (experimental condition) in which PCPs are&#xD;
      embedded within an oncology practice and will care for low-risk survivors who will be&#xD;
      transitioned at 6-12 months post-treatment for comprehensive survivorship care. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that a) patients in the PCP model will have superior receipt of recommended care&#xD;
      compared to usual care; b) patients in the PCP model will perceive significantly better care&#xD;
      coordination, self-efficacy, and confidence in their PCP compared to usual care; and c) use&#xD;
      of unplanned and non-recommended care will be less in the PCP model compared to usual care.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Embedded primary care providers (PCPs) will provide comprehensive care for survivors, including cancer surveillance services, preventive care, and management of long-term therapy and associated side effects (e.g., endocrine therapy in breast survivors). A comprehensive multilevel approach will prepare survivors and PCPs (physicians and/or advance practice providers). Eligible patients in the embedded PCP model will be provided with tailored education regarding the planned transition and, after cessation of active treatment, printed information on the planned course of care, expectations for embedded PCP care, transition timing, and reassurance that the oncology team will be available via telephone and email, and that PCPs will refer back to the oncologist for any concerning signs or symptoms. Tailored alerts will also be added to the electronic medical record (EMR) for recommended cancer surveillance and preventive care services that will fire for visits with embedded PCPs.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Item Set is a set of supplemental questions that can be added to the adult and child versions of the CAHPS Clinician &amp; Group Survey (CG-CAHPS) to gather more information on patient experience with the domains of primary care that define a medical home. However, use of this item set is not limited to practices that explicitly function as medical homes. Any primary care practice that is interested in a more comprehensive assessment of their patients' experiences may add the PCMH items to the survey (6 questions; response options: 3-item, 4-item or 6-item Likert scale).</description>
