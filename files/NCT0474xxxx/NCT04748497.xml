      The primary objective of the study: improvement of sportive performances by quantification&#xD;
      and performances monitoring of paralympic athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quantification and performances monitoring of mechanical performances during the filed&#xD;
           tests, the laboratory analysis and the sportive competitions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quantification and performances monitoring of physiological performances during the&#xD;
           filed tests, the laboratory analysis and the sportive competitions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quantification and risk monitoring of discipline-relative musculo-squeletic troubles,&#xD;
           caused by training or using of sportive equipment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quantification and mechanical monitoring by the made-to-measure or usual sportive&#xD;
           material.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sportive performance results from a range of determinations such as: physiological,&#xD;
      biomechanical, morphological, psychological, social and environmental factors. The&#xD;
      interactions between athletes, equipment, training and environment influences the development&#xD;
      of athletes' performance. In the context of the coming Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, the&#xD;
      performance construction for the exploration, the quantification and the management of all&#xD;
      factors is an commun objective between sportive team, medical team and researchers.&#xD;
