  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature births are a challenging process for parents in many ways. Especially after the&#xD;
      treatment and care in the hospital, they are concerned about whether they will be able to&#xD;
      provide adequate care for their baby at home. The aim of this study is to examine the effect&#xD;
      of the guide and telephone support given to mothers whose premature infants were discharged&#xD;
      from the neonatal intensive care unit on the perceived maternal self-efficacy and state&#xD;
      anxiety levels.&#xD;

      The study was planned as a randomized controlled trial with a single blind, pretest-posttest&#xD;
      design. This study will be conducted between February 2021 and March 2022 with premature&#xD;
      infants mothers. The sample of the study will be mothers (n = 102) of premature infants&#xD;
      discharged from Antalya Training and Research Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. 51&#xD;
      mothers participating in the study will be given a premature infant home care guide after the&#xD;
      discharge routine procedures are completed. In addition, mothers will be given an appointment&#xD;
      for a phone call a week later. No intervention will be applied to the other 51 mothers after&#xD;
      their discharge routine. Data will be collected by Mother-Infant Descriptive Information&#xD;
      Form, Perceived Maternity Self-Efficacy Scale (PMSES), State Anxiety Inventory (SAI). Data&#xD;
      will be collected with forms and scales immediately after discharge (pre-test) and in the 4th&#xD;
      week after discharge (post-test). Ethics Committee and Institutional Permission was obtained&#xD;
      for the study. In addition, written consent will be obtained from the participants.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be done using SPSS 23.0 and significance will be evaluated at p&#xD;
      &lt;0.05. Support will be received in the analysis phase of the Statistical Information Unit of&#xD;
      Akdeniz University. It is predicted that the new information obtained from the research data&#xD;
      will guide the education of premature infant mothers and new researches.&#xD;
