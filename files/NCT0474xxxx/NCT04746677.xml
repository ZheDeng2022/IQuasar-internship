  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      physician-modified endovascular grafts (PMEGs) for endovascular repair of complex aortic&#xD;
      pathology in high-risk patients. The study is divided into three study arms based on the&#xD;
      subject's aortic pathology: (1) Complex abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA); (2) Thoracoabdominal&#xD;
      aortic aneurysm; and (3) Aortic dissection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complex aortic pathology, comprised of aneurysmal disease and aortic dissection involving the&#xD;
      visceral aortic segment, presents a technical challenge for repair due to involvement of the&#xD;
      renal and/or mesenteric arteries. Traditionally, the gold standard for repair has been open&#xD;
      repair. However, open repair of these diseases is associated with high perioperative&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Therefore, for patients with significant medical comorbidities or&#xD;
      complex surgical/anatomical features, the risk of open surgery may be prohibitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As endovascular techniques have become increasingly advanced, options for the endovascular&#xD;
      treatment of complex aortic pathology involving the visceral segment have been developed. The&#xD;
      predominant approach is fenestrated or branched endovascular aortic repair (F/B-EVAR) with&#xD;
      fenestrated or branched endovascular grafts. Currently, there is only one device FDA-approved&#xD;
      for commercial use in the United States, the Zenith Fenestrated AAA Endovascular Graft (Cook&#xD;
      Medical, Bloomington, IN). However, its use is limited by the design specifications of the&#xD;
      device and the required manufacturing time in patients requiring more urgent repair.&#xD;
      Therefore, many patients with complex aortic pathology are not eligible for repair with this&#xD;
      device, and there are currently no other FDA-approved options for definitive repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One option for definitive repair of complex aortic pathology in patients ineligible for the&#xD;
      Zenith fenestrated device is endovascular repair with a physician-modified endovascular graft&#xD;
      (PMEG). For this procedure, the operating surgeon modifies an FDA-approved endovascular graft&#xD;
      to incorporate fenestrations or branches based on the patient's anatomy. Numerous reports&#xD;
      have been published demonstrating that this procedure can be performed with high technical&#xD;
      success, and acceptable perioperative and mid-term results in high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate safety and effectiveness of PMEGs for the&#xD;
      endovascular repair of complex aortic pathology in high-risk patients. The safety outcomes&#xD;
      include perioperative mortality (defined as death &lt;30 days postoperative or during the index&#xD;
      hospitalization) and major adverse events, along with mortality and adverse events during&#xD;
      follow-up. Effectiveness outcomes include initial technical success, endoleak rate, target&#xD;
      vessel patency, and rate of reintervention. Patients will be followed for five years.&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated preoperatively, at the time of the procedure, at the time of&#xD;
      discharge from the index hospitalization, 1-month post-procedure, 6-months post-procedure,&#xD;
      and 1-year post-procedure, and annually for five-years.&#xD;
