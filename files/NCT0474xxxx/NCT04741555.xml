  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open heart surgeries are one of the major and complicated surgeries performed frequently in&#xD;
      the world due to the prolongation of life expectancy and developments in medicine. As a&#xD;
      result of these operations, not only the heart and vessels, but also all organs and systems&#xD;
      depending on the systemic circulation are affected. Some biological inflammation markers have&#xD;
      been determinant in determining cardiovascular risk. High neutrophil count was associated&#xD;
      with increased mortality, while low lymphocyte count was a strong constant predictor of&#xD;
      mortality. In addition, increased serum uric acid (UA) levels have been found to be&#xD;
      associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, which is associated with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of patients&#xD;
      who underwent coronary bypass surgery under elective conditions in Karadeniz Technical&#xD;
      University Faculty of Medicine between 2008-2020 on in-hospital and 1-year mortality based on&#xD;
      preoperative neutrophil / lymphocyte ratios and uric acid values.&#xD;

      Open heart surgeries are one of the major and complicated surgeries performed frequently in&#xD;
      the world due to the prolongation of life expectancy and developments in medicine. Mortality&#xD;
      rates are decreasing day by day, although more and more additional diseases are present and&#xD;
      older patients are taken in open heart surgery. The aim of these surgeries is to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of death by correcting existing cardiac pathologies and increasing the quality of life&#xD;
      of patients. For this reason, some studies have developed cardiac risk scoring methods in&#xD;
      preoperative evaluation in order to predict mortality before surgery, and created a risky&#xD;
      group such as advanced age, female gender, decreased left ventricular functions, those who&#xD;
      use postoperative intraaortic balloon pumps, and those who receive inotrope support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some biological inflammation markers have been determinant in determining cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk. High neutrophil count was associated with increased mortality, while low lymphocyte&#xD;
      count was a strong constant predictor of mortality. Cardiovascular bypass itself is related&#xD;
      to neutrophil activation, highlighting the effects of its high preoperative levels. Increased&#xD;
      neutrophil counts are related to blood viscosity and hypercoagulability. Also, decreased&#xD;
      lymphocyte count indicates increased physiological stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of serum uric acid levels has been stated in many epidemiological studies as a&#xD;
      risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Increased serum uric acid (UA) levels are associated&#xD;
      with obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, which is associated with a risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. In another study, it was shown that the risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality and increased serum UA levels were independently and significantly related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to examine the short-term (first 30 days) and long-term (1 year)&#xD;
      mortality of patients who underwent elective coronary bypass surgery between 2008 and 2020 at&#xD;
      the Karadeniz Technical University Faculty of Medicine, based on preoperative neutrophil /&#xD;
      lymphocyte ratios and uric acid values. effects will be investigated&#xD;
