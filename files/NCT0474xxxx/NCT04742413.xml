      A 12-Month Observational Prospective Multicentre Cohort Study based on existing and newly&#xD;
      collected data of schizophrenia patients followed-up for one year in secondary care settings&#xD;
      (psychiatric services). Schizophrenia patients will be enrolled in a consecutive manner over&#xD;
      a period of 6 month into two cohorts according to their prescribing switching treatment: to&#xD;
      lurasidone (cohort A) and to another SGA (cohort B).&#xD;

      Study design A 12-Month observational prospective multicentre cohort study based on existing&#xD;
      and newly collected data of schizophrenia patients followed-up for one year in secondary care&#xD;
      settings (psychiatric services).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected by the specialist when required to switch the SGA therapy for&#xD;
      schizophrenia (index data). Schizophrenia patients will be enrolled in a consecutive manner&#xD;
      over a period of 6 month into two cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: patients who are prescribed to switch to lurasidone (lurasidone cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B: patients who are prescribed to switch to any other monotherapy SGA (other SGA&#xD;
           cohort) The decision to switch the SGA treatment and prescribe the new treatment is done&#xD;
           previously and independent from the decision to enter the patient into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 0 will be performed when the investigator consider necessary to perform the treatment&#xD;
      switch and patients give their informed consent to participate in the study. All patients&#xD;
      will sign the Informed consent before starting the data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study will be 12 months of follow-up after switching (visit 0): month 1&#xD;
      (visit 1), month 3 (visit 2), month 6 (visit 3) and month 12 (visit 4). Moreover, the&#xD;
      clinical data of the patients recorded previous the index data will be collected in order to&#xD;
      ensure that these patients were on an SGA monotherapy for a minimum of 3 months before&#xD;
      switching to maximize potential weight gain and dysmetabolic problems that occurs early&#xD;
      during the treatment. Preferably, patients have to be on treatment for a year or more before&#xD;
      switching so that they have reached a weight plateau.&#xD;
