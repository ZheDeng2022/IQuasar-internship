    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness (assessed by clinical evaluation&#xD;
      of eczema/atopic dermatitis severity and parent-perceived benefits) and tolerability&#xD;
      (assessed by clinical grading and parent-perception) of the investigational cream when used&#xD;
      in conjunction with a baby wash in babies, toddlers, and children with mild to moderate&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) After 4 Weeks of Product Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>EASI is a composite scoring system index which is used to measure the severity of 4 clinical manifestations of atopic dermatitis (erythema, edema/induration/papulation, excoriations, and lichenification) according to the percentage of affected area in each of the 4 body regions (head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). Final scores range from 0 (no disease anywhere on the body) to 72 (severest disease on all body areas).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) After 4 Weeks of Product Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>ADSI is a scoring system that reflects the severity of a target eczema lesion. The ADSI score is a sum of scores for 5 different parameters - erythema, itching, exudation, excoriation, lichenification - which are each measured on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The total score can range from 0 (no eczema signs) to 15 (severe eczema lesion).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Skin Microbiome</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, 3, 7 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in skin microbiome in lesion versus adjacent non-lesional site will be assessed. Microbiome samples collected from the identified lesional site and an adjacent non-lesional site by swabbing technique will be analyzed by using 16s ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Caregiver Itch Assessment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, 3, 7 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Parent participant will assess how much itching/scratching the child participant has been exhibiting on a scale of 1 (none) to 4 (all the time). An option of &quot;I don't have an opinion&quot; will be included.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Infant Dermatitis Quality of Life Index (IDQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, 3, 7 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>IDQoL is a validated questionnaire completed by parents to assess the impact of atopic dermatitis on the quality of life in infants aged 0-3 years. The Infant's Dermatitis Quality of Life Index is calculated by summing the score of each question: for question 1 (0 [none] to 3 [all the time]), For question 2 (0 [happy] to 3 [always crying]), For question 3 (0 [0-15 minutes to 3 [More than 2 hours]), For question 4 (0 [less than one hour] to 3 [Five hours or more]), and For questions 5 to 10 (0 [None] to 3 [Very much]), resulting in a maximum score of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. The severity of eczema is scored separately and can be correlated with the Infants' Dermatitis Quality of Life Index. The score of Dermatitis severity ranges from 0 (None) to 4 (Extremely severe).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire-Revised (BISQ-R) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, 3, 7 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>BISQ-R is an age-based, norm-referenced scoring system that provides a comprehensive assessment of infant and toddler sleep patterns. Five (5) items related to sleep onset latency, number, and duration of night wakings, longest stretch of sleep and total night sleep. Parent perception consists of 3 items related to bedtime difficulty, overnight sleep, and overall child sleep problems. Parent behaviors consisting of 11 items related to bedtime routine consistency, bedtime, parental behavior at time of sleep onset and night wakings, sleep locations at time of sleep onset and following night wakings that may impact sleep outcomes. Score ranging from 0-100 is derived for each sub-scale, with higher scores denoting better sleep quality, more positive perceptions of sleep quality, and parental habits that promote healthy sleep behaviors and independent infant sleep, respectively. Total score is calculated as an average of infant sleep, parent perceptions and parent behavior subscale scores.</description>
