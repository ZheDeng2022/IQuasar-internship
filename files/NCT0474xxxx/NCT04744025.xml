  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine if using a microfluidics chamber, a device used to&#xD;
      process sperm, will be effective in improving the rates of embryos with normal chromosomes&#xD;
      (structures that carry genetic information) during in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that this device is effective at improving rates of normal&#xD;
      chromosomes among embryos.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process, eggs are removed from the ovaries and&#xD;
      are inseminated (mixed) or injected with sperm. In order for fertilization to occur, the&#xD;
      sperm cells must be separated from the semen before introducing them to the eggs. Currently,&#xD;
      sperm are isolated from the semen using a series of wash steps in a centrifuge (device to&#xD;
      spin and concentrate the sperm). This requires processing at high speeds in order to separate&#xD;
      motile sperm from the other parts of the semen. Although it is common practice, it is&#xD;
      possible that this method of processing the semen may cause damage to the sperm cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively, a microfluidics chamber can be used to choose the best sperm. A microfluidics&#xD;
      chamber is a small device in which the unwashed sperm can be placed at one end. Sperm that&#xD;
      are moving forward will swim through the chamber and come out the other end. Dead sperm are&#xD;
      left behind and the sperm with the best motility (how normally they move forward) and normal&#xD;
      morphology (how the sperm looks) will make it to the other end of the chamber. These sperm&#xD;
      can then be chosen for injection into the egg. This device is FDA-approved for this purpose&#xD;
      and is commercially available and is currently routinely used in the IVF lab utilized by the&#xD;
      investigators as well as most labs in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some small initial studies showed that a higher number of embryos with higher quality were&#xD;
      made with sperm selected from a microfluidics chamber. In another recent study, the chances&#xD;
      of creating an embryo with a normal number of chromosomes (structures that carry genetic&#xD;
      information) was also slightly higher if a microfluidics chamber was used to process the&#xD;
      sperm. This might be because sperm that have the highest motility and normal morphology may&#xD;
      also be more likely to be genetically normal. However, there are no good-quality studies&#xD;
      looking at the rates of embryos with normal chromosomes created from using a microfluidics&#xD;
      chamber to process sperm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether using a microfluidics chamber to&#xD;
      process sperm for injection into eggs increases the rates of embryos with normal chromosomes.&#xD;
      At the time of egg retrieval, participants will have their eggs randomized (like the flip of&#xD;
      a coin) into two groups. Half of the eggs will be injected with sperm processed using&#xD;
      gradient centrifugation, the standard method. The other half of the eggs will be injected&#xD;
      with sperm processed using a microfluidics chamber. The goal is to determine the rate of&#xD;
      embryos with normal chromosomes in each group. Other goals include looking at how many&#xD;
      embryos develop to good quality blastocysts and are biopsied and how many patients get&#xD;
      pregnant after embryo transfer.&#xD;
