  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Faecal incontinence (FI) is the involuntary loss of flatus, liquid or solid stool per rectum.&#xD;
      Owing to the emotional stress and the psychosocial stigma surrounding this problem, it is&#xD;
      under-reported by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative management of FI involves lifestyle, medical adjustments and pelvic floor&#xD;
      sphincter training. If conservative treatment fails, surgical options such as sphincter&#xD;
      repair, sacral nerve stimulation (SNM) and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) can&#xD;
      be reformed. SNM and PTNS involve application of nervous electrical stimulation&#xD;
      (neuromodulation) with significant improvement of symptoms. The positions of electrical&#xD;
      stimuli are also very similar to acupuncture sites (acupoints) used in Traditional Chinese&#xD;
      Medicine for the treatment of faecal incontinence. However, disadvantage of these methods&#xD;
      are; 1) they are invasive and may cause complications such as pain, infection and bleeding&#xD;
      and; 2) the devices for each SNM device can be costly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is non-invasive, which is commonly used&#xD;
      for the management of pain. It works via the application of electrical stimuli using adhesive&#xD;
      gel pads. They are cheap to run and are widely accepted by patients. Hence application of&#xD;
      TENS over acupoints (Acu-TENS) may provide a novel non-invasive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled trial will be carried out on patients with FI. Demographic data, past&#xD;
      medical history, in particular any structural or neurological causes of FI, will be recorded.&#xD;
      Ano-rectal manometry and endoanal ultrasound will be performed before and after treatment.&#xD;
      Acu-TENS machine will be applied to standardised acupuncture points. Assessment of FI via&#xD;
      Cleveland Clinic Florida Faecal Incontinence Score and Quality of life measurements via the&#xD;
      validated questionnaires Short Form 36 (SF-36) and the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life&#xD;
      Scale (FIQL) (Chinese version) questionnaires will be carried out at baseline, and followup&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
