  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to help researchers learn more about and successfully diagnose&#xD;
      cancer using blood samples and tissue samples from surgeries in patients with suspicious&#xD;
      thyroid nodules or thyroid cancer. Diagnosing cancer in this way, as opposed to biopsies, may&#xD;
      be less invasive to the patient. Analyzing blood and tissues samples may also help&#xD;
      researchers to differentiate non-cancerous tumors from thyroid cancer and detect high-risk&#xD;
      mutations to guide treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Sensitivity and specificity of molecular profile of thyroid derived extracellular vesicles&#xD;
      (EVs) as predictor of thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Quantity of thyroid derived EVs captured in various stages of thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Whether quantity of EVs decreases in proportion to response to therapy in thyroid cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Optimal ribonucleic acid (RNA)/deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) panel in thyroid tumor&#xD;
      derived EVs to diagnose thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of blood samples on the day of surgery following anesthesia but&#xD;
      prior to incision and approximately 4-6 weeks after surgery. Patients who undergo remnant&#xD;
      ablation after total thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine have an additional blood sample&#xD;
      collected. Patients also undergo collection of tissue samples following surgical resection of&#xD;
      the thyroid. Patients' medical records are also reviewed.&#xD;
