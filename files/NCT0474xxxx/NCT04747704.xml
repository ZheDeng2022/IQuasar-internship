  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of an acceptance-based, insight-oriented treatment approach for US incarcerated&#xD;
      adults. Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed through attendance and retention&#xD;
      throughout the intervention period. Primary outcomes include negative affect, psychological&#xD;
      flexibility, emotion regulation, purpose in life, impulsivity, and trauma. Changes will be&#xD;
      assessed from baseline to post-course, post-course to 6-month follow up, and baseline to&#xD;
      6-month follow up for all primary outcomes. Researchers hypothesize that, 1) retention rates&#xD;
      will be similar to previous trials with 70% retention from pre- to post-course; 2) there will&#xD;
      be significant baseline-to-post-course reductions in psychological symptoms, impulsivity, and&#xD;
      trauma, and an increase in psychological flexibility, purpose in life, and emotion&#xD;
      regulation; and 3) there will be significant baseline-to-6-month reductions in psychological&#xD;
      symptoms, impulsivity, and trauma, and an increase in psychological flexibility, purpose in&#xD;
      life, and emotion regulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevailing correctional counseling methods (e.g., cognitive-behavior therapy, social&#xD;
      learning) often operate from an &quot;outside-in&quot; paradigm attempting to put mental health &quot;into&quot;&#xD;
      people in prison using various strategies and techniques. Three Principles Correctional&#xD;
      Counseling (3PCC), informed by theosophy of Sydney Banks, with a subsequent intervention&#xD;
      based on Banks's work, is grounded in a different paradigm-in which all individuals,&#xD;
      including incarcerated, have innate positive mental health; however, their belief systems&#xD;
      convince them otherwise. When incarcerated individuals learn to navigate daily challenges&#xD;
      with mental clarity, affective states shift from negative to positive, allowing for&#xD;
      state-dependent positive recall, leading to lower likelihood of responding to negative&#xD;
      thoughts and feelings with deviant and other health-damaging behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies suggest 3PCC leads to improvements in negative affect such as depression, anxiety,&#xD;
      and rumination, and increases in positive outcomes including mindfulness, mental health,&#xD;
      social well-being, emotional regulation and non-attachment in non-correctional samples,&#xD;
      reductions in stress and anxiety for HIV-positive patients; improvements in substance use&#xD;
      problems, criminal justice involvement, employment, housing, and psychological wellbeing for&#xD;
      women in in-patient substance abuse treatment; improved resilience in high-risk children and&#xD;
      adolescents, improved mental health and resilience in young trauma-exposed sex offenders,&#xD;
      improvements in thought recognition, mindfulness, and psychological well-being in a&#xD;
      correctional sample, and improved in mental well-being, purpose in life, anxiety and anger,&#xD;
      and behavior in a UK prison. 3PCC has also shown feasibility and acceptability in refugee&#xD;
      women with trauma, and demonstrated feasible retention rates of 76% in an English prison&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current trial is designed to further assess efficacy of 3PCC in incarcerated individuals.&#xD;
      3PCC classes will be facilitated by practitioners with several years of experience working&#xD;
      with diverse client populations. Each 3PCC class will meet weekly for 10 consecutive weeks,&#xD;
      with each session approximately 3 hours long. Classes will include the following modules:&#xD;
      Building Rapport, Exploration of &quot;Reality&quot;; Separate Realities; Exploration of Thought and&#xD;
      Insight; Consciousness-Where Does it Come From?; Exploring Feelings/Moods/Behavior; Exploring&#xD;
      Innate Health/Natural Intelligence; What is Mind?; Exploring Infinite Potential; Exploring&#xD;
      Mental Clarity Versus a Busy Mind; Stepping into the Unknown, Implications of the Principles&#xD;
      for Life in Prison; and Living Outside of Prison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Compared with the control group, participants in the 3PCC condition will&#xD;
      demonstrate significant increases in psychological flexibility, quality of life, clear mind,&#xD;
      emotional regulation, impulse control and purpose in life at post-course, which will be&#xD;
      maintained at 3- and 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Compared with the control group, participants exposed to 3PCC will show&#xD;
      significant decreases in depression, anxiety, anger, and trauma symptoms at post-course,&#xD;
      which will be maintained at 3- and 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Compared with the control group, participants exposed to 3PCC will show greater&#xD;
      improvement in behavior within the prison community at post-course, which will be maintained&#xD;
      at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Behavior will be measured by prison records measuring&#xD;
      participants' behavioral violations and rewards for prosocial behavior.&#xD;

    <description>A 10-week insight-based program offered in prisons in a group setting for 2 hours each week. Approximately 15 - 20 adults or youth in custody participate at a time, led by two trained teachers. The curriculum is designed to teach an understanding of the mind and human experience for the purpose of reducing risk factors, uncovering resiliency and to promote emotional and psychological well-being for adults and youth in the criminal justice system. This is taught through a compilation of sessions that speak to the potential, ability and resilience inherent in every individual. Sessions include a mix of lessons, experiential learning, and group conversations.</description>
