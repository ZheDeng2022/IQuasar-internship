      In our society the population consists of more elderly patients. Medical treatment needs to&#xD;
      be adjusted to this patient group. This research project focusses on patients with a&#xD;
      fragility fracture of the pelvis. This results from a minor trauma and can cause a long&#xD;
      immobilization period because of severe pain. For FFP type II b and II c there is no&#xD;
      consensus on the best treatment option. Either a surgical minimal invasive sacroiliac&#xD;
      osteosynthesis or conservative treatment is a possibility. Of course, both treatment options&#xD;
      have pros and cons. This research project will randomize all patients with a FFP IIb or IIc&#xD;
      fracture in either surgical or conservative treatment. These treatments will be evaluated at&#xD;
      the follow-ups, 4 weeks, 4 months and 1 year after trauma. This will be evaluated with the&#xD;
      DEMMI, Accelerometer, EQ-5D (EuroQol Quality of Live Questionnaire), radiological results,&#xD;
      range of motion, pain-levels and reporting any postoperative complications or adverse events.&#xD;
      Patient will be included over a period of 18 months and will be followed for at least a year.&#xD;
      This research project aim to answer the question which treatment option for FFP type IIb and&#xD;
      IIc is the most adequate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background. Fragility fractures of the pelvis are increasing in incidence. These are&#xD;
      osteoporotic fractures, who result from a minor trauma. Typically, the weak osteoporotic bone&#xD;
      is fractured, an the ligaments remain intact resulting in an undisplaced or minimally&#xD;
      displaced pelvic ring. Fragility fractures of the pelvis can be divided in type I, II, III&#xD;
      and IV. For type I the treatment method of choice is conservative. For type III and IV a&#xD;
      surgical treatment is necessary. Only the ideal treatment for type II remains unclear. There&#xD;
      is no consensus in whether conservative treatment or surgical treatment will have the best&#xD;
      outcomes. Surgical treatment mostly means a minimal invasive osteosynthesis. In our hospital&#xD;
      we use percutaneous sacroiliac screw fixation with augmentation. The screws used are&#xD;
      perforated and fenestrated, allowing for a correct placement an cement augmentation.&#xD;
      Preferably, this procedure is performed in our hybrid operation theatre. An intraoperative&#xD;
      CT-scan can be performed. This treatment method has proven to be a safe method in literature.&#xD;
      On the other hand, surgical treatment, can have complications and risks, especially in the&#xD;
      elderly. Conservative treatment consist of mobilisation and physiotherapy. But conservative&#xD;
      treatment can be limited because of uncontrolled pain, resulting in a long immobilisation&#xD;
      period. Immobilisation in the elderly leads to several complications. This research project&#xD;
      will focus on early operative intervention to reduce the immobilisation period and its&#xD;
      negative consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. Recruitment of patients will find place in our emergency department and our&#xD;
      outpatient clinic. A lot of patients with a FFP type IIb and IIc present themselves at our&#xD;
      emergency department due to immobilising pain. All the elderly patient who complain about&#xD;
      sacroiliac pain will receive an CT-scan. Literature showed that an conventional x-ray is not&#xD;
      sufficient to detect sacroiliac fractures. On the other hand a lot of patient are referred to&#xD;
      our outpatient clinic by other hospitals in our region or even general practioners. All these&#xD;
      patients, who meet our inclusion criteria, will be asked for informed consent. After informed&#xD;
      consent has been collected, patients will be randomised to on of the groups. The first group&#xD;
      will receive surgical treatment and the second group will receive conservative treatment.&#xD;
      Randomisation is performed with a vending machine. Depending on which soda can comes out,&#xD;
      patients are assigned to the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention. As stated before the are two groups in this research project. Both&#xD;
      treatment are standard treatments. Both groups will receive a standard set of&#xD;
      co-interventions, such as adequate analgesics and intensive physiotherapy. At our hospital a&#xD;
      geriatric trauma centre is established. After discharge or 4 weeks after trauma a first&#xD;
      follow-up is planned. This is primary for the treatment evaluation. Then after 4 months are&#xD;
      second follow-up is planned with a traumatologist, physiotherapist and a geriatric&#xD;
      specialist. At this follow-up several benchmark test are performed, such as the DEMMI, EQ 5D&#xD;
      and an accelerometer is explained and given out. Especially this accelerometer will tell us&#xD;
      more about the amount of mobilisation or immobilisation at home. The last follow-up will be 1&#xD;
      year after trauma. At all follow-ups radiological controls are performed. These will be&#xD;
      conventional x-rays. Only in specific cases, for example prolonged pain, an CT-scan will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and data management. The sample size was based on the expected difference between&#xD;
      treatment groups in improvement on the DEMMI score between baseline and 4 months follow-up.&#xD;
      Previous studies show that the minimal clinical important difference of the DEMMI score is 10&#xD;
      points. This results in a sample size of 68 patients, accounted for 10% loss to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical planned analyses are primary a pearson chi-squared or fishers exact test for&#xD;
      categorical variables or a students t or mann-whitney test. However the primary outcome will&#xD;
      be analysed using mixed linear models with random effects. The models will be compared usin&#xD;
      Akaike information criterium. Missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation. All&#xD;
      analyses will be performed using SPSS version 19 or higher. A p value &lt;0.05 is regarded as&#xD;
      being statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is stored on the protected server systems of Hospital of Lucerne. Files containing&#xD;
      anonymous data can also be stored on the personal computers of the investigators. Data is&#xD;
      recorded on paper and digitally. Questionnaires are on paper, but all the measurements, as&#xD;
      the DEMMI score of range of motion will be digitally. Participants can not be identified in&#xD;
      the CRF (Case report form). Appropriate corresponding codes are only known and accessible for&#xD;
      the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon simple request by the patient, he or she will immediately be withdrawn from the study&#xD;
      and no further date will be recorded in the study. It is guaranteed that further treatment&#xD;
      will be equal to standard care.&#xD;
