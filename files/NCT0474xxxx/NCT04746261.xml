  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study of ASSIP as a treatment for patients who have recently made a&#xD;
      suicide attempt. Six psychiatric clinics from four regions in Sweden are included. Together&#xD;
      460 patients will be recruited. Patients will be randomized to ASSIP as a supplement to&#xD;
      treatment as usual or to treatment as usual only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the study is to evaluate whether ASSIP, a short-term clinical&#xD;
      intervention, can prevent future suicidal behavior in people who have attempted suicide&#xD;
      better than just conventional treatment. The project also investigates whether there are any&#xD;
      specific factors that may be related to ASSIP's potential effectiveness and whether ASSIP has&#xD;
      health economic benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients who give their written consent will be included in the study. Those who meet&#xD;
      the inclusion and no exclusion criteria at screening / visit 1 undergo an assessment&#xD;
      according to an interview protocol, self-assessment form, and self-assessment scales.&#xD;
      Thereafter, the patient is randomized via an electronic system to either ASSIP plus standard&#xD;
      treatment or only standard treatment. All patients, regardless of which treatment they are&#xD;
      randomized to, will be followed up for two years with a telephone interview and&#xD;
      self-assessment scales month 3, 12 and 24. Data from medical records and registers will also&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;

      Purpose and aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of this project is to evaluate ASSIP for the prevention of future&#xD;
      suicidal behavior in persons who attempt suicide. The specific goals are a) to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Program (ASSIP) in reducing new suicide&#xD;
      attempts in Swedish healthcare, b) to identify factors associated with the effectiveness of&#xD;
      ASSIP, c) to construct a cost-effectiveness model of ASSIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a consensus position paper from the evidence-based national suicide prevention&#xD;
      task force in Europe, health care approaches with high evidence include treatment of&#xD;
      depression and ensuring chain of care. These strategies are in line with Swedish guidelines.&#xD;
      However, several recent international studies suggest that interventions specifically&#xD;
      targeted to prevent suicide attempts may be more successful and that brief psychological&#xD;
      interventions are of interest . One promising brief psychotherapeutic intervention to prevent&#xD;
      new suicide attempts in suicide attempters is ASSIP . An RCT from Switzerland that included&#xD;
      120 patients showed an 80% risk reduction for new suicide attempt within two years, when&#xD;
      ASSIP was added on to treatment as usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an evaluator-blinded, multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT). The patients&#xD;
      will be examined with a structured interview and self-rating scales at baseline (first&#xD;
      visit), and structured telephone interviews, self-rating scales and medical record screening&#xD;
      at 3 months, 12 months and 24 months follow up. Completed suicides will be detected through&#xD;
      the Cause of Death Register. The study will also collect information from the National Board&#xD;
      of Health and Welfare (NBHW), National Prescribed Drugs Register (NPDR), Longitudinal&#xD;
      integrated database for health insurance and labour market studies (LISA) and the Swedish&#xD;
      Social Insurance Agency (Försäkringskassan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: After the first visit, the patients will be randomized to ASSIP+ TAU or TAU&#xD;
      only, using stratified randomization according to clinical site. The randomization will be&#xD;
      performed through REDCAP, a web-based application for electronic data collection in research&#xD;
      studies. Expected site differences: To map the variation of TAU with site, age, gender, ICD&#xD;
      diagnoses and previous suicide attempts, health care contacts and treatments a TAU check list&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;

First session: Videotaped narrative interview focusing on the background to the suicidal crisis.&#xD;
Second session: Video playback. The patient and the therapist watch the recorded interview together, stopping the film regularly to add information. The patient is given a psychoeducational text to read and comment on as homework.&#xD;
Third session: Compilation of a written case formulation of the individual's vulnerability and triggering events that preceded the suicidal crisis. Individual preventive measures are developed by the patient and the therapist together and written down in a document that the patient keeps and which is attached to the patient's medical record.&#xD;
Fourth session (optional): Mini-exposure.&#xD;
Standardized letters: The therapist contacts the patient by letter during two years, every three months the first year and every six months the second year.&#xD;
Treatment as usual: As described bellow</description>

    <description>Treatment as usual will be multidisciplinary and combine psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and other treatments as well as referral to specialist psychiatry or primary care as required. At the first visit, a specialist or resident in psychiatry will assess the suicide risk as high, medium or high, based on the information from the referring psychiatrist, the standardized interview, the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) scales and the medical record. Based on the suicide risk assessment the follow up treatment will be divided into different levels.</description>
