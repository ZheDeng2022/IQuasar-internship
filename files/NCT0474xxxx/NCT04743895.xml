  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is prospective, randomized, single-blinded, single-center for adult patients&#xD;
      undergoing sternotomy closure after cardiac surgery. The clinical, patient-reported, and&#xD;
      imaging outcomes will be measured comparing standard stainless steel wire (SSW) cerclage&#xD;
      versus the FiberTape cerclage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the progression of sternal healing in&#xD;
      subjects that underwent midline sternal closure with FiberTape cerclage compared to subjects&#xD;
      that underwent midline sternal closure with stainless steel wire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the complication rate and postoperative pain of&#xD;
      subjects that underwent midline sternal closure with FiberTape cerclage compared to subjects&#xD;
      that underwent midline sternal closure with stainless steel wire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scans are performed at three months postoperatively to assess sternal healing. Two&#xD;
      radiologists will read all CT scans. Axial slices are analyzed at five locations along the&#xD;
      sternum (manubrium, top of the aortic arch, aortopulmonary window, main pulmonary arteries,&#xD;
      and aortic root) using a 6-point quantitative scale (0=no sign of healing, 1=minimal healing,&#xD;
      2=mild healing, 3=moderate healing, 4=partial synthesis, 5=complete synthesis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events related to the sternal closure procedure or the devices used for closure&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain scores will be collected using a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) with a&#xD;
      numeric rating of 0 to 10. Sternal pain will be rated at rest, coughing, and with movement.&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesic use for sternal closure pain will be evaluated.The Veterans Rand&#xD;
      (VR-12) health survey will be collected postoperatively (see schedule of events for details).&#xD;

    <description>Patient reported physical and mental health survey. Answers are summarized into 2 scores, a physical component score (PCS) and a mental component score (MCS). The scores may be reported as Z-scores (difference compared to the population average, measured in standard deviations). The United States population average PCS and MCS are both 50 points. The United States population standard deviation is 10 points. Therefore, each increment of 10 points above or below 50 corresponds to one standard deviation away from the population average.</description>
