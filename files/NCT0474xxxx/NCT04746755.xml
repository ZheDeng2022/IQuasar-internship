    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, single-centre, parallel-group clinical investigation, to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and in-use tolerability of a range of four orthotic insoles on target areas of&#xD;
      pain in the lower body, associated with musculoskeletal stress, experienced by those who&#xD;
      spend most of their working day on their feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation design included two periods; 'run-in' period and 'treatment' period. The&#xD;
      treatment period comprised of two sub-periods; a 'breaking-in' period and the 'full use'&#xD;
      period. The breaking-in period was intended to allow time for the subjects' feet to accustom&#xD;
      to wearing the insoles. The full-use period was used to determine effectiveness of the&#xD;
      insoles. These periods constitute lengths of time defined for the purpose of the&#xD;
      investigation as &quot;working episodes&quot;. Working episodes were defined as at least 3 (up to 6)&#xD;
      consecutive working days of at least 6 hours each at work, following at least 2 consecutive&#xD;
      non-working days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects at Visit 1 (screening) were enrolled into the run-in period, where subjects&#xD;
      were assessed prior to treatment with the insoles under investigation. During the run-in&#xD;
      period, consisting of one working episode, subjects self-reported their pain without using&#xD;
      insoles on a daily basis (Q3-9 of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)), in order to provide the&#xD;
      baseline data to which the insoles were compared. Eligible subjects were enrolled into the&#xD;
      treatment period at Visit 2 and assigned the insole relevant to the target pain area/pain&#xD;
      area combination. Insole use was built up gradually during a breaking-in period, which&#xD;
      constituted one working episode, with at least one nonworking day prior to the start of the&#xD;
      working episode. Following the breaking-in period, the full-use period commenced. During the&#xD;
      treatment period, subjects wore the insoles on working days and as much as possible on&#xD;
      non-working days, self-reporting their pain daily (BPI Questions 3 - 9 inclusive).&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    Participants experienced data collection issues when using the eDiary, these issues increased&#xD;
    the burden and lowered compliance. Updates to the eDiary were unsuccessful at resolving the&#xD;
    issues so the decision was taken to terminate the Investigation.&#xD;

             working episodes during the 4 (up to 5)-week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             These working episodes should be non-complex in the opinion of the Investigator, to&#xD;
             ensure continued eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Those who spent most (at least three quarters) of their working day on their feet, and&#xD;
             remained in their current employment/work environment throughout the investigation&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Those who have experienced pain associated with musculoskeletal stress during working&#xD;
             episodes, for at least 4 weeks prior to enrolment (Visit 1) that they can distinguish&#xD;
             as being in one of the following primary areas of pain or combination thereof, that&#xD;
             the Investigator or designee considers could be treated with the relevant insole to be&#xD;
             used in the investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lower back&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Knee and/or Heel&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Arch&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Heel&#xD;
&#xD;
             Eligibility regarding this criterion will also be confirmed by the physiotherapist at&#xD;
             Visit 2, following their assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Those who scored an average of 5 (±1) on the BPI average pain item (question 5) over&#xD;
             the first three consecutive working days of the run-in period working episode**, when&#xD;
             assessed specifically in their primary target pain area/pain area combination, as&#xD;
             confirmed at Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the run-in period constituted more than one working episode (e.g. due to the&#xD;
                  scheduling of Visit 2), only the data from the first working episode was included&#xD;
                  in the calculation to determine eligibility, providing this included at least&#xD;
                  three consecutive working days. Otherwise data from the second working episode&#xD;
                  was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Those who had a current medical condition that is contraindicated by the use of the&#xD;
             orthotic insoles (e.g. peripheral vascular disease, sensory neuropathy or diabetes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Those who currently use prescribed orthotics for biomechanical or other issues, or&#xD;
             have received and used prescribed orthotics within the last 12 months or&#xD;
             over-the-counter (OTC) orthotics in the last 6 months (odour-eaters and any&#xD;
             non-structured/non-orthotic shock-absorber insole were permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Those with any significant medical history which in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
             could have interfered with the assessments of the investigation. For example;&#xD;
             structural conditions (e.g. bunion or bunionette), lower limb or foot injury,&#xD;
             rheumatic disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, polymyalgia rheumatica),&#xD;
             fibromyalgia, neurological disease or moderate to severe depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Those who were taking any of the following medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Anti-psychotic, sedatives, muscle-relaxants or medicines intended to treat&#xD;
                  neuropathic pain&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Anti-inflammatory medications which would reduce systemic inflammation or locally&#xD;
                  at the target pain areas (low dose Aspirin (75 mg daily) and nasal/inhaled&#xD;
                  steroids could have been considered acceptable, where in the opinion of the&#xD;
                  Investigator they would not interfere with the assessments of the investigation)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. An unstable dose of anti-depressants (defined as a change in therapy within the&#xD;
                  last 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Those who are taking regular medication for targeted pain (including OTC pain relief,&#xD;
             in excess of 2g paracetamol daily) which is either beyond the maximum recommended&#xD;
             daily dose according to the SmPC or which the Investigator deems inappropriate for the&#xD;
             subject to continue at the same dose throughout the investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Those who were pregnant or who had given birth within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Females of child-bearing potential who were unwilling to use a minimum of an&#xD;

             recommendations) level of birth control, for the entire duration of the investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Suitable methods of birth control (in accordance with &quot;highly effective&quot; and&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated&#xD;
                  with the inhibition of ovulation; oral, intravaginal, transdermal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of&#xD;
                  ovulation; oral, intravaginal, transdermal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is&#xD;
                  not the primary mode of action&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Male or female condom with or without spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Intrauterine device&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Intrauterine hormone-releasing system&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Bilateral tubal occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Vasectomised partner (where this was the subject's sole sexual partner and where&#xD;
                  the vasectomised partner had received medical assessment of the surgical success)&#xD;
&#xD;

                  intercourse during the entire period of the investigation in line with their&#xD;
                  preferred and usual lifestyle)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Females who were considered to be of child-bearing potential were those who were&#xD;
             fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently&#xD;
             sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy&#xD;
             and bilateral oophorectomy. A post-menopausal state is defined as no menses for 12&#xD;
             months without an alternative medical cause (Clinical Trials Facilitation Group,&#xD;
             2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Those who suffered from allergies or sensitivities to the raw material of the insoles&#xD;
             (as detailed in the Investigator Brochure).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Those who had participated in another clinical investigation within the 3 months prior&#xD;
             to enrolment into the run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Employee at the investigational site, or a partner or first degree relative of the&#xD;
             Investigator or member of the investigation team at the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Those, in the opinion of the Investigator, who were not deemed suitable or were unable&#xD;
             to comply fully with the investigation requirements, for any other reason.&#xD;
