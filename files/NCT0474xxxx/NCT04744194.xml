  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effect of two hamstring strengthening programs on hamstring&#xD;
      muscle strength in university students. 38 participants will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
      They will be randomly assigned to one of two 6-week hamstring strengthening programs, namely&#xD;
      the single leg bridge exercise and the Nordic hamstring exercise protocol. Eccentric&#xD;
      hamstring strength will be measured before and after the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited from the local university sports clubs. Club chairpersons will&#xD;
      be asked to send an email to club players. Players interested in participating in the study&#xD;
      will be asked to attend a meeting where the study will be explained to them. Those who were&#xD;
      interested will then be assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A four block randomization method will be used to allocate participants to the Nordic&#xD;
      hamstring exercise protocol or the single leg bridge protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Nordic hamstring exercise program or the single leg bridge program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eccentric strength of the participants' hamstrings will be recorded before and after the&#xD;
      exercise intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 10 point visual analogue scale will be used to record the level of muscle soreness&#xD;
      experienced after each training session.&#xD;

    <description>This will be measured using devices that measure the eccentric strength of the hamstrings during the Nordic hamstring exercise. The devices are called the Hamstring Solo device and the Nordbord device. Participants will kneel on the padded surface of the device with their lower limbs held in position just above the ankles. The ankle supports have load sensitive cells. The participants will be asked to complete the nordic hamstring exercise. This involves them folding their arms across their chest and slowly lowering themselves towards the ground by allowing their knees to slowly straighten. The load cells will record the force (newtons) during the exercise for each leg.</description>

The distance from the load cells to the knee joint will be measured (meters) to calculate the moment in Newton meters for the exercise</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline after 6 weeks</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle soreness ratings following exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately following each session</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will use a ten point numerical rating scale to record the level of muscle soreness after training sessions. The scale will range from 0 to 10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the most severe pain imaginable.</description>

    <description>Participants are required to kneel on a gym mat keeping their hips in a slightly flexed position and to slowly lower themselves in a controlled manner as far as they could towards the ground. When they can no longer lower themselves as such, they are instructed to utilise their arms to buffer the fall and touch their chest off the ground, while maintaining tension in their hamstrings. Once their chest touches the ground they are instructed to immediately return to the starting position by pushing up with their hands</description>

    <arm_group_label>Single leg bridge exercise program</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The single leg bridge is performed with the participant lying on the ground in supine with one heel on a box that is approximately 60cm in height and the knee in approximately 20 degrees of flexion. The participant then crosses their arms across their chest and pushes down through the heel to lift their hips off the ground so that their hips extend into a position of zero degrees flexion. The participant then allows their hips/buttocks to slowly lower to the ground.</description>
