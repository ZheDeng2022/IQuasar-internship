      The SAPPHYRE study is an ambispective (retrospective and prospective), non-interventional,&#xD;
      multicenter, post-market clinical follow-up study. The study objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and performance of Sophysa's CE marked Polaris® 24 adjustable valve system in the&#xD;
      treatment of hydrocephalus by shunting the cerebrospinal fluid. It is expected to recruit 126&#xD;
      patients in two-year. Patients will be followed-up up to 5 years post-procedure.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient implanted with the Polaris® 24 adjustable valve system for the following&#xD;
             reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Primo implant of a valve shunt-based derivation system, or as a&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Replacement of another valve -based shunt system, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Endoscopic ventriculostomy (EVT) failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient having given his/her informed consent prior to inclusion in this study, as per&#xD;
             local regulations&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed or suspected infections along the length of the shunt (meningitis,&#xD;
             ventriculitis, peritonitis, septicemia or bacteremia) or any infection present in any&#xD;
             part of the body&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient on anticoagulant therapy, or presenting with bleeding diathesis, or with&#xD;
             haemorrhagic CSF, as the presence of blood in the system could lead to an obstruction&#xD;
             in the system&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ventriculo-atrial shunts in patient suffering from congenital cardiopathies or other&#xD;
