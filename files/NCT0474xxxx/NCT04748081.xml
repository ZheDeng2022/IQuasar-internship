    <textblock>
      This study examined long-term incidence rates of major bleeding associated with hepatectomy.&#xD;
      The investigators used data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database.&#xD;
      Patients who underwent hepatectomy between 2000 and 2012 were identified by International&#xD;
      Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Variables including&#xD;
      gender, age, comorbidities, and prescribed medications were matched between cases and&#xD;
      controls. A total of 1,053 patients with hepatectomy and 4,212 matched non-hepatectomy&#xD;
      subjects were included in this study.&#xD;

      The study population consisted of two cohorts. Patients who underwent hepatectomy (ICD-9-CM&#xD;
      procedure code: 50.2, 50.22, 50.3 and 50.4) between 2000 and 2012 were identified as the&#xD;
      surgery cohort. The index date was defined as the earliest date that patients underwent&#xD;
      hepatectomy. Patients without any record of hepatectomy during the same period of time were&#xD;
      defined as the control cohort. Patients younger than 20 years of age and those diagnosed with&#xD;
      coagulation defects (ICD-9-CM: 286.4) or had a pre-existing bleeding episode before the index&#xD;
      date. The primary outcome of this study was an incident diagnosis of major bleeding,&#xD;
      consisting of 3 categories: intracranial bleeding (ICD-9-CM; 430, 431, 432.0, 432.1, 432.9,&#xD;
      852.0, 852.2, 852.4, 853.0), gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (ICD-9-CM; 456.0, 456.20, 530.7,&#xD;
      531, 531.2, 531.4, 531.6, 532, 532.2, 532.4, 532.6, 533, 533.2, 533.4, 533.6, 534, 534.2,&#xD;
      534.4, 534.6, 535.01, 535.11, 535.21, 535.31, 535.41, 535.51, 535.61, 535.71, 537.83, 537.84,&#xD;
      562.02, 562.03, 562.12, 562.13, 569.3, 569.85, 578) and other sites bleeding [ICD-9-CM;&#xD;
      336.1, 363.6, 372.72, 376.32, 377.42, 379.23 (eye); 593.81, 866.01, 866.02, 866.11, 866.12&#xD;
      (kidney); 719.1 (joint); 729.92 (soft tissue); 423.0 (heart); 772.5 (adrenal gland), 626.8,&#xD;
      626.9 (uterine)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics evaluated in this study included gender, age, comorbidities and&#xD;
      prescribed medications. The comorbidities included hypertension (ICD-9-CM; 401-405, A260 and&#xD;
      A269), hyperlipidemia (ICD-9-CM: 272), chronic liver disease (ICD-9-CM: 571.4, 571.5),&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (ICD-9-CM: 070.41, 070.44, 070.51, 070.54, and V02.62),&#xD;
      malignant neoplasm of liver and intrahepatic bile ducts (ICD-9-CM: 155), cirrhosis (ICD-9-CM:&#xD;
      571, A347), chronic kidney disease (ICD-9-CM: 580-589, A350), alcohol-related disease&#xD;
      (ICD-9-CM: 291, 303, 305.0, 357.5, 425.5, 535.3, 571.0-571.3, 980.0, E947.3), biliary stone&#xD;
      disease (ICD-9-CM: 574), and diabetes mellitus (ICD-9-CM: 250). The investigators also&#xD;
      searched the clinical records for the use of anticoagulants, antiplatelets, thrombolytic&#xD;
      agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitors (SNRIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) prescribed before the&#xD;
      index date. The investigators applied a 4:1 propensity-score matched analysis to reduce&#xD;
      selection bias between cases and controls.&#xD;
