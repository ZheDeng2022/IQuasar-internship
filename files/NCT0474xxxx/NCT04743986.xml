      Randomized controlled trial examining platelet rich plasma versus corticosteroid injection in&#xD;
      partial thickness rotator cuff tears or tendinopathy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We performed a randomized controlled trial on patients with imaging-shown rotator cuff&#xD;
      tendinopathy or partial thickness tearing. Patients were randomized to receive either&#xD;
      platelet rich plasma or corticosteroid. Follow-up was done at 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months&#xD;
      following injection.&#xD;

    <description>Patients had 10ml venous blood drawn. Injection was performed under ultrasound guidance by one of two musculoskeletal radiologists. Injection was 3-5ml at the site of tendon pathology with the remainder of the PRP preparation infiltrated into the subacromial space. A leukocyte-poor preparation was used from a pre-packaged kit (RegenLab, Lausanne, Switzerland). The samples were centrifuged at 1500g for 5 mins to yield approx 5.5ml of 80% platelets at 1.6x concentration. The supernatant was then resuspended by inverting the tube several times and was drawn into a separate 5-ml syringe for subacromial injection.</description>

    <description>Patients had 10ml venous blood drawn. Injection was performed under ultrasound guidance by one of two musculoskeletal radiologists. The blood sample was kept for a similar time delay for centrifugation prior to injection, and was then discarded. 1ml of 40-mg/ml triamcinolone was suspended in 2ml of 0.5% bupivicaine. Injection was performed through a lateral subacromial approach after needle fenestration of the supraspinatus tendon under ultrasound visualization. CS was infiltrated into the subacromial bursa and not the tendon itself.</description>
