  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dermatomyositis (DM) is a highly heterogeneous autoimmune disease characterized by rash and&#xD;
      myasthenia. Beside these, respiratory involvement is one of the common complications of DM.&#xD;
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) occur in approximately 90% of patients with DM, part of them&#xD;
      may manifest rapidly progressive-interstitial lung disease (rp-ILD), which progresses into&#xD;
      respiratory failure that is difficult to correct and leads to death. Early identification of&#xD;
      rp-ILD high risk group is of great significance to improve the prognosis of patients and to&#xD;
      conduct following clinical studies. A simple, easy, convenient and reliable diagnostic tool&#xD;
      has not yet acquired till now.&#xD;

      MSG-Jiangsu, short for Myositis Study Group-Jiangsu, was founded by department of&#xD;
      rheumatology and immunology of eighteen tertiary hospitals. Clinical Research on Advanced&#xD;
      Warning Factors Of Respiratory Injury in Dermatomyositis (CRAWFORD) as a multicenter&#xD;
      observational cohort study was started at Jun 1, 2020. Our cohort plan to recruit 1,000 adult&#xD;
      inpatients. What's more, prognostic data from these DM patients were obtained by following up&#xD;
      for 1 year. At the same time, clinical data and auxiliary examination results of the baseline&#xD;
      DM patients were analyzed to look for factors that are associated with outcomes. Then,&#xD;
      regression analysis of influencing factors will help us to set up a multi-factor weighted&#xD;
      score to forecast the prognosis of DM patients. Finally, Biological specimen from patients at&#xD;
      baseline are used to look for biomarkers that predict prognosis by RNA-sequencing, whole exon&#xD;
      sequencing, proteomic screening and so on.&#xD;
