    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify and establish a safe and effective tracheostomy&#xD;
      teaching protocol for caregivers. Results of this study will help in the development of a&#xD;
      discharge protocol that allows for caregiver confidence and activation in tracheostomy care&#xD;
      for patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-phase, prospective controlled cohort study .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first &quot;pre-implementation&quot; phase will include assessment of healthcare utilization costs&#xD;
      of tracheostomy patients currently and nursing perspective on current caregiver tracheostomy&#xD;
      knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second &quot;protocol&quot; phase will include assessment of the necessity, acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility, fidelity, safety and effectiveness of a standardized pathway and assessment of&#xD;
      the caregiver's activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third &quot;post-implementation&quot; phase will involve assessment of post-implementation&#xD;
      tracheostomy-related healthcare utilization costs and nursing perspective on caregiver&#xD;
      tracheostomy knowledge.&#xD;

    <measure>Feasibility Questionnaire scores</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of surgery, an average of 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility questionnaire evaluates the necessity, acceptability and feasibility of the of the implementation of a standardized discharge program. Questions are related to readiness and willingness to participate in tracheostomy care. It will assess feasibility in attending tracheostomy teaching sessions by nurses and their baseline comfort in tracheostomy care and their enthusiasm in learning tracheostomy care. Questionnaire consists of 12 questions, with scores ranging from 12 to 60, with higher scores indicating higher feasibility of tracheostomy protocol implementation.</description>

    <description>Effectiveness will be measured with the tracheostomy care competency assessment. This survey will be an individual's subjective assessment of his or her knowledge of tracheostomy care. A 5-point Likert scale will be used from 1 &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 5 &quot;strongly agree&quot; and assess different aspects of tracheostomy care outlined during their tracheostomy teaching provided by nurses. This assessment includes 12 questions with scores ranging from from 12 to 60 with higher scores indicating higher competency.&#xD;

Pre-implementation phase: Eligible &quot;patient&quot; participants identified &amp; healthcare utilization recorded. &quot;Nursing staff&quot; participants complete nursing survey to capture volume of tracheostomy-related questions received.&#xD;
Protocol-phase: &quot;Caregiver&quot; participants will complete a survey prior to patient tracheostomy, on day of patient discharge, and one week following discharge&#xD;
Post-implementation phase: &quot;Nursing staff&quot; participants will complete an additional survey similar to the one in the pre-implementation phase. EMR will be reviewed for implementation fidelity.</description>
