  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implant placement in the posterior maxilla is compromised due to atrophy of the alveolar&#xD;
      process and maxillary sinus pneumatisation. Bone augmentation is frequently necessary before&#xD;
      or in conjunction with implant placement. The most commonly used method to augment the&#xD;
      posterior maxillary involves maxillary sinus floor augmentation (MSFA) with autogenous bone&#xD;
      graft or bone substitute. Autogenous bone graft harvesting is associated with risk of donor&#xD;
      site morbidity and unpredictable resorption of graft. Thus, bone substitutes alone or in&#xD;
      combination with autogenous bone are used increasingly to simplify the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symbios biphasic biomaterial is a resorbable inorganic bone forming material derived from red&#xD;
      algae consisting of 20% hydroxylapatite and 80% β-tricalciumphosphate with osteoconductive&#xD;
      properties. Histologic and radiographic examinations indicate that β-tricalciumphosphate is&#xD;
      slowly resorbed and replaced with bone. MSFA with β-tricalciumphosphate alone or in&#xD;
      combination with autogenous bone or other bone substitutes have demonstrated high implant&#xD;
      survival and new bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symbios xenograft granules is a porcine bone mineral with osteoconductive properties.&#xD;
      Histologic and radiographic examinations indicate that xenograft is a non-resorbable graft&#xD;
      material. MSFA with xenograft alone or in combination with autogenous bone have shown high&#xD;
      implant survival and new bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to test the H0-hypothesis of no difference in implant outcome after MSFA&#xD;
      with autogenous bone graft or in combination with Symbios biphasic biomaterial or Symbios&#xD;
      xenograft. 60 consecutively healthy patients with a missing posterior maxillary tooth/teeth&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to: 1) MSFA with autogenous bone graft, 2) MSFA with mixture of&#xD;
      50% autogenous bone graft and 50% Symbios biphasic biomaterial 3) MSFA with mixture of 50%&#xD;
      autogenous bone graft and 50% Symbios xenograft. Implants will be inserted simultaneously&#xD;
      with MSFA. Clinical and/or radiographical evaluation using periapical radiographs and Cone&#xD;
      Beam Computer Tomography will be performed preoperatively, immediate postoperatively, before&#xD;
      abutment connection, after prosthetic rehabilitation, and after one year to assess the&#xD;
      treatment outcome and volumetric changes of the augmented area. Outcome include survival of&#xD;
      suprastructures and implants, volumetric stability of graft, peri-implant marginal bone&#xD;
      level, oral health related quality of life, and complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maxillary sinus floor augmentation (MSFA) is the most frequently used method to enhance the&#xD;
      alveolar bone of the posterior maxilla before or in conjunction with implant placement.&#xD;
      Autogenous bone is considered as the preferred graft material due to its osteoinductive,&#xD;
      osteogenic and osteoconductive characteristics. However, autogenous bone grafts is associated&#xD;
      with risk of donor site morbidity and unpredictable graft resorption. Hence, various bone&#xD;
      substitutes are used increasingly to simplify the surgical procedure by diminishing the need&#xD;
      for bone harvesting. From a clinical and patient perspective, it would be an advantage, if&#xD;
      autogenous bone grafts could partially or totally be replaced with bone substitutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symbios xenograft is a new porcine bone mineral characterized as an anorganic bone matrix&#xD;
      with an interconnecting macro- and microscopic pore structure that supports formation and&#xD;
      in-growth of new bone. Porcine xenograft have previously been used for various augmentation&#xD;
      procedures disclosing new bone formation. Studies comparing autogenous bone graft with&#xD;
      porcine bone alone or a mixture of autogenous bone and porcine bone have demonstrated high&#xD;
      implant survival and new bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synthetic biomaterials including calcium phosphate, calcium sulphate, polymers and bioactive&#xD;
      glass represent a large group of inorganic diverse biomaterials with variating structures,&#xD;
      chemical composition and physical properties. Symbios biphasic biomaterials is a resorbable&#xD;
      inorganic bone forming material derived from red algae consisting of 20% hydroxylapatite and&#xD;
      80% β-tricalciumphosphate. Studies assessing MSFA with β-tricalciumphosphate have&#xD;
      demonstrated that it is a safe grafting material with osteoconductive properties. Histologic&#xD;
      and radiographic examinations indicate that β-tricalciumphosphate is slowly resorbed and&#xD;
      replaced with bone. MSFA with β-tricalciumphosphate alone or in combination with autogenous&#xD;
      bone or other bone substitutes have demonstrated high implant survival and new bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study purpose is to increase our knowledge about MSFA with autogenous bone alone or in&#xD;
      combination with Symbios biphasic biomaterials or Symbios xenograft granules and to&#xD;
      simplified the procedure. Evaluation will include survival of suprastructures and implants,&#xD;
      peri-implant marginal bone level, volumetrical stability of the graft and complications after&#xD;
      an observation period of one year. Furthermore, oral health related quality of life, using&#xD;
      OHIP-14 self-administrated and patient satisfaction using visual analogue scales (VAS), will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to test the H0 hypothesis of no differences in 1) Survival of&#xD;
      suprastructures and implants, 2) Volumetrical stability of the graft, 3)Peri-implant marginal&#xD;
      bone level, 4) Implantat stability quotient, 5) Patient-reported outcome measures, and 6)&#xD;
      Biologic and technical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Study population 60 consecutively healthy patients with a missing&#xD;
      posterior maxillary tooth will be included and randomly allocated to: 1) MSFA with autogenous&#xD;
      bone graft alone (control group), 2) mixture of 50% autogenous bone graft and 50% Symbios&#xD;
      biphasic biomaterial (test group I), and 3) mixture of 50% autogenous bone and 50% Symbios&#xD;
      xenograft (test group II). The study will be conducted at the Departments of Oral and&#xD;
      Maxillofacial Surgery, Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark and Oral and Maxillofacial&#xD;
      Surgery and Oral Medicine, Malmö University, Malmö, Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included to the study by using a Facebook posting through the University's&#xD;
      Facebook page, the local dental association website or patients that are referred to the&#xD;
      Departments for treatment of one or more missing teeth in the posterior maxilla. All patients&#xD;
      will be offered participation in the study, if they meet the inclusion criteria. Prior to&#xD;
      patients' first visit, they will receive a notice informing about their rights and informed&#xD;
      consent form will be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria involves 1) &gt;20 years, 2) Missing one or more posterior maxillary teeth,&#xD;
      3) Residual bone height of the maxillary alveolar process between 3 to 7 mm, 4) Width of the&#xD;
      alveolar process ≥6.5 mm and, 5) Mandibular occluding teeth. Exclusion criteria involves 1)&#xD;
      Contraindications to implant therapy, 2) Full mouth plaque score &gt;25%, 3) Progressive&#xD;
      marginal periodontitis, 4) Acute infection in the area intended for implant placement,&#xD;
      5)Parafunction, bruxism, or clenching, 6) Psychiatric problems or unrealistic expectations,&#xD;
      7) Heavy tobacco use, define as &gt;10 cigarettes per day, and 8)Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is approved by the local ethical Committee on Health Research and the Danish Data&#xD;
      Protection Agency and The Ethical Review Board in Lund, Sweden' and will be performed&#xD;
      according to the Declaration of Helsinki on clinical research. All patients will be given&#xD;
      verbal and written information about the study at a clinical visit prior to surgery. Written&#xD;
      informed consent is mandatory for inclusion in the study and will be obtained by the&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial examination of the patient will include 1) Clinical examination and screening of&#xD;
      the parodontal health, 2) Radiographical examination of the residual alveolar bone height&#xD;
      based on CBCT and Orthopantomography, and 3) Patient will fill out the OHIP-14 questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedure will be performed in local anesthesia. Implant installation and&#xD;
      fabrication of the subsequently prosthetic solution will be performed according to&#xD;
      manufacturer's recommendations. The maxillary sinus wall is exposed by an intraoral marginal&#xD;
      incision from tuber maxillae to the first premolar with a vertical releasing incision. A 1 x&#xD;
      1 cm window to the maxillary sinus is created with metal and diamond burrs maintaining an&#xD;
      intact Schneiderian membrane. The Schneiderian membrane is elevated from the sinus floor as&#xD;
      well as the lateral sinus wall and displaced dorsocranially with blunt dissector. An implant&#xD;
      bed is successively prepared on the top of the alveolar crest following manufactory's&#xD;
      recommendations at 1500 rpm. A straight implant (ASTRA TECH Implant System EV 3.6, 4.2 or&#xD;
      4.8, 13 mm) is inserted with a cover screw. The implant stability quotient is measured for&#xD;
      all inserted implants. A sealed randomization envelope is opened in order to allocate the&#xD;
      patient to: 1) MSFA with particulated autogenous bone graft alone (control group), 2) a&#xD;
      mixture of 50% particulated autogenous bone graft and 50% Symbios biphasic bone graft&#xD;
      material (1.0 mm to 2.0 mm) (test group I), 3) a mixture of 50% particulated autogenous bone&#xD;
      graft and 50% Symbios xenograft granules (1.0 mm to 2.0 mm) (test group II). The autogenous&#xD;
      bone graft is harvested with a curved SafeScraper from the zygomatic buttress area. Specially&#xD;
      prepared stainless steel cups (0.5 cm3 and 1 cm3) are used to estimate 1 cm3 of graft&#xD;
      material for each inserted implant. The graft material will be soaked in autogenous blood&#xD;
      from the surgical site until use. The sinus around the implant is packed with 1 cm3 graft&#xD;
      material. The created window to the maxillary sinus is covered by a Symbios Collagen Membrane&#xD;
      15 x 20 mm. Periosteum and mucosa are sutured with Vicryl 4-0. Minor perforations of sinus&#xD;
      membrane will be covered with a Symbios Collagen Membrane. If the sinus membrane is largely&#xD;
      perforated the procedure will be cancelled, and the patient will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
      No provisional restoration is inserted during the healing period. After six months of&#xD;
      healing, the inserted implants in the three treatment groups are exposed via a crestal&#xD;
      incision. Mucosa and periosteum are elevated and the cover screw is removed. The implant&#xD;
      stability quotient is measured for all inserted implants. The implant is rinsed with saline&#xD;
      and a prefabricated healing abutment is placed. The implants are manually tested for mobility&#xD;
      and osseointegration by percussion. Mucosa is adapted and sutured with Vicryl 4-0. The&#xD;
      prosthetic restoration will be initiated three weeks after the healing abutment has been&#xD;
      placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prosthetic restoration will include an individualized abutment and a fixed restoration&#xD;
      performed by experienced prosthodontists with extensive clinical experience with&#xD;
      implant-based prosthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be scheduled for a postoperative clinical examination at baseline, and one year&#xD;
      after loading. The following parameters will be recorded at each visit 1) Plaque and gingival&#xD;
      index, probing pocket depth, and probing attachment level, 2) Oral health related quality of&#xD;
      life - OHIP-14 and 3) Patient satisfaction (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographical evaluation will include seven sets of periapical radiographs and CBCT obtained&#xD;
      preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, after abutment connection, at baseline and one&#xD;
      year after loading. To provide blinding of the radiographical evaluation, the CBCT-scans are&#xD;
      coded. Volumetrical changes of the grafts are estimated by point counting and the method&#xD;
      described originally by Cavalieri. To obtain an equivalent starting point for the systematic&#xD;
      uniform random sampling of the CBCT-scans images involving the maxillary sinus, all images&#xD;
      from the neighboring teeth to the implant bed are selected. The first CBCT images after the&#xD;
      distal surface of the anterior neighboring tooth is sampled randomly using a random number&#xD;
      table for each maxillary sinus. Every second CBCT image is selected to ensure an equal mutual&#xD;
      distance between the selected 5-10 images. The original outline of the maxillary sinus before&#xD;
      implant installation is recorded and superimposed on the corresponding images. A point grid&#xD;
      test system is superimposed at random on all images, allowing 100-200 points to hit the graft&#xD;
      of each maxillary sinus. The numbers of intersections over the graft are counted on each&#xD;
      selected image. Cavalieri volume estimation principle is used to estimate the total volume of&#xD;
      the graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V = t x a(p) x ΣP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where V is volume, t is the distance between the sampled images, a(p) is the area associated&#xD;
      with each test point corrected for magnification and ΣP is the total number of points hitting&#xD;
      the graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-implant marginal bone changes are evaluated by linear measurements on digital periapical&#xD;
      radiographs and will be done on radiographs obtained at implant placement, baseline, and one&#xD;
      year after loading. The distance from the implant-abutment connection to the marginal bone&#xD;
      level will be measured mesially and distally parallel with the long-axis of the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and analysis including calculation of descriptive statistics are done using&#xD;
      STATA. A power calculation are based on differences in marginal bone level changes preformed&#xD;
      in a previous study involving replacement of a single tooth with 2 different protocols of&#xD;
      implant treatment. The calculation is based on the observed changes in marginal bone level&#xD;
      from insertion of the implant to abutment connection (a change of 0.65 mm and a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 0.65), 17 patients in each group reaches a power of 97% at the 5%-level. With&#xD;
      15% to cover drop-outs, each treatment group should include 20 patients. The statistical&#xD;
      evaluation is performed by analysis of variance. Scheffe´s multiple comparison test is used&#xD;
      post hoc to determine the relative effect of the various graft types. Level of significance&#xD;
      is 0.05.&#xD;
