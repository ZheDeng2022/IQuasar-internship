    <textblock>
      This study will adapt and evaluate a novel, innovative, and highly scalable parenting&#xD;
      intervention that employs video coaching to target responsive parenting, Filming Interactions&#xD;
      to Nurture Development (FIND), among women who have been referred to or are in treatment for&#xD;
      opioid misuse/addiction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to conduct a randomized trial with a sample of&#xD;
      opioid-using women who are in or have been referred for treatment through outpatient and&#xD;
      inpatient services and have a child aged 0-36 months. We will use a longitudinal design with&#xD;
      an active control condition to test the central hypothesis that associations between (a)&#xD;
      increases in responsive caregiving and (b) subsequent caregiver opioid addiction recovery,&#xD;
      psychological well-being, and child developmental and biobehavioral outcomes (secondary&#xD;
      targets), will be partially mediated through (c) changes in caregiver executive functioning,&#xD;
      reward responsiveness, and parent self-concept. The rationale for this work is that it&#xD;
      simultaneously addresses the unmet needs of a large, significantly underserved population and&#xD;
      allows for a rigorous test of our conceptual model, which specifies hypothesized underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms and differential impact.&#xD;

    <measure>Caregiver's perceived sense of competency in parenting via the Parent Sense of Competency scale (PSOC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at endpoint (3-4 months post-baseline) and 6 months post-endpoint</time_frame>
    <description>The Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC) questionnaire is filled out by the caregiver to assess parents' sense of competence and enjoyment of parenting. This is an adapted version of the PSOC (original PSOC has 17 items, Johnston &amp; Mash, 1989), with 18 items and simplified language for lower reading levels.&#xD;
These items are answered on a 4-point scale ranging from &quot;strongly agree&quot; to &quot;strongly disagree.&quot; Scoring for some items is reversed so that, for all items, higher scores indicate greater parenting self-esteem. Nine (9) items (#s 2,3,4,5,8,9,13,15 and 17) on the PSOC are reverse coded.&#xD;
Subscales include:&#xD;
Satisfaction: Mean score of 2,3,4,5,9,13,15,17, and 18 (Range = 1-4) Efficacy: Mean score of 1,6,7,8,10,11,14, and 16 (Range = 1-4) Total Score: 18 - 72, scored responses summed</description>

    <measure>Observed Parental Self-Concept</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at endpoint (3-4 months post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The PSET involves visual presentation of single words or short phrases in the parenting domain (e.g., kind, supportive, enforces rules) seen under two different instruction conditions. The identity condition will ask participants to indicate via a button press whether the word or phrase describes them as a parent (left index finger = yes, right index finger = no). The control condition will ask participants to indicate via a button press whether the word or phrase is a quality that can change for a parent (yes/no). Scores are percent endorsement of developmentally-supportive (DS) and developmentally-unsupportive (DU) items in each condition. The key neural contrasts are neural activation during the presentation of (a) identity &gt; control trials and (b) identity-yes &gt; identity-no trials.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of parent's warmth and hostility towards their child through the use of the Iowa Family Interaction Rating Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at endpoint (3-4 months post-baseline) and 6 months post-endpoint</time_frame>
    <description>The Iowa family interaction rating scales were used to assess parent's warmth and hostility towards their partner, their perceived warmth and hostility received from their partner, and warmth and hostility towards their child. The questionnaire is divided into 3 parts; the first 10 questions ask how you have behaved towards your partner, the next 10 ask how your partner has behaved towards you, and the final 10 questions ask how you have behaved towards your child.&#xD;
There are 2 scales for each part of the questionnaire, warmth (6 items) and hostility (4 items). For both scales each item has a possible 7 responses. Each scale reverse scored and then summed by adding each item score, giving a possible range of 0-42 for the warmth scale and 0-28 for the hostility scale. Higher scores indicate higher levels of warmth/hostility respectively.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of early adversity assessed via the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The ACE is a 10-item measure of childhood adversity and is often used as a predicter of poorer outcomes later in life. The higher the score out of 10, the more likely for poor outcomes.&#xD;
Sum the scores of all responses 1-10 for total ACE score. Reverse code the emotional neglect question, question 10, which counts as an ACE if either sub-question is answered &quot;No.&quot; The developers suggest not including the supplemental questions in the Total ACE score. They recommend remaining true to the original ACE 10 categories so we can compare data across sites. If desired, you can sum the scores on the supplementary questions, and create a supplementary grand total to examine separately.&#xD;

    <measure>Assessment of unpredictability and fragmentation of early-life environments in infants and children through the use of the Questionnaire of Unpredictability in Childhood (QUIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The QUIC, a reliable and valid self-report assessment of exposure to unpredictability in the social, emotional, and physical domains during early life, is a brief, comprehensive, and promising instrument for predicting risk for mental illness. The QUIC consists of an overall score and five separate subscale scores. Higher scores indicate more exposure to unpredictability in childhood. To obtain the overall score or subscale scores, reverse score select items (indicated by an R after the item number) and then calculate the sum of the items in each scale: Parental monitoring and involvement = 1R + 3R + 4R + 5R + 6R + 7R + 9R + 10R + 14R Parental predictability = 2 + 8R + 11 + 12 + 15R + 16 + 17R + 31 + 32 + 33 + 34 + 35 Parental environment = 18 + 19 + 21 + 22 + 28R + 29 + 30 Physical environment = 13 + 20 + 26 + 27 + 36R + 37 + 38 Safety and security = 23 + 24 + 25 Overall = Sum of all subscales.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>FIND is a brief video coaching intervention which involves feedback provided by the coach to the caregiver using brief film clips derived from video of caregiver-child interaction. The coaching focuses on showing caregivers instances in which they are engaging in developmentally-supportive interactions during coaching sessions. FIND is delivered over 10 weekly sessions lasting 30-45 minutes. The process begins with an initial session in which the coach provides an overview, records 10-15 minutes of caregiver-child interaction, then introduces the concept of serve and return. The video is edited to show brief clips in which the caregiver is engaged in the first of five specific caregiver-based components of serve and return. The next week, the FIND coach reviews the edited clips in detail with the caregiver. Sessions continue, alternating between filming and coaching sessions until all five components have been covered sequentially.</description>
