  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to propose a modification of the original periostal pocket flap&#xD;
      technique consisting in replacing the xenograft by a conglomerate which contains autologous&#xD;
      bone obtained from the future implant site through biological drilling technique and PRGF&#xD;
      (Plasma Rich in Growth Factors)&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Materials and methods: 8 patients referred for implant placement and with a slight&#xD;
      bucco-lingual (BL) width deficiency in alveolar bone were included in the study. Patients&#xD;
      were placed dental implants and bone width was augmented by using the conglomerate mentioned&#xD;
      above.&#xD;

    <description>After local anesthesia, a full thickness flap was elevated from the lingual wall and a partial thickness flap was performed in the buccal one. After that, the buccal periosteum was detached and dental implants were placed following the biological drilling protocol, getting autologous bone particles from the implant site.&#xD;
Patient's blood collection was performed and the plasm obtained was poured down on a sterile container and mixed with autologous bone particles collected previously during the drilling procedure. Finally the graft was placed in the pocket prepared previously and the surgical wound was sutured in two planes.</description>
