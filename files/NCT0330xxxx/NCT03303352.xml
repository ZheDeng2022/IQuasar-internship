      Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration (EUS FNA) is an established and recommended&#xD;
      technique for diagnostic of solid pancreatic masses. The accuracy of the technique depends on&#xD;
      the operator experience, lesion type and location, type of procedure sedation as well as&#xD;
      procedure related technique factors (presence of elastography or contrast enhanced imaging,&#xD;
      needle diameter, presence of stylet, use of suction and type of suction, the number and&#xD;
      method of &quot;to and fro&quot; movements, the number of passes and the presence of a cytopathologist&#xD;
      in the examination room).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between the &quot;to and fro&quot; movement and the EUS FNA yield in solid pancreatic&#xD;
      masses has only been explored in the literature in a subjective fashion, without accurately&#xD;
      measuring the needle acceleration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a simple electronic sensor device connected by Bluetooth to a phone, has been&#xD;
      proposed for teaching and research purposes. Among its sensors, it includes an accelerometer&#xD;
      which can measure the instant scalar acceleration of an object and transmit it to the&#xD;
      connected phone. By attaching this device to the EUS FNA needle, the investigators can&#xD;
      accurately measure the instant scalar acceleration of the &quot;to and fro&quot; movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective, multicenter, randomized, crossover study on 51&#xD;
      patients with solid pancreatic masses to compare an EUS FNA &quot;fast&quot; sampling technique in&#xD;
      which the needle acceleration is higher than 1 g to a &quot;slow&quot; technique where the needle&#xD;
      acceleration is lower than 1g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to compare the tissue acquisition rates and the&#xD;
      histological diagnosis accuracy between the 2 methods &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot;. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives of the study are to compare the cellularity and quality scores of the obtained&#xD;
      specimens between the 2 methods. Another secondary objective is to find a linear relationship&#xD;
      between the needle acceleration and the EUS FNA yield (histological diagnosis, sample&#xD;
      cellularity and adequacy).&#xD;

      Research questions and aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that during a EUS FNA (endoscopic ultrasound fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration) procedure, the acceleration of the needle that travels through tissue during the&#xD;
      &quot;to and fro&quot; movements influence the diagnostic yield.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to test this hypothesis in EUS FNA of solid pancreatic masses by&#xD;
      accurately measuring and comparing the diagnostic yield of 2 different needle accelerations,&#xD;
      &quot;fast&quot; - where the mean needle scalar acceleration is higher and &quot;slow&quot; - where the mean&#xD;
      needle scalar acceleration is lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS FNA is an established and recommended technique for diagnostic of solid pancreatic&#xD;
      masses. The median EUS FNA sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and&#xD;
      accuracy values for differentiating benign versus malignant lesions are 83% (54-95%), 100%&#xD;
      (71-100%), 72% (16-92%) and 88% (65-96%) respectively. The yield of the procedure depends on&#xD;
      the operator, lesion and technique related factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  operator. A minimum of 25 supervised pancreatic EUS FNA is recommended at the beginning,&#xD;
           the diagnostic accuracy plateau improving with experience;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sedation. General anesthesia significantly increases the diagnostic yield;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lesion type and location. Lower sensitivities are expected when the punctured mass is&#xD;
           found in a pancreas with chronic pancreatitis criteria versus a normal appearing&#xD;
           pancreas. Also, lower sensitivity is expected when EUS FNA is performed trans-duodenal&#xD;
           (pancreatic head and uncinate process) versus trans-gastric approach (body and tail&#xD;
           lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  elastography or contrast enhanced imaging. These may improve the EUS FNA diagnostic&#xD;
           yield either by estimating the mass etiology in relation with its elasticity or by&#xD;
           finely tuning the exact spot where a solid lesion should be punctured;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  needle diameter. 25 gauge needles may confer an advantage in adequacy relative to 22&#xD;
           gauge needles but confer no advantage with respect to accuracy, number of passes, or&#xD;
           complications. 19 gauge needles do not confer an advantage in this moment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the presence of stylet only increases bloodiness of the harvested sample;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the use of suction. The presence of a syringe for aspiration does not appear to increase&#xD;
           the diagnostic yield, only increases the bloodiness of the sample. The slow withdrawal&#xD;
           of the stylet (the capillary technique) yields better results when using 25 gauge&#xD;
           needles, but not for 22 gauge needles. The wet suction technique yields a significant&#xD;
           better specimen for 22 gauge needles, but the clinical relevance is questioned;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the sampling technique. The fanning technique significantly increases the first pass&#xD;
           diagnosis rate from 57.7% to 85.7%;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the number of &quot;to and fro&quot; movements per pass. The optimal number of &quot;to and fro&quot;&#xD;
           movements (jabs) is said to be 15;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the presence of a cytopathologist in the procedure room - rapid on site evaluation&#xD;
           (ROSE) increases the yield of EUS FNA by 15 to 20%;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the minimum recommended number of passes without ROSE is 5 to 7. It seems that 7 passes&#xD;
           are non-inferior to ROSE and may be more cost effective;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  finally, the use of fine needle biopsy (FNB) with second generation needles by Cook&#xD;
           Endoscopy and by Medtronic Corporation. The debate today is whether this can replace EUS&#xD;
           FNA with ROSE;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the authors of the paper &quot;Multicenter, prospective, crossover trial comparing the&#xD;
      door-knocking method with the conventional method for EUS-FNA of solid pancreatic masses&quot;&#xD;
      published in &quot;Gastrointestinal Endoscopy&quot; in 2016 hypothesized that that &quot;needle speed&quot; might&#xD;
      affect the result of EUS FNA procedure of a pancreatic mass. They designed a prospective&#xD;
      study of EUS FNA for pancreatic solid masses using 22 gauge needles, comparing two&#xD;
      acquisition techniques: the conventional technique and the &quot;door knocking method&quot;. In the&#xD;
      later technique, the needle is rapidly pushed towards the stopper, taking care not to exit&#xD;
      the outer border of the lesion. The &quot;door knocking method&quot; is a sudden needle deceleration of&#xD;
      an unknown value in m/s2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the accuracies of the two methods (conventional and &quot;door knocking method&quot;) were&#xD;
      similar, the quality rates of the histological specimen for the two methods were also&#xD;
      similar, only the number of cells were significantly higher in the &quot;door knocking method&quot; (p&#xD;
      = 0.03), with discordant results between trans-gastric and duodenal route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the relationship between the needle &quot;to and fro&quot; movement acceleration value and the&#xD;
      yield of EUS FNA for solid pancreatic masses?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, from oocytes aspiration studies, according to Hagen's-Poiseuille law, the velocity&#xD;
      of the aspirated flow within the needle tract increases with needle diameter and decreases&#xD;
      with needle length. However, from clinical studies so for, one knows that syringe aspiration&#xD;
      only increases bloodiness but not sample cellularity. This is explained probably by the fact&#xD;
      that only blood (containing small size particles unbound to the extracellular tissue - red&#xD;
      blood cells) has a &quot;flow&quot; behavior within the needle tract. Larger particles bound to&#xD;
      extracellular space (pancreatic mass cells) have to be firstly detached from the matrix by&#xD;
      cutting them with the needle bevel and then aspirated within the needle tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the previous study, as oocytes are meant to be released from ovary, they are not as&#xD;
      &quot;tightly&quot; held in the ovarian tissue and this is why aspiration is important. However, one&#xD;
      knows that pancreatic cancer has the highest amount of stroma compared to other solid organs&#xD;
      and this is why aspiration does not increase the yield of pancreatic EUS FNA. Only needles&#xD;
      which can effectively cut and &quot;detach&quot; pancreatic cells may harvest a high cellular sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, from vacuum cleaner physics, particle aspiration is best when the tube does not&#xD;
      move very fast on the floor, so as the particles have time to be aspirated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applying these two concepts, the investigators hypothesize that the &quot;to&quot; movement will have&#xD;
      to have a high acceleration so as to cut, detach and aspire the tissue cells from their&#xD;
      surrounding extracellular space and the &quot;fro&quot; movement has to be slower, so as to give the&#xD;
      time to the detached tumor cells to be aspired into the needle tube. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      verify this hypothesis in EUS FNA of pancreatic solid masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, crossover study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with solid pancreatic masses fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      allocated to receive EUS FNA with an Olympus linear scope. Each patient will receive 2 EUS&#xD;
      FNA passes, 1 &quot;fast&quot; and 1 &quot;slow&quot;, with a 22 gauge EUS needle, with suction syringe,&#xD;
      employing the fanning technique, 10 jabs for each pass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A &quot;fast&quot; pass has an advancing mean acceleration jab (&quot;to&quot; movement) higher than 1 g, while a&#xD;
      &quot;slow&quot; pass has an advancing mean acceleration jab of less than 1 g (where 1 g equals 9.8&#xD;
      m/s2). Both movements will have a &quot;slow&quot; &quot;fro&quot; withdrawal movement, from the point of maximum&#xD;
      advance into the lesion to the lesion entry site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, the passes order with be either done as &quot;fast&quot;, &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;slow&quot;, &quot;fast&quot; in&#xD;
      a randomized fashion. The randomization numbers list will be generated on a dedicated&#xD;
      website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The needle acceleration will be measured with an accelerometer (Pocket-Lab) attached to the&#xD;
      aspiration syringe, connected to a phone using Bluetooth. Pocket-Lab is a device awarded the&#xD;
      &quot;Yale School of Management Grand Prize and Audience Choice Award&quot; and is an &quot;Intel Education&#xD;
      Accelerator Partner&quot;. It can function as an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a magnetometer, a&#xD;
      barometer and a thermometer, all at once. Recorded data is transmitted via Bluetooth to a&#xD;
      phone and can be visualized and stored for further analysis. When the device varies its&#xD;
      position, speed, acceleration, pressure or temperature, data is captured and transmitted to&#xD;
      the phone. The investigators will take advantage on its accelerometer properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pocket-Lab device will be attached to the EUS FNA needle. As the needle will be moved up&#xD;
      and down, the instant scalar acceleration values will be registered to form a chart&#xD;
      visualized and recorded on the phone screen. Data can then be exported as a &quot;.csv&quot; file (CSV,&#xD;
      comma separated values), translated on a spreadsheet and analyzed in an Excel Table (mean,&#xD;
      median, range).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, acceleration scalar variation data from the 2 passes will be recorded and&#xD;
      analyzed. For each pass, the harvested material will be put in a recipient containing&#xD;
      absolute alcohol for cyto-block preparation and ulterior histological analysis. Each patient&#xD;
      will finally have 2 clearly numbered recipients with harvested material put in alcohol, 1 for&#xD;
      &quot;fast&quot; and 1 for &quot;slow&quot; passes. The needle stopper will be fixed at a calculated distance so&#xD;
      as the needle will not exit the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological examination will be performed by experienced pathologists from each&#xD;
      participating institution. 1 slide for each of the formalin recipient, containing the most&#xD;
      available tissue will be stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, all slides will be scored for cellularity and quality on a 0 to 3&#xD;
      discrete scale by an independent pathologist. This pathologist will not be involved in the&#xD;
      initial histological analysis for each patients and will be blinded to the type of pass&#xD;
      (&quot;fast&quot; or &quot;slow&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a type I risk error of less than 5% (alpha = 0.05), a type II risk error less than 20%&#xD;
      (power beta = 0.80), a histological accuracy for pancreatic masses of 65% with less than 1 g&#xD;
      acceleration &quot;to and fro&quot; hand movement and a predicted 90% accuracy with higher than 1 g&#xD;
      acceleration hand &quot;to and fro&quot; movement, the calculated sample size is 51 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research protocol, the case report forms (CRF), the informed consent brochures will be&#xD;
      submitted by each center to their local independent ethical committee (IEC) for regulatory&#xD;
      approval. The trial will be registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov Data will be collected&#xD;
      locally in each center in a CRF, translated in an Excel Spreadsheet and then centralized for&#xD;
      data analysis. Data will by anonymized and protected according to national and European Union&#xD;
      laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, the investigators will collect the following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
