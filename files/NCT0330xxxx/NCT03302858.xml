  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to assess the safety and effectiveness of circumferential&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to the anal canal using the BarrxTM Ablation System to destroy&#xD;
      anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). The BarrxTM Ablation System used in&#xD;
      this study comprises an RFA generator (Barrx™ FLEX) and the BarrxTM Anorectal Wand. The&#xD;
      generator and wand are cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use and&#xD;
      the wand is specifically cleared for treatment of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). AIN&#xD;
      is a precancerous condition. HSIL is an advanced form of AIN. The presence of HSIL has&#xD;
      traditionally warranted treatment. RFA has been shown in many studies to effectively and&#xD;
      safely destroy precancerous cells in a condition called Barrett's esophagus, which is a&#xD;
      precancerous condition of the esophagus (the swallowing tube). Recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      RFA may offer the same benefits for those with HSIL in the anal canal. In particular,&#xD;
      ablation of the entire circumference of the canal seems to reduce recurrence of HSIL in other&#xD;
      locations of the anal canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last between 12 to 15 months. Subjects will be required to undergo 5 to 8&#xD;
      study visits as outlined below that are carried out by the study doctors or the physician&#xD;
      assistant. Most visits will last approximately one hour. Some may be shorter and some may be&#xD;
      longer. Up to seventy (70) volunteers will participate in this study at several locations.&#xD;

    <description>The radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or Barrx™ Ablation System used in this protocol comprises an RFA generator (Barrx™ FLEX) and the Barrx™ Anorectal Wand. The generator and wand are cleared by the FDA for human use and the wand is specifically cleared for treatment of anal neoplasia. The present FDA indication for use statement is: &quot;The Barrx™ catheters are indicated for use in the coagulation of bleeding and non-bleeding sites in the gastrointestinal tract including, but not limited to, the esophagus. Indications include esophageal ulcers, Mallory-Weiss tears, arteriovenous malformations, angiomata, Barrett's esophagus, Dieulafoy lesions, angiodysplasia, gastric antral vascular ectasia, and radiation proctitis.&quot;</description>
