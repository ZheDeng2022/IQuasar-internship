  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, phase I study consisting of 2 parts. The first part is a multiple&#xD;
      ascending dose (MAD) part with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design in 3&#xD;
      treatment groups of 8 subjects (6 active; 2 placebo). The second part is a food effect (FE)&#xD;
      part with a randomized, open-label, 2-period, 2-way crossover, single dose design in 8&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

      MAD part (Part 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After assessing eligibility during a 4-week screening period, subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      1 of the 3 treatments as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: 14 oral doses of 100 mg FP-025 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) in 8 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: 14 oral doses of 200 mg FP-025 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) in 8 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment C: 14 oral doses of 400 mg FP-025 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) in 8 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FE part (Part 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After assessing eligibility during a 4-week screening period, 1 treatment group of 8 subjects&#xD;
      (8 active; 0 placebo) will be randomized to a treatment sequence (D followed by E, or E&#xD;
      followed by D):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment D: single oral dose of 200 mg FP-025 under fasted conditions, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment E: single oral dose of 200 mg FP-025 after intake of a high-fat, high-calorie&#xD;
           breakfast (fed condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study planned duration for each part, Part 1 and Part 2 of the study, is&#xD;
      approximately 6 weeks, including screening period.&#xD;

    <description>Safety evaluation will study the adverse event (AE) profile, clinical laboratory safety tests, vital signs, and ECG monitoring. The ECG parameter QTc will be calculated according to Fridericia's correction using the ECG parameters QT interval (QT) and RR recorded. QTc (msec) = QT (msec)/RR (sec)1/3. QT msec will be calculated with RR sec to arrive at one reported value for QTc.</description>
