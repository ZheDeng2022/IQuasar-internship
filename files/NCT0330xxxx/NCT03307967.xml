  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal (MSD) conditions often develop chronic pain&#xD;
      and are at high risk for substance misuse. The Investigators propose to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to&#xD;
      Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and reduce risky substance&#xD;
      use, in part by helping Veterans get comprehensive pain treatment. The study will involve a&#xD;
      2-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single site to counsel Veterans throughout New&#xD;
      England by phone with SBIRT-PM as part of a clinical trial, and a 4-year period to conduct&#xD;
      the trial and disseminate its findings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2015 alone, 97,223 new Veterans under age 35 began receiving compensation for injuries&#xD;
      related to their military service. In total, there are 559,999 post-9/11 Veterans being&#xD;
      compensated for back or neck conditions, and a partially overlapping 596,250 for limitation&#xD;
      of flexion in joints. Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often&#xD;
      develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. Early intervention is needed&#xD;
      to arrest worsening pain and risky substance use, particularly among post-9/11 Veterans for&#xD;
      whom engagement in non-pharmacological pain treatment has the potential to improve their&#xD;
      overall quality of life and spare them the complications of opioid treatments. The&#xD;
      service-connection application is an ideal point-of-contact for initiating early intervention&#xD;
      treatments for these at-risk Veterans. The Investigators propose to test the effectiveness&#xD;
      and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain&#xD;
      Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and risky substance use. In brief, the&#xD;
      counselor explains that treating both physical and psychological aspects of pain leads to the&#xD;
      best outcomes, outlines what VA (and non-VA if preferred) services are available to Veterans,&#xD;
      explains that substances are sometimes used for pain relief, and segues into traditional&#xD;
      SBIRT. SBIRT-PM's efficacy is supported by a completed clinical trial of 101 Veterans&#xD;
      applying for service-connection for MSD, and by studies showing the efficacy of SBIRT for&#xD;
      people with risky substance use and of Motivational Interviewing for engagement in&#xD;
      non-pharmacological pain care. The study will involve a two-year period to arrange for&#xD;
      clinicians at a single &quot;hub&quot; site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with&#xD;
      SBIRT-PM, and a four-year period to conduct the clinical trial and disseminate its findings.&#xD;
      During the two-years of preparation for the clinical trial, the team will prepare SBIRT-PM&#xD;
      for implementation by establishing communication (Relational Coordination is the theoretical&#xD;
      framework) between the &quot;hub&quot; where the SBIRT-PM clinician is sited and the &quot;spoke&quot; sites,&#xD;
      establishing study-related procedures, and piloting the intervention at each of the eight VA&#xD;
      medical centers in New England. For the full clinical trial, investigators will randomize&#xD;
      1200 Veterans applying for compensation related to MSD to either SBIRT-PM or Usual Care (UC)&#xD;
      across eight VA medical centers in New England. Outcome assessment by phone will occur at 12&#xD;
      and 36-week follow-ups, and will be corroborated with other sources of information ---the&#xD;
      electronic health record and toxicology testing of nail clippings. Investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that, compared to Usual Care, SBIRT-PM will be more effective and cost-effective in improving&#xD;
      Veterans' pain and substance use. Investigators further hypothesize that a mediator of these&#xD;
      improvements will be use of non-pharmacological services, as extracted from VA records from&#xD;
      structured data fields and from narrative text in the medical record using an innovative&#xD;
      natural language processing algorithm. Screening and referral to treatment at&#xD;
      service-connection examinations can transform a widely-used point of entry to VA into a&#xD;
      health-promoting encounter.&#xD;

    <description>Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM) was developed to promote engagement in multi-modal non-pharmacological pain management among compensation-seeking Veterans with chronic pain. In SBIRT-PM, a clinician meets with the Veteran after the compensation examination to address the presenting MSD complaint. The clinician addresses Veterans' motivation for multi-modal pain care, and explains how pain can be managed using a variety of non-pharmacological pain management services. The clinician spells out how those services can be accessed at VA. Using permissive language about how pain is commonly self-medicated with substances, the clinician transitions to inquiries about use of prescription and non-prescription substances. The clinician then attempts to motivate Veterans to change their behavior if they are misusing substances. Thus, SBIRT-PM addresses the Veteran's presenting pain complaint first and nascent substance use subsequently.</description>

    <description>SBIRT-PM involves an initial telephone-delivered session followed by up to three calls to Veterans in a 12-week period to support Veteran engagement in multi-modal non-pharmacological pain care and to motivate those who misuse substances to change this problematic behavior. SBIRT-PM also includes coordination between the SBIRT-PM clinicians and the PACT nurse case manager after the initial session to support these patient outcomes.</description>
