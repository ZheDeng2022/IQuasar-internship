      Conformity to Therapy and Quality of Life in Asthma in patients living in Greece&#xD;

      Dry powder devices, available since 1970, have been developed to make inhalation simpler than&#xD;
      pMDIs and relieve the need for co-ordination of spraying and inhalation, which is&#xD;
      particularly important for patient groups such as the elderly and children. In addition, dry&#xD;
      powder devices do not contain propellant gases potentially hostile to the environment as they&#xD;
      are activated by inhalation of the patient and do not cause cold sensation upon inhalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, the combination of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting β2-inducer with an&#xD;
      inhaler is the basic treatment for asthma6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of long-acting β2-inducer (LABA) to a daily inhaled corticosteroid regimen1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improves the symptoms,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduces nightly asthma symptoms,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improves pulmonary function,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduces the use of β2-agonists for rapid action,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduces the number of seizures,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does not increase the risk of hospitalizations due to asthma,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Achieves clinical asthma control in more patients, faster and with less ICS than would&#xD;
           be required if ICS were administered alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The greater effectiveness of combination therapy has led to the development of stable&#xD;
      combination inhalers that both glucocorticosteroids and LABA (eg, fluticasone-salmeterol,&#xD;
      budesonide-formoterol stable compounds) are concomitantly conveyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stable combinations are more user-friendly for patients, potentially increasing compliance,&#xD;
      and ensure that LABA is always accompanied by glucocorticosteroid1. Of the combinations&#xD;
      available, the budesonide-formoterol combination can be used both as maintenance therapy and&#xD;
      symptom relief due to the rapid onset of formoterol compared to salmeterol. Both components&#xD;
      of the budesonide-formoterol combination when administered are helpful in enhancing&#xD;
      protection from severe seizures in patients receiving combination therapy for maintenance and&#xD;
      improve the control of asthma at relatively low ICS doses.&#xD;
