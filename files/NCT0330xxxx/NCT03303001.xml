      The shoulder pain is commonly seeing in orthopedic consultation. Many patients was affected&#xD;
      in activities of daily living and in laborer absent. One of the first treatment lines is the&#xD;
      steroid infiltration for pain relieve, however in several times is only effective by a short&#xD;
      period of time, and the symptoms usually appear again. One of the not known infiltration is&#xD;
      the high volumen infiltration in subacromial space, this treatment appears to be an effective&#xD;
      treatment for this patients.&#xD;

      Shoulder pain is a common complaint in patients of all ages and activity levels, it is&#xD;
      estimated that approximately 50% of the general population will experience at least one&#xD;
      episode of shoulder pain over the course of a year. Shoulder pain has a general prevalence of&#xD;
      6.9-34%. The shoulder is the part of the upper extremity which is formed the proximal&#xD;
      humerus, by the clavicle and the scapula, consisting in the shoulder griddle. The acromion is&#xD;
      a bony process in the upper region of the scapula that articulates medially with the clavicle&#xD;
      creating the acromioclavicular joint, at the same time forms the upper part of the shoulder&#xD;
      joint. Between the humeral head and the acromion arch there is a space, the subacromial&#xD;
      space, in which there are important structures for the proper functioning of the shoulder,&#xD;
      among them, the subacromial bursa, the tendon of the rotator cuff and the tendon of the&#xD;
      biceps brachii. The shoulder is the most mobile joint of all the body, therefore it is&#xD;
      predisposed to suffer multiple injuries, including shoulder impingement syndrome, which has&#xD;
      become one of the most frequent alterations of the musculoskeletal system. This pathology has&#xD;
      an estimated prevalence of 43.7%. It is one of the most common causes of shoulder pain in the&#xD;
      middle and advanced age patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder Impingement Syndrome is a condition in which structures in the subacromial space are&#xD;
      chronically trapped between the humeral head and the acromion. It encompasses multiple&#xD;
      conditions which includes partial rupture of the rotator cuff, rotator cuff tendinosis,&#xD;
      calcified tendinitis or subacromial bursitis. All of these conditions may have a similar&#xD;
      clinical picture and may be distinguishable by imaging of arthroscopy. The etiology of the&#xD;
      syndrome is multifactorial, divided into extrinsic factors such as tendon overload, post&#xD;
      trauma or repetitive microtraumas and intrinsic factors such as the vascularity of the&#xD;
      tendon. There are also structural factors: anatomy of the acromion, subacromial osteophytes&#xD;
      and acromioclavicular osteophytes; and functional factors: weakness of the rotator cuff,&#xD;
      altered movement of scapula and ligament laxity increased. It is the result of a reduced&#xD;
      space below the acromion. The most frequent clinical presentation will be insidious pain that&#xD;
      can be installed in a period of days to months or after a trauma that can be irradiated to&#xD;
      the side of the humerus. Usually the pain is nocturnal exacerbated by movements above the&#xD;
      head or sleep on the affected shoulder and is attenuated by keeping the affected limb at&#xD;
      rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination should assess muscular strength and ranges of motion. The general&#xD;
      inspection should assess the presence of antalgic positions, muscular atrophy, asymmetries or&#xD;
      sings of local inflammation. There is specific evidence for the evaluation of this pathology:&#xD;
      Jobe's test, to evaluate de supraspinatus muscle, in which the patient is asked to perform&#xD;
      90° shoulder flexion, 30° abduction and external rotation and maintain the position against&#xD;
      the shoulder resistance; Hawkins-Kennedy sign, for the subacromial impingement evaluation,&#xD;
      with shoulder and elbow with 90° flexion perform rapid internal rotation of the shoulder, it&#xD;
      is positive if it arouses with pain; Neer maneuver, for assessment of subacromial&#xD;
      impingement, consists of the passive elevation of the extremity in abduction, flexion and&#xD;
      internal rotation with stabilization of the scapula; Yocum´s maneuver, for assessment of&#xD;
      subacromial impingement, the patient is asked to place the hand of the explored side in the&#xD;
      contralateral shoulder and rises against resistance, it is positive if it causes pain. There&#xD;
      are multiple differential diagnoses of this pathology, among which is adhesive capsulitis,&#xD;
      cervical radiculopathy, glenohumeral instability, and acromioclavicular or glenohumeral&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis is clinical and it is corroborated by imaging studies. Shoulder radiographs&#xD;
      should be ordered in two positions to assess the morphology of the shoulder joint, to observe&#xD;
      the distance between the humeral head to the acromion (11-14mm) and the evaluation of the&#xD;
      acromioclavicular joint. Magnetic resonance imaging is the study of choice for evaluating&#xD;
      shoulder impingement syndrome, where we will observe soft tissue structures that are part of&#xD;
      the shoulder joint. Shoulder Impingement Syndrome is a pathology that causes pain and&#xD;
      limitations to perform activities of daily living and evidence suggests that this condition&#xD;
      is no self-limited, for this there are different alternatives of treatment. The aim of&#xD;
      treatment is to decrease the pain and inflammation of soft tissues involved in the&#xD;
      impingement in the subacromial space. Conservative treatment includes physical therapy,&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics (NSAIDs) and subacromial infiltration. Surgical&#xD;
      treatment includes shoulder arthroscopy to perform acromioplasty and thus release the&#xD;
      subacromial space&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Therapy Physical therapy is frequently implemented to reduce pain and improve&#xD;
      shoulder function in this pathology. This must be carried out for at least six weeks. It&#xD;
      includes cold-heat therapy, ultrasound, which has been shown to be of no benefit in the&#xD;
      treatment of shoulder impingement and structural shoulder exercises, the aim of these&#xD;
      treatment Is to reduce subacromial mechanical stress, to improve movement patterns and&#xD;
      strengthening muscle fibers and thus prevent relapses, which have shown improvement in pain&#xD;
      and function. Added to this it is recommended to avoid activities that are carried out above&#xD;
      the head until the symptoms decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics It is a frequent therapy in the treatment of this&#xD;
      pathology. The effectiveness of NSAIDs in the treatment of shoulder impingement has not been&#xD;
      demonstrated and potential complications have been observed with the use of long-term NSAIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder Subacromial Injection It is a technique that consists of the direct application of&#xD;
      an active principle in the subacromial space with the objective to suppress the inflammation&#xD;
      and to diminish the pain. There are studies that show that there is a variation in the type&#xD;
      and dose of steroids used in infiltration, in addition to that the number infiltrations also&#xD;
      varied. Two studies conclude that there is an improvement in pain and range of motion with&#xD;
      the use of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Treatment Surgical treatment is indicated in patients who fail conservative&#xD;
      treatment and continuous pain or in patients with complete rupture of the rotator cuff.&#xD;
      Actually subacromial decompression with acromioplasty, osteophyte resection and bursectomy is&#xD;
      performed by arthroscopy, in addition, to being able to observe the possible damage to the&#xD;
      tendon of the rotator cuff, which, if present, can be repaired. It is currently mentioned&#xD;
      that there is limited benefit with the conservative treatment established in the impingement&#xD;
      syndrome, which is why new treatment options are being developed. A new treatment option is&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided high-volume injection (HVIGI) in patients with shoulder impingement&#xD;
      syndrome. Ultrasound-guided high-volume injection is a recent technique that involves&#xD;
      injecting a high volume of fluid including a long-acting anesthetic and corticosteroids,&#xD;
      guided by imaging (ultrasound). This technique has been used successfully and with good&#xD;
      results in patellar tendinopathies, Achilles tendinopathies and subacromial impingement. High&#xD;
      volume injection acts in different ways: breaks adhesions, stripping effect, stretch, has&#xD;
      compression effect and also removes pain and promotes the healing of tendinopathy. Each&#xD;
      injected component has different effect: the high volume breaks the adhesions, stretch and&#xD;
      has drag effect; the long-acting anesthetic removes pain and the steroid prevents the&#xD;
      formation of adhesions and promotes tendon healing&#xD;
