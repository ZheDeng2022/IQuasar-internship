  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe haemophilia and subsequent arthropathy result in joint pain, disability and impaired&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. Improvements in haemophilia care over the last decades might&#xD;
      lead to expectation of a near-normal quality of life for adults with haemophilia. However,&#xD;
      little is known about the impact of haemophilia and its treatment on social functioning. A&#xD;
      study based on a national US cohort of 141 young men (18-34 y.o.) showed that, compared to&#xD;
      the general US population, this cohort experienced social burdens such as unemployment and&#xD;
      lower high-school graduation rates. Another study conducted in the framework of the HERO&#xD;
      (Haemophilia Experiences, Results and Opportunities) international initiative showed that a&#xD;
      majority of the 230 young adults aged 18-30 years (including 16 French participants) were&#xD;
      employed at least part-time (62%) and most of them reported that haemophilia has had a&#xD;
      negative impact on employment (76%) which was reported as moderate or very large by 47% of&#xD;
      the participants. The replicability of these results could be limited by the specific&#xD;
      socio-economic national context. In France, a survey was conducted in 2008 to assess quality&#xD;
      of life and its determinants in children, adolescents and adults with moderate and severe&#xD;
      haemophilia. Descriptive results on the socio-economic characteristics of the included adults&#xD;
      showed that 51.3% of them had access to higher education (which was higher than the observed&#xD;
      rate in the French general population in 2005, i.e. 32.5%), and that 52.1% were employed&#xD;
      among whom 44.3% had an at-risk activity. In spite of these results which were presented in a&#xD;
      descriptive report by the InVS (Institut de veille sanitaire - French Institute for Public&#xD;
      Health Surveillance), some limitations could be discussed:&#xD;

      The principal objective of the present project is to assess occupational issues in an&#xD;
      exhaustive national cohort of persons with severe haemophilia compared to the national&#xD;
      population in order to describe the impact of severe haemophilia on the occupational&#xD;
      integration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed objectives are mentioned hereinbelow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess occupational issues in adults with severe haemophilia in France&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the impact of the changes of the context of life over the last decades in the&#xD;
           new generation of adults with severe haemophilia in France&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare occupational outcomes between adults with severe haemophilia and the general&#xD;
           population in France&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify individual characteristics (socio-demographics, clinical and&#xD;
           psycho-behavioural) associated with occupational issues in adults with severe&#xD;
           haemophilia in France&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare occupational issues between adults with severe haemophilia and adults with&#xD;
           others severe chronic childhood diseases in France to identify common and&#xD;
           haemophilia-specific issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adults (18-65 y.o.) participating in the FranceCoag cohort, which includes more than&#xD;
      1,500 French adults with severe haemophilia followed-up in 34 Haemophilia Treatment Centres,&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in the study. These adults will be identified through the&#xD;
      database of the FranceCoag cohort, and will be invited to participate through the post by the&#xD;
      physician who follows them up in the Haemophilia Treatment Centre. If they agree to&#xD;
      participate, they will be asked to fill a self-administered questionnaire in. This&#xD;
      questionnaire will include items focusing on the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  occupational outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  access to higher education and high-school graduation,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  age at the start of working life,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  degree of employment (unemployment / part-time employment / full-time employment),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  sheltered employment,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  job security (temporary / permanent contract / self-employment),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  type of job (using the International Standard Classification of Occupations)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  socio-demographic outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  age&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  living with a partner&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  having dependent children&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  psycho-behavioural outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  depressive symptomatology (using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression&#xD;
                (CES-D) scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  quality of life (using the generic scale 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) and the&#xD;
                haemophilia-specific scale Haem-A-QoL)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  anxiety (using the Strate-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  coping strategies (using the BriefCOPE)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  perceived impact of haemophilia on employment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  participating in therapeutic education sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  member of the Association française des hémophiles (AFH)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes will be recorded via the FranceCoag cohort database (type of haemophilia,&#xD;
      treatment, presence of an inhibitor, comorbidities as HIV and HCV infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational outcomes of the participants will be described, and compared to the French&#xD;
      national population. Expected distributions of the outcomes will be established by using data&#xD;
      from the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies. Observed and expected&#xD;
      distributions will be compared. The modulating role of individual characteristics (including&#xD;
      the period of birth, the presence of an inhibitor, comorbidities as HIV and HCV infections)&#xD;
      in occupational issues will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this project will establish an updated picture of the occupational situation&#xD;
      of French adults with severe haemophilia. By comparing the evolution of the occupational&#xD;
      situation among them with the evolution in adults from the general population, the&#xD;
      investigators will be able to assess the possibly different impact of the changes of the&#xD;
      socio-economic context on the occupational situation of adults with severe haemophilia. The&#xD;
      results will also establish a new picture of the occupational situation for the new&#xD;
      generation of adults who was not concerned by the survey carried out about ten years ago.&#xD;
      This sub-group is of particular interest as the impact of the disease on their life might&#xD;
      have been different (major therapeutic progresses, no exposition to transfusion-transmitted&#xD;
      infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Via the French haemophilia society (AFH) which is a partner of the present project, the&#xD;
      results from the objectives 1 to 4 will be used for the education, training and awareness of&#xD;
      patient resources, for the development of therapeutic patient education sessions focused on&#xD;
      occupational issues, and for the drawing up of a brochure intended for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survivors of childhood leukemia from the French LEA cohort who present a higher rate of&#xD;
      employment than the general population, but a lower access to a steady job could be an&#xD;
      interesting comparative group for the fifth objective. As numerous actions are proposed to&#xD;
      facilitate the occupational integration of survivors of cancer, the identification of the&#xD;
      haemophilia-specific difficulties could help the decisions-makers to allocate means according&#xD;
      to the specific needs of the persons with haemophilia.&#xD;
