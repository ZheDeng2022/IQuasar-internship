  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal illness contributes significantly to the global burden of disease. Cancer,&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease and diverticulosis result in substantial patients suffering and&#xD;
      health care expenditures. The causes of colorectal diseases remain unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New data suggests that intestinal bacteria may play a major role in the causal chain for many&#xD;
      diseases, and the research on the microbial environment in the colon in relation to bowel&#xD;
      disease is increasingly intense although the possibility for analysis of the composition of&#xD;
      bacteria in the gut has so far been limited. However, new analytic methods based on powerful&#xD;
      DNA sequencing, opens new opportunities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the surgical clinic at Danderyds hospital, Stockholm, 2500 colonoscopies are performed per&#xD;
      year. The investigators have created a biobank with mucosal samples from patient's large&#xD;
      bowel and will consecutively include all patients scheduled for colonoscopy during one year&#xD;
      (N=2500). Biopsies from the colonic mucosa will be analysed in collaboration with the&#xD;
      Clinical Genomics, Science for Life laboratory (Karolinska Institutet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, the association between specific bacteria and colorectal disease will be&#xD;
      investigated (hypothesis generating phase). In Phase 2, the investigators aim to identify&#xD;
      specific bacterial biomarkers that could be used as screening tools, and lay the ground for&#xD;
      future new treatments for colorectal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection and new treatment regimes would result in both significant patient benefits&#xD;
      as well as reductions in healthcare costs.&#xD;

      Project description Overall hypothesis: The colonic microbial environment correlates with&#xD;
      bowel pathology and is relevant to development and progress of colorectal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions and outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1 (year 1, hypothesis generating phase), the association between specific bacteria&#xD;
      and the following diseases will be investigated: colorectal disease (colorectal cancer&#xD;
      /polyps, adenomas (pre-cancerous lesions), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and&#xD;
      diverticulosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is the microenvironment of the gut mucosa in and around tissue with adenomas/colorectal&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma, IBD and diverticulosis colonized with a bacterial set different from&#xD;
           healthy mucosa?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does age, sex and life/dietary habits impact different types of bacterial composition?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2 (year 2-3), we aim to identify specific bacterial biomarkers that could be used as&#xD;
      screening tools, and lay the ground for future new treatments for colorectal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Are specific bacterial sets associated with early formation of adenoma and colorectal&#xD;
           cancer?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can these bacteria be used as faecal biomarkers in a colorectal screening program for&#xD;
           cancer or be identified by serological biomarkers?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Can the identification of specific bacteria lead to further studies on the possible&#xD;
           genesis of the emergence and growth of colorectal cancer?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Are specific bacterial sets associated with IBD and diverticulosis and can those be used&#xD;
           as faecal or serological biomarkers for disease?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can treatment of these bacteria or their metabolites reduce the incidence of morbidity&#xD;
           in relation to IBD or diverticulitis (inflammation in diverticula)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: (2017) -2018. During one year, all patients scheduled for colonoscopy at Danderyd's&#xD;
      Hospital (sample size = 2500 patients) will be consecutively invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study and to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Bleeding risk (defined as a International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt; 1.6),&#xD;
      severe dementia or inability to understand information and make an informed decision about&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who agree to participate will receive an information letter about the study by mail&#xD;
      (2-3 weeks before colonoscopy). In addition all patients will also receive a phone call as a&#xD;
      reminder of the study. Before bowel preparation, patients will be asked to leave a faeces&#xD;
      sample that will be saved for culture. Study participants will also be asked to complete a&#xD;
      validated questionnaire on medical history, previous illnesses, diet, lifestyle habits,&#xD;
      previous colonoscopies and antibiotic treatment. Immediately before the colonoscopy&#xD;
      examination, four blood samples will be taken: Two for the analysis of HbA1c, haemoglobin and&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and two for storage at hospital's biobank robot for later analysis&#xD;
      of biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During colonoscopy, tissue samples in addition to routine diagnostic tissue samples will be&#xD;
      taken from the colonic mucosa:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Two biopsies (one for DNA sequencing, one for cultivation) will be taken from a healthy&#xD;
           part of colonic mucosa (preferably in the first part of the colon) in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Four biopsies, two (DNA + culture) from pathologic colonic mucosa (polyp (adenomas) /&#xD;
           colorectal cancer / IBD/diverticulosis) and two (DNA + culture) in the nearby area of&#xD;
           the pathologic mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: 2018-2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Detection and investigation of biologically important bacteria and their metabolites&#xD;
           (metagenomics and metabolomics (studies of chemical processes involving metabolites))&#xD;
           will be carried out for information about specific bacterial genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This data will then be statistically analysed for any association with various&#xD;
           colorectal conditions, adjusting for confounding and exposures available in medical&#xD;
           records and in the patient questionnaire (See below). These analyses will provide us&#xD;
           with important novel information about the pathogenic mechanisms of relevance for&#xD;
           development of cancer and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Based on these expected findings of specific bacterial compositions in relation to&#xD;
           colonic disease, specific disease mechanisms can begin to be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The possibilities of using disease-specific bacterial compositions as a clinical marker&#xD;
           of colonic disease will also be explored. During this sub-study we will look at the&#xD;
           association between mucosal microbiota and the microbiota in the feces. Thus, stool&#xD;
           samples from all patients will be will be used to explore whether these correspond to&#xD;
           the bacterial composition of the colonic mucosa sampled from the pathologic and healthy&#xD;
           intestinal area. In addition, serological biomarkers will be examined in relation to&#xD;
           specific bacterial compositions in mucosal samples from pathologic mucosa in all study&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples and analysis The samples are first stored and recorded in the Danderyd Hospital&#xD;
      biobank and will thereafter be sent for DNA analysis at the Science for Life laboratory,&#xD;
      Karolinska Institutet. The DNA analysis (primary variables) relates to massive parallel&#xD;
      sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene that gives information about the composition of bacteria in&#xD;
      the sample and the relative amount of bacteria down to the gene level. The results are&#xD;
      presented as a diversity index (Shannon diversity index or alpha diversity within the same&#xD;
      sample) and Unifrac analysis based on the software QIIME. The latter analysis shows&#xD;
      differences in bacterial composition between samples - so-called beta diversity. In addition&#xD;
      to16S sequencing, so called metagenomic sequencing will be performed on selected samples -&#xD;
      with this assay one can also get information about the specific bacterial gene content and&#xD;
      thus gain knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms with relevance to include cancer development.&#xD;
      The validated questionnaire of diet and lifestyle habits will be analysed in relation to the&#xD;
      microbial environment (dependent variable in this laboratory analysis).&#xD;
