  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multiple dose, open-label pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy adult&#xD;
      male and female subjects to determine and compare plasma, epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and&#xD;
      alveolar macrophage (AM) concentrations of ETX2514 and sulbactam in healthy adult subjects&#xD;
      after intravenous infusion of ETX2514 1.0 g given concurrently with intravenous sulbactam 1.0&#xD;
      g, administered every 6 hours with each infused over 3 hours, for 3 consecutive doses&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood samples for determining plasma concentrations of ETX2514 and sulbactam will be&#xD;
      collected within 5 minutes prior to and at 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 2.95, 3.05, 3.25, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0 and&#xD;
      6.0 hours after start of the third dose (last dose) administered on Day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will undergo one standardized bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in&#xD;
      the outpatient bronchoscopy suite at 1.0, 2.5, 3.25, 4.0, or 6.0 hours after start of the&#xD;
      infusion of the third dose of ETX2514 and sulbactam (6 subjects per timepoint) on Day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed throughout the study by adverse event monitoring, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests, ECG, physical examination, and vital sign monitoring.&#xD;
