      The goal of this pilot imaging study is to evaluate the visibility of marking the interface&#xD;
      between the pancreas and duodenum with TraceIT Tissue Marker. Patients with a pathologically&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of BR/LAPC (borderline resectable/locally advanced pancreatic cancer)&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinomas indicated for neo-adjuvant image-guided radiotherapy with SBRT&#xD;
      (stereotactic body radiation therapy) will be enrolled. This study will thus set the stage&#xD;
      for further investigations using the TraceIT Tissue Marker to avoid duodenum toxicity with&#xD;
      imaging localization, enabling further dose intensification with SBRT or IMRT to improve the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in BR/LAPC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is now the third leading cause of cancer-related death, with&#xD;
      a devastating 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of nearly 8%, despite having the 12th most&#xD;
      common incidence of all malignancies in the United States. One-third of patients will present&#xD;
      with borderline resectable or unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer (BR/LAPC). In&#xD;
      the cases of LAPC, chemotherapy with or without radiation may be recommended to improve the&#xD;
      quality of life by relieving symptoms and extending survival. Despite aggressive combined&#xD;
      modality therapy, the median survival remains between 9 and 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current guidelines for the management of BR/LAPC patients include single- or multi-agent&#xD;
      chemotherapy or chemoradiation (CRT) in sequence with chemotherapy. Results of studies&#xD;
      comparing chemotherapy alone to CRT for patients with BR/LAPC are mixed. The importance of&#xD;
      local control or delaying local progression on improving morbidity and possibly mortality in&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer is supported by autopsy data demonstrating that 30% of&#xD;
      patients die of locally destructive disease. It follows that in the cases of LAPC, advanced&#xD;
      radiation therapy techniques using dose-escalation with intensity modulated radiotherapy&#xD;
      (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) are potential strategies to improve local&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A consistent challenge to dose-escalation with IMRT (intensity modulation radiation therapy)&#xD;
      or SBRT is the sensitivity of the surrounding gastrointestinal organs, particularly the small&#xD;
      bowel which is directly adjacent to the head of the pancreas head of the pancreas (HOP). For&#xD;
      BR/LAPC patients treated with CRT, advances in image guidance have provided the opportunity&#xD;
      to safely deliver higher biologically effective doses of radiation therapy using IMRT of &gt;70&#xD;
      Gy (57.25 Gy in 25 fractions, BED 70.36 Gy) compared to standard fractionation regimens&#xD;
      (50.40 Gy in 28 fractions or 50 Gy in 25 fractions, BED 59.47 Gy and 60 Gy, respectively).&#xD;
      Those patients who underwent dose-escalated CRT with BED&gt;70 Gy, did have a superior OS&#xD;
      compared to those receiving BED&lt;70 Gy, supporting the utility of dose-escalation in improving&#xD;
      long-term outcomes. SBRT involves a short course of radiation therapy, five fractions or&#xD;
      less, and has demonstrated higher rates of local control compared to CRT in other disease&#xD;
      sites. Early studies evaluating SBRT for pancreatic cancer utilized single fractions of 25&#xD;
      Gy, resulting in local control rates of 100% at 1 year but unacceptably high rates of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicity. More recently, hypofractionated SBRT (33 Gy total, 6.6 Gy daily&#xD;
      fractions) has been evaluated and utilized by our group in an effort to reduce the toxicity&#xD;
      of therapy, with results demonstrating nearly 80% rate of freedom from local progression at&#xD;
      one year and an acceptable 11% long-term gastrointestinal toxicity. Outcomes with SBRT are&#xD;
      thus promising; however, higher local control rates with dose-escalation may be achievable,&#xD;
      but current practice is limited due to risks of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this pilot imaging study is to evaluate the visibility of marking the interface&#xD;
      between the pancreas and duodenum with TraceIT Tissue Marker. Patients with a pathologically&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of BR/LAPC pancreatic adenocarcinomas indicated for neo-adjuvant&#xD;
      image-guided radiotherapy with SBRT will be enrolled. This study will thus set the stage for&#xD;
      further investigations using the TraceIT Tissue Marker to avoid duodenum toxicity with&#xD;
      imaging localization, enabling further dose intensification with SBRT or IMRT to improve the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in BR/LAPC.&#xD;
