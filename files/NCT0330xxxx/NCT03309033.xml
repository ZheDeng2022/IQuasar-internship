      The goal of this study is to extend follow up of women who participated in the Costa Rica&#xD;
      Vaccine Trial (CVT) and received one dose or two doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV)&#xD;
      vaccine, along with a group of women who received three doses. It also studies the stability&#xD;
      of HPV defenses in these groups of women for up to 15 years after initial vaccination.&#xD;
      Studying samples of blood in the laboratory may provide information on how long one, two, and&#xD;
      three doses of the vaccine provide protection against HPV. The results of this study may also&#xD;
      help researchers learn whether one dose of HPV vaccine is enough to protect against HPV.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the change in antibody levels between years 10 and 15. II. Estimate the&#xD;
      proportion of individuals who become seronegative (i.e.: serorevert) between years 10 and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a short questionnaire regarding risk factors for HPV infection and undergo&#xD;
      collection of blood samples for testing HPV16 and HPV18 levels at years 13 and 15 after&#xD;
      receiving initial vaccination.&#xD;

    <description>Changes in the level of antibodies and geometric mean titers will be assessed. Heterogeneity across the women under study will be assessed and reported. For each individual, will measure the average change in human papillomavirus (HPV)16 (and HPV18) antibody levels between years 10 and 15. For each individual, will obtain this estimate by regressing log (titer) of the antibody levels on time. Will then calculate the mean and 95% confidence interval of this regression coefficient for each dose regimen (i.e., 1, 2, and 3 doses separately). Will also report 95% confidence intervals for these estimates.</description>
