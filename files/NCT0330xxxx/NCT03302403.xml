    <textblock>
      A single arm, open-label pilot study is designed to determine the safety, efficacy and&#xD;
      cytokinetics of CAR T cells in patients with malignant tumors with positive antigen targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAR T cells are genetically engineered to express single-chain variable fragment (scFv)&#xD;
      targeting indication-specific antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational CAR T cells and proposed indications are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAR-CD19 T cells for B cell leukaemia/lymphoma; CAR-BCMA T cells for myeloma; CAR-GPC3 T cell&#xD;
      for hepatocellular carcinoma; CAR-CLD18 T cells for pancreatic carcinoma and adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      of esophagogastric junction.&#xD;

      This study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and engraftment potential of&#xD;
      lentivirus-transduced CAR T cells in patients with malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the safety and tolerability of CAR T cells (autologous T cells transduced with&#xD;
           chimeric antigen receptors recognizing CD19, BCMA, GPC3 and Claudin18.2) in patients&#xD;
           with malignant tumors (B-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma, myeloma, hepatocellular&#xD;
           carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Observe the cytokinetics of CAR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Observe the efficacy of CAR T cells in patients with malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Make an evaluation on the distribution and in vivo survival of CAR T cells in targeted&#xD;
           tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Observe the immunogenicity of CAR T cells, and determine if there are anti-scFv cellular&#xD;
           immune response and anti-scFv humoral immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Observe the changes of cell subsets for CAR T cells against T cells (Tcm, central memory&#xD;
           T lymphocytes; Tem, effector memory T lymphocytes; Treg, regulatory T-lymphocytes).&#xD;
