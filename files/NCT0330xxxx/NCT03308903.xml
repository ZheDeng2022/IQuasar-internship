      A common condition associated with ageing is sarcopenia, which is a progressive decrease in&#xD;
      muscle mass. Sarcopenia is associated with adverse outcomes including increased mortality,&#xD;
      and places a major burden on healthcare spending, with the annual cost of sarcopenia in the&#xD;
      United States exceeding that of osteoporosis and hip fracture. In the UK, the prevalence of&#xD;
      sarcopenia in community-dwelling older people has been estimated at 5% for men and 8% for&#xD;
      women. Current guidelines for sarcopenia diagnosis require muscle mass to be measured using&#xD;
      costly devices such as Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      (MRI). Previous research has found strong relationships between the sit-to-stand (STS) test&#xD;
      and both muscle mass and muscle strength. This pilot study aims to examine this relationship&#xD;
      in community-dwelling older people to develop predictive equations for initial screening of&#xD;
      sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty subjects will be tested using the diagnostic criteria developed by the European Working&#xD;
      Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP). Muscle mass will be measured using the DXA and&#xD;
      diagnostic ultrasound. Muscle strength will be measured using isokinetic dynamometer,&#xD;
      handgrip dynamometry, and hand-held dynamometry. Functional performance will be measured&#xD;
      using the Timed-up-and-Go and gait velocity, and the STS. Subjects will perform two variants&#xD;
      of the STSÍ¾ the five times STS (5STS), which requires subjects to perform five consecutive&#xD;
      STS movements as quick as possible, and the 30-second STS (30STS), which requires subjects to&#xD;
      perform as many STS movements as possible in 30 seconds. All testing will be completed in a&#xD;
      single session lasting 90 minutes for each subject. Testing will be performed at the&#xD;
      University of Bedfordshire Polhill Campus. Subject recruitment will be recruited using&#xD;
      advertisement posters and word of mouth.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Loss of function and mobility becomes an increasing concern as we age. Life expectancy is&#xD;
      continuing to increase, which in turn leads to age-related diseases and syndromes becoming&#xD;
      more common, complex and costly. Sarcopenia is the deficiency of muscle and this refers to&#xD;
      the gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength that occurs with advancing age This&#xD;
      age-related disease is now understood as a major clinical problem for the elderly and it is&#xD;
      becoming a public health issue in today's society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) has developed a clinical&#xD;
      and practical definition and a diagnostic criterion for age-related sarcopenia. They define&#xD;
      sarcopenia as &quot;a syndrome characterised by progressive and generalised loss of skeletal&#xD;
      muscle mass and strength with a risk of adverse outcomes&quot;. The EWGSOP further develop their&#xD;
      definition of sarcopenia into two different categories and three different stages. The two&#xD;
      categories are known as primary sarcopenia and secondary sarcopenia. Primary or age-related&#xD;
      sarcopenia is when there is no other cause evident except ageing. Whereas secondary&#xD;
      sarcopenia is when there are one or more other causes, such as activity-related,&#xD;
      disease-related or nutrition-related. The three stages of sarcopenia reflect the severity of&#xD;
      the condition; these are known as presarcopenia, sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia. The&#xD;
      presarcopenia stage is described as having low muscle mass, without influencing muscle&#xD;
      strength or physical performance. The sarcopenia stage is indicated by again having low&#xD;
      muscle mass plus either having low muscle strength or poor physical performance. The severe&#xD;
      sarcopenia stage is characterised by meeting all three criteria of the definition; low muscle&#xD;
      mass, low muscle strength and poor physical performance. The EWGSOP specify that the&#xD;
      measurable variables of sarcopenia are muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance.&#xD;
      The challenge they raised is the difficulty determining which methods are best to accurately&#xD;
      measure these variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EWGSOP indicate that muscle mass is best measured using body imaging techniques such as&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computer-tomography (CT). Both MRI and CT scans are known&#xD;
      as the gold standards for measuring muscle mass within research. However, they are costly&#xD;
      procedures that are not always freely available. Muscle mass can also be measured through&#xD;
      dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), for determining the presence of and formulating a&#xD;
      diagnosis of sarcopenia. DEXA is based on the measurement of X-ray transmission crossing&#xD;
      human tissues. The radiation energies produced by the DEXA are variably attenuated, either&#xD;
      scattered or absorbed, by the anatomical structures within the body, dependent on the&#xD;
      intensity of the energy and the density and thickness of the human tissues. DEXA enables&#xD;
      measurements of fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM) and bone mineral content (BMC) and can assess&#xD;
      body masses and bone mineral density (BMD) on a regional and a whole-body basis, whilst&#xD;
      exposing only minimal radiation to the patient. According to the EWGSOP, DEXA is a preferred&#xD;
      alternative method for measuring muscle mass within research and clinical use. However, it&#xD;
      has been reported that measures of muscle mass from DEXA scans do not seem to be accurate,&#xD;
      with a site-specific assessment of loss of muscle mass, using ultrasound-based assessment&#xD;
      suggested. Ultrasound has been reported to be an effective and non-invasive tool to determine&#xD;
      muscle wasting, potentially leading to an earlier and more accurate detection of sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of muscle mass are not as good a predictor of physical capability as muscle&#xD;
      strength. Lower limb muscle strength is more relevant for gait and physical function than&#xD;
      upper limb muscle strength. However, the EWGSOP recognise handgrip strength as the most&#xD;
      widely used method for measuring muscle strength to screen for sarcopenia. Handgrip strength&#xD;
      is strongly related with lower extremity muscle power, knee extension torque and calf&#xD;
      cross-sectional muscle area. Consequently, it has been documented that muscle power&#xD;
      deteriorates earlier and quicker than muscle strength in older populations. Therefore, a&#xD;
      measure of muscle power could be more beneficial in the diagnosis of sarcopenia as older&#xD;
      people lose power quicker than they do strength. Isokinetic dynamometers (IKD) are a commonly&#xD;
      used tool and are recognised as a gold standard measure of muscle power and strength. IKD's&#xD;
      measure force dynamically through a specified range of motion whilst allowing the velocity of&#xD;
      the movement to be controlled and measured. It is recognised as a popular method to assess&#xD;
      muscle function in both clinical and research settings. However, due to IKD's not being&#xD;
      portable and are not always accessible, there has been a rise in the use of hand-held&#xD;
      dynamometry (HHD) to assess isometric muscle strength. It has been reported that HHD is a&#xD;
      simple and inexpensive and a reliable and valid assessment tool for measuring strength,&#xD;
      particularity in older adults. The use of isometric strength testing may be more suitable for&#xD;
      older adults if there is a limited range of joint motion and if joint pain is prevalent,&#xD;
      concentric actions may be challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of using physical performance measures within clinical geriatrics as well as&#xD;
      ageing research has also been documented. There are many tests of physical performance that&#xD;
      have been validated and are widely used. The EWGSOP identified popular methods for evaluating&#xD;
      physical performance. These include the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), usual gait&#xD;
      speed (GS), the timed get-up-and-go (TUG) test and the stair climb power test. The ability to&#xD;
      rise from a chair has been used in clinical evaluations and on-going assessments for decades.&#xD;
      This everyday task was standardised and developed into the 'timed-stands' test. This test was&#xD;
      initially designed to measure functional strength of the lower extremities as participants&#xD;
      completed 10 timed-stands. Variations of this sit-to-stand (STS) task have evolved and now&#xD;
      one of the most commonly used tools for clinical evaluation of physical performance is the&#xD;
      Five-Times-Sit-To-Stand (5STS) test. The 5STS, requires the participant to stand up and sit&#xD;
      down from a chair five times, with performance taken as the time to complete the test. The&#xD;
      STS task was modified further, with a standardised 'time' protocol of 30 seconds (30sSTS),&#xD;
      requiring the participant to stand up and sit down as many times as possible within 30&#xD;
      seconds. They reasoned the use of the 30sSTS instead of participants performing a&#xD;
      predetermined number of repetitions (e.g. 5STS, 10STS) to assess a wider range of ability.&#xD;
      Moreover, the 5STS and potentially even the 10STS can be recorded as the participant performs&#xD;
      the 30sSTS. In addition to functional performance, the STS task could also be used to&#xD;
      estimate muscle power and even muscle mass. In a recent study, an accurate estimation of&#xD;
      lower-limb muscle power was obtained using a simple regression equation in which only body&#xD;
      weight and the number of STS performed in 20 seconds, of a 30-second trial were used. Another&#xD;
      study had also reported a good estimation of muscle mass obtained from an MRI, again using a&#xD;
      simple regression equation in which only three basic variables were used, namely leg length,&#xD;
      body mass and the time taken for a single STS movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aim The aim of this study is to validate the use of the Sit-To-Stand task as a&#xD;
      measure of muscle mass, muscle strength and power and physical performance in screening for&#xD;
      sarcopenia compared to gold standard measures, in older adults aged 65 years and over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Suitability of the Sit-To-Stand task as a measure of muscle mass in comparison to the&#xD;
           gold standard equivalents, the dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan and diagnostic&#xD;
           ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Suitability of the Sit-To-Stand task as a measure of muscle strength and power in&#xD;
           comparison to the gold standard equivalents, the isokinetic dynamometer the hand-grip&#xD;
           strength dynamometer and the hand-held dynamometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Suitability of the Sit-To-Stand task as a measure of physical performance in comparison&#xD;
           to other well used physical function tests, the Timed-Up-and-Go and gait.&#xD;
