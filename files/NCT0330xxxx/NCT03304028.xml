    <textblock>
      Early detection of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients is&#xD;
      important to quickly trigger treatment and reduce respiratory damage. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that using home-based connected devices (CDs) in educated patients applying&#xD;
      Cumulative sum charts (CUSUM) to monitor physiological parameters (PP) and patients'&#xD;
      perception reported (PRP), will allow early detection of PEx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to study clinical validity of using CDs and evaluate adherence and satisfaction in&#xD;
      CF patients and teams&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: 3 phase multicenter study in 36 CF patients aged &gt;=12 years. Phase 1, patients are&#xD;
      equipped during 3 months with CDs. PP and PRP to estimate CUSUM parameters are collected. In&#xD;
      phase 2, patient's personalized educational plan to manage alerts is built. In phase 3, PP&#xD;
      and PRP are collected during 12 months. Clinical validity, change in patients clinical data,&#xD;
      quality of Life/Anxiety-Depression/Satisfaction, patients and teams' acceptance and adherence&#xD;
      are assessed.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) are the major cause of lung function decline in Cystic Fibrosis&#xD;
      (CF) patients leading to respiratory failure. Identifying warning signs of PEx is a priority&#xD;
      to trigger early treatment and reduce respiratory damage. Some authors tried to define scores&#xD;
      based on symptoms to standardize treatment. However, lack of consensus led the&#xD;
      Euro-Care-CF-Working-Group to recommend the use of medical antibiotic treatment decision (or&#xD;
      treatment modification) associated with PEx-like symptoms as best definition of PEx for&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A DELPHI study identified 10 signs frequently perceived by patients and 10 most often cited&#xD;
      indicators by caregivers. Two studies have shown that a combination of physiological&#xD;
      parameters (PP) and patient reported perceptions (PRP) such as weight loss, decreased&#xD;
      spirometry , increased cough or increased sputum production reported daily, help diagnose PEx&#xD;
      episodes and trigger early treatment. Clinical observations show that changes in PP and PRP&#xD;
      related to PEx differ according to age and degree of lung function impairment. Currently,&#xD;
      patients with CF do not routinely monitor their lung function at home, nor do they&#xD;
      objectively track PP or PRP. Consequently, CF PEx can be diagnosed late when symptoms&#xD;
      progress, in which they seek medical care. Thus, development of an effective approach that&#xD;
      helps to monitor daily indicators of PEx to early identification and treatment is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Home monitoring of PEx symptoms Several studies have been conducted with daily&#xD;
           monitoring of PEx symptoms. Most of these studies monitored one or two respiratory&#xD;
           parameters with data transmission to the medical staff who decide what course of action&#xD;
           to take. In addition, these studies used for each parameter the same alert limit for all&#xD;
           patients, as it is known that patients with CF have different thresholds of these&#xD;
           indicators,some may present more frequently than others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CUSUM to monitor indicators of pulmonary exacerbation The use of statistical process&#xD;
           control (SPC) shows promise for monitoring indicators of CF PEx and rapidly detecting&#xD;
           unwanted changes in these indicators. SPC uses rigorous time-series analysis methods,&#xD;
           with results reported as a graph of changes in indicators over time[9]. Moreover, SPC&#xD;
           can help to determine whether these changes are real (related to a causative factor) or&#xD;
           merely a manifestation of natural variability. Among SPC, cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart&#xD;
           has been found effective for measuring and monitoring healthcare outcome. It detects&#xD;
           changes rapidly, and can identify small shifts. Connected devices software programming&#xD;
           integrating CUSUM alert limits can help to determine whether the changes in PP and PRT&#xD;
           are due to real PEx episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY HYPOTHESIS The investigators hypothesize that using home-based CDs applying CUSUM with&#xD;
      patient's personalized alert limits to monitor physiological data and PRP combined with&#xD;
      patient education allows early detection of PEx. Studying alerts can help clinicians to&#xD;
      develop a patient's personalized educational plan allowing patients better management of PEx&#xD;
      including ability to make informed choices. This study aims to assess clinical validity of&#xD;
      using different CDs, acceptance and adherence of patients of data collection of physiological&#xD;
      data and PRPs, and acceptance by the clinical teams of this process of care. It will lead a&#xD;
      larger trial aiming to evaluate efficacy of this process of care on patient's clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A 3 phase multi-center prospective longitudinal pilot study will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Phase 1- Baseline data collection Clinic staff will email all patients or parents&#xD;
      (pediatric settings) to introduce the study. A qualitative interview with 10 patients who&#xD;
      declined to participate in the study will be conducted to identify the reason of refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      M0: Inclusion visit: the inclusion will be proposed at a follow-up visit by the child's or&#xD;
      adult's referring doctor. A written informed consent form will be obtained from all adults or&#xD;
      both parents of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life and Anxiety-Depression will be collected using the HADS and CFQ-R scale Each&#xD;
      included patient will be equipped with CDs-spirometer, oxymeter, scale and watch During 3&#xD;
      months: Baseline data of 14 warning indicators of Pex will be collected during 3 non&#xD;
      consecutive days a week using the CDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number and time of acute PEx, FEV1, weight, respiratory symptoms and antibiotic treatments&#xD;
      prescribed will be collected at the end of the period from the medical patient chart in the&#xD;
      CF centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2- statistical analysis and patient education Statistical analysis of the data&#xD;
           collected in phase 1 will take place to calculate the CUSUM parameters. Alert parameters&#xD;
           for each patient are then fixed. An educational visit will be scheduled with patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3- CDs use and personalized care PP and PRP will be continuously collected during&#xD;
           12 months using CDs. If alerts occur, patients will be informed by email or SMS, with&#xD;
           data transmission to the medical team who will not interfere. Patients should apply the&#xD;
           shared action plan they learned. Quality of Life and Anxiety-Depression will be&#xD;
           collected using the HADS and CFQ-R scale. Number and time of acute PEx, FEV1, weight,&#xD;
           respiratory symptoms and antibiotic treatments prescribed during the period will be&#xD;
           collected at the end of the period from the medical patient chart in the CF centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Phase 3: Semi-structured interviews will be completed with the 30&#xD;
      patients/parents and 5 medical teams to explore confidence on the CDs, impact on the&#xD;
      doctor-patient relationship, change in the workload of medical team…etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect a better quality of life for patients, and that their&#xD;
      anxiety-depression has not increased or rather decreased. For the clinical teams, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to demonstrate that the use of CDs at home by educated patients is&#xD;
      acceptable in their daily workload, and satisfying regarding the application of the shared&#xD;
      action plan by the patient. Unlike other studies, patients are empowered to initiate actions&#xD;
      when alerted by variations of the parameters. If they don't follow the action plan decided&#xD;
      with the clinical teams, the treatment of PEx might not be earlier than if they didn't use&#xD;
      CDs. In that case, a discussion with the clinicians may lead to the alternative process in&#xD;
      which the alerts are used by the clinical teams to drive the actions for the patient.&#xD;
      Interestingly, this alternative is possible because the alerts are simultaneously transmitted&#xD;
      to the patient and to the team. The leader in the process may even change at some critical&#xD;
      periods when the patient is in bad condition or depressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative analysis will provide knowledge on benefits and pitfalls to improve confidence in&#xD;
      the use of CDS at home from the patients and the clinical teams, improve the patient-team&#xD;
      partnership and, decrease stress and anxiety about pulmonary exacerbation treatment. This&#xD;
      study will lead to further plan a larger trial aiming to evaluate efficacy of this process of&#xD;
      care on patients' clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific innovation The use of home based CD is rapidly growing and their contribution to&#xD;
      the diagnosis of Pex in CF patients deserves to be fully evaluated. The use of CUSUM is&#xD;
      particularly promising for monitoring indicators of CF PEx. Because CUSUM chart detects&#xD;
      rapidly changes in these indicators and can identify small persistent shifts, it can help to&#xD;
      trigger early treatment and reduce respiratory damages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, this is the first study which uses a combination of numerous CDs to evaluate&#xD;
      several warning indicators of PEx. In addition, putting patients at the center of their&#xD;
      health care and giving them more autonomy (empowerment) is innovative in this type of study&#xD;
      and can improve both detection and management of their PEx episodes.&#xD;
