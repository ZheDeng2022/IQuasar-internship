  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Hemay022 combined&#xD;
      with endocrine therapy in the treatment of ER and HER2-positive metastatic or advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer, and to establish OTR (best tolerated regimen). The second purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of Hemay022 in combination with exemestane, and&#xD;
      the safety of Hemay022 in combination with letrozole or fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be divided into two parts. In the first part, 15 to 24 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled to determine the safety and tolerability of combining Hemay022 with exemestane in&#xD;
      patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer. The second part will enroll about 24-36&#xD;
      other subjects with ER and HER2-positive advanced breast cancer to better determine the&#xD;
      tolerability and preliminary efficacy of Hemay022.&#xD;
