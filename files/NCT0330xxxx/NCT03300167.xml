    <textblock>
      This interventional study is using the PlaqueTec LBS will enrol participants already&#xD;
      undergoing coronary angiography as a component of their standard care for NSTE-ACS. The study&#xD;
      will involve no change to medication or overall treatment strategy, but will involve an&#xD;
      additional procedure: use of a novel CE-marked coronary artery catheter to obtain&#xD;
      spatially-separated intravascular samples for laboratory measurement. As a safety objective&#xD;
      and as a component of the required post-marketing surveillance, OCT will be performed before&#xD;
      and after deployment of the LBS, and patients will be followed up for a significant period of&#xD;
      time by the investigator's post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual participants will not gain directly from taking part in the study, other than&#xD;
      having access to more prolonged follow up than is standard. However, new insights will be&#xD;
      gained into the microenvironment surrounding a ruptured plaque in NSTE-ACS, which has the&#xD;
      potential to benefit patients with CAD in the future through greater understanding of the&#xD;
      effects of current therapy, development of new treatment strategies and methods of assessing&#xD;
      the efficacy of those treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of the LBS and the associated OCT examinations will require additional angiographic&#xD;
      screening and therefore lead to greater exposure to radiation and higher contrast load. This&#xD;
      will be closely monitored as per Trust policies in line with IRMER and local radiological&#xD;
      guidelines. Patients at particular risk of developing complications from increased exposure&#xD;
      to radiation and contrast (eg. those who are pregnant and those with abnormal baseline renal&#xD;
      function) will not be included in order to minimise adverse effects.&#xD;

      This clinical protocol will be subject to peer review according to standard local procedures,&#xD;
      including independent scientific review by the Scientific Advisory Board of the Clinical&#xD;
      Research Facility, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; the Clinical Research&#xD;
      Office, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; and the Research Ethics Committee.&#xD;
      The study will be a single-centre study including use of a CE-marked medical device to obtain&#xD;
      samples, conducted at Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery Directorate, Northern General&#xD;
      Hospital, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a diagnosis of NSTE-ACS, receiving DAPT with a combination of aspirin and&#xD;
      ticagrelor or prasugrel, and listed either for coronary angiography with the intention of&#xD;
      proceeding to PCI or for PCI following coronary angiography at a referring hospital, will be&#xD;
      approached and their informed consent sought for this study. 18 patients found to have&#xD;
      culprit significant proximal epicardial coronary artery stenosis suitable for PCI, meeting&#xD;
      all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will proceed to have platelet function testing and&#xD;
      LBS measurements. Blood will be taken from the arterial sheath or guide catheter and baseline&#xD;
      platelet function testing will be performed (VerifyNow P2Y12 assay; light transmittance&#xD;
      aggregometry with ADP and arachidonic acid as agonists; and serum thromboxane B2 assay).&#xD;
      Balloon predilatation prior to stent deployment will be a mandatory requirement for the&#xD;
      study. Following balloon predilatation, the LBS will be deployed across the treated lesion&#xD;
      and blood sampling will be performed proximal and distal to the lesion at approximately 5&#xD;
      minutes after predilatation. The following assays will be performed on the sampled blood:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Plasma levels of soluble markers of thrombosis and inflammation including prothrombin&#xD;
           fragments 1 and 2, fibrinopeptide A, soluble P-selectin and thromboxane B2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Platelet surface P-selectin expression&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Leukocyte surface CD11b expression Blood taken prior to PCI will also be sent to the&#xD;
           local laboratory for measurement of the cardiac-specific marker high-sensitivity&#xD;
           troponin T and a further venous blood sample will be collected at 6 hours after PCI to&#xD;
           measure any rise in troponin in order to correlate this with thrombin generation. A rise&#xD;
           of 5 times the upper limit of normal of troponin following PCI in the context of chest&#xD;
           pain or diagnostic ECG changes will be used to define peri-procedural myocardial&#xD;
           infarction per the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (Thygesen, Alpert et&#xD;
           al. 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT of the culprit lesion, as well as the coronary artery proximal and distal to this, will&#xD;
      be performed before and after the deployment of the LBS to assess any topographical changes&#xD;
      to the vessel wall caused by the LBS and provide information on target lesion morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes will be reviewed and AEs (including MACE) will be recorded at 6 hours, 30&#xD;
      days and 6 months after the procedure. At the 6-hour visit, patients will be assessed by a&#xD;
      medically-qualified investigator and have a blood sample collected for troponin T level and&#xD;
      ECG performed. At the 30-day visit, patients will receive a full clinical assessment by a&#xD;
      medically-qualified investigator, have DAPT compliance assessed, be asked about angina&#xD;
      intensity, have any MACE or other AEs recorded and have an ECG. A telephone contact will be&#xD;
      made at 6 months after PCI to assess any MACE or other AEs, angina intensity and DAPT&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
