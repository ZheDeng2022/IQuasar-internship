      This pilot trial will evaluate the ability of thiamine to affect on postoperative vasoplegia&#xD;
      in high risk cardiac surgery patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thiamine has a pivotal role and is an essential cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase activity.&#xD;
      Widely known wet beri-beri is developed due to thiamine deficiency and characterized by&#xD;
      vasodilatory shock and despaired oxygen extraction leading to kidney, heart and central&#xD;
      nervous system dysfunction. Thiamine deficiency is often underestimated and even in primary&#xD;
      absence of vitamin B1 deficiency, high-consumptive state of many critical illness and cardiac&#xD;
      surgery itself can lead to its lack. Reported that in patients on chronic dialysis and&#xD;
      patients with AKI requiring RRT thiamine deficiency is a usual finding. In cross-sectional&#xD;
      observational study it has been shown that up to 33% of patients with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      congestive heart failure (CHF) had thiamine deficiency due to chronic loop diuretic use. Also&#xD;
      reported that 96% of patients (21 of 23) with heart failure receiving loop diuretic therapy&#xD;
      (daily dose: 80-240 mg furosemide) developed thiamine deficiency. In prospective&#xD;
      observational trial it has been shown that plasma thiamine levels were decreased after CABG&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in&#xD;
      septic patients, thiamine supplementation showed highly-promising renal protective effect.&#xD;
      Need for RRT was 8 patients (21%) in placebo group and 1 patient (3%) in thiamine group&#xD;
      (p=0.04).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand it was unable to show any benefit of thiamine supplementation in patients&#xD;
      undergoing CABG surgery. Although, postoperative oxygen consumption was significantly&#xD;
      increased among patients receiving thiamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, existing evidence suggests that thiamine supplementation might be an attractive&#xD;
      strategy in counteracting organ dysfunction and thus morbidity and mortality in high-risk&#xD;
      cardiac surgical patients.&#xD;
