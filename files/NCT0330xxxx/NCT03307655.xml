  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies indicate that Nitric Oxide (NO) plays an important role in the physiology of&#xD;
      the reproductive system in mammals. It has been shown that NO affects sperm motility, it&#xD;
      regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of different sperm proteins, it enhances the sperm&#xD;
      binding ability to the zona pellucida and it modulates the acrosome reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enzyme responsible for NO synthesis, the Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS), has also been&#xD;
      identified in the oocytes, cumulus and corona cells, as well as in the oviduct. For these&#xD;
      reasons, the NOS presence at the fertilization site could be a key element to determine the&#xD;
      success of this process. Therefore, carrying out in vitro studies to better understand NO's&#xD;
      role in the fertilization process, especially in human sperm capacitation, could improve the&#xD;
      outcome of the Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ARTs) due to an improvement both in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of infertility and in the prognosis of treatment success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is carried out in collaboration with the Animal Physiology Department from the&#xD;
      Veterinary Faculty (University of Murcia, Spain) and it is funded by the European Commission&#xD;
      under the Horizon 2020 Programme.&#xD;

      Main Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine changes in the NOS expression and protein nitrosylation in fertile and infertile&#xD;
      patients, when adding L-Arginine, the substrate for NO synthesis, to the sperm capacitation&#xD;
      medium in the presence/absence of human follicular fluid (hFF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate if the effects of hFF on sperm capacitation are associated to NO levels in&#xD;
           the fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify the correlation between NO levels in hFF and the clinical outcomes from ARTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Population The population included in the study will comprise both semen donors and&#xD;
           couples attending the clinic IVI Murcia for a treatment of assisted reproduction via&#xD;
           techniques of in vitro fertilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Inclusion / exclusion criteria Depending on the objectives, both the population and&#xD;
           inclusion and exclusion criteria may vary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria Main Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           To examine the modifications in the NOS expression as well as the protein nitrosylation&#xD;
           in fertile and subfertile patients. For this purpose, the following groups will be&#xD;
           recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a group of fertile males, such as the semen donors attending the clinic IVI Murcia;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a group of subfertile males composed of patients, who attend the clinic IVI Murcia&#xD;
                to undergo an in vitro fertilization treatment and who possess one altered&#xD;
                spermiogram parameter, according to the WHO (2010) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to reach the Secondary Objectives, couples who undergo an IVF or ICSI treatment&#xD;
           will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria Will be excluded couples who undergo preimplantation genetic&#xD;
           diagnosis, were diagnosed with repetitive abortion (three or more consecutive abortions&#xD;
           before week 20) or implantation failure (lack of pregnancy after three embryo transfers&#xD;
           with good quality embryos in women under 36 years of age or after two embryo transfers&#xD;
           in women over 36 years of age), as well as women over 40 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
           C. Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Since reference values for NOS expression are not available and since the variability of&#xD;
           the distribution of progressive spermatozoa is high, it has been determined that to&#xD;
           detect a difference of 20% with respect to the mean in a bilateral test, with a level of&#xD;
           significance of 5% and 80% of statistical power, 41 semen samples per group will be&#xD;
           necessary. A period of 24 months is estimated to reach the number of seminal samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
           D. Experimental design and interventions Biomedical research study with control group&#xD;
           (fertile semen donors) and experimental group (subfertile males)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Semen samples: will be obtained by masturbation after 2-7 days of sexual abstinence. All&#xD;
           samples will be analyzed according to WHO guidelines (2010). To avoid unnecessary visits&#xD;
           for the men included in the study, the semen sample will be requested during one of&#xD;
           their visits to the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Spermatozoa will be capacitated in the presence and absence of hFF. In a first set of&#xD;
           experiments, the hFF will be supplemented with L-Arginine and the NOS inhibitor L-NAME.&#xD;
           In another set of experiments the same supplementations to the capacitation medium will&#xD;
           be examined, but without using hFF.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A series of techniques such as Western blot, in situ nitrosylation and Biotin Switch&#xD;
           Assay will be used to determine any changes in the NOS expression and protein&#xD;
           nitrosylation in spermatozoa. The Western blot technique will also be applied to&#xD;
           evaluate other capacitation markers such as the Protein Kinase A (PKA) activity,&#xD;
           tyrosine phosphorylation and tyrosine nitration. The same treatment will be performed on&#xD;
           all semen samples regardless of whether they come from patients or from semen donors. IN&#xD;
           NO CASE WILL THESE SEMEN SAMPLES BE USED TO PERFORM AN ASSISTED REPRODUCTION TREATMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Human follicular fluid samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To study the correlation between the NO concentration in follicular fluid and the&#xD;
           success of the assisted reproduction treatment, the follicular fluid samples will be&#xD;
           obtained during the oocyte pick up procedure. After oocyte removal, these fluids are&#xD;
           normally eliminated, but in this case the fluids will be centrifuged for 10 minutes at&#xD;
           2000g and stored at -20°C until evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The NO concentration will be determined with the help of a commercially available&#xD;
           measurement system. NO is rapidly oxidized into two stable ions, namely nitrite and&#xD;
           nitrate, which can be assayed by using ions selective electrodes. These electrodes have&#xD;
           been miniaturized to be able to measure samples down to 30-40 µl with detection limits&#xD;
           down to the low µM range for both species.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Western blot and protein nitrosylation assays will be performed inside the Animal&#xD;
           Physiology laboratory, at the University of Murcia (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine).&#xD;
&#xD;
           It should be noted that the only objective of analyzing the follicular fluid is to&#xD;
           investigate after the assisted reproduction treatment if there is any correlation&#xD;
           between the result of the treatment and the NO levels. Under no circumstances will&#xD;
           embryo transfer decisions be made based on the NO levels in the follicular fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
           E. Collection of biological samples Sperm and follicular fluid samples will be evaluated&#xD;
           in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Purpose of sample collection The samples collected in the present study will only&#xD;
                be used for the completion of the research project. To each biological sample a&#xD;
                code will be assigned, which will be independent from the NHC code (number of&#xD;
                clinical history) of the patients and will only be known by the research team. Dr.&#xD;
                Juan Carlos Martínez Soto will be responsible for the storage and safekeeping of&#xD;
                the biological samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Method for sample collection The biological samples will only be obtained once the&#xD;
                patient has signed the corresponding informed consent. The seminal samples will be&#xD;
                obtained by masturbation after 2-7 days of sexual abstinence. To avoid unnecessary&#xD;
                displacements, the sample collection will take place during the visit of the&#xD;
                patient to the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The follicular fluid samples will be obtained on the day of the oocyte pick up procedure&#xD;
           performed for the in vitro fertilization treatment that the patients will follow. This&#xD;
           fluid, which is normally discarded, will be used only to determine NO values.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Obtaining this follicular fluid does not pose any additional risk or discomfort to those&#xD;
           caused by the reproduction treatment, since the surgical procedure of oocyte pick up is&#xD;
           used to obtain the follicular fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Method for sample identification The semen and follicular fluid samples will be&#xD;
                identified in a way which will allow to safeguard the identity of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sample conservation Both seminal and follicular fluid samples will be stored in&#xD;
                freezers in the laboratory of Andrology (IVI Murcia) at -80°C until further&#xD;
                processing, under the supervision of Dr Juan Carlos Martínez Soto. The samples sent&#xD;
                to the University of Murcia will be stored by Dr. Carmen Matás Parra. Both the&#xD;
                facilities of the University of Murcia and those of the IVI clinic have a&#xD;
                restricted access, therefore the samples will be always guarded. Upon completion of&#xD;
                the study (January 2019), the surplus samples will be destroyed following the usual&#xD;
                protocols of the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
           F. Database The data regarding sample analysis (follicular fluid and semen samples),&#xD;
           will be stored in Excel tables in the facilities of IVI Murcia. The data regarding the&#xD;
           results of the assisted reproduction treatments that have been followed by the patients&#xD;
           included in the study will be obtained from the IVI management system (SIVIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
           G. Study variables&#xD;
&#xD;
           Four classes of variables will be distinguished according to their relevance within the&#xD;
           study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Variable: NO levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Variables: NOS expression, rate of progressive sperm, pregnancy rate,&#xD;
           biochemical pregnancy, pregnancy evolution, implantation rate, ectopic pregnancy rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Control Variables: Tyrosine phosphorylation (optical density units), PKA (optical&#xD;
           density units), protein nitrosylation (optical density units), nitrates and nitrites&#xD;
           (micromolar units).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Descriptive variables: maternal age, paternal age, male etiology, female etiology, BMI,&#xD;
           smoking habit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H. Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Descriptive analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical summary of the data collected in the study. Categorical data will be&#xD;
           presented in frequency tables and histograms. The continuous values will be summarized&#xD;
           with the mean, standard deviation and confidence interval, they will be represented by&#xD;
           graphs of quartiles or densities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The exploratory analysis of the data will allow to assess the quality of the data and&#xD;
           the detection of anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis of homogeneity:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The means and proportions of the descriptive variables (baseline and demographic) will&#xD;
           be compared to validate the degree of comparability of the study groups. S chi-square&#xD;
           test will be applied in the categorical variables and, assuming the data follow a normal&#xD;
           distribution, a T-test in the continuous variables. If the data does not follow a normal&#xD;
           distribution, a Mann-Whitney test would be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the case of finding descriptive variables distributed in a way that there are&#xD;
           statistical differences between the groups, they will be included in a regression model,&#xD;
           to control their interference in the main relation to be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Comparison of NO expression:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To validate a hypothesis of correlation of proportions in the NO expression, a Fisher&#xD;
           test will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To evaluate the effect of other covariables that can modify the behavior of NO&#xD;
           expression, a logistic regression model will be defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As for the comparison of protein nitrosylation, a Student's t-test will be applied&#xD;
           assuming that the data follow a normal distribution. If the normality assumption will&#xD;
           not be met, verified by a Kolmogorov-Smirnof test, a non-parametric U-MannWhitney test&#xD;
           would be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the same way, a linear regression model will be defined that allows the evaluation of&#xD;
           the effect of other correlated variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluation of seminal quality:&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the set of variables that make up the seminal quality, a t-Student test will be&#xD;
           applied assuming that the data follow a normal distribution. If the normality assumption&#xD;
           will not be met, verified by a Kolmogorov-Smirnof test, a non-parametric U-MannWhitney&#xD;
           test would be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluation of gestational outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the set of variables that define the gestation results, a Fisher test will be&#xD;
           applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Workplan:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Development stages and distribution of the tasks of the entire research team, and the&#xD;
           assignments planned for the technical staff. Indicate in addition place / center of&#xD;
           realization of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The design of the study, as well as the drafting of the project have been carried out by&#xD;
           Doctors Carmen Matás Parra and Juan Carlos Martínez Soto.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The team of gynecologists who make up the Unit of Reproductive Medicine at the IVI&#xD;
           Murcia clinic, Dr. Jose Landeras, María Nicolás, Laura Fernández and Martina Trabalón,&#xD;
           will be responsible for the inclusion of patients and semen donors in the study, as well&#xD;
           as the direct responsible for the assisted reproduction treatment performed on patients.&#xD;
           Such treatment includes: the choice of treatment to be performed, ovarian stimulation,&#xD;
           oocyte pick up procedure to collect oocytes and follicular fluid, as well as embryo&#xD;
           transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The embryologists Marta Molla, David Gumbao, Julián Marcos, Beatriz Amorocho and Ana&#xD;
           Isabel Sanchez will be responsible for the process of oocyte fertilization in the&#xD;
           fertilization laboratory, as well as the selection of embryos to be transferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Florentin-Daniel Staicu, Carmen Matás Parra and Juan Carlos Martínez Soto will carry out&#xD;
           the analysis of both seminal and follicular fluid samples. These analyses will be&#xD;
           carried out both in the facilities of the IVI Murcia clinic and in the laboratories of&#xD;
           the University of Murcia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dr. Jorge Chavarro will conduct the epidemiological and biostatistical studies.&#xD;
