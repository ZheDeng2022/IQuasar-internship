      The study design matches with a multicenter observational ambispective study. A first pilot&#xD;
      study will be undertaken in Caen center and is expected to be extended to Rouen and Lille&#xD;
      center. So patients from Normandy and North-West areas will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to include patients in this observational study historical data about first line&#xD;
      injectable treatments (interferons and glatiramer acetate) are used. As well as the data on&#xD;
      patients treated with oral first line therapies (teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate) began&#xD;
      to be collected ahead of the study start (Retrospective phase). During the course of the&#xD;
      study, new patients under teriflunomide or dimethyl fumarate will be included (Prospective&#xD;
      phase).&#xD;

      Multiple sclerosis is known to be the first non traumatic cause of disability in young&#xD;
      people. Multiple sclerosis is described as a chronic inflammatory immune-mediated disease of&#xD;
      the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a few disease modifying treatments where available before 1994, but in two decades, the&#xD;
      therapeutic armamentarium was reinforced by many more and more effective drugs for RRMS .They&#xD;
      tend to extend time to conversion towards a defined MS after the first relapse and between&#xD;
      relapses and have a notable action on the decreasing clinical and radiological disease&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First line of disease modifying treatments (DMTs), IFN β-1a and glatiramer acetate are known&#xD;
      to have a favorable benefit-to-risk profile in RRMS, they reduce relapse rate and MRI&#xD;
      activity of the disease, but their efficacy remains limited. They do not stop the disease&#xD;
      progression but only slow down it for a while. Otherwise four drugs cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      mitoxantrone, natalizumab and fingolimod were used as second-line therapy or as first-line&#xD;
      for rapidly evolving RRMS. Whereas second line DMTs cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone were&#xD;
      merely an alternative to pharmacological run away, natalizumab and fingolimod proved to be&#xD;
      two effective drugs of second line DMTs. Natalizumab impressively inhibits inflammatory&#xD;
      process of MS, with &gt;65% reduction in relapses during 2 years of treat¬ment, and &gt;90%&#xD;
      suppression of new inflammatory MRI lesions and fingolimod suppresses MS disease activity&#xD;
      with 55-60% of lower relapses rates and a remarkable decrease of visible MRI activity . In&#xD;
      2014 alemtuzumab received FDA approval and joined the other second line treatment but it is&#xD;
      still not commercialized in France. Recently years two new first line treatments&#xD;
      teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate have made their entry on the market. The main advantage&#xD;
      of these both treatments is their mode of administration. Whereas the two first line&#xD;
      treatments are under injectable form, teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate can be administered&#xD;
      per os, and so facilitate the therapy compliance for newly-diagnosed RRMS patients. In TEMSO,&#xD;
      a phase III multicentric double-blinded study with teriflunomide 14 mg once a day versus&#xD;
      placebo, teriflunomide shows both efficacy in reducing from 31,5% relapse rate in 2 years and&#xD;
      a significant 80.4% of reduction of MRI activity for T1 enhanced lesions by gadolinium. Risk&#xD;
      of disability progression is also significantly reduced of 29.8%, as compared with placebo.&#xD;
      Efficacy and safety phase 3 trial study DEFINE assessed efficacy of BG-12 (dimethyl fumarate)&#xD;
      240 mg given orally either twice daily significantly reduced the risk of relapse by 49% or&#xD;
      compared with placebo at 2 years. On ARR, there were relative reductions of 53% .The&#xD;
      probability of confirmed 12-week disability progression was reduced by 38%. In an MRI&#xD;
      sub-study the mean number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions was reduced by 85% . A clear&#xD;
      efficacy on disease activity is shown when comparing respectively dimethylfumarate and&#xD;
      teriflunomide with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However the efficacy on clinical symptoms and disease activity isn't significantly better&#xD;
      than that of the first line's treatments of references. Compare to glatiramer acetate,&#xD;
      dimethyl fumarate shows no significant greater clinical effect on the disease . No&#xD;
      significant annual relapses rate difference was shown either between teriflunomide and&#xD;
      interferon ß-1a . The most interesting progress of these two molecules lies in their easier&#xD;
      mode of administration and the inherent change of medical practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and therapeutic delays have already proved to be some remarkable health indicators&#xD;
      in numerous chronic or serious diseases. In cancers, &quot;diagnostic delays&quot; and &quot;therapeutics&#xD;
      delays&quot; are demonstrated to have an negative impact survival and mortality . Various delays&#xD;
      may occur at different stages of health care. On the one hand diagnosis delays are a complex&#xD;
      association of &quot;patients delay&quot; (from onset of symptoms to their first presentation),&#xD;
      depending on patients factors as behavior or social background, &quot;referral delay&quot; (from&#xD;
      general practician's medical consultation to a specialist one), and finally &quot;delay to lead a&#xD;
      diagnosis&quot; (time required to undergo specialized medical examinations). On the other hand&#xD;
      therapeutics delays (from diagnosis to start of the treatment) are more associated with&#xD;
      health system process (15,16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evolution of diagnosis criteria and especially last revision of McDonald 2010 criteria, that&#xD;
      show high sensibility and specificity, obviously influence healthcare delays by allowing&#xD;
      early diagnosis and indirectly early treatment initiation. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment delays are also shorten by the evidence of a favorable impact of early treatment&#xD;
      initiation for patients with RRMS . Early DMT initiation seems to be beneficial for MS&#xD;
      patients. Early treatment with INF-1b reduced the risk of clinically determined Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis (CDMS) by 37% compared with delayed treatment after a 5 year follow-up . Early&#xD;
      treatment with glatiramer acetate is efficacious in delaying conversion to CDMS in patients&#xD;
      presenting with clinically isolated symptoms (CIS) and brain lesions detected by MRI. Time&#xD;
      for 25% of patients to convert to CDMS was prolonged from 336 days for Placebo to 722 days&#xD;
      for glatiramer acetate. Similar data have been found with early treatment with glatiramer&#xD;
      acetate 40 mg injected 3 times a week: reductions in annual relapses rate, lesion activity,&#xD;
      and evolution of active lesions to chronic black holes over 3 years. For new oral treatments,&#xD;
      same significant results highlight the benefit of an early teriflunomide initiation. In an&#xD;
      extension of TOWER study in patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg for up to 5.5 years,&#xD;
      comparisons of early versus s delayed treatment initiation was made. An estimated 26.7% of&#xD;
      patients in the early treatment group experienced disability progression confirmed for ≥12&#xD;
      weeks versus an estimated 30.2% in the delayed treatment group. Moreover a relative reduction&#xD;
      of 29.9% of annual relapses rate was significantly proved between early treatment group and&#xD;
      the delayed treatment group. And time of first relapse is significantly longer in the early&#xD;
      treatment group than in the delayed one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social determinants in public health issues have interested worldwide many researchers, and&#xD;
      international comparisons show that social inequalities in health are particularly pronounced&#xD;
      in France despite a global good quality health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies in the US have found that depending on insurance status and social position&#xD;
      (education, employment status ) there were a difference in accessing specialty MS care .&#xD;
      Patients followed by MS multidisciplinary network benefit of a better global care, they are&#xD;
      more likely to undergo diagnosis tests and be prescribed DMT's. As patients socially deprived&#xD;
      have a limited access to MS multidisciplinary network, they benefit of a lower global health&#xD;
      care quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In survey studies lead in 50 states of the United Sates significant differences appears&#xD;
      between urban/rural on residency in accessing specialty MS care providers. MS patients who&#xD;
      live in more remote rural areas received MS focused areas at the same place than their&#xD;
      routine health care, whereas their urban counterparts have an easier access to MS clinics or&#xD;
      MS health centers. Most of geographically isolated patients haven't recourse to MS related&#xD;
      cares because of greater travel times to receive MS care from specialist (27). There are&#xD;
      differences in the use of physician services patients according to urban or rural on&#xD;
      residency. In more remote rural areas one on three patients does not consult a neurologist or&#xD;
      MS specialist as much as they would like. Patients who lives in rural areas do not received&#xD;
      the same appropriate MS focused cares than their urban counterparts . Distances and travel&#xD;
      times to access MS related cares may also act as a loss of chances for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last two decades, there was a progressive evolution of therapies and every new drugs&#xD;
      type arrival on the market being synonymous of medical practices evolutions and patients&#xD;
      healthcare. First line oral DMT(s) obviously represent an improvement in ease of treatments'&#xD;
      administration. So an impact of the recent treatments teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate&#xD;
      arrival in reducing therapeutic healthcare delays can be hypothesized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addition to complete this study, a second hypothesis can be formulated. Social inequalities&#xD;
      and geographic disparities strongly have an impact on patients medical and treatment&#xD;
      initiation, so improving drug delivery will probably moderate this impact.&#xD;
