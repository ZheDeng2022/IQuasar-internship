  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adhesive restorative materials are routinely used in operative dentistry to improve tooth&#xD;
      tissues with minimal preparation, achieve more esthetic and long term restorations. Despite&#xD;
      these efficacy to dentistry these materials still present some drawbacks like polymerization&#xD;
      shrinkage. Postoperative sensitivity, marginal discoloration and possibly secondary caries&#xD;
      are often associated with loss of marginal integrity in composite restorations occurred as a&#xD;
      result of polymerization shrinkage. To achieve optimal long term performance, the&#xD;
      requirements will be first to manage polymerization stress buildup following&#xD;
      restoration.Low-shrinking composites with new formulas have been successful in brilliantly&#xD;
      further developing the leader product els extra low shrinkage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the clinical performance of&#xD;
      restorative material ELS versus ELS Extra resin composite for Class I and Class II cavities&#xD;
      that needs to be restored in permanent teeth.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The detrimental impact of resin composite polymerization shrinkage on restoration interface&#xD;
      quality and stability has been recognized since the early use of this material is still one&#xD;
      of the major drawbacks in adhesive dentistry, as it frequently leads to loss of marginal&#xD;
      integrity or enamel fracture. According to clinical studies, drawbacks such as postoperative&#xD;
      sensitivity, marginal discoloration and possibly secondary caries are often associated with&#xD;
      loss of marginal integrity in composite restorations occurred as a result of polymerization&#xD;
      shrinkage. Various technological solutions were investigated, including improved filler&#xD;
      technology; improved, novel matrix structure with reduced shrinkage; use of stress-decreasing&#xD;
      compounds within the resin matrix; changes in light-initiation technology to increase curing&#xD;
      depth; and use of sonic vibrations and energy to favor flow and adaptation of highly filled&#xD;
      resin composite. To achieve optimal long term performance, the requirements will be first to&#xD;
      manage polymerization stress buildup following restoration. Low-shrinking composites should&#xD;
      help to avoid clinical problems that are commonly associated with composite restorations,&#xD;
      such as post-operative sensitivity, enamel cracks, rapid discoloration and deterioration of&#xD;
      restoration margins, early development of caries recurrence, with a new formula and improved&#xD;
      sculptability SAREMCO has been successful in brilliantly further developing the leader&#xD;
      product els extra low shrinkage. When using new simplified restorative systems featuring&#xD;
      distinctive physicochemical characteristics, the potential impact of different parameters&#xD;
      such as fatigue behavior and/or elastic modulus on restoration quality and behavior is&#xD;
      unknown and justifies additional investigations. Instead of in vitro evaluations,&#xD;
      consideration of a rather well-established clinical trials suggesting medium to long term&#xD;
      observation periods to discriminately appraise the clinical performance of various operative&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project includes 30 patients. Most of the patients have been recruited from the Istanbul&#xD;
      Medipol University Dental Clinics in Istanbul. After giving their consent to take part in the&#xD;
      study Class I &amp; II restorations of both upper and lower molars and premolars are&#xD;
      performed.The treatment procedure is: The patients are offered local anesthetic before&#xD;
      treatment start. The cavity is excavated and filled according to the guidelines for composite&#xD;
      restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control procedure is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The restoration is evaluated according to marginal adaptation, cavo surface marginal&#xD;
      discoloration, approximal contact, fractures, caries associated with restorations and&#xD;
      postoperative hypersensitivity. The controls will take place after two weeks, one year, two&#xD;
      years and three years.&#xD;
