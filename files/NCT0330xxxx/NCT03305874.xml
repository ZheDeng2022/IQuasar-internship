  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast agent is typically used during routine cardiac intervention in order to enhance the&#xD;
      imaging necessary to perform the procedure. Using this contrast agent could lead to kidney&#xD;
      injury, called contrast induced nephropathy (CIN). Currently, the methods used to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of CIN include reducing the amount of contrast agent used and using a hydration strategy&#xD;
      during procedure. A computer-based risk tool has been developed which reports a risk score&#xD;
      for the likelihood a person undergoing cardiac intervention gets CIN and a proposed&#xD;
      corresponding hydration strategy to reduce the risk of CIN. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine whether the rate of CIN decreases when the treating physician has access to this&#xD;
      risk tool during the procedure.&#xD;

      This is a case-control series comparing a strategy using a computer-based contrast induced&#xD;
      nephropathy (CBCIN) risk tool in patients undergoing PCI versus usual care. Only inpatients&#xD;
      will be included in this study. These inpatients will be compared to historical controls&#xD;
      obtained using the medical record of age- and gender-matched inpatients who underwent cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization with at least two consecutive daily post-procedure creatinine values. The&#xD;
      percentage PCI will be matched in the retrospective series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the prospective group, the operator will be exposed to the CBCIN risk tool before and&#xD;
      during care delivery with estimated CIN risk. The CBCIN risk tool estimates CIN risk based on&#xD;
      the status of known risk factors (and suggests an associated standard hydration strategy&#xD;
      based on left-ventricular end-diastolic pressure), which are automatically prepared from the&#xD;
      patient's Electronic Medical Record and presented to the operator for review. This&#xD;
      functionality has been evaluated in previous research and was found to be stable and&#xD;
      reliable. Based on the data presented by and reviewed in the CBCIN risk tool, the operator&#xD;
      may use the information and adjust therapy as clinically indicated (i.e. the risk tool is not&#xD;
      the basis for clinical decisions). Following the PCI, serum creatinine will be measured as&#xD;
      per treating physician, but those who undergo at least two consecutive daily serum creatinine&#xD;
      measurements starting the day after the procedure will be included in the study. These&#xD;
      patients will be called 6 months and 12 months post-procedure to determine mortality and&#xD;
      re-hospitalization status.&#xD;

    <description>Prospectively, inpatients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) will be consented, and the computer-based contrast induced nephropathy (CBCIN) risk score will be calculated and displayed to the operator, along with suggested standard CIN-avoidance strategies during the PCI. Following the PCI, serum creatinine will be measured as per treating physician, but those who undergo at least two consecutive daily serum creatinine measurements starting the day after the procedure will be included in the study. These patients will be called 6 months and 12 months post-procedure to determine mortality and re-hospitalization status.</description>

    <description>The computer-based contrast induced nephropathy (CBCIN) risk score and associated standard hydration strategy will be displayed on a monitor in front of the treating interventional cardiologist during the entirety of the PCI case. Since this scoring system and hydration strategy are both available in the peer-reviewed literature, clinical use of these data and implementation of a CIN-avoidance strategy is not experimental; however, the display of these data to interventional cardiologists is experimental. Based on exposure to these data, the treating interventional cardiologist may use the information as clinically appropriate (i.e. it is not the basis for clinical decisions).</description>

        A prospective patient may be considered for the study if they are referred to the&#xD;
        University of Chicago Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory as an inpatient for either a&#xD;
        planned PCI or a diagnostic angiogram with high likelihood for PCI. For the retrospective&#xD;
        control series, subjects will be selected from the electronic medical record starting from&#xD;
        the date of the study protocol submission backwards until January 1, 2010 if they meet&#xD;
        inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
