  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to confirm the clinical relevance of the novel biomarker for&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) detection. Samples of blood, urine and saliva will be collected&#xD;
      from a) patients with suspected TBI (isolated), b) patients with orthopedic injury, and c)&#xD;
      healthy controls. The sponsor will do biochemical investigations for the samples to evaluate&#xD;
      the presence, level and structure of the targeted biomarker.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study will analyze and compare the levels of certain biomolecules and cellular&#xD;
      degradation products which are released upon a brain injury and which become detectable in&#xD;
      the body fluids. Patients with a traumatic brain injury are supposed to express these&#xD;
      biomarkers in their body fluids while orthopedic trauma patients and healthy controls are&#xD;
      supposed to be undetectable with respect to these biomolecules. The study is a case-control&#xD;
      study where the study subjects with a property (injured) are compared to subjects without the&#xD;
      property (healthy). The brain injury patient group will consist of subjects who entered the&#xD;
      Emergency Department of the hospital with a suspected TBI. The orthopedic patient group will&#xD;
      consists of patients who were admitted with a bone fracture in the limbs, but without a&#xD;
      suspected TBI. The control group will consist of healthy subjects who will be recruited to&#xD;
      the study by the activities of the study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire study is split into two successive parts. In the first Part I, 18 - 24 subjects&#xD;
      will be recruited in each group. In the second part, the number of the patients with&#xD;
      suspected TBI will be added to up to 100 in order to receive an adequate number of samples&#xD;
      and to gain sufficient statistical significance between the brain injury severities and in&#xD;
      successive sampling time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected samples and relevant clinical data of each subject will be supplied to the&#xD;
      sponsor who will perform to the samples 1) Biochemical analysis for the presence and level of&#xD;
      the biomarker, and 2) Biomarker profiling and structure analysis by LC/MS.&#xD;
