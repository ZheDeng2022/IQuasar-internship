    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIa, open label, single arm, and prospective study of hormone therapy-naïve&#xD;
      men with oligometastatic prostate cancer to the bone. The study will test if treating the&#xD;
      primary tumor sites and 5 or fewer sites of bone-only metastasis with external beam radiation&#xD;
      with concomitant systemic Radium-223 will reduce the utilization of androgen deprivation&#xD;
      therapy, improve QOL and improve OS over a the comparator cohort of SWOG intermittent ADT&#xD;
      historic cohort.&#xD;
