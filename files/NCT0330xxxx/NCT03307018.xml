  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory complications are the largest group of complications following anatomical lung&#xD;
      resections. Most of these complications result from a disrupted evacuation of respiratory&#xD;
      secretions. At present, prevention of such complications involve: aspirating of secretions&#xD;
      with a catheter during surgery through an intubation tube, active postoperative&#xD;
      rehabilitation, mucolytic treatment and effective postoperative pain management. Suctioning&#xD;
      of secretions by a catheter through an intubation tube does not, however, allow for removal&#xD;
      of secretions from entire bronchial tree. Bronchofiberoscopy with a small-diameter flexible&#xD;
      bronchoscope and thorough, systematic aspiration of secretions from respiratory tract&#xD;
      immediately after surgery could presumably result in more effective bronchial cleansing and&#xD;
      reduce risk of respiratory complications after surgery. Although the British Thoracic Society&#xD;
      guidelines do not recommend routine bronchoscopy as a standard postoperative management after&#xD;
      lung resections, they are based on a single, randomized, study analyzing a small group of&#xD;
      patients. Bronchoscopy with systematic aspiration of secretions done with a thin flexible&#xD;
      scope is a safe procedure, without risk of complications. It does not cause any additional&#xD;
      discomfort to the patients and allows for much more accurate aspiration of the bronchial&#xD;
      secretions than with a catheter inserted blindly through an intubation tube. It also gives an&#xD;
      opportunity to directly evaluate segmental and subsegmental bronchial patency. This is&#xD;
      particularly important in patients with COPD who tend to accumulate large amounts of mucus&#xD;
      secretion in the bronchial tree.&#xD;

      Introduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atelectasis and pneumonia are the most common complications after anatomical lung resections.&#xD;
      Their occurrence in the postoperative period may necessitate treatment with antibiotics and&#xD;
      fiberoptic bronchoscopy and may lead prolongation of hospital stay, diminished quality of&#xD;
      life and increased cost of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among known risk factors, retention of bronchial secretions is probably the most important.&#xD;
      Although at the end of surgery suctioning of the secretions from large airways is always&#xD;
      done, it is usually performed with suction catheter inserted blindly through an endotracheal&#xD;
      tube. This procedure does not allow for complete removal of secretions from all parts of&#xD;
      bronchial tree and trachea. Remaining secretions may lead to postoperative atelectasis and&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed with a thin scope allows for accurate visual assessment and&#xD;
      precise aspiration of secretions from all main, lobar and segmental bronchi. If performed in&#xD;
      a systematic way, it allows for complete removal of bronchial secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of routine bronchoscopic aspiration has already been evaluated in one randomized&#xD;
      study. However, study group included only 20 subjects, which is too little to perform proper&#xD;
      statistical analysis and draw conclusions (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After qualification for the study informed consent will be obtained from a patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two arms of the study: &quot;BRONCH&quot; or &quot;CONTROL&quot;.&#xD;
      Simple randomization method and random number generator&#xD;
      (https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/index.cfm) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial assessment will include demographics, smoking history, comorbidities (Charlson&#xD;
      Comorbidity Index, CCI and Thoracic Revised Cardiac Risk Index, thRCRI), pulmonary function&#xD;
      tests, diffusion lung capacity (DLCO), computed tomography of the chest and bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed under general anesthesia with double-lumen endotracheal tube&#xD;
      intubation and single lung ventilation. Patients will be placed in lateral decubitus position&#xD;
      and operation table will be flexed at the level of 5th - 6th rib The decision about the type&#xD;
      of surgical approach (video-assisted thoracic surgery, VATS or antero-lateral muscle-sparing&#xD;
      thoracotomy) will be made according to the criteria presently used, in particular size of a&#xD;
      tumor and its TNM classification assessed on the basis of preoperative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary lobectomy will be performed in standardized fashion. Pulmonary vessels (veins and&#xD;
      arteries) will be closed with vascular staplers, silk loops or vascular clips. Bronchus will&#xD;
      be closed with stapler or running suture. Interlobar fissures will be divided with staplers.&#xD;
      Mediastinal lymph node dissection (MLND) will be performed using either monopolar&#xD;
      electrocautery or high-energy device. One chest tube will be placed in case of VATS and two&#xD;
      in case of thoracotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery, after lobectomy and MLND, catheter will be introduced through&#xD;
      intubation tube and suctioning of secretions from large airways will be done. Collapsed lung&#xD;
      will be re-expanded and alveolar recruitment maneuvers will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VATS/thoracotomy wound will be closed and patient will be placed in prone position. All&#xD;
      investigators, except one designated for performing bronchoscopy will leave operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this time, it will be checked, to which arm the patient was randomly assigned. If the&#xD;
      patient was assigned to &quot;CONTROL&quot; arm, bronchoscopy will not be done and the patient will be&#xD;
      woken. If the patient was assigned to &quot;BRONCH&quot; arm, bronchoscopy will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscope will be kept in a closed cupboard, so it will not be possible for the&#xD;
      investigators involved in perioperative assessment and surgery to accidentally learn if it&#xD;
      has been used or not. If the patient will be assigned to &quot;BRONCH&quot; group, scope will be&#xD;
      brought from the cupboard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscopy will be done with a thin, flexible bronchoscope by investigator specifically&#xD;
      designated for the task, who will not participate in postoperative assessment of the&#xD;
      patients. He/she will not be allowed to inform other investigators if bronchoscopy would be&#xD;
      performed or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscopy and suctioning of secretions will be performed in a systematic manner as&#xD;
      follows: 1) main bronchi, 2) lung on non-operated side: lower lobe - middle lobe/lingula-&#xD;
      upper lobe/culmen, 3) lung on operated side starting from lower lobe bronchi towards upper&#xD;
      lobe bronchi, 4) main bronchi. Secretions will be removed from main, lobar and segmental&#xD;
      bronchi. Care will be taken not to injure bronchial mucosa. Bronchial secretions will be sent&#xD;
      for microbiological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After bronchoscopy scope will be immediately transferred for cleaning and another one will be&#xD;
      placed in the cupboard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After operation patient will be transferred to surgery ward or intensive care unit if&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain management will include local analgesia (epidural in thoracotomy, intercostal block with&#xD;
      bupivacaine performed at the end of surgery in VATS), acetaminophen, NSAIDS and opioids. Pain&#xD;
      severity will be assessed daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination, including auscultation, temperature measurement, heart rate,&#xD;
      respiratory rate and others will be performed twice a day. Chest x-ray will be performed in&#xD;
      the evening on the day of surgery, on postoperative day 1 and postoperative day 2 and&#xD;
      additionally if symptoms corresponding to retention of secretions, atelectasis or pneumonia&#xD;
      will be found on physical examination. C-reactive protein serum level will be measured before&#xD;
      surgery and 72 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following factors/parameters will be additionally measured and compared in both groups:&#xD;
      duration of surgery, duration of single-lung ventilation, chest tube duration, hospital stay,&#xD;
      ICU admission and its duration, results of bacteriological examination of bronchial&#xD;
      secretions, histology, TNM, stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other complications will be recorded (bleeding, transfusion, prolonged air leak, residual air&#xD;
      space, wound infection, redo surgery, psychosis and others).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest tubes will be removed if fluid drainage will be less than 200ml/day and no air leak&#xD;
      will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Occurrence of atelectasis on chest x-ray on day 1, 2 or 3 after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bronchial Secretion Retention Related Complications Score (BRCS) on day 1, 2 or 3 after&#xD;
           surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Occurrence of new atrial fibrillation during day 1, 2 or 3 after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. C-reactive protein level 72 hours after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      BRCS will reflect a spectrum of complications resulting from retention of bronchial&#xD;
      secretions. Each of the complications will be assigned a number corresponding to severity of&#xD;
      a complication (ordinal scale), as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Normal breath sounds on auscultation, no atelectasis on CXR, no pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Residual secretions on auscultation, no atelectasis on CXR, no pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Atelectasis on CXR, no pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to enroll 200 patients, 100 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyzed data will be presented as means, standard deviations, minimum and maximum&#xD;
      values, medians, interquartile ranges (lower quartile, upper quartile) or percentage, as&#xD;
      appropriate. Normality of the distribution will be tested with the Shapiro-Wilk's test, and&#xD;
      the equality of variances will be checked with the Levene's test. For comparison of groups,&#xD;
      unpaired t test or one-way ANOVA (for data which follow normal distribution and homogeneity&#xD;
      of variances) or Welch test will be applied. In case data will not normally distributed&#xD;
      nonparametric tests will be used - Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test with the&#xD;
      Dunn's post-hoc test. Categorical data will be analyzed with the χ2 test or the&#xD;
      Fisher-Freeman-Halton test. The relationship between variables will be analyzed with the&#xD;
      Pearson's linear correlation coefficient or the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient or&#xD;
      (and) by multivariate linear regression. All the results will be considered significant at&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05. Statistical analyses will be performed with statistical packages: STATISTICA 10.0 PL&#xD;
      (StatSoft. Inc.) or StatXact 9.0 (CytelStudio) software.&#xD;
