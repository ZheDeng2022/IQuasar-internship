  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to prospectively investigate the use of virtual reality headsets on the&#xD;
      placement of IVs in a pediatric emergency department, by comparing the first stick success&#xD;
      rate, total number of attempts, and the time to successful IV placement between patients who&#xD;
      use virtual reality headset technology during the placement and those who receive the&#xD;
      standard of care IV placement when child life ( individuals with special training in aiding&#xD;
      and augmenting pediatric coping skills) is not available. The investigators will also compare&#xD;
      the patient and parent perception of pain and anxiety associated with the IV placement in&#xD;
      both study groups. Finally, by detailing which medications have been given prior to use of&#xD;
      the VR for IV placement the investigators may evaluate for possible synergistic effects of VR&#xD;
      with prior medication administration.&#xD;

      Children often describe procedures involving needles as the most stressful portion of the&#xD;
      hospital experience. 1,2 Many studies involving the perception of pain have highlighted the&#xD;
      importance of attention for the perception of pain, and, conversely, the benefit of&#xD;
      distraction for decreasing pain perception. 3,4 Virtual reality technologies (VR) have been&#xD;
      shown to mitigate the experience of pain and anxiety in patients undergoing procedures in a&#xD;
      number of different ways. 5,6 While small studies have demonstrated the use of VR to be&#xD;
      effective in diminishing pain during intravenous (IV) placement for outpatient imaging in&#xD;
      pediatric patients aged 8-12, there have not been large-scale studies assessing the use of VR&#xD;
      during IV placement in the Pediatric Emergency Department. 7 Studies examining the use of VR&#xD;
      during venipuncture and IV placement also frequently focus on self-reported or&#xD;
      parent-reported pain, rather than objectively quantifying number of IV sticks and time to&#xD;
      successful IV placement.8 Additionally, the pediatric age ranges which benefit from VR have&#xD;
      not been well-established, with some studies citing benefits only in patients over 10 years&#xD;
      of age, and others showing improvements in all age groups.7,9,10&#xD;
