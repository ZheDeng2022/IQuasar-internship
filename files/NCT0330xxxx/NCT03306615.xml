      This is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over Phase II&#xD;
      trial of human recombinant hyaluronidase injections in individuals with post-stroke upper&#xD;
      limb muscle stiffness. The investigators will recruit 50 subjects, 25 males and 25 females,&#xD;
      who will be randomized to receive either hyaluronidase plus saline (treatment arm, n=25) or&#xD;
      normal saline (control arm, n=25) injections (first injection) in Phase 1 of the study over 5&#xD;
      visits that will test all 3 study aims. Then subjects will cross over to Phase 2 to receive a&#xD;
      second injection, where the treatment arm will receive the placebo and the placebo arm will&#xD;
      receive the treatment. It is expected that approximately 50 participants will be enrolled to&#xD;
      produce 42 evaluable participants. This design will ensure that all subjects receive the drug&#xD;
      treatment, which will facilitate recruitment. The injecting physician (PI), the assessors,&#xD;
      and the patients will be blind to group assignment. Randomization will be initiated by the&#xD;
      IDS pharmacy as per the study statistician. All patients will be assessed at seven visits&#xD;
      over 9 weeks of the study: Visit 1 - screening and baseline assessment of aims 1 and 2 (week&#xD;
      1-2); Visit 2 - pre-injection MRI for aim 3 (week 1-2); Visit 3 - first injection (week 2);&#xD;
      Visit 4 - post-injection MRI (week 3-5); Visit 5 - post-injection follow up for aims 1 and 2&#xD;
      (week 3-5); CROSSOVER TO OPPOSITE TREATMENT ARM Visit 6 - Second injection (week 6); Visit 7&#xD;
      - post-injection follow-up for aims 1 and 2/ final study visit (week 7-9). There will be no&#xD;
      MRI assessment after the second injection as the technique is adequately sensitive to&#xD;
      demonstrate changes with a small sample size. The investigators will follow the patients for&#xD;
      approximately 9 weeks in this study. After obtaining informed consent, subjects will be&#xD;
      screened to ensure that the subjects meet study criteria.&#xD;

      1. To test the effect of hyaluronidase injections on upper limb outcomes. The investigators&#xD;
           will test the hypothesis that compared to placebo, human recombinant hyaluronidase&#xD;
           injections will increase ROM as measured by motion analysis (primary outcome), isometric&#xD;
           muscle strength using MVC on EMG, reduce upper limb motor impairment as measured by the&#xD;
           Fugl-Meyer (FM) scale, and improve function as measured by the Wolf Motor Function Test&#xD;
           (WMFT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effect of hyaluronidase on neural and non-neural components of muscle&#xD;
           stiffness. The investigators will test the hypothesis that compared to placebo, IM&#xD;
           hyaluronidase will modulate the passive and potentially also the active component of the&#xD;
           stretch reflex, reduce stiffness and improve arm motor control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the effect of hyaluronidase on intramuscular GAG content. The investigators&#xD;
           will test the hypothesis that compared to placebo, IM hyaluronidase will reduce the&#xD;
           T1rho relaxation times in the biceps and triceps muscles of the affected arm.&#xD;

    <description>tool that can be used to systematically and thoroughly assess mental status. It is an 11-question measure that tests five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The maximum score is 30. A score of 23 or lower is indicative of cognitive impairment. The MMSE takes only 5-10 minutes to administer and is therefore practical to use repeatedly and routinely.</description>
