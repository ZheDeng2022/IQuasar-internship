      <recruitment_details>This was open-label, multiple-dose and matched-group design. 20 participants entered (ten in each of the two groups). Participants with moderate renal impairment were assigned to the moderate group and individually matched participants with normal renal function were assigned to the normal group.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All participants were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Participants attended a specialist site which would then ensure that they (the participants) met all strictly implemented inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participants were not to be assigned to treatment groups if any one of the specific entry criteria were violated.</pre_assignment_details>
