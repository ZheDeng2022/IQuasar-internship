  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test whether a short educational intervention about emotional&#xD;
      skills can improve survivor cancer patient emotional skills and quality of life. Half of&#xD;
      participants will follow the educational intervention about emotional skills, while the other&#xD;
      half will practice relaxation followed by a non-directive talking group. The educational&#xD;
      intervention should give better results on patient emotional skills and quality of life than&#xD;
      the control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the end of treatments, cancer patients face a difficult time because it is expected&#xD;
      that they return to normal, but at the same time they still have to struggle with the&#xD;
      aftermath of cancer and fear of recurrence. This is why there is room in this period for an&#xD;
      intervention designed to help patients to cope with their emotions. . Patient emotional&#xD;
      skills are patient abilities to identify, express and manage their emotions for the best&#xD;
      possible psychological adjustment. In general population, emotional skills have been shown to&#xD;
      be highly related to a better quality of life. In this randomized controlled study,&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary and oesogastric cancer patients between 6 months and 2 years after the end&#xD;
      of treatments will undergo either the emotional skills intervention (intervention group) or&#xD;
      the relaxation group (control group).&#xD;
