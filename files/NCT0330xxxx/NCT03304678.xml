      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, progressive disease. It usually affects women in&#xD;
      the prime of their lives. It typically results in lung destruction. Studies have shown that a&#xD;
      drug called sirolimus stabilizes lung function in people with LAM. But researchers do not&#xD;
      know what drug dose and blood serum levels are needed to reach this stability. Researchers&#xD;
      want to learn more about the right dose of sirolimus for people with LAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if blood and urine markers after 1 dose and again after 3 months can be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the correct dose of sirolimus for people with LAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women ages 18-90 with LAM whose doctors have decided they should start taking sirolimus to&#xD;
      treat it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 1, participants will take their first dose of sirolimus by mouth at the clinic. They&#xD;
      will have blood and urine collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take 1 tablet of the study drug each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 will be 3 months after visit 1. Participants will have blood and urine collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant samples will be stored in a secure place. No personal data will be connected to&#xD;
      them.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sirolimus (rapamycin), which acts as a targeted inhibitor of the protein mechanistic target&#xD;
      of rapamycin (mTOR), has been shown to be effective in patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis&#xD;
      (LAM). It stabilizes lung function, resolves chylous effusions and lymphangioleiomas and&#xD;
      shrinks angiomyolipomas. The current study is to understand better the short-term action of&#xD;
      the drug by following the effects on potential biomarkers in blood and urine. Patients with&#xD;
      LAM will have samples taken prior to administration of first dose of the drug, at 1 hr and&#xD;
      then at 23 hours after the drug (trough level). At 3 and 9 months, samples will be obtained&#xD;
      at trough and 1 hour after the dose. Molecular and cellular analyses will be performed to&#xD;
      look for potential biomarkers.&#xD;
