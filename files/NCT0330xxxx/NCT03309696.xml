  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This device-study includes a pilot, physiological investigation of normal human subjects. The&#xD;
      aim is to determine how existing non-invasive neuromodulation devices affect brain circuitry&#xD;
      as measured by EEG recording. Currently, the application of non-invasive neuromodulation is&#xD;
      rarely guided by detailed knowledge of how neural activity is altered in the brain circuits&#xD;
      that are targeted for intervention. This gap in knowledge is problematic for interpreting&#xD;
      response variability, which is common. To address this gap, the current proposal aims to&#xD;
      combine two forms of neuromodulation sequentially, transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), to regulate homeostatic&#xD;
      plasticity prior to rTMS delivery at different frequencies of rTMS. Homeostatic plasticity,&#xD;
      the initial activation state of a targeted circuit, is a key determinant of whether rTMS&#xD;
      induces long term potentiation (LTP) or long term depression (LTD) Yet, homeostatic&#xD;
      plasticity is rarely measured or controlled in rTMS studies. We aim to control homeostatic&#xD;
      plasticity by preconditioning the targeted circuits with tDCS prior to rTMS delivery. The&#xD;
      protocol included an exploratory aim to examine physiological changes in patients with&#xD;
      tinnitus but this aim was not part of the pilot physiological investigation and it could not&#xD;
      be completed due to funding limitations.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale: The current proposal aims to combine two forms of neuromodulation,&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS), to regulate homeostatic plasticity prior to rTMS delivery at two&#xD;
      different frequencies (1Hz and 10Hz). Homeostatic plasticity, the initial activation state of&#xD;
      a targeted circuit, is a theoretical determinant of whether rTMS induces long term&#xD;
      potentiation (LTP) or long term depression (LTD).Yet, homeostatic plasticity is rarely&#xD;
      measured or controlled in rTMS studies. In a physiological investigation of health subjects,&#xD;
      we aim to control homeostatic plasticity by preconditioning the targeted circuits with tDCS&#xD;
      prior to rTMS delivery. The justification for this study is that controlling homeostatic&#xD;
      plasticity can reduce subject variability and the knowledge gained can be used to optimize&#xD;
      rTMS delivery. What is needed to move the field forward is a method for combining tDCS and&#xD;
      rTMS and for measuring neuronal responses directly which we aim to establish in this study.&#xD;
      The pilot study project will examine the targeted effects of neuromodulation in normal&#xD;
      subjects. The brain regions targeted for intervention include auditory areas in the temporal&#xD;
      cortex (TC) that process sounds and functionally connected regions of the dorsolateral&#xD;
      frontal cortex (DLFC) that mediate sensory habituation. Due to funding limitations, only the&#xD;
      1 Hz rTMS condition could be initiated.&#xD;

    <description>TEPs refer to TMS-evoked EEG potentials. The P100 amplitude of TEPs is one means of assessing cortical excitability. The P100 amplitude has been shown to be a reliable metric in studies of healthy subjects. The P100 amplitude is used in this study to assess the excitation state of two regions of interest (ROIs), one in the TC and one in the DLPFC, at each period of TEP recording (i.e., Baseline, Post tDCS, Post rTMS, and 20 minute delay).</description>

        <title>Log Transformed P100 Amplitude of TEPs From the Global Mean Field Analysis.</title>
        <description>TEPs refer to TMS-evoked EEG potentials. The P100 amplitude of TEPs is one means of assessing cortical excitability. The P100 amplitude has been shown to be a reliable metric in studies of healthy subjects. The P100 amplitude is used in this study to assess the excitation state of two regions of interest (ROIs), one in the TC and one in the DLPFC, at each period of TEP recording (i.e., Baseline, Post tDCS, Post rTMS, and 20 minute delay).</description>

        <population>The analyses population is 5 subjects who were assigned to the arm &quot;tDCS and 1 Hz rTMS over the temporal cortex&quot;. The group titles reflect sequences of sham and active tDCS and rTMS conditions used to create contrasts for data analysis. Outcome measures are not reported for the DLPF arm because, due to insufficient resources and the required personnel needed to perform the extensive data cleaning and pipeline analysis, no P100 amplitude data can be reported.</population>

          <description>Adverse events data were collected irrespective of Arm/Group assignment. Adverse events were coded as either serious/nonserious, expected/unexpected, and related or unrelated to the intervention. There was only 1 adverse event (a mild headache, which was nonserious, expected and related to active rTMS).</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Our pilot study funding ended. Subjects could not be recruited for the 10 Hz rTMS arm. A proposed study of tinnitus patients could not be initiated. Data analysis could only be completed for one arm.</limitations_and_caveats>
