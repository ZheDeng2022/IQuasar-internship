  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized pilot study of patients who will undergo either early or&#xD;
      late incisional laser therapy after breast reduction surgery to alleviate scar burden at NYU&#xD;
      Langone Medical Center. The purpose of this study is to see how well carbon dioxide (CO2)&#xD;
      laser therapy works at preventing scar formation after surgery.CO2 laser therapy is currently&#xD;
      being used by dermatologists and plastic surgeons to help with scarring after acne and to&#xD;
      rejuvenate the face; its benefits are now being explored by medical professionals in&#xD;
      dermatology and cosmetic surgery to prevent scarring after surgery.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of all ethnic origins will be considered, although certain ethnic groups will&#xD;
             be preferentially excluded more than others such as black and South Asian patients due&#xD;
             to our exclusion criteria related to darker skin individuals (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing bilateral breast reduction surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males will be excluded from this study as male patients rarely undergo breast&#xD;
             reduction surgery. When males do undergo breast reduction surgery for gynecomastia, it&#xD;
             is often unilateral, and is performed with several techniques and incision types that&#xD;
             are not typical employed during female breast reduction. Thus, for this study, only&#xD;
             female patients will be considered (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient enrolled in this study who shows evidence of delayed wound healing,&#xD;
             dehiscence, or post operative infection at the first post operative visit will be&#xD;
             excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with darker skin (Fitzpatrick IV and above), which is a well-known&#xD;
             contraindication to laser therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior breast surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior chest/breast irradiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with the following diseases which interferes with wound healing: prior&#xD;
             hypertrophic scarring/keloids, type I or type II Diabetes Mellitus, autoimmune&#xD;
             diseases/collagen vascular diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are active smokers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients using blood thinners that cannot be stopped&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have used aspirin within a week of the procedure date&#xD;
