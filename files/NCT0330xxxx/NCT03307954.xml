  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to rapid and profound bone loss with large decreases in bone&#xD;
      mineral density (BMD) below the level of the lesion. Decreases in BMD of ~2% per month from&#xD;
      the lower limbs have been reported and rates of loss are maximal over the first two years. As&#xD;
      a consequence, there is an increased risk of fragility fractures particularly of the lower&#xD;
      limbs including an increased risk of hip fracture. Lower limb fragility fractures affect up&#xD;
      to 35% of patients following SCI. These fractures are associated with considerable morbidity&#xD;
      and an increase in mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single centre UK study will determine if it is feasible to carry out a randomised&#xD;
      controlled BMD study in the acute SCI patient population. The study will compare the BMD of&#xD;
      patients who receive Ekso Therapy (powered exoskeleton device) verse patients who receive&#xD;
      usual physiotherapy alone (control group). It will address patient recruitment rates and&#xD;
      reasons for withdrawal from the study and highlight any practicality issues with study&#xD;
      conduct. It will also provide preliminary data on the effects of Ekso Therapy on BMD,&#xD;
      biochemistry and bone turnover markers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are an estimated 40,000 people living with a Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) in the UK alone&#xD;
      (http://www.apparelyzed.com/statistics.html).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to rapid and profound bone loss with large decreases in bone&#xD;
      mineral density (BMD) below the level of the lesion (Frey-Rindova et al., 2000). Decreases in&#xD;
      BMD of ~2% per month from the lower limbs have been reported and rates of loss are maximal&#xD;
      over the first two years (Jiang et al., 2005). Bone loss is associated with increased bone&#xD;
      resorption and remodelling imbalance which is thought to be due to the combined effects of&#xD;
      immobility together with neurogenic effects. As a consequence, there is an increased risk of&#xD;
      fragility fractures particularly of the lower limbs including an increased risk of hip&#xD;
      fracture. Lower limb fragility fractures affect up to 35% of patients following SCI. These&#xD;
      fractures are associated with considerable morbidity and an increase in mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMD is conventionally measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). This technique&#xD;
      enables measurement of bone mineral content, projected area and areal BMD at the lumbar spine&#xD;
      and proximal femur. DXA does not allow differentiation between cortical and trabecular bone&#xD;
      and does not have the ability to examine microstructural change. High resolution peripheral&#xD;
      quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a novel technique which enables changes in&#xD;
      trabecular and cortical microstructure to be evaluated. Using HR-pQCT it is possible to&#xD;
      detect changes in surrogate measures of bone strength in response to loss of weight bearing&#xD;
      activity over just 6 weeks (Kazakia et al, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is no established intervention which has been demonstrated to prevent or&#xD;
      reverse bone loss and fractures in this clinical setting. Small studies have suggested that&#xD;
      anti-resorptive agents including bisphosphonates (Bryson et al., 2009) and denosumab (Gifre&#xD;
      et al., 2015) have potential to protect against bone loss following SCI. Physical therapy&#xD;
      using vibration was ineffective (Dudley-Javoroski et al., 2015) as was an ambulation&#xD;
      programme undertaken late in the management of SCI (Needham-Shropshire et al., 1997). Once&#xD;
      bone loss has occurred, it appears to be at best only partially reversible on recovery of&#xD;
      lower limb function. It has been postulated that weight-bearing activity on its own&#xD;
      (Dionyssiotis et al., 2015) or perhaps in combination with anti-resorptive treatment has the&#xD;
      potential to preserve or improve bone health following SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2014, a new therapy service called 'Ekso Therapy' was introduced at the Sheffield Princess&#xD;
      Royal Spinal Injuries Centre. Ekso is a revolutionary powered exoskeleton device, which is&#xD;
      strapped on to patients with a SCI to enable them to stand and walk. The device is&#xD;
      manufactured by Ekso Bionics and is CE marked. It has been reported to be a good form of&#xD;
      exercise allowing patients to stretch, and is claimed to be beneficial for muscle strength,&#xD;
      bone health, bowel and bladder function and circulation and has a positive psychological&#xD;
      impact. None of these claims have been investigated or proven in large clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single centre UK study will therefore determine if it is feasible to carry out a&#xD;
      randomised controlled bone study in the acute SCI patient population using the Ekso device.&#xD;
      Investigators will compare the BMD of acute SCI patients before and after they receive a&#xD;
      programme of Ekso Therapy alongside their usual physiotherapy and compare it to patients who&#xD;
      receive standing therapy with usual physiotherapy alone (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will address patient recruitment rates and reasons for withdrawal from the study and&#xD;
      highlight any practicality issues with study conduct. It will also provide preliminary data&#xD;
      on the effects of Ekso Therapy on bone mineral density, biochemistry and bone turnover&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
