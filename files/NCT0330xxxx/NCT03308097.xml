  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop and test an interactive mobile messaging intervention to improve&#xD;
      engagement in care related to Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and decrease HIV risk behaviors&#xD;
      for Black men who have sex with men living in the Southern U.S. The mobile messaging&#xD;
      intervention will include interactive text messaging and free, publicly available links to&#xD;
      websites and YouTube videos. During the intervention participants will gain information about&#xD;
      their health, improve motivation for engagement in PrEP related care, and build skills for&#xD;
      healthy behaviors. Participants will also receive intervention materials to help decrease&#xD;
      frequent barriers to care. If the intervention is found to be effective, it can be tested in&#xD;
      a larger study and then disseminated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The uptake of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) has been slow for young Black men who have sex&#xD;
      with men (BMSM) living in the Southern United States. This is a significant issue because&#xD;
      eight of the ten states with the highest rates of new HIV infections are located in the&#xD;
      South. Jackson, Mississippi (MS) (the site of this project) has the second highest AIDS&#xD;
      diagnosis rate in the nation, and the highest rate of HIV infection for young urban Black men&#xD;
      who have sex with men. This study will develop and test an engaging, interactive, and cost&#xD;
      effective mobile messaging intervention to improve linkage to PrEP care for BMSM (18-35 yrs)&#xD;
      living in Jackson, MS. BMSM eligible for PrEP, receiving care at the University of&#xD;
      Mississippi Medical Center sexually-transmitted infections (STI)/HIV testing clinics, will be&#xD;
      texted interactive links to publicly available, online content about PrEP and HIV prevention.&#xD;
      Links will be sent to PrEP eligible BMSM by 8-16 interactive text messages over 4 weeks. The&#xD;
      material used in the intervention will be consistent with the Information Motivation Behavior&#xD;
      (IMB) Model and will address cultural and structural barriers to initiating PrEP care. A&#xD;
      small randomized controlled study among 66 new participants in the clinics will examine the&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of the intervention compared to enhanced standard of care on attendance&#xD;
      at a PrEP Services Appointment (the first step in initiating PrEP care). It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that, compared to BMSM receiving enhanced standard of care, BMSM receiving the PrEP Mobile&#xD;
      Messaging Intervention will show greater attendance at a PrEP Services Appointment and&#xD;
      decreased HIV risk behavior at 4 and 16 weeks.&#xD;
