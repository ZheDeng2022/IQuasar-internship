      Endometriosis and adenomyosis can impact on the quality of life including the physical,&#xD;
      psychological and social aspects. It is important to include quality of life measurements in&#xD;
      evaluating the disease severity and response to any given treatment. The 30-item&#xD;
      Endometriosis Health Profile (EHP-30), derived from in-depth interviews of patients with&#xD;
      endometriosis, is currently the most reliable questionnaire for health-related quality of&#xD;
      life measurement in women with endometriosis. It includes specific questions addressing the&#xD;
      problems faced by patients with endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, this widely accepted tool does not have a traditional Chinese version for the&#xD;
      measurement of health-related quality of life of endometriosis in Hong Kong. Furthermore,&#xD;
      adenomyosis and endometriosis share similar histological and clinical symptomatology, but&#xD;
      application of EHP-30 to adenomyosis has never been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the present study are to translate the EHP-30 English version into traditional&#xD;
      Chinese version and to evaluate its psychometric properties in endometriosis and adenomyosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that EHP-30 (Hong Kong) traditional Chinese questionnaire has&#xD;
      high internal consistency, construct validity, reproducibility as the original English&#xD;
      version and can be applicable to Hong Kong Chinese women with endometriosis and adenomyosis.&#xD;

      Endometriosis is a chronic condition caused by the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue&#xD;
      outside the uterus, affecting the fallopian tubes, ovaries, pelvic peritoneum or even the&#xD;
      urinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Adenomyosis is characterized by the presence of ectopic&#xD;
      endometrial gland and stroma in the myometrium with associated myometrial hypertrophy and&#xD;
      hyperplasia. Adenomyosis has been reported to occur in 30-60% of the hysterectomy&#xD;
      specimen.Endometriosis causes painful symptoms including dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain,&#xD;
      dyspareunia and infertility. Adenomyosis also causes clinically significant symptoms include&#xD;
      dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain and heavy menstrual flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both conditions can impact on the quality of life including the physical, psychological and&#xD;
      social aspects. It is important to include quality of life measurements in evaluating the&#xD;
      disease severity and response to any given treatment. The 30-item Endometriosis Health&#xD;
      Profile (EHP-30), derived from in-depth interviews of patients with endometriosis, is&#xD;
      currently the most reliable questionnaire for health-related quality of life measurement in&#xD;
      women with endometriosis. It includes specific questions addressing the problems faced by&#xD;
      patients with endometriosis. It also exhibits good reliability, validity and&#xD;
      interpretability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EHP-30 has recently been translated into simplified Chinese version and evaluated with&#xD;
      psychometric tests which showed the simplified Chinese version is a valid, reliable and&#xD;
      acceptable tool for the measurement of the health-related quality of life of women with&#xD;
      endometriosis in mainland China. Unfortunately, this widely accepted tool does not have a&#xD;
      traditional Chinese version for the measurement of health-related quality of life of&#xD;
      endometriosis in Hong Kong. Furthermore, adenomyosis and endometriosis share similar&#xD;
      histological and clinical symptomatology, but application of EHP-30 to adenomyosis has not&#xD;
      been studied. The aims of the present study are to translate the EHP-30 English version into&#xD;
      traditional Chinese version and to evaluate its psychometric properties in endometriosis and&#xD;
      adenomyosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EHP-30 consists of 30 items in English, grouping into five subscales measuring pain (11&#xD;
      items), control and powerlessness (6 items), emotions (6 items), social support (4 items) and&#xD;
      self-image (3 items) in part one. Part two consists of 23 items, grouping into six subscales&#xD;
      may not be applicable to all adenomyosis patients: work (5 items), relationship with children&#xD;
      (2 items), sexual intercourse (5 items), medical profession (4 items), treatment (3 items)&#xD;
      and infertility (4 items). Participants choose their response from a five point likert scale&#xD;
      from 0 to 4. Items within each subscale will be added up to generate a subscale score. Then,&#xD;
      the subscale score is divided by maximum possible score and multiply by 100 to give a health&#xD;
      status score which 100 represent worst health and 0 represent best health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, approval to use EHP-30 will be obtained from the original author, Dr Georgina Jones.&#xD;
      We will adhere to the Good Practice for the Translation and Cultural adaptation process for&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes measures guideline. 6 The EHP-30 will be evaluated by 2 bilingual&#xD;
      researchers in the fields of gynaecology independently and decide if any item will be&#xD;
      regarded as inappropriate. They will then perform the forward translation of the EHP-30 to&#xD;
      traditional Chinese independently. After that, they will review the two versions of&#xD;
      translation and hold a meeting for discussion on items of discrepancy, in order to produce&#xD;
      one version. Back-translation will be performed by another 2 persons who are professional in&#xD;
      Chinese-English translation, after the iterative evaluation of forward translation process.&#xD;
      The original and back-translated versions will be compared for accuracy and comprehension by&#xD;
      another two monolingual researchers. If substantial differences existed between the two&#xD;
      original and the back-translated versions, the translation-back translation process are&#xD;
      repeated until a questionnaire representative of the original is obtained. Finally, the&#xD;
      back-translated version will be sent to Dr Georgina Jones and the colleagues. Comments on the&#xD;
      back-translated version will be obtained from them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot phase of the translated questionnaire Chinese women attending the Gynaecology clinic of&#xD;
      New Territories East Cluster with pelvic painful symptoms will be invited to join the study.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include an age of less than 18 years, mental incapacity that would&#xD;
      preclude completion of the questionnaire and those who refuse to join. Written consent will&#xD;
      be obtained from them by a research assistant. They will be asked to complete the EHP-30 and&#xD;
      SF-36 at the specialty clinic. After filling in the questionnaires, they will be asked to&#xD;
      give comments on the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient attending the gynaecology clinic who fulfills the inclusion criteria and without&#xD;
      any exclusion criteria will be invited for participation in the study. If the patient is&#xD;
      willing to participate, written consent will be obtained from the patient. The study&#xD;
      investigators will record demographic features and characteristics of the disease. The&#xD;
      patient will be asked to complete the traditional-Chinese version of EHP-30 and&#xD;
      traditional-Chinese version of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item health survey&#xD;
      (SF-36). 11-13 Demographic data collected include age, height, weight, education level,&#xD;
      marital status, monthly household income and employment status. Disease characteristics for&#xD;
      endometriosis include intensity of painful symptoms by visual analog scale (VAS), menstrual&#xD;
      blood loss by pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) and intraoperative scoring of the&#xD;
      severity of endometriosis. Disease characteristics for adenomyosis include VAS scores on&#xD;
      painful symptoms, size of uterus and size of adenomyosis and menstrual blood loss by&#xD;
      pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploring the impact of quality of life is important to clinical practice. The Medical&#xD;
      Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item health survey (SF-36) is a generic type of Health Related&#xD;
      Quality of Life (HRQoL) assessment tool widely used in different disease conditions.&#xD;
      Questionnaire which assesses eight dimensions of QoL of an individual. A higher score means a&#xD;
      better quality of life. It has been used to study QoL in normal populations as well as&#xD;
      patients suffering illnesses and estimating the relative burden of different diseases. 11-13&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are expected to spend within 30 minutes on questionnaire survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study for test-retest reliability, patient with endometriosis and adenomyosis&#xD;
      scheduled for operation will be asked to complete the first set of questionnaires, EHP-30 and&#xD;
      SF-36, when they attend for the pre-operative assessment clinic. The same set of EHP-30 will&#xD;
      be completed when they are admitted for operation. In order to study the measurement&#xD;
      properties of the questionnaire, the same set of EHP-30 and SF-36 will be given at the usual&#xD;
      postoperative follow up visit which is usually scheduled 3-6 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study for test-retest reliability, patient with endometriosis and adenomyosis not&#xD;
      scheduled for operation will be asked to complete the first set of questionnaires, EHP-30 and&#xD;
      SF-36, at recruitment and a set of EHP-30 will be completed 2 weeks later and return by the&#xD;
      return envelope provided. In order to study the measurement properties of the questionnaire,&#xD;
      the same set of EHP-30 and SF-36 will be given at the usual gynaecology follow up visit which&#xD;
      is usually scheduled 3-6 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be asked to report any important health or life changes that occur between&#xD;
      the questionnaires.&#xD;
