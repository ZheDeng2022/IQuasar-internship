  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary vascular dysfunction (DVP) is associated with a pejorative prognosis during ARDS.&#xD;
      There is no specific therapeutic intervention to thwart it. Extracorporeal CO2 purification&#xD;
      (ECCO2-R) is a technique that has been very rapidly diffused and adopted in intensive care&#xD;
      since commercialization of the devices but, the formal clinical evaluation is insufficient.&#xD;
      It could significantly improve the prognosis of patients with both DVP and refractory&#xD;
      hypercapnia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-comparative, open-label, multicenter regional study, without&#xD;
      random drawing or blindfolding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is the correction by ECCO2-R of hypercapnia in patients&#xD;
      with DVP in moderate to severe ARDS under protective ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients with hypercapnia correction (defined as a&#xD;
      20% decrease in PaCO2 at H2 of ECCO2-R initiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate that ECCO2-R allows in hypercapnic ARDS and DVP patients to correct&#xD;
           hypercapnia with H6 and H24, improve DVP and hemodynamics, reduce alveolar dead space,&#xD;
           improvement of respiratory mechanics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the tolerance of the evaluated technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Relative change of capnia to H6 and H24 in relation to H0; proportion of patients with a&#xD;
      decrease of at least 20% of PaCO2 to H6 and H24; changes in echocardiographic indices;&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters; alveolar deadspace and respiratory mechanics to H2, H6 and H24,&#xD;
      compared to H0; Complications, Mortality at reanimation discharge (or on D28 if this date&#xD;
      occurs before discharge of reanimation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is based on the use of ECCO2-R (PrismaLung®, Prismaflex ® Baxter) in&#xD;
      eligible patients. ECCO2-R will be initiated as soon as possible after inclusion, for a&#xD;
      duration of at least 24 H (possibly prolonged up to 72 H at the decision of reanimator), by&#xD;
      jugular or femoral vein-venous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The size of the catheters, the machine settings, in particular the blood flow and sweep will&#xD;
      be standardized according to the state of the art and the recommendations of the manufacturer&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ECO2R venous technique uses devices consisting of a monitor, an exchanger and a pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The PrismaLung® Kit (Baxter): Single-use EC-marked extracorporeal circuit intended for&#xD;
           use for at least 24 hours (maximum 72 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The PrismaLung® kit is intended for use with the Prismaflex® monitor with software&#xD;
           version 8.10 or later and its support in conjunction with Prismaflex® single use&#xD;
           treatment sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Prismaflex HP-X Set (Baxter): blood line set for extracorporeal blood circulation,&#xD;
           EC marked or the HF 1400® set (Baxter) (for extra-corporeal CO2 purification combined&#xD;
           with purification).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Prismaflex® monitor (Baxter), EC marked, is used routinely in intensive care&#xD;
           (continuous extra-renal purification, therapeutic plasma exchange, haemoperfusion,&#xD;
           hemopurification).&#xD;
&#xD;
      So that each center has a dedicated monitor for research, this device will be provided by the&#xD;
      Baxter laboratory. The monitor will be equipped with a holder for the Prismalung kit marked&#xD;
      CE.&#xD;

    <description>A low-flow CO2 removal device (Prismalung®, Baxter) will be used with a conventional renal replacement therapy (RRT) platform (Prismaflex®, Baxter). In patients already treated with continuous RRT because of renal failure or metabolic acidosis, the HF 1400® (Baxter) set will be used to combine RRT and decarboxylation. Gas flow through the gas exchanger will be set up to 10 L/min, with an oxygen concentration from 0.21 to 1 and a blood flow of 200-400 mL/min. Patients will be ventilated with a target tidal volume of 6 ml/kg (predicted body weight) and a target plateau pressure below 30 cmH2O.</description>
