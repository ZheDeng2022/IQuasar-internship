      Several free fatty acids receptors (FFARs) have been discovered. These have been implicated&#xD;
      in metabolic processes and inflammation. Consequently, these receptors have attracted&#xD;
      interest as targets for the treatment of metabolic and inflammatory diseases, including&#xD;
      obesity and type 2 diabetes. Two of these FFARs (FFA1, FFA4), which is activated by specific&#xD;
      free fatty acids (FFAs), is expressed on enteroendocrine cells, pancreatic beta-cells and&#xD;
      adipocytes. They have been linked to 1) increased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion&#xD;
      and hence the incretin-mediated increase in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and&#xD;
      suppression of glucagon secretion, 2) a direct positive effect on GSIS, 3) reduced&#xD;
      inflammation and 4) improved insulin sensitivity. These functions and the abundance of fatty&#xD;
      acids in food suggest that FFARs can be considered as nutrient sensing regulators of&#xD;
      metabolism. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), frequently results in immediate beneficial&#xD;
      effects on glucose metabolism and often complete remission of type 2 diabetes. This may in&#xD;
      part be explained by increased GLP-1 levels after surgery. It appears that the effect depends&#xD;
      on nutrient delivery directly to the lower parts of the small intestine. It is possible that&#xD;
      the RYGB effects are partly due to enteroendocrine stimulation of FFA1 and perhaps FFA4 by&#xD;
      direct nutrient delivery, i.e. FFA release in the lower intestines. Pinolenic acid from pine&#xD;
      nuts has been shown to be a potent dual FFA1/FFA4 agonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these findings the investigators have planned a number of human intervention studies&#xD;
      in order to investigate 1) the optimal oral formulation of pine nut oil 2) whether it is&#xD;
      possible to mimic the beneficial effects observed after RYGB, 2) if it is possible to&#xD;
      increase GLP-1 secretion by stimulating FFA1/FFA4 on enteroendocrine cells causing improved&#xD;
      GSIS and increased satiety and 3) enhancement of GSIS by directly stimulating FFA1 on&#xD;
      beta-cells.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the greatest health challenges worldwide. The disease is&#xD;
      strongly associated with obesity, and develops via pre-diabetic conditions, where insulin&#xD;
      resistance and low-grade inflammation play an important role, to T2D, where failure of the&#xD;
      pancreatic beta-cell to compensate for insulin resistance causes hyperglycemia. According to&#xD;
      recent estimates, 350 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes. The disease typically&#xD;
      leads to many years of reduced quality of life due to complications such as cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD), blindness, kidney failure and amputations. T2D is estimated to be the 4th&#xD;
      leading cause of death in the Western world with 5-10 years reduced life expectancy. It is&#xD;
      generally agreed that a healthy diet and increased physical activity are effective in&#xD;
      preventing T2D, and also may help to achieve a better control of T2D and reduce the risk of&#xD;
      CVD. There is, however, not a general agreement as to what a healthy diet constitutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last decade, several cell surface receptors that respond to free fatty acids&#xD;
      (FFAs) have been discovered. These free fatty acid receptors (FFARs) belong to the&#xD;
      superfamily of G protein-coupled 7-transmembrane receptors (GPRs), and have all been&#xD;
      implicated in metabolic processes, energy expenditure and inflammation. Consequently, several&#xD;
      of the receptors have attracted interest as potential targets for the treatment of metabolic&#xD;
      and inflammatory diseases, including obesity and T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FFA1 (GPR40), which is activated by long-chain FFAs, is highly expressed in pancreatic&#xD;
      β-cells and increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) [4]. There is evidence that&#xD;
      FFA1 is also expressed in intestinal enteroendocrine cells, where it promotes secretion of&#xD;
      incretin hormones such as GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). GLP-1 is&#xD;
      highly interesting for treatment of obesity and T2D because of its ability to increase GSIS,&#xD;
      enhance β-cell growth, increase insulin sensitivity, reduce gastric motility, increase&#xD;
      satiety and cause a loss of weight. The published phase II clinical trial with the selective&#xD;
      FFA1 agonist TAK-875 demonstrated high efficacy in reducing plasma glucose without increased&#xD;
      incidence of hypoglycemia, and has caused considerable interest in the receptor as a new&#xD;
      target for treatment of T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FFA4 (GPR120), which is activated by unsaturated long-chain FFA, is expressed in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal system, adipose tissue, and β-cells, and is reported to promote GLP-1&#xD;
      secretion from intestinal cells, to counteract inflammation and to increase insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity in adipose tissue. Notably, dysfunctional FFA4 was recently connected to the&#xD;
      development of obesity in both mice and humans. This has considerably increased the interest&#xD;
      on the receptor as a target for obesity and metabolic diseases. This is supported by&#xD;
      indications that unsaturated FFAs revert diet-induced hypothalamic inflammation through FFA4,&#xD;
      and thereby reduce body weight in diet-induced obese mice. These FFARs are thus expressed in&#xD;
      different tissues in the body where they potentially can affect metabolic and inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions such as T2D and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These functions combined and the abundance of fatty acids in food suggests that FFARs can be&#xD;
      considered as nutrient sensing regulators of metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, often used to treat severe obesity, frequently&#xD;
      results in immediate beneficial effects on glucose metabolism in T2D, often with complete&#xD;
      remission. These effects are in part independent of weight loss, but may be explained by a&#xD;
      significant increase in GLP-1 levels immediately after surgery. Thus, it appears that the&#xD;
      effect depends on delivery of nutrients and pancreatic juices directly to the lower parts of&#xD;
      the ileum. Normally, FFAs are rapidly absorbed in the upper parts of the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract. It is therefore possible that the RYGB effects are partly due to enteroendocrine&#xD;
      stimulation of FFA1 and perhaps FFA4 by direct nutrient delivery that is FFA release in the&#xD;
      lower intestines. A hypothesis to be investigated in this PhD project is that delivery of a&#xD;
      specific naturally occurring polyunsaturated FFA with proven high efficacy on both FFA1 and&#xD;
      FFA4 directly to the lower intestines can mimic the beneficial effects observed after RYGB&#xD;
      with less expense and fewer adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of a higher load of unabsorbed FFA to the distal small intestine can be achieved by&#xD;
      taking advantage of enteric coating that dissolves at pH &gt;6.0, which is observed in the lumen&#xD;
      of the distal jejunum, ileum and colon, and is independent of the colonic flora. This enteric&#xD;
      coating technology is well established for delivering drugs to the ileum and colon. The&#xD;
      potential positive effect of this principle was recently reported in a small cohort of&#xD;
      patients with T2D. Thus, delivery of small amounts of lauric acid (a C12 fatty acid) to the&#xD;
      distal gut using enteric-coated pellets stimulated GLP-1 secretion and lowered postprandial&#xD;
      glucose levels in response to meals. No chronic effects where tested in this study. Although&#xD;
      not suggested by the authors, the increased release of GLP-1 could involve direct stimulation&#xD;
      of FFAR1 and/or FFAR4 by lauric acid in the distal gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a part of the FFARMED project supported by the Danish Council for Strategic Research, a&#xD;
      screening of 36 relevant FFAs and their ability to act as FFA1 and FFA4 agonists in vitro&#xD;
      have been carried out to identify the most potent naturally occurring dual FFA1/FFA4 agonist&#xD;
      for clinical studies. Of these, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), pinolenic acid showed&#xD;
      a significantly higher efficacy than the others, and was therefore selected for further&#xD;
      studies. To further support this choice, the effect of pinolenic acid has been tested using a&#xD;
      small dose (100 mg/kg) given 30 min prior to an oral glucose tolerance test in mice.&#xD;
      Convincingly, purified pinolenic acid significantly improved glucose tolerance by reducing&#xD;
      glucose levels when compared to control (corn oil). The efficacy was similar to that obtained&#xD;
      with a pharmaceutical selective FFA1 agonist (TUG-905). Pinolenic acid is a fatty acid&#xD;
      contained in Siberian Pine nuts, Korean Pine nuts and the seeds of other pines. The highest&#xD;
      percentage of pinolenic acid (~20%) is found in Siberian Pine nuts and the oil produced from&#xD;
      them. Korean Pine nut oil given as hydrolyzed FFAs, but not as triglycerides has been&#xD;
      reported to increase secretion of GLP-1 and decrease appetite in overweight females. This is&#xD;
      in coherence with previous results in mice, and indicates that purified pinolenic acid may be&#xD;
      superior in improving glucose metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: As described, the expression of FFA1 and FFA4 on intestinal enteroendocrine&#xD;
      cells, pancreatic beta-cells and adipose tissue has been linked to 1) increased secretion of&#xD;
      GLP-1 and hence the incretin-mediated increase in GSIS and suppression of glucagon secretion,&#xD;
      2) a direct positive effect on GSIS, 3) reduced inflammation and 4) improved insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity. Based on the above findings, the investigators are performing a number of&#xD;
      clinical trials using pinolenic acid derived from Siberian pine nuts as a naturally occurring&#xD;
      dual FFA1/FFA4 agonist. The investigators hypothesize that ingestion of a small amount of&#xD;
      pinolenic acid given as enteric-coated pellets dissolved in the lower intestines will 1)&#xD;
      increase GLP-1 secretion by stimulating FFA1/FFA4 on enteroendocrine cells causing improved&#xD;
      GSIS and increased satiety, 2) enhance GSIS by directly stimulating FFA1 on beta-cells, and&#xD;
      3) attenuate the low-grade inflammation seen in insulin resistant conditions such as obesity&#xD;
      and T2D by stimulating FFA4 on adipocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate: The dose-response effect of delayed release&#xD;
      pinolenic acid (hydrolyzed pine nut oil) on glucose tolerance, insulin and incretin&#xD;
      secretion, appetite and tolerability in healthy humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registration covers the third off five planned pilot studies investigating the effect of&#xD;
      hydrolyzed pine nut oil on glucose metabolism during an oral glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
