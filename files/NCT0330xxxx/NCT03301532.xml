    <textblock>
      To explore triheptanoin (C7 oil) compatibility with the ketogenic diet by evaluating EEG, and&#xD;
      seizure rate, glycemia and ketosis in proven G1D patients receiving a ketogenic diet.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single site, open label proof of principle exploratory trial to investigate the&#xD;
      compatibility of C7 oil with the ketogenic diet in subjects diagnosed with G1D. The ketogenic&#xD;
      diet will have been previously described by the patient's treating physician independently of&#xD;
      this study and for clinical reasons. The ketogenic diet supplies over 50% of calories from&#xD;
      fat, subjects, who are already tolerating over this much fat as part of their previously&#xD;
      prescribed ketogenic diet, will replace 45% of their daily caloric intake with the&#xD;
      triheptanoin for 24 hours, during a 48 hour inpatient stay. Subjects will have a continuous&#xD;
      EEG to monitor for any potential C7 related changes in seizure before, during, and after&#xD;
      triheptanoin oil ingestion.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of glucose transporter type 1 deficiency (G1D), confirmed by clinical&#xD;
             genotyping at a CLIA-certified laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable on ketogenic diet at 2.5:1 to 4:1 ratio (i.e., no changes in ratio will have&#xD;
             taken place for 2 months). The initiation of a ketogenic diet is previous to - and&#xD;
             thus is not part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females 30 months to 35 years and 11 months old inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with evidence of independent, unrelated metabolic and/or genetic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a chronic gastrointestinal disorder, such as irritable bowel syndrome,&#xD;
             crohn's disease, or colitis that could increase the subject's risk of developing&#xD;
             diarrhea or stomach pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a BMI (body mass index) greater than or equal to 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects currently not on ketogenic diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding may not participate. Women who plan to become&#xD;
             pregnant during the course of the study, or who are unwilling to use birth control to&#xD;
             prevent pregnancy (including abstinence) may not participate. Females age 10 and over&#xD;
             will be asked to provide a urine sample for a pregnancy test via dipstick. Subjects&#xD;
             will be asked to agree to abstinence or another form of birth control for the duration&#xD;
             of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy/sensitivity to C7&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous use of triheptanoin less than 1 month prior to study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with medium chain triglycerides in the last 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects exhibiting signs of dementia, or diagnosed with any degenerative brain&#xD;
             disorder (such as Alzheimer's disease) that would confound assessment of cognitive&#xD;
             changes, in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             would interfere with adherence to study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to give written&#xD;
             informed consent, or assent for children age 10-17,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Addition of a new antiseizure drug in the previous 3 months.&#xD;
