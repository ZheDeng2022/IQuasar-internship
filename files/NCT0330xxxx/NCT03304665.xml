  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To screen and create a list of adult volunteers in good health for participation&#xD;
      in research studies conducted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda,&#xD;
      Maryland. Develop a normative set of structural and functional brain MRI scans that are&#xD;
      linked to healthy research volunteer characteristics. Maximize scientific impact of data from&#xD;
      volunteers by broadly sharing with other researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Adult males and females in general good health who are 18 years of age and&#xD;
      older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Adult individuals who are interested in participating in NIMH IRP clinical studies as&#xD;
      a healthy research volunteer can directly visit or be directed to visit the study website&#xD;
      where they will first consent electronically and then complete a set of online self-report&#xD;
      measures. Items may include: demographic information, mental health symptoms, disability&#xD;
      status, substance use patterns, handedness and clinical/family history. Individuals who are&#xD;
      flagged based on predetermined responses to survey items will be further screened by a member&#xD;
      of the study clinical team. If found to be ineligible for the study because of a clinically&#xD;
      significant or unstable medical or mental health condition, these individuals will be&#xD;
      referred back to the community and/or given information about NIMH clinical studies for which&#xD;
      they may be eligible. Respondents with no flags or who pass through additional screening will&#xD;
      be scheduled for an in-person assessment. During the outpatient appointment and after&#xD;
      in-person informed consent, participants will receive a brief clinical interview to screen&#xD;
      for current medical and mental conditions, and risk for self-harm. They will complete&#xD;
      assessments of psychological, emotional, physiologic, biological and cognitive functioning.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a physical exam and be asked to provide blood and urine samples for&#xD;
      routine clinical labs as well as additional blood samples for future secondary analysis that&#xD;
      could include genetic or biomarker assays. Participants can separately consent for an&#xD;
      optional baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and an optional&#xD;
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) exam. All consent forms will explicitly inform participants that&#xD;
      if enrolled in the study, their de-identified data will be broadly and publicly shared&#xD;
      through NIH-approved data repositories. Participants in this recruitment and characterization&#xD;
      study will then be placed on a list of healthy research volunteers from which other NIMH IRP&#xD;
      studies may recruit according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria in their respective&#xD;
      IRB-approved protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Outcome measures may include demographic data, mental and medical history&#xD;
      and symptoms, results of psychological, emotional, physiologic, biological, and cognitive&#xD;
      testing, physical exam and MRI findings.&#xD;
