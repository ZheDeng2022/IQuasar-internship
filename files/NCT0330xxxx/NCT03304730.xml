      1. Introduction: Low back pain is one of the major health problems, studies show that it&#xD;
           can affect 80-85% of people throughout life; consisting of the second major cause of&#xD;
           work withdrawal. In the investigation by lumbar spine imaging methods, facet&#xD;
           osteoarthritis (FO) is one of the most prevalent diagnoses, in the order of 59.6% for&#xD;
           men and 66.7% for women. The process of osteoarthritis begins early in the spine, more&#xD;
           than half of adults are under 30 years old, presenting degenerative changes in the&#xD;
           facets, being more commonly affected the L4-L5 level. It is estimated that the pain of&#xD;
           facet origin corresponds to 30% of cases of low back pain. The treatment of low back&#xD;
           pain, which presents questionable results, has a strong economic impact on the health&#xD;
           system and represents a growing concern for public and medical policy makers. The lack&#xD;
           of diagnostic accuracy and the various types of treatment, without evidence of&#xD;
           appropriate effectiveness, are considered the main causes of the increasing costs of the&#xD;
           health system. As demonstrated by biomechanical, neuroanatomical and neurophysiological&#xD;
           studies, there are free and encapsulated nerve endings in the lumbar facet joints as&#xD;
           well as nerves containing substance P and peptide related to the calcitonin gene.&#xD;
           Chemical or mechanical stimuli can cause pain. The pathophysiology of facet pain is not&#xD;
           fully understood, but it is believed that facet osteoarthritis is due to repetitive&#xD;
           mechanical stress, with subsequent inflammation and elongation of the joint capsule,&#xD;
           generating pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Several treatments are used in low back pain secondary to FO. The most used are&#xD;
           non-hormonal anti-inflammatory drugs and physiotherapy, as a conservative measure.&#xD;
           Interventional procedures such as facet intraarticular or periarticular infiltration of&#xD;
           corticoid for neural blockade and denervation by radiofrequency are considered minimally&#xD;
           invasive options, indicated for cases in which conservative treatment fails. Surgical&#xD;
           treatment of arthrodesis is also part of the therapeutic options. The use of a systemic&#xD;
           corticosteroid is within the available therapeutic arsenal but has undesirable side&#xD;
           effects and its use is restricted in a short period of time. In order to increase drug&#xD;
           concentration at the symptom site, without the undesirable side effects of the systemic&#xD;
           corticosteroid, facet intraarticular infiltration (FI) has been used as a complementary&#xD;
           treatment. The therapeutic value of FI is not consensus, with widely divergent results&#xD;
           in the literature. Even so, it is one of the most used treatments, observing a growing&#xD;
           demand of this procedure in the last decades. The selection of the appropriate patient,&#xD;
           who would benefit from the treatment, is a determining factor in the outcome of the FI,&#xD;
           since in thesis, only the subgroup of patients with inflammatory process in activity in&#xD;
           the facet joint, would have a positive result with corticosteroid infiltration . The&#xD;
           identification of this subgroup of patients is a challenge because the diagnosis of&#xD;
           facet origin pain is often imprecise. With proper and accurate diagnosis, FI is expected&#xD;
           to achieve better results. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the ability to identify&#xD;
           the morphological characteristics of facet osteoarthritis, generating a classification&#xD;
           in degrees mild, moderate or severe. It also allows to diagnose the presence or absence&#xD;
           of an inflammatory process in the facet joint, which is usually manifested by indirect&#xD;
           signs such as bone edema, periarticular soft tissue edema, joint effusion and synovitis.&#xD;
           However, morphological characteristics and inflammatory markers of MR imaging have not&#xD;
           been tested as prognostic factors of FI efficacy. Patients' characteristics such as&#xD;
           gender, age, schooling, family income, smoking, body mass index, professional activity&#xD;
           may have an effect on the expected results, but they have not been tested as prognostic&#xD;
           factors of FI efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Rationale: The relationship between MRI findings of facet osteoarthritis and the&#xD;
           effect on FI of corticoid and anesthetic has not been studied. The relationship between&#xD;
           the characteristics of age, sex, education, family income, smoking, body mass index,&#xD;
           professional activity and the effect on FI of steroids and anesthetics has not been&#xD;
           studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Determining the prognostic factors may have an impact on the clinical routine of&#xD;
           physicians and patients, guiding the treatment and selecting those with chances of&#xD;
           better results with the FI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Hypotheses: MRI findings of facet osteoarthritis and patient characteristics are&#xD;
           prognostic factors for improvement or worsening of the clinical outcome after treatment&#xD;
           with FI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Purpose: To determine the prognostic factors of corticoid and anesthetic infiltration in&#xD;
           the treatment of facet osteoarthritis in the lumbar spine. To determine the association&#xD;
           between MRI imaging findings and pain, functional disability and patients' quality of&#xD;
           life. To determine the association between age, sex, schooling, family income, smoking,&#xD;
           body mass index, professional activity in pain, functional disability and quality of&#xD;
           life of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Method: This is a prospective cohort study that will include all patients with clinical&#xD;
           suspicion of facet pain, who have undergone MRI and have been referred to the&#xD;
           intervention center of the image department of a tertiary hospital, to perform FI with&#xD;
           corticoid and anesthetic. On the day of the procedure patients will be invited to&#xD;
           participate in the study. Before performing the facet infiltration patients will respond&#xD;
           to informed consent form (ICF) and five questionnaires: 1. data collection form; 2. the&#xD;
           visual analogue pain scale (VAS); 3. Roland-Morris questionnaire on functional&#xD;
           disability; 4. Oswestry questionnaire on functional disability; 5. EuroQol questionnaire&#xD;
           (EQ-5D) on quality of life. To measure the effect of the proposed treatment, all&#xD;
           patients will be followed for one year, responding by telephone VAS, Roland-Morris,&#xD;
           Oswestry and EQ-5D questionnaires at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the FI . The systemic&#xD;
           use of corticosteroids, the performance of another infiltration or surgery and the&#xD;
           amount of analgesics ingested per day will also be evaluated in the follow-up.&#xD;
           Researchers will only apply the specific questionnaires of the project, having no&#xD;
           influence on the indication, accomplishment and treatment of FI complications or on the&#xD;
           clinical routine of the intervention center. To characterize the sample, the following&#xD;
           variables will be collected: age (years), sex (male or female), schooling (years of&#xD;
           study), smoking (number of cigarettes per day), family income, professional activity&#xD;
           (type of occupation, number of hours sitting or standing, carrying weight or not) and&#xD;
           oral analgesic use (number of tablets taken per day). The FI procedure will be guided by&#xD;
           computed tomography. The radiation dose used will be the minimum possible to obtain&#xD;
           images with sufficient quality to guide the location and progression of the needle,&#xD;
           being within the limits established in the institutional protocols and already practiced&#xD;
           in the department. After image confirmation of the correct intraarticular positioning of&#xD;
           the needle, a solution containing triamcinolone 20mg / ml and hydrochloride of naropin&#xD;
           in a ratio of 1: 1, in the volume of 1.5 to 2.0 ml, will be injected. After the&#xD;
           procedure, the patient will be discharged and will be advised to do home rest for 24&#xD;
           hours. The study design proposes to determine the correlation between the clinical&#xD;
           outcome measured by the results of the VAS, Roland-Morris, Oswestry and EQ-5D&#xD;
           questionnaires, and the variables identified by MRI and also the correlation between the&#xD;
           clinical outcome and the variables: age, sex, educational level, smoking, family income,&#xD;
           body mass index (BMI), professional activity and amount of analgesics ingested per day .&#xD;
           To measure the effect of the proposed treatment, all patients will be followed for one&#xD;
           year, responding by telephone VAS, Roland-Morris, Oswestry and EQ-5D questionnaires at&#xD;
           1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the IF . The systemic use of corticosteroids, the&#xD;
           performance of another infiltration or surgery and the amount of analgesics ingested per&#xD;
           day will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Image exams and evaluator: All the lumbar spine MRI scans performed by the patients will&#xD;
      be analyzed. Two radiologist will read MRI exams without knowledge of clinical, laboratory,&#xD;
      or patient evaluation and questionnaire results. The variables degree of facet&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, bone edema, peri-articular edema, synovitis, effusion, osteophytes,&#xD;
      subchondral sclerosis, subchondral cysts, sliding, sagittal or horizontal orientation,&#xD;
      identified by MRI, will be tabulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Rating: MRI studies will be evaluated respecting patients' anonymity. Patients'&#xD;
      characteristics, MRI imaging findings and VAS, Roland-Morris, Oswestry and EQ-5D&#xD;
      questionnaires will be tabulated according to the following characteristics: age, sex,&#xD;
      schooling, family income, smoking, weight , height, body mass index (BMI), occupational&#xD;
      activity, analgesic ingestion, laterality, location, degree of facet arthritis, bone edema,&#xD;
      peri-articular edema, synovitis, effusion, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral&#xD;
      cysts, orientation sagittal or horizontal, facet sliding, VAS, Roland-Morris, EQ-5D and&#xD;
      Oswestry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Sample size estimation: Taking into account the main variable of the study as the&#xD;
      presence of inflammatory process in the facet joint, identified at MRI, with expected&#xD;
      prevalence of 30% in the sample and as the main outcome the functional disability, as&#xD;
      measured by the Roland-Morris questionnaire, when checking the sample size needed to detect a&#xD;
      difference between the groups, with and without inflammatory process, before and after the FI&#xD;
      procedure, it will require 117 patients in total, with a difference in the mean of the groups&#xD;
      of 4.0 points. This calculation considered that the standard deviation of the difference of&#xD;
      averages between the groups would be homogeneous and of 7.0 points, as observed in the&#xD;
      literature. Considering the possibility of loss of follow-up in 20% of the cases, it is&#xD;
      intended to include 147 patients in the study. Once the study has a six-month follow-up of 20&#xD;
      patients, the calculation of the sample size needed to compare the groups with and without&#xD;
      the inflammatory process will be recalculated based on the standard deviation observed in&#xD;
      this study. The calculations were made considering 80% test power and a significance level of&#xD;
      5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Statistical analysis: Patient characteristics, MRI findings and pain (VAS), disability&#xD;
      (Roland Morris and Oswestry), quality of life (EQ-5D) scores will be described by means of&#xD;
      absolute frequencies and percentages in categorical variables, or through means, standard&#xD;
      deviations or medians and quartiles, in addition to minimum and maximum values, in&#xD;
      quantitative variables. The MRI characteristics analyzed by two observers will be evaluated&#xD;
      for agreement by means of correlation coefficients appropriate to the observed distribution&#xD;
      of number of cases, such as the Kappa coefficient.To evaluate MRI findings and patient&#xD;
      characteristics (age, sex, smoking, family income, BMI, education, occupation and analgesic&#xD;
      intake) in the evolution of pain (VAS), disability (Roland Morris and Oswestry) and of&#xD;
      quality of life (EuroQol) during twelve months after infiltration, will be used mixed linear&#xD;
      models or generalized linear models, in multiple approaches, being such models appropriate&#xD;
      for measurements obtained from the same patient at different times. The results of the models&#xD;
      will be presented by effect estimates (change in mean pain or in means of functional&#xD;
      disability and quality of life) and 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to carry out the analyzes with the aid of the statistical package R and considering&#xD;
      significance level 5%.&#xD;
