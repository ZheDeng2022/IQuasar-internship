  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic valve stenosis (AS) shows high and increasing prevalence in Western civilizations and&#xD;
      leads to high morbidity and mortality. 15 years ago Alain Cribier performed the first&#xD;
      catheter-based transfemoral aortic valve replacement at the University of Rouon. This&#xD;
      historical step initiated a dramatic shift in the treatment of AS with more than 50% of&#xD;
      patients being treated interventionally instead of the surgical approach, today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comorbidities are major determinants of cardiovascular events and clinical outcome in aortic&#xD;
      valve stenosis but little is known about psychiatric comorbidities or frailty in these&#xD;
      patients. Data from our group suggest an inflammatory trigger for depression and potentially&#xD;
      other psychiatric diseases and aortic valve stenosis as well as aortic valve replacement are&#xD;
      associated with considerable changes in the inflammatory state of the patients. However, no&#xD;
      study has prospectively examined the interaction of these inflammatory markers and mood&#xD;
      disorders, yet. In addition, frailty is a key aspect of many of TAVR patients clinically,&#xD;
      however, scientifically there is only emerging data with half of all PubMed-indexed&#xD;
      publications being less than 18 months old and clinical use of various scores still under&#xD;
      discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot; Effect of interventional aortic valve replacement on emotional status, quality of life,&#xD;
      frailty and inflammation&quot;-study is designed to fill these gaps in evidence. It will be a&#xD;
      prospective epidemiological cohort study to recruit 102 patients with symptomatic severe&#xD;
      aortic valve stenosis within 18 months. All of these patients will undergo standardized&#xD;
      cardiologic, psychiatric and frailty assessment as well as a sophisticated laboratory&#xD;
      analysis focussing on the inflammatory state. The study aims to integrate these&#xD;
      interdisciplinary findings to optimize patient treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Aortic valve stenosis (AS) shows a high prevalence in Western civilizations with an&#xD;
      increasing incidence and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. AS is a&#xD;
      degenerative disease and therefore the main reason for the increasing prevalence is the&#xD;
      higher proportion of elderly patients in western societies. Untreated symptomatic AS is&#xD;
      characterized by severe morbidity with mainly dyspnea, orthopnea and reduced exercise&#xD;
      capacity. In addition, AS has a very high mortality (50-90% in 2 years), most often due to&#xD;
      lung edema as a result of increased afterload of the left ventricle. So far, there is no&#xD;
      medical treatment available improving mortality in these patients. For decades, the only&#xD;
      known therapy has been surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), having shown a dramatic&#xD;
      reduction in mortality. However, many of the patients suffering from AS are octogenarians or&#xD;
      even older and also suffer from multiple comorbidities. Thus, many of these patients are&#xD;
      considered inoperable using a surgical approach. Exactly 15 years ago Alain Cribier performed&#xD;
      the first catheter-based transfemoral aortic valve replacement at the University of Rouon.&#xD;
      This historical step initiated a dramatic shift in the treatment of AS with more than 50% of&#xD;
      patients being treated interventionally instead of the surgical approach, today.&#xD;
