    <textblock>
      0116-ASG REMETY is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation Phase I study&#xD;
      evaluating the safety and anti-tumor activity of TAS-102 administered in combination with&#xD;
      Regorafenib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine safety, feasibility and the recommended phase II dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) of a combination treatment consisting of TAS-102 and Regorafenib in subjects with mCRC&#xD;
      who have progressed after standard therapy.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>According to the standard 3+3 dose finding strategy, a safety assessment will be performed after the test of each dose level (patient cohorts of n=3) and the frequency of DLTs determined. Based on the results the dose for the consecutive patient cohort will either be escalated (0/3 DLTs), repeated (1/3 DLTs) or deescalated (&gt;1/3 DLTs).</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be determined by recording dose limiting toxicities (DLT) occurring during the first 2 treatment cycles of each patient in each tested dose level. DLT will be identified by observing frequency and severity of specific adverse events.</description>

    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>approx. 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of ALL Treated Subjects whose best overall response (BOR) from baseline is either a CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 criteria. BOR is determined by the best response designation recorded between the date of subject enrollment and the date of objectively documented progression. For subjects without documented progression, all available response designations will contribute to the BOR determination.&#xD;
ORR will be evaluated by reporting absolute and relative frequencies.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>approx. 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival will be calculated from the date of subject enrollment until the date of confirmed PD or death from any cause. If no event is observed (e.g. lost to follow-up) PFS is censored at the time of last tumor assessment.</description>
