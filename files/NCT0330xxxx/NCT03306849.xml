      This study is being conducted in order to determine if ultrasound features of the ovaries can&#xD;
      be used to reliably diagnose different types of anovulatory disorders in women across all&#xD;
      body types. The study will also try to establish whether ultrasound features of the ovary can&#xD;
      reflect the degree of reproductive and metabolic problems that a woman with irregular or&#xD;
      absent periods might be experiencing. In this way, the researchers can help to maximize the&#xD;
      information that can be received when using ultrasound to evaluate patients with concerns&#xD;
      over irregular menstrual cycles and/or infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ovaries are the site of egg production and normally release one egg every month. The&#xD;
      process of releasing an egg is called ovulation. The act of releasing an egg is the body's&#xD;
      way of ensuring a woman's fertility each month during her reproductive years. There are a&#xD;
      number of reasons why ovulation may not occur regularly in women. Some of these reasons are&#xD;
      believed to relate to male hormone production (i.e. androgens), body composition, nutrition&#xD;
      and overall metabolic health. However, the precise ways in which these factors affect&#xD;
      ovulation are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers plan to evaluate how the ovaries look and function in a large group of women.&#xD;
      Their goal is to recruit both lean and overweight women to this study and include both women&#xD;
      that have regular, predictable menstrual cycles as well as those that have infrequent or&#xD;
      absent menstrual cycles. The researchers will include women with irregular cycles due to&#xD;
      increased androgen production, or hyperandrogenic anovulation - as well as those that have&#xD;
      irregular cycles but normal androgen levels or normoandrogenic anovulation. The researchers&#xD;
      will use ultrasound to collect information on how the ovaries look and function, and then&#xD;
      relate the features of the ovaries to body composition, reproductive and metabolic hormones&#xD;
      as well as nutritional factors. Because features of the ovaries are expected to be different&#xD;
      in lean and overweight women, the researchers hope to develop ultrasound criteria that will&#xD;
      help healthcare providers to diagnosis specific ovulation problems in women across all body&#xD;
      sizes. Together, this research will help to better understand the complex relationship&#xD;
      between nutrition, metabolism and reproductive health in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish these objectives, the investigators plan to recruit 50 women with regular&#xD;
      menstrual cycles, 50 women with normoandrogenic anovulation, and 50 women with&#xD;
      hyperandrogenic anovulation. Their goal is to recruit an equal number of women in each group&#xD;
      who are lean (BMI; Normal weight = 18.5 - 24.9 kg/m2) and overweight or obese (BMI;&#xD;
      Overweight = 25 - 29.9 kg/m2; Obese &gt;= 30kg/m2). Ultrasound scans of the ovaries will be&#xD;
      assessed for the total number, size, and distribution of follicles using both two- and&#xD;
      three-dimensional imaging techniques. Participants will have blood samples collected&#xD;
      determine serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
      (FSH), estradiol, progesterone. The following metabolic parameters will be assessed: (1)&#xD;
      75-gram oral glucose tolerance test to characterize glucose and insulin dynamics at 0, 30,&#xD;
      60, 90, and 120 minutes post-glucose ingestion; (2) dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to&#xD;
      quantify body fat and lean muscle distribution; (3) vitals and anthropometry assessment to&#xD;
      measure waist and hip circumference, height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate, and (4)&#xD;
      fasting blood tests to detect serum concentrations of androgens (i.e., total testosterone,&#xD;
      androstenedione, free androgen index) and serum markers of metabolic syndrome (i.e., lipids&#xD;
      and hemoglobin A1C). Participants will complete a food frequency questionnaire and physical&#xD;
      activity questionnaire. A researcher may also provide participants with an accelerometer to&#xD;
      wear for a week.&#xD;
