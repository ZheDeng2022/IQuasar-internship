  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, multi-centre (via Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium) phase Ib/II study&#xD;
      of patients treated with durvalumab 1500 mg IV q 4 weeks in combination with guadecitabine at&#xD;
      the recommended phase 2 dose subcutaneously for 5 consecutive days. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      have metastatic RCC with a clear cell component, ECOG performance status of 0-1, have&#xD;
      received 0-1 prior therapy but no prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA4 (Cohort 1, 36 subjects). Study&#xD;
      treatment could potentially continue for up to 13 cycles (52 weeks).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of up to 58 subjects will be enrolled on both phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib: 6-12 subjects; enrolled into either Cohort 1 or 2. Phase II: 46 subjects; enrolled&#xD;
      into either Cohort 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 (36 subjects): received 0-1 prior therapy and no prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 (16 subjects): received up to 2 prior therapies, one of which must include an&#xD;
      anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy to which they did not respond. Only one prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy&#xD;
      is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from Phase Ib treated at the eventual phase II dose will be combined with patients&#xD;
      in Phase II in the efficacy analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therapy will start with guadecitabine on days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle. Guadecitabine will&#xD;
           be dosed subcutaneously on days 1-5 at either dose level 0 (60 mg/m2) or dose level -1&#xD;
           (45 mg/m2), based on the recommended phase II dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Durvalumab will be started on day 8 of the 28-day cycle. Durvalumab will be administered&#xD;
           intravenously at a flat dose of 1500mg every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study treatment may continue for up to 13 cycles (52 weeks) in the absence of confirmed&#xD;
           progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib Treatment Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be evaluated within the first cycle (i.e., within&#xD;
           the first 28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six patients will be enrolled at dose level 0. If 2 or fewer patients experience a dose&#xD;
           limiting toxicity, the study will continue to the phase II portion at dose level 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alternately, if 3 or more patients have a dose limiting toxicity at dose level 0, 6&#xD;
           patients will be accrued at the lower dose (dose -1). If 2 or fewer patients experience&#xD;
           a dose limiting toxicity, the study will continue to phase II at dose level -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If 3 or more subjects experience a dose limiting toxicity at dose level -1, the&#xD;
           treatment will be considered unsafe and the trial will be stopped. In this case,&#xD;
           durvalumab and guadecitabine will be permanently discontinued and the subjects followed&#xD;
           per protocol.&#xD;
