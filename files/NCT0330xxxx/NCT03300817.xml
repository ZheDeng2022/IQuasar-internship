    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and how well MUC1 peptide-Poly-ICLC vaccine&#xD;
      works in preventing lung cancer in current and former smokers at high risk for lung cancer.&#xD;
      Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill&#xD;
      cells. MUC1 peptide-Poly-ICLC vaccine may stimulate the body's immune system and slow or stop&#xD;
      the changes from normal to pre-cancer to cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Immunogenicity of the vaccine, assessed at week 12, based on the increase in IgG anti-MUC1&#xD;
      antibody titer over the pre-vaccination levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Safety, assessed throughout the trial and continued observation for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore potential differences, if any, in the immunogenicity of the vaccine (as&#xD;
      assessed at week 12 by the IgG anti-MUC1 antibody titer ratio) in current versus (vs.) former&#xD;
      smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate pre-vaccination levels of circulating myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC)&#xD;
      and correlate with the ability to respond to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore immune response at week 24. II. To explore the relationship between chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status at pre-registration and immune response in&#xD;
      current versus former smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the impact of the MUC1 peptide-Poly-ICLC vaccine (MUC1/Poly-ICLC vaccine) on&#xD;
      inflammation-related high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the impact of baseline levels of hsCRP and IL-6 on the ability to successfully&#xD;
      vaccinate with MUC1/Poly-ICLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To establish a biospecimen repository archive: frozen peripheral blood live cells and&#xD;
      plasma for future more detailed and comprehensive immunologic assays, including direct&#xD;
      testing of anti-MUC1 T cell immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive MUC1 peptide-Poly-ICLC vaccine subcutaneously (SC) at weeks 0, 2, and 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients may be followed up at week 28.&#xD;

    <measure>Immunogenicity of the MUC1 vaccine</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Will be evaluated by monitoring changes in IgG anti-MUC1 antibody titer ratio; defined as t12/t0, where t0 is the &quot;initial titer&quot; measured prior to vaccination, and t12 is the &quot;final titer&quot; drawn at 12 weeks. A titer ratio of &gt;= 2 will be considered a positive response.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0. The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each participant and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine the overall patterns. In addition, the number and severity of adverse events will be tabulated and summarized across all grades.</description>

    <description>Will correlate with the ability to respond to the vaccine. Will summarize the data using descriptive statistics and graphical methods (i.e. boxplots, scatter plots, etc.). For continuous MDSC data versus response data, will use t-tests or Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests (for non-normal data). For the associations of 2 continuous variables, will use linear regression, the correlation coefficient, and scatter plots.</description>
