    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, single-center, open label, single arm study in which a group of 30&#xD;
      subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will receive secukinumab therapy.&#xD;
      Non-invasive imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be used to monitor the&#xD;
      resolution of psoriatic plaques with treatment in comparison to observed clinical&#xD;
      improvements. Early subclinical finding will be used to elucidate drug mechanism of action.&#xD;
      Assessment will be based on intrasubject comparisons, and all findings will be compared to&#xD;
      patients baseline imaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secukinumab, an anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody, is an effective treatment for moderate to&#xD;
      severe plaque psoriasis.While there is an abundance of clinical data in the literature&#xD;
      supporting the clinical efficacy of this therapy, there is limited data on early disease&#xD;
      clearance and other histologic findings elucidating a drug mechanism of action.&#xD;
      Hyper-proliferation of the epidermis and inflammation of dermis seen in psoriasis are thought&#xD;
      to be due to persistent T-cell activation and production of several pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines by dermal immune reaction. Therefore, with treatments with immunomodulatory&#xD;
      effects, such as Secukinumab, monitoring markers of inflammation, angiogenesis, and collagen&#xD;
      synthesis would be useful in establishing mechanism of action. While a skin biopsy can show&#xD;
      these findings at one moment in time, it does not allow for repetitive monitoring overtime.&#xD;
      The investigators propose the use of non-invasive imaging with Optical Coherence Tomography&#xD;
      (OCT) to demonstrate histologic features of plaque psoriasis not clinically evident. Upon&#xD;
      completion of the study, the investigators will assess when OCT improvements of psoriasis&#xD;
      treatment are detectable and how these findings correlate to observed clinical improvements.&#xD;
