  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to one-half of those in treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD) has a co-occurring&#xD;
      anxiety disorder (&quot;comorbidity&quot;), a condition that marks a high degree of treatment&#xD;
      resistance, severity and relapse risk in AUD treatment patients. The investigators&#xD;
      conceptualize comorbidity as a feed-forward system (&quot;vicious cycle&quot;, [VC]) of interacting&#xD;
      negative affect/stress, drinking motives/behavior, coping skills deficits, environmental&#xD;
      circumstances, and neurobiological adaptations. Based on this model, the investigators&#xD;
      developed and validated the VC cognitive-behavioral therapy (VC-CBT) to disrupt this system&#xD;
      at several key linkage points. In a recently completed randomized controlled trial (RCT), the&#xD;
      investigators found that adding the VC-CBT to standard AUD inpatient treatment resulted in&#xD;
      better alcohol outcomes 4 months following treatment than did adding an anxiety treatment or&#xD;
      standard&#xD;

    <textblock>
      AUD treatment alone. With a number needed to treat (NNT) index of 8 (relative to standard AUD&#xD;
      treatment alone), the VC-CBT could, if broadly disseminated, have a large positive impact on&#xD;
      AUD treatment. Unfortunately, several significant barriers related to the resource- and&#xD;
      expertise-intensive delivery of the VC-CBT limit its dissemination potential and, hence, the&#xD;
      impact of this otherwise effective treatment. Therefore, to maximize the public health and&#xD;
      scientific potential of the investigators work, the investigators propose to adapt the&#xD;
      therapist-delivered VC-CBT to a computer-delivered format to facilitate reliable and&#xD;
      economical dissemination of the VC-CBT while maintaining its established efficacy. The first&#xD;
      phase of the work (Year 1) will be to adapt the 6-session therapist-delivered VC-CBT for&#xD;
      delivery on an internet-based computer platform. This work will be done using a standard&#xD;
      iterative process for developing e-content in partnership with local technology experts&#xD;
      experienced in producing engaging and effective e-learning products. Approximately 24&#xD;
      patients (6 to test and supply feedback on each of three 2-session therapy modules and 6 to&#xD;
      test and supply feedback on all 3 modules given together) will be employed in this phase. The&#xD;
      second phase (Years 2 and 3) will be devoted to conducting an RCT to test the efficacy of the&#xD;
      refined computer-delivered VC-CBT. The investigators will randomize AUD treatment patients&#xD;
      with co-occurring anxiety disorder to receive either the computer-delivered VC-CBT or&#xD;
      standard AUD treatment alone (50 patients in each group) to establish significance and effect&#xD;
      size estimates of clinical effect for the adapted e-therapy. In addition to analyzing the RCT&#xD;
      data, the investigators will perform quasi-experimental contrasts of the process and outcome&#xD;
      measures from the computer-delivered VC-CBT group in the RCT with parallel data from the&#xD;
      therapist-delivered VC-CBT obtained in an earlier clinical trial. These contrasts will&#xD;
      provide a reasonable estimate of how well the computer format compares to the therapist&#xD;
      format of the VC-CBT. The proposed work aims to provide an easy and inexpensive&#xD;
      computer-delivered version of the VC-CBT that has comparable efficacy to the validated but&#xD;
      resource-intensive therapist-delivered version. Achieving this will enable the VC-CBT therapy&#xD;
      to benefit more AUD treatment patients and to be more easily studied by other investigators.&#xD;
