    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if it is possible to use a new 3D imaging method to&#xD;
      guide Botulinum neurotoxin (BTX) injection for muscle spasticity management after stroke.&#xD;
      This imaging method is called three dimensional innervation zone imaging, or 3DIZI.&#xD;

    <measure>Spasticity as Assessed by Reflex Torque of Elbow Flexors</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (1 day prior to BTX injection)</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject will receive a total of 60 degrees of computer-controlled elbow extension stretching at different speeds. The stretch ends at 10 degrees beyond the resting angle of the elbow joint during standing to offset the baseline difference among subjects. From the angle-torque relations, reflex torque is obtained after subtracting passive torque at 5˚/sec from those at 50˚/sec or 100˚/sec. Reflex torque is considered to reflect the neural component of muscle spasticity.</description>

    <description>For standard injection procedures, target muscles will be visualized under ultrasound imaging which is operated by an experienced and dedicated technician. Position of needle tip within the target muscle is visualized prior to injection. Ultrasound guidance can help ensure depth of needle tip location, i.e., to make sure the needle tip is within the muscle, but it is not able to tell where it is located with reference to the IZs of the entire muscle.</description>

    <description>In the IZ-guided injection technique, IZ location obtained using the 3DIZ will be first marked over the skin surface of the muscle and the depth of the IZ will be also provided. The 3DIZ will be applied to the IZ-guided injection group 1 day prior to scheduled injection. The surface location and depth information of the IZ will be used to guide where the needle tip needs to go. Currently, patients commonly receive 1 to 2 injection sites, occasionally 3 sites for biceps muscles. To standardize the procedure, we will choose 2 sites for all patients.</description>

    <description>Simultaneous surface EMG and intramuscular EMG measurements will be acquired from the spastic biceps of the patients. Patients will be seated comfortably on a height-adjustable chair. The arm to be tested will be secured firmly on a customized apparatus with the elbow joint at approximately 90° of flexion and the shoulder at approximately 45° of abduction and 30° of flexion. The 128-channel unipolar surface EMG signals will be recorded with 2 flexible 2-dimensional 64-channel surface electrode array. A coating fine wire electrode will be inserted into the mid-axial section of the biceps to record bipolar intramuscular EMG signals. Ultrasound scan will be performed on the biceps to identify the location of the inserted wire electrode. Patients will be asked to contract their impaired biceps to perform maximum voluntary contraction of elbow flexion against the vertical plates 3 times.</description>

        <title>Spasticity as Assessed by Reflex Torque of Elbow Flexors</title>
        <description>Each subject will receive a total of 60 degrees of computer-controlled elbow extension stretching at different speeds. The stretch ends at 10 degrees beyond the resting angle of the elbow joint during standing to offset the baseline difference among subjects. From the angle-torque relations, reflex torque is obtained after subtracting passive torque at 5˚/sec from those at 50˚/sec or 100˚/sec. Reflex torque is considered to reflect the neural component of muscle spasticity.</description>

            <description>For standard injection procedures, target muscles will be visualized under ultrasound imaging which is operated by an experienced and dedicated technician. Position of needle tip within the target muscle is visualized prior to injection. Ultrasound guidance can help ensure depth of needle tip location, i.e., to make sure the needle tip is within the muscle, but it is not able to tell where it is located with reference to the IZs of the entire muscle.</description>

The 3DIZ will be applied to the IZ-guided injection group 1 day prior to scheduled injection. The surface location and depth information of the IZ will be used to guide where the needle tip needs to go. Currently, patients commonly receive 1 to 2 injection sites, occasionally 3 sites for biceps muscles. To standardize the procedure, we will choose 2 sites for all patients.</description>

            <description>In the IZ-guided injection technique, IZ location obtained using the 3DIZ will be first marked over the skin surface of the muscle and the depth of the IZ will be also provided. The 3DIZ will be applied to the IZ-guided injection group 1 day prior to scheduled injection. The surface location and depth information of the IZ will be used to guide where the needle tip needs to go.
