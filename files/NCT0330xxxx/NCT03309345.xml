  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be case-control study investigating whether dietary intake and components of energy&#xD;
      expenditure such as Basal metabolic rate (BMR), physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE)&#xD;
      and diet induce thermogenesis (DIT) are different between people with phenylketonuria (PKU)&#xD;
      and matched healthy controls. Participants will be children and adults with PKU age between&#xD;
      10 to 45 years old, free from history of any acute and chronic illness. Participants will&#xD;
      attend the Metabolic Research Unit at New Lister Building (NLB) after 12-hour overnight&#xD;
      fasting refraining from alcohol consumption for at least 24 hours. Any planned exercise will&#xD;
      be avoided during the 48 hours prior visit to the Metabolic Research Unit. Height, body&#xD;
      weight and handgrip strength will be measured upon arrival at the unit. BMR will be assessed&#xD;
      and participants will be asked to provide baseline saliva sample followed by consumption of 8&#xD;
      g deuterium water (D2O) diluted in drinking water. Normal or PKU-type isocaloric breakfast&#xD;
      meal will then be provided based on intervention group-type. DIT will be measured 5 times for&#xD;
      3 hours, with each measurement lasting for 20 minutes. Two saliva samples will be collected&#xD;
      at 3 and 3.5 hours after ingestion of D2O. Participants will be asked to perform an&#xD;
      incremental intensity exercise test for 20 minutes on the treadmill during which expired air&#xD;
      will be collected and accelerometer counts and heart rate will be measured. Participants will&#xD;
      then be trained on how to recorded food intake and how to use accelerometers for habitual&#xD;
      physical activity measurements. PKU participants (and their parents if ≤15 years old) will be&#xD;
      asked to complete quality of life (QoL) questionnaires. Participants will be required to wear&#xD;
      the accelerometer equipment for seven consecutive days excluding bedtime and keep a record of&#xD;
      non-wear times. During these days, they will also prospectively record estimated food and&#xD;
      beverages intake over four days including one weekend day.&#xD;

      1. Anthropometric measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Height will be measured using a wall-mounted stadiometer to the nearest 0.01 meter. Body&#xD;
           mass will be measured in kilograms using balance scale. Body mass index (BMI) will be&#xD;
           calculated using the following formula: BMI = kg/m² [weight in kilograms/ height in&#xD;
           meters²].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Handgrip strength (kilograms):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Grip strength will be measured by using a handgrip dynamometer as a measure of strength&#xD;
           and physical capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Body composition determination, saliva samples collection, storage and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Body composition will be determined using the deuterium water (D2O) dilution technique.&#xD;
           Participants will be provided a dose of 8 g of D2O diluted in drinking water.&#xD;
           Participants will be asked to provide a baseline saliva samples and another samples will&#xD;
           be obtained at 3 and 3.5 hrs after ingestion of the D2O. Samples will be stored in&#xD;
           freezers at -20 °C. All samples will be analysed at Scottish Universities Environmental&#xD;
           Research Centre (SUERC), Glasgow, for measurements of total body water (TBW) by means of&#xD;
           Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Metabolic rate measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Metabolic rate will be measured by means of computerised open-circuit ventilated hood&#xD;
           system (Quark, Resting metabolic rate (RMR) ®, Italy). Rate of oxygen consumption (O2)&#xD;
           and carbon dioxide production (CO2) will be recorded every 30 seconds for total duration&#xD;
           of 20 minutes with 10 minute break.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Breakfast meal:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants in phenylketonuria (PKU) group will receive a breakfast based on PKU-type&#xD;
           foods. Participants in control group will receive a similar breakfast based on normal&#xD;
           foods with calories content and weight being matched between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Measurements of physical activity (PA) and physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE):&#xD;
&#xD;
           ActiGraph accelerometer (GT3X+®) will be used to measure and record acceleration of&#xD;
           participant's physical activity. The participants will have to wear them for seven&#xD;
           consecutive days. They should record the time they put the monitor on in the morning and&#xD;
           when taking it off in the evening in their activity diaries. They also have to keep&#xD;
           notes of time and reason if they take the monitor off during the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Individual calibration curves for counts against rate of O2 and rate of CO2 will be&#xD;
           established during rest, and continuous incremental exercise test on the treadmill. Each&#xD;
           participant will conduct walking/ running test with starting speed of 2 km/h being&#xD;
           increased by 1 km/h every 4 minutes. The test will be stopped when heart rate (HR) just&#xD;
           reaches 80 % of maximal heart rate (HRmax) defined as 220 - age. During this incremental&#xD;
           test, participants will wear both ActiGraph accelerometer and face mask connected to&#xD;
           indirect calorimetry equipment (Quark RMR®, Italy) to measure rate of O2 and rate of&#xD;
           CO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Dietary analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will record their food intake by food portion size estimation method.&#xD;
           Participants will be asked to record their intake for four days including one weekend&#xD;
           day. Data from food diaries will be compared to reference UK photographic atlas of food&#xD;
           portion sizes to estimate weight of food intake. Food and energy intake will then be&#xD;
           calculated using computerised program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Quality of life assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           PKU participants' quality of life will be assessed by means of validated PKU-specific&#xD;
           Health-related Quality of Life Questionnaires (PKU-QOL). The questionnaires cover the&#xD;
           physical, emotional, and social impacts of PKU and its treatment on patients' lives and&#xD;
           come along with a software to calculate PKU-QoL scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Clinical data on history of disease activity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about disease management relevant to the study (i.e. records of phenylalanine&#xD;
      levels, weight and height status, and number of protein exchanges and dietary compliance,&#xD;
      quantity and types of prescribed PKU foods and amino acid supplements) will be collected from&#xD;
      the patients' medical notes. The data will be obtained for one year prior to the&#xD;
      participants' intended day of study start.&#xD;
