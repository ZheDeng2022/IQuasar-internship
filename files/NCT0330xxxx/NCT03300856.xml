      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is a non-invasive way to stimulate the&#xD;
      brain. It helps researchers study the nervous system. TMS can assess central motor conduction&#xD;
      time (CMCT). That can be used to diagnose some diseases. It can also show how well treatments&#xD;
      are working. Researchers want to study the records of people who have already had TMS. They&#xD;
      want to see how it relates to the results of diagnostic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the results of transcranial magnetic stimulation in certain neurological disorders.&#xD;
      To create a descriptive analysis of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records that are already in the NINDS database&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will not enroll any participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will search the database for certain terms. These include TMS, CMTC, and motor&#xD;
      evoked potentials. This will identify records of people who had TMS for diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using data from the records, researchers will calculate CMCT. They will note other data that&#xD;
      relate to CMCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will analyze their findings. They will write a review article.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal data will be removed from all the records before the findings are analyzed.&#xD;

      Objective- To retrospectively study the results of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in&#xD;
      various neurological disorders and create a descriptive analysis of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population- Existing records of patients within the NINDS database who have had TMS&#xD;
      performed to measure central motor conduction time (CMCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retrospective descriptive analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The NINDS EMG Database will be queried using terms such as TMS, CMCT, and MEP (motor&#xD;
           evoked potentials) to identify EMG reports on patients who underwent TMS for diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within these reports peripheral motor conduction time (PMCT), the cortical motor evoked&#xD;
           potential (MEP) latency and amplitude will be used to calculate CMCT, clinical patient&#xD;
           factors pertinent to estimation of CMCT as well clinically significant physical exam&#xD;
           findings will be recorded as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical diagnoses and neurological exams will be extracted from medical records&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient identifiers will be de-linked after compiling data from medical records&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Results of CMCT using TMS in different diagnoses will be summarized for different&#xD;
      neurologic disorders and correlated to clinical exam measures documented in previous records&#xD;
