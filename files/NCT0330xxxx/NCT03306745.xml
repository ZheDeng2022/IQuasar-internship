    <textblock>
      The role of micronutrients in fertility has recently gained increased attention. In women who&#xD;
      suffer from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and infertility, we aim to test the impact of a&#xD;
      standardized, multinutrient supplementation on the course of PCOS-specific parameters namely&#xD;
      anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), testosterone, and androstenedione. A total of 60 infertile&#xD;
      women with PCOS, previously untreated, will be randomized to receive either a combined&#xD;
      standardized multinutrient supplementation (containing folic acid, selenium, vitamin E,&#xD;
      catechins, glycyrrhizin, coenzyme Q10 and omega-3-fatty acids; study group) or folic acid&#xD;
      alone (control group) in a double-blinded, randomized manner. These study medications will be&#xD;
      provided for 3 months and pre- to posttreatment levels of AMH, testosterone, and AMH will be&#xD;
      analysed. The study will be performed at the Clinical Division of Gynecologic Endocrinology&#xD;
      and Reproductive Medicine of the Medical University of Vienna.&#xD;

      Introduction and scientific background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Western world, malnutrition and subfertility have become increasingly common problems&#xD;
      affecting both men and women. A recent study showed that conforming to nutritional&#xD;
      recommendations significantly increased the probability of a clinical pregnancy following&#xD;
      vitro fertilisation (IVF)/ intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). They included fruit,&#xD;
      vegetables, certain types of meat, fish, whole-grain products and specific fats (according to&#xD;
      the Netherlands Nutrition Centre Foundation). Another study specifically analysed&#xD;
      preconceptional consumption of unsaturated fatty acids by women before IVF/ICSI. It&#xD;
      discovered a positive effect on the embryo's morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of micronutrients on female fertility is currently under investigation. A 2012&#xD;
      review on the subject included 13 studies with more than 90,000 female participants and&#xD;
      provided no generalised recommendations, but allowed the authors to deduce a certain positive&#xD;
      effect of supplementation with certain micronutrients on female fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study will test the effect of a currently available micronutrient&#xD;
      supplementation in women suffering from polycystic ovary (PCO)-syndrome and sterility. The&#xD;
      product (PROfertil ® female, Lenus Pharma, Seeböckgasse 59, 1160 Vienna, Austria) is based on&#xD;
      several studies that showed (i) an increased need for these micronutrients of women with a&#xD;
      desire to have a child or currently pregnant and/or (ii) a positive effect on female&#xD;
      fertility. PROfertil ® female is a micronutrient supplement containing selenium, vitamin E,&#xD;
      catechins, glycyrrhizin, co-enzyme Q10, folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seems of impact from a scientific perspective. Clinical experience with PROfertil&#xD;
      ® female suggests that patients suffering from PCO-syndrome experience an increase of&#xD;
      anti-müllerian hormone and androgen levels. The reductive effect of PCO-typical serum&#xD;
      parameters can be explained pathophysiologically: A chronic low-level pro-inflammatory state&#xD;
      - both locally in the ovary and systemically - appears to be among the central&#xD;
      pathophysiological correlates of PCO-syndrome. PROfertil ® female contains a mix of several&#xD;
      antioxidative agents. A favourable effect on PCO-syndrome is expected. Metformin is an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory substance commonly used to treat PCO-syndrome. The anti-inflammatory effect&#xD;
      is seen as positive. This explains why women suffering from PCO-syndrome without&#xD;
      insulin-glucose balance problems react positively to treatment with metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to perform a prospective randomized test comparing PROfertil ®&#xD;
      female to supplementation with folic acid alone for female patients suffering from&#xD;
      PCO-syndrome and infertility. Supplementation with folic acid is the current state of the art&#xD;
      in micronutrient supplementation of infertile women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims The primary aim of this study is to analyse the effects of three months of&#xD;
      treatment with PROfertil ® female compared to a supplementation with 400µg of folic acid for&#xD;
      women suffering from PCO-syndrome, sterility, anovulation. The study will examine the&#xD;
      parameters typical for PCO-syndrome (anti-müllerian hormone, total testosterone,&#xD;
      androstenedione).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary goal is to document the individual course of further fertility treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The products being administered to the patients for four weeks are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROfertil ® female (Lenus Pharma Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung [GesmbH],&#xD;
           Seeböckgasse 59, 1160 Vienna; treatment group) - one soft capsule (500mg Omega-3-fatty&#xD;
           acids) and one pill (folic acid: 800µg, selenium 70µg, vitamin E 30mg, catechine: 4mg,&#xD;
           glycyrrhizin 12mg, and coenzyme Q10: 30mg) per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  200µg folic acid (folic acid capsules 400µg ®, OTC Produktion und Forschung GesmbH,&#xD;
           Fischergasse 17, 5020 Salzburg; control group) - two capsules per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in a double-blinded manner. The medications are unlabeled for&#xD;
      both groups and will be dispensed in unlabeled blisters. However, patients could search for&#xD;
      the actual look of the PROfertil ® female soft capsules and the pills (for example on the&#xD;
      internet). Since they differ from the folic acid capsules, patients could identify the&#xD;
      control medications. The study team is aware of the fact that this kind of blinding is not&#xD;
      according to standards and could introduce some kind of bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First hypothesis: A three-month treatment with PROfertil ® female causes a drop of&#xD;
      anti-müllerian hormone, total testosterone and androstenedione levels. This does not happen&#xD;
      if treated with 400µg folic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome parameters: anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), total testosterone and&#xD;
      androstenedione levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monocentric, prospective randomized double-blinded trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are recruited by medical professionals at the Department of Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynecology of the Medical University of Vienna using the above mentioned criteria during&#xD;
      routine examinations before any treatment for PCO-syndrome and/or sterility is initiated.&#xD;
      Potential participants are informed about the procedure, clinical relevance and possible&#xD;
      additional effort caused by study participation. The patients willing to participate then&#xD;
      have to sign the written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a reduction of the mean AMH levels by 2 ng/ml at a standard deviation of 3 ng/ml and&#xD;
      an alpha value of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, the paired t-test requires 26 patients per group.&#xD;
      Due to the fact that the participants wish to conceive a child and have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      sterility, a low drop-out rate can be expected. There is no reliable data on this or similar&#xD;
      treatments that allow prediction of the chance to conceive. Due to the favourable&#xD;
      benefit-to-risk profile, a 15% drop-out rate is assumed. This corresponds to 4 patients per&#xD;
      group. Thus, the final sample size is calculated as 30 patients per group, which leads to a&#xD;
      total study population of 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bio-statistician will randomise the data using nQuery advisorTM Version 7.0. The&#xD;
      information will then be packaged in an envelope by a person independent of the participating&#xD;
      medical professionals and other scientific personnel. This will only be opened after the&#xD;
      inclusion of the patient. Categorical variables will be presented as absolute numbers and&#xD;
      percentages, numerical variables as median and interquartile range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following statistical analyses are planned: The result parameters and the patient&#xD;
      characteristics of the two groups will be compared using the Welch test (for numerical&#xD;
      variables) and the Chi-square-test or Fisher's exact test (for categorical variables). A&#xD;
      p-value of &lt;0.05 is considered to be statistically significant. The statistical analyses will&#xD;
      be performed using SPSS 24.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, 1989-2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further details on study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recruiting the participants at the outpatient clinics for Gynecologic Endocrinology and&#xD;
      Infertility Treatment, they are randomly assigned to one of the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive either 2 unlabelled soft capsules containing 200µg folic acid each&#xD;
      or 1 unlabelled soft capsule containing omega-3 fatty acids and 1 tablet containing folic&#xD;
      acid, selenium, vitamin E, catechins, glycyrrhizin, and co-enzyme Q10 (see Table above for&#xD;
      details on doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned examination of AMH, total testosterone and androstenedione levels will take place&#xD;
      after a minimum of 90 days (and a maximum of 100 days) after beginning supplementation with&#xD;
      PROfertil ® female or folic acid. The maximum duration of participation is thus 100 days.&#xD;
      After taking the micronutrient supplementation (PROfertil ® female or folic acid) beyond the&#xD;
      planned minimum treatment duration, an individualised fertility treatment can be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two study-specific consultations: After including the patient (consultation 1:&#xD;
      randomisation, distribution of drugs and start of study) and after 90 to 100 days&#xD;
      (consultation 2). During consultation 2, unused study blisters are collected and patients are&#xD;
      questioned on peculiarities and possible side effects of the micronutrient supplementation&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that 30 minutes for consultation 1 and 15 minutes for consultation 2 will have&#xD;
      to be spent by the patient. The consultations will be held during regular outpatient&#xD;
      treatments and will be part of the planned routine examinations. They include discussions of&#xD;
      examination results and recommendations for further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits-to-risk assessment and preventive measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks or complications due to the use of PROfertil ® female and additional venepuncture are&#xD;
      not expected. A recent study using the same product showed no substance-related side effects&#xD;
      (number of the ethics committee of the Medical University of: 1659/2013; accepted on&#xD;
      2013-09-24) (9). A direct benefit for the treatment group is possible. A positive effect on&#xD;
      PCO syndrome can be assumed, which might result in a higher chance of pregnancy. The&#xD;
      substance administered to the control group is state of the art for female fertility&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
