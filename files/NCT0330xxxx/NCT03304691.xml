      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria is caused by parasites carried by some mosquitos. When the mosquitos bite people, the&#xD;
      parasites can infect them. One of these parasites is Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax). Some&#xD;
      children have P. vivax in their blood. They did not have malaria symptoms, but some also had&#xD;
      a blood problem called anemia. This can make people feel tired or weak. This could have been&#xD;
      caused by P. vivax. Researchers want to know how P. vivax infects these children, and if it&#xD;
      affects their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect blood, stool, and urine monthly from children to look for infections with P.&#xD;
      vivax, worms, and other parasites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between 6 months and 10 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For screening, the study will be explained to the participant s parents or guardians, who&#xD;
      will provide consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a visit once a month for about 3 months, from November to January, and&#xD;
      then for about 6 months from June to November 2018. Visits include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about their health&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood draw by pricking the finger tip&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine and stool collection. They may collect these at home and bring them back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants have P. vivax in their blood, them may need to come back to the clinic within&#xD;
      3 days. They will have blood taken from their arm using a needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants feel ill during the study, they can go to the clinic for an exam and blood&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants develop malaria while on the study, they will be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants samples will be stored for future research studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium vivax was thought not to be a problem in Duffy blood group negative Africans.&#xD;
      However, recent research has found that P. vivax infection occurs not only in areas where&#xD;
      Duffy-positive and -negative people live side-by-side, but also in areas where populations&#xD;
      are predominantly Duffy-negative, such as Bandiagara, Mali. In this region, our research&#xD;
      group recently observed 25 P. vivax infections in children, all of whom were Duffy-negative.&#xD;
      Furthermore, some preliminary data suggest that, despite having extremely low parasitemia and&#xD;
      no malarial symptoms (no fever, muscle aches, or chills), the children of Bandiagara with P.&#xD;
      vivax may have a drop in hemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study involves two substudies to detect P. vivax infections in children and&#xD;
      adults of two predominantly Duffy-negative Malian populations where P. vivax infections have&#xD;
      previously been identified. The cohort study will be conducted in the Bandiagara region. We&#xD;
      will conduct physical exams and collect blood, urine, and stool samples at baseline and&#xD;
      monthly (urine samples will be collected only at baseline) for about 10 months. Our goal is&#xD;
      to detect and characterize P. vivax infections, focusing on molecularly characterizing how P.&#xD;
      vivax invades erythrocytes in Duffy-negative individuals. Specifically, we want to identify&#xD;
      the parasite ligands involved in this invasion. We will use RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of P.&#xD;
      vivax in blood samples of infected subjects to define the level of expression of parasite&#xD;
      invasion ligands. From the parasite DNA found in blood samples, we will determine whether&#xD;
      there is gene expansion of the parasite ligand Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) (the number of&#xD;
      copies of PvDBP in each genome), and identify the sequence of PvDBP to determine whether it&#xD;
      can bind an erythrocyte receptor other than the Duffy blood group antigen (i.e.,&#xD;
      Duffy-negative erythrocytes). An additional focus will be whether P. vivax leads to anemia in&#xD;
      the Duffy-negative children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will conduct a cross-sectional study to investigate the prevalence of P.&#xD;
      vivax in the general population in Yirimadio, a periurban setting of Bamako, which is the&#xD;
      sole place in Mali besides Bandiagara where P. vivax infections have been reported in&#xD;
      Duffy-negative individuals. This will be achieved by undertaking a cross-sectional survey.&#xD;
      Three times during the different seasons, subjects will provide blood for blood smear and&#xD;
      filter paper analyses to identify the presence of P. vivax infection.&#xD;
