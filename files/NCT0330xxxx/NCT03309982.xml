  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the beneficial effects of supplementation with a plant polyphenol&#xD;
      blend rich in anthocyanins on parameters of inflammation and metabolic responses following a&#xD;
      challenge with a high-fat (HF) meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a randomized crossover study to investigate the effects of: 1)&#xD;
      placebo (control); 2) plant polyphenol blend rich in anthocyanins; on systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      markers (endotoxemia, cytokines, NF-ÎºB), glucose and lipid metabolic responses following&#xD;
      consumption of a high-fat (HF) meal in healthy subjects. The high-fat meal (320 g) consists&#xD;
      of English muffin bread, sausage, egg and cheese, obtained from US market and completed with&#xD;
      palm fat. The total energy content of the high-fat meal is 1,026 Kcal with 70.5 g of fat&#xD;
      (29.8 g of saturated fat), 270 mg of cholesterol, 65 g carbohydrate, 5.2 g sugar, and 33 g&#xD;
      protein with a total of 62% energy originated from fat, 25% from carbohydrates and 13% from&#xD;
      protein. The high-fat meal will be standard and it will not be adjusted for large and small&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
