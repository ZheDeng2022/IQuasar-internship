      Long-term safety and efficacy follow-up for participants with Hemophilia B who were&#xD;
      previously treated in the C0371005 (formerly SPK-9001-101) study, and a dose-escalation&#xD;
      sub-study evaluating safety, tolerability, and kinetics of a higher dose with long-term&#xD;
      safety and efficacy follow-up. Participants in the substudy do not need to have participated&#xD;

      Evaluation of the long-term level of persistence and potential late or delayed adverse events&#xD;
      associated with PF-06838435 (formerly SPK-9001), assessment of the durability of the&#xD;
      transgene expression, and determination of the effects of PF-06838435 on clinical outcomes in&#xD;
      individuals who have previously received a single administration of PF-06838435 in the&#xD;
      C0371005 study. Amendment 2 of this study incorporates a dose-escalation substudy to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, and kinetics of a single IV infusion of PF-06838435 at a higher&#xD;
      dose than that used in the C0371005 study. The dose-escalation participants will also be&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study was originally designed as a long-term follow up study for individuals dosed in Study C0371005 to evaluate the overall long-term safety, durability of transgene expression, and effect on clinical outcomes of PF-06838435 mediated gene transfer. For these individuals this study will last for 5 years providing a minimum of 6 years of follow up post vector administration.&#xD;
Amendment 2 of this study introduces a dose-escalation substudy to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and kinetics of a single IV infusion of PF-06838435 at a higher dose(s) than that used in the C0371005 study. For these participants this study will last for a total of 6 years post vector administration.</intervention_model_description>
