      Sensitivity to Acute Middle cerebral or intracranial Carotid artery Occlusion in MIGrainers&#xD;
      (SMCO-MIG) is a prospective multi-center study to determine if migraine induces a faster&#xD;
      infarct growth as assessed by initial multimodal imaging.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke results from the occlusion of a brain artery by a clot. Early&#xD;
      revascularization by thrombolysis and thrombectomy promotes neurological recovery by saving&#xD;
      the area of ischemic penumbra. Progression of ischemic stroke is evaluated on multimodal&#xD;
      imaging by the &quot;mismatch ratio&quot; between necrotized core and salvageable hypoperfused volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migraine affects 12% of the population. Although considered as a benign condition, migraine,&#xD;
      particularly with aura, is a risk factor for ischemic stroke. Based on pathophysiological&#xD;
      hypothesis and the result of one study, which had several limitations, it's suggest that&#xD;
      migraine might increase the sensitivity to cerebral ischemia and induce a faster infarct&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to determine if the mismatch ratio between irreversibly&#xD;
      injured and hypoperfused volumes, measured on initial imaging (MRI or CT) during acute&#xD;
      ischemia due to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or the intracranial internal carotid&#xD;
      artery, varies according to the migraine status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicentric prospective cohort will be conduct, outcome study. The initial multimodal&#xD;
      imaging (MRI or CT) will be acquired routinely using a harmonized protocol in any patient&#xD;
      suspected of an acute stroke. All consecutive patients eligible to the study will be included&#xD;
      within 7 days of their initial admission, and evaluated with a short questionnaire&#xD;
      classifying them as &quot;migrainers&quot; whose status will undergo a detailed validation at 3 months&#xD;
      by a migraine expert, and &quot;non-migrainers&quot; whose status will be validated by repeating the&#xD;
      short questionnaire at the follow-up visit at 3 months. All radiological data will be&#xD;
      analyzed centrally after the end of the recruitment, by investigators blinded to the migraine&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
