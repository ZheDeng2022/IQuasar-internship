  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femoral artery approach to perform coronary procedures is considered the standard technique&#xD;
      for vascular access due to optimal catheter control, lower thromboembolic complications and&#xD;
      immediate access due to the large diameter of the artery. Trans-radial approach has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce major bleeding complications, vascular complications related to the site of&#xD;
      puncture, including death from all causes, and to prevent post-procedure limb rest, greater&#xD;
      comfort for patients, immediate ambulation, early discharge and reduction of costs. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that intravenous, topical and intraarterial use of nitroglycerin produces&#xD;
      vasodilation of the radial artery. Extravascular (subcutaneous) administration of&#xD;
      nitroglycerin is extremely effective in restoring the radial pulse, and allows adequate&#xD;
      cannulation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unlike femoral access, the trans-radial approach to coronary angiography requires a greater&#xD;
      learning curve for the inexperienced interventionist, and demands a greater technical&#xD;
      challenge than the femoral approach, which leads to a high incidence of failures and&#xD;
      complications, mainly in the initial stages of their formation. Some explanations for&#xD;
      procedural failure include inability for radial artery puncture, vessel tortuosity, and&#xD;
      radial spasm. Radial spasm has been reported from 5 to 30% in experienced centers, with a&#xD;
      decrease to 2.5% when associated with the administration of nitrate added to local&#xD;
      anesthesia. Although radial spasm is infrequent and usually occurs once the artery is&#xD;
      cannulated or during manipulation of the catheters, it can sometimes occur before cannulation&#xD;
      due to multiple unsuccessful attempts to cannulate the artery, which can also produce pain in&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct an experimental, placebo-controlled, longitudinal,&#xD;
      prospective, double-blind, parallel arm clinical trial. Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive 1:1 an intervention or placebo. Intervention group will receive a subcutaneous&#xD;
      &quot;cocktail&quot; with 0.5 ml of 500 mcg of nitroglycerin + 1 ml of 2% simple lidocaine. Placebo&#xD;
      group will receive a subcutaneous injection with 0.5 ml of 0.9% saline solution + 1 ml of 2%&#xD;
      simple lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the maneuver (subcutaneous infiltration of local&#xD;
      anesthetic together with nitroglycerin) will facilitate radial access in terms of fewer&#xD;
      punctures until the insertion of the arterial introducer, shorter access time, lower&#xD;
      incidence of radial spasm, and lower crossover rate to femoral access, compared with placebo.&#xD;
      In terms of safety, the investigators do not believe that the maneuver represents a risk to&#xD;
      the patient in terms of incidence of hypotension or headache. In fact, the investigators&#xD;
      believe that the maneuver will provide less pain at the site of puncture referred by the&#xD;
      patient due to the less number of unsuccessful punctures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the calculation of the required sample, since the incidence of our primary end-point of a&#xD;
      compound of crossover to femoral access and/or access site-related vascular complications has&#xD;
      not been reported so far, the sample will be calculated with the rate of events obtained in&#xD;
      our center at 6 months of recruiting patients. For this calculation, the proportional&#xD;
      difference formula with an alpha value of 0,05 and a beta value of 0,20 will be used to have&#xD;
      a statistical power of 80%. The investigators estimate that 1,500 patients will be required&#xD;
      in a 11-month period.&#xD;
