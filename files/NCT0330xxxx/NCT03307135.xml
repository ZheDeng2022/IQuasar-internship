  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is a disorder of the muscular tonus that occurs in disease including the upper&#xD;
      motor neuron (strokes, spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injuries or&#xD;
      cerebral palsies). It begins few hours after the neural aggression and last until the grave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most accepted definition refers to a velocity-dependent increase in stretch reflexes&#xD;
      elicited by passive stretch (Lance definition) but new approaches prefers to distinguish&#xD;
      neural (reflex) and non-neural (soft tissues alterations) components of the increase&#xD;
      resistance to a passive stretch. This deficiency is a major cause of complications as walking&#xD;
      impairment, pain or bone deformities and may require intensive therapies (intrathecal&#xD;
      baclofen infusion, intramuscular toxin botulinium injection, surgery, etc). Despite its high&#xD;
      frequency and the potential complications, only clinical scales (modified Ashworth scale and&#xD;
      modified Tardieu scale essentially) with criticized metrological properties are available for&#xD;
      daily assessment. The SPASM Consortium has published on 2005 recommendations for developing&#xD;
      devices using both mechanical and electrophysiological parameters. The principle challenge&#xD;
      was to ally parameters accuracy and utilization facility allowing quickly evaluation to the&#xD;
      patient's bed. Few research team works on this topic but mostly on specific population and&#xD;
      nowadays, no device has really crossed the door of laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This kind of tool would help us to improve the quality of the follow-up and to guide us&#xD;
      between the choices of specific therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MSPMI has been created following these recommendations in the University of Technology of&#xD;
      Compiègne, thanks to the collaboration between researchers of the UMR 7338 CNRS and a brain&#xD;
      surgeon of the Nantes University Hospital. The patent was obtained on 2012. This device&#xD;
      allows the assessment of the ankle plantar extensor (triceps surae) during a manually applied&#xD;
      stretch movement. This muscle was selected as it is frequently involved and treated for&#xD;
      spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the metrological properties of the MSPMI (reliabilities,&#xD;
      responsiveness, known group validity, construct validity, measurement errors and internal&#xD;
      consistency) among a large cohort of patients with no restriction of etiologies recruited in&#xD;
      the Nantes University Hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation will include medical histories and specific information about spasticity&#xD;
      management and consequences. The patient will be assessed by two evaluators with the MSPMI&#xD;
      installed on the foot and the shank. MSPMI allows the record of angular movement of the ankle&#xD;
      (position, speed and acceleration), of biomechanics (stiffness, torque, work and power) and&#xD;
      electromyography (root mean squared and integrated electromyography signals) of two chiefs of&#xD;
      the triceps surae (medial gastrocnemius and soleus). Electromyography data will be recorded&#xD;
      on a maximum voluntary contraction when the deficiency will permit it. After that, data will&#xD;
      be recorded at 3 velocities (with respect to the clinical scale recommendations) on two&#xD;
      different positions (knee flexed and extended), according to our clinical practice. The&#xD;
      evaluation on day 0 will allow the assessment of inter-rater intra-session reproductibility,&#xD;
      internal consistency, construct validity, measurement error and known group validity. If the&#xD;
      patient is hospitalized, he will be included on the &quot;hospitalization group&quot; and a second&#xD;
      evaluation following the same protocol will be done 7 days later (assessment of inter and&#xD;
      intra-rater inter-session reproductibility). If a specific therapy (selective tibial&#xD;
      neurotomy, anesthetic block or botulinum toxin intramuscular injection) is proposed, the&#xD;
      patient will be included on the &quot;treatment group&quot; and a new evaluation will be done after the&#xD;
      therapy (30 minutes - 2 hours after an anesthetic block, 2-3 months after neurotomy or&#xD;
      botulinium toxin injection) allowing assessment of the responsiveness of the MSPMI. If the&#xD;
      patient is not on these two situations, he will be included on the &quot;simple evaluation group&quot;&#xD;
      and his participation will end.&#xD;
