  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 10-month internet-based randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether an online&#xD;
      chronic pain management program (&quot;E-Health&quot;) can assist with reduced opioid reliance in&#xD;
      chronic pain patients. About half of the eligible participants will receive access to the&#xD;
      E-Health program in addition to their standard chronic pain treatment; the other half will&#xD;
      just continue receiving their standard chronic pain treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether an innovative, accessible E-health intervention can assist&#xD;
      with reduced opioid reliance in chronic pain patients, which can, ultimately, reduce risks of&#xD;
      unintended opioid overdose and death. Importantly, the study will contribute to a better&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms contributing to opioid use reduction while managing pain. The&#xD;
      findings may assist in developing treatment options for a population at risk for opioid&#xD;
      adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be identified through electronic health record (EHR) queries at&#xD;
      participating sites. Participants will be assessed at baseline, at the end of the 4-month&#xD;
      treatment period, and at 6 months following end-of-treatment through an electronic data&#xD;
      capture system accessed by the participants. Other outcome data will be obtained from the&#xD;
      participant's EHR data.&#xD;

    <description>The Goalistics Chronic Pain Management Program, referred to as the E-health program in EMPOWER, was developed from cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, and self-management interventions with demonstrated efficacy in traditional face-to-face or group settings. It is patient-centered, having been developed based on substantial input from people with chronic pain and chronic pain professionals.</description>
