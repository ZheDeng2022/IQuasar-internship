  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A person s genome is the collection of all their genes. A gene instructs individual cells to&#xD;
      make proteins. Proteins are involved in all of our body s chemical processes. Genome&#xD;
      sequencing allows researchers to find variations in genes. Some of these are normal and are&#xD;
      not known to cause disease. Some variants are known to cause or affect diseases like cancer.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study genetic variants in people with cancer who also have an immunologic&#xD;
      disease like HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the biology of cancer in order to improve ways to prevent, detect, and treat it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 18 years old with certain cancers and/or immunodeficiencies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and lab tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give samples of one or more tissue type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They may give blood or urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers may get samples of tissue when participants have surgery or when the participants&#xD;
      are on other protocols in the NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a procedure to have tissue samples removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers may collect data from participant medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare the genes in a participant s cancer tissue to their normal tissue.&#xD;
      They may use the tissue cells to grow new cells in a lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be contacted about the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples will be stored for future research. No personal data will be kept with them.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The availability of high quality, clinically annotated patient samples is crucial for&#xD;
           the study of biologic factors that influence the natural history of viral related&#xD;
           malignancies, malignancies occurring in the setting of HIV, and Castleman disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comprehensive genomic sequence of viral-associated malignancies, malignancies occurring&#xD;
           in the setting of HIV, tumors hypothesized to be caused by endogenous retroviruses, and&#xD;
           Castleman disease may identify diagnostic or prognostic disease signatures, and&#xD;
           recurrent driver alterations that interact with viral factors, and may identify targets&#xD;
           for new therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of transcriptomes and genomes between cancers or Castleman disease from HIV+&#xD;
           and HIV- individuals might identify novel non-human sequences that could potentially&#xD;
           suggest the presence of transcripts from hitherto undiscovered oncogenic viral agents&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The primary objective of this protocol is to support molecular investigation of viral&#xD;
      associated malignancies, malignancies occurring in the setting of HIV or other&#xD;
      immunodeficiencies, and Castleman disease, by accrual of high quality, clinically annotated&#xD;
      tissue from such patients as well as patients with tumors that may serve as appropriate&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV or other acquired immunodeficiency and cancer or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Viral-associated cancer or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV-negative with cancer that commonly occurs in people with HIV or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV)-associated malignancy or related diseases, such as&#xD;
           Multicentric Castleman Disease or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Idiopathic Castleman disease or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumors that are hypothesized to be caused by endogenous retroviruses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples will be processed using project specific collection and processing protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of non-tumor specimens will generally be performed to obtain germ-line&#xD;
           genetic material. The results between tumor and normal DNA will be analyzed to identify&#xD;
           the somatic changes present in the cancer tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alterations to be evaluated may include: detection of chromosomal changes, such as, but&#xD;
           not limited to, amplification, deletions, loss of heterozygosity, translocations, etc.;&#xD;
           as well as expression profiling and detection of transcripts resulting from&#xD;
           translocations and mutations, including single nucleotide variants, insertions,&#xD;
           deletions, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple forms of project specific analyses may be performed, including evaluation of&#xD;
           polymorphisms, mutations, gene expression and clinical pathologic correlation based on&#xD;
           project specific statistical and bioinformatics plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alterations may also be analyzed within the context of biological pathways and systems&#xD;
           biology being evaluated in a given project.&#xD;
