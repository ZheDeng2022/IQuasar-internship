      In this study the investigators aim to test TGreenlight (532-nm) laser Photoselective&#xD;
      Enucleation of the Prostate (Green LEP) using (XPS) 180W system ) vs Thulium Laser 200 W&#xD;
      Enucleation of the Prostate (ThuLEP) in reduction of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)&#xD;
      secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      Furthermore, all peri-operative parameters, urinary flow parameters, prostate size changes&#xD;
      and complications associated with the procedures will be compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and open simple prostatectomy (SP) have been&#xD;
      the historical reference-standard procedures for prostates &lt; 80 g and ≥ 80 to 100 g,&#xD;
      respectively, for years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evolution of LASER technology revived the concept of enucleation, so that the resectoscope&#xD;
      can be used instead of the surgeon's index finger to separate the adenoma from the surgical&#xD;
      capsule mimicking OP. There are several types of laser energy available for enucleation, but&#xD;
      the commonest types are Holmium, Greenlight (532nm) and Thulim YAG LASERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thulium: yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser Thulium LASER works at a wavelength between 1940 and&#xD;
      2013 nm in continuous wave mode so it offers advanced vaporization and hemostatic features.&#xD;
      Different applications and techniques were developed ranging from vapoenucleation technique&#xD;
      with in situ laser assisted resection, so-called Tangerine technique (Thulium Laser resection&#xD;
      of the prostate Tangerine Technique &quot;TmLRP-TT&quot;), and enucleation (ThuVEP/ThuLEP are&#xD;
      published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inspite of paucity of RCT comparing ThuLEP to other standard techniques in management of&#xD;
      large prostate, long term outcomes of ThuLEP are so robust. Gross et al reported their 5 year&#xD;
      follow up after ThuVEP in 500 patients with median prostate size of 50 grams. They&#xD;
      demonstrated durable outcomes, with persistent reductions in I-PSS score (5 vs 21), QoL score&#xD;
      (1 vs 4) and improvement in Q max (16.3 vs 6.9 ml/sec). Late complications included urethral&#xD;
      stricture in 3.1%, BNC in 3.1% and recurrent adenoma in 0.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yang et al published their 5 year results of a RCT comparing ThuLEP vs TURis in 159 patients&#xD;
      with median prostate size of 70 gm. No statistically significant difference between both&#xD;
      groups in terms of IPSS, Qmax or post voiding residual. No patient in either group required&#xD;
      retreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In RCT by Feng et al comparing ThuLEP to PKEP ,with 18 months follow up results , the former&#xD;
      proved to be efficient and safe within 12 months follow-up interval. However, ThuLEP had&#xD;
      significantly better hemostasis parameters and shorter catheterization time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III GreenLight (532nm) laser system&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kalium-Titanyl-Phosphate (KTP) and the lithium triborate (LBO) lasers work at a&#xD;
      wavelength of 532 nm. Laser energy is absorbed by haemoglobin, but not by water. Vaporisation&#xD;
      leads to immediate removal of prostatic tissue, relief of BPO, and reduction of LUTS.&#xD;
      GreenLight laser has gained increasing acceptance as a less invasive treatment for lower&#xD;
      urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH/ LUTS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A meta-analysis of the nine available RCTs comparing PVP using the 80-W and 120-W lasers with&#xD;
      TURP , no differences were found in Qmax and IPSS between 80-W-PVP and TURP, but only two&#xD;
      RCTs provided sufficient 12-month data to be included in the meta-analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the 180-W (XPS) laser efficacy is comparable to TURP in terms of IPSS, Qmax, post voided&#xD;
      residual volume, prostate volume reduction, PSA decrease and QoL questionnaires. The XPS&#xD;
      laser prostatectomy is superior to TURP in terms of catheterisation time, lengths of hospital&#xD;
      stay and time to stable health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a RCT by Al-Ansari et al comparing HPS 120-W laser PVP versus TURP , the former was&#xD;
      associated with dramatic improvements in all urinary outcomes compared to TURP, but&#xD;
      reintervention rate for recurrent adenomas was 11 % compared to 1.8% in TURP group. All&#xD;
      patients who needed redo surgery had prostate larger than 80 gm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another RCT, El-Shal et al of a compared Greenlight laser 180W XPS vapo enucleation ,&#xD;
      where the adenoma is bluntly enucleated partially then vaporized in situ, and HoLEP and&#xD;
      reported 12 months follow up results. Green light XPS vapoenucleation was comparable and non&#xD;
      inferior to HoLEP in symptom improvement. However, at 12 months Q max, prostate size&#xD;
      reduction and PSA reduction were significantly higher in HoLEP group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These important findings highlighted some limitations in PVP or vapoenucleation such as the&#xD;
      difficulty in determining the anatomical cleavage limits and capsular plain of large&#xD;
      adenomas. These drawbacks are not related to the energy source but to the technique used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gomez Sancha described different technique to avoid these limitations which was Greenlight&#xD;
      LASER En-bloc Enucleation of Prostate (Green LEP) where the whole adenoma is dissected from&#xD;
      the surgical capsule and morcellated at the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Misrai et al compared Green LEP vs Greenlight PVP for management of prostates larger than 80&#xD;
      gms. At 6 months follow up, IPSS, QoL and PVR improved similarly in both groups but Q max was&#xD;
      significantly higher in Green LEP group. Median percent reduction in prostate size as&#xD;
      measured by TRUS was significantly higher in green LEP (74% vs 57%). Median % reduction of&#xD;
      PSA was 40% and 67% in PVP and Green LEP respectively (p&lt;0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity in studies comparing different types of EEP using different energy sources&#xD;
      other than holmium laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work In this study the investigators aim to test Thulium Laser 200 W Enucleation&#xD;
      of the Prostate (ThuLEP) vs Greenlight (532-nm) laser Photoselective Enucleation of the&#xD;
      Prostate (Green LEP) using (XPS) 180W system in reduction of LUTS secondary to BPH in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. Furthermore, all peri-operative parameters, urinary flow&#xD;
      parameters, prostate size changes and complications associated with the procedures will be&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
