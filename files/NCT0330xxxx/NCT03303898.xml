  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leishmaniasis is considered by the WHO as emerging and uncontrolled diseases. They are the&#xD;
      second leading cause of death and the fourth leading cause of morbidity in tropical diseases.&#xD;
      Leishmaniasis is parasitic reticulo-endotheliosis, the pathogenic agent of which is a&#xD;
      flagellated protozoan belonging to the genus Leishmania. It is estimated that there are about&#xD;
      2 million new cases per year. Effective treatments against visceral leishmaniasis are few and&#xD;
      resistance problems appear. To date, only a canine vaccine is available protecting dogs from&#xD;
      the development of canine leishmaniasis to L. infantum. In man, in parallel clinical cases,&#xD;
      leishmaniasis is characterized by a large number of asymptomatic carriers. This is the case&#xD;
      in the Alpes-Maritimes where 50% of the inhabitants of the hinterland of Nice are carriers of&#xD;
      the parasite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators wish to study the protective immune response to the parasite and more&#xD;
      particularly to the asymptomatic carriers. Indeed, these patients were infected with the&#xD;
      parasite and did not develop the disease. Understanding the protective immune response in&#xD;
      these patients against the parasite is therefore paramount in the development of a human&#xD;
      leishmaniasis vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, the investigator wants to make an ex vivo study of the immune response of&#xD;
      lymphocytes coming from asymptomatic carriers after stimulation by Leishmania vaccine&#xD;
      peptides. It also wants to describe the immune response, after stimulation by these peptides,&#xD;
      in the lymphocytes of subjects asymptomatic carriers and lymphocytes from subjects not&#xD;
      infected with the parasite and comparing them. This study is unicentric and non-randomized.&#xD;
      It wishes to recruit 20 asymptomatic carriers of L. Infantum and 10 uninfected subjects. They&#xD;
      will be selected from our database. A simple blood sample will be taken. After verification&#xD;
      by quantitative PCR and western blotting of their status towards leishmaniasis, the team will&#xD;
      divide them into two groups (asymptomatic or healthy). Then the blood samples will be sent to&#xD;
      the team of Jean Loup Lemesre of the Laboratory INTERTRYP - UMR177 of the IRD in Montpellier.&#xD;
      ELISPOT analysis and assay of cytokines and proteases to describe the immune response of the&#xD;
      two groups and to compare them. In addition, cell typing will be performed by flow cytometry&#xD;
      to determine the type of lymphocytes involved in the immune response against Leishmania&#xD;
      peptides. HLA typing will also be performed to validate the HLA coverage of the peptides&#xD;
      tested. Finally, an analysis of the transcryptome will be carried out, which will allow to&#xD;
      identify the differential expression of genes and metabolic pathways involved in the immune&#xD;
      response and thus to understand how asymptomatic people can control the infection.&#xD;
