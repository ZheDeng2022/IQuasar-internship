  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During major surgical procedures general anesthesia is used to make the patient unconscious.&#xD;
      General anesthesia insures that the patient is unaware of any pain caused by surgery. General&#xD;
      anesthesia also prevents the patient from moving to prevent any potential surgical error. At&#xD;
      the same time general anesthesia makes it impossible for the patient to breathe. To help the&#xD;
      patient breathe a breathing tube is placed into the patient's airway and connected to the&#xD;
      mechanical ventilator. A mechanical ventilator is an artificial breathing pump, which&#xD;
      delivers gas into a patient's airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if brief periods of diaphragm stimulation&#xD;
      can prevent diaphragm problems caused by the use of mechanical ventilators and surgery. To&#xD;
      answer this question the changes in the genes responsible for maintaining diaphragm function&#xD;
      will be studied. A gene is the code present in each cell in your body and controls the&#xD;
      behavior of that cell. In addition, the changes in the contractile properties of muscle&#xD;
      fibers will be studied. The results from this study may help develop new treatments to&#xD;
      prevent diaphragm weakness resulting from mechanical ventilation use.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although mechanical ventilation (MV) is life-sustaining, it comes with a cost. MV&#xD;
      dramatically reduces diaphragm contractility, induces ventilator-induced diaphragm&#xD;
      dysfunction (VIDD) and sometimes leads to weaning failure. VIDD includes reduced&#xD;
      mitochondrial respiration and increased oxidative stress, muscle fiber damage and decreased&#xD;
      diaphragm force production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal models, intermittent diaphragm contraction during MV support attenuates VIDD.&#xD;
      However, there are only limited data addressing this problem in humans. Here, the study team&#xD;
      propose to directly test the hypothesis that intermittent electrical stimulation (ES) of the&#xD;
      human hemidiaphragm during prolonged cardiac surgeries with MV support prevents/attenuates&#xD;
      VIDD in the active hemidiaphragm. Mitochondrial function is central to energy metabolism and&#xD;
      skeletal muscle function in a chronically active muscle, such as the diaphragm. Although&#xD;
      abnormal mitochondrial function is thought to precipitate VIDD in animal models, limited data&#xD;
      are available concerning mitochondrial contributions to VIDD in humans. Of even greater&#xD;
      importance, there are no interventions available to attenuate these defects in humans. Here,&#xD;
      the study team will test the impact of an innovative experimental treatment, intermittent&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (ES) of the hemidiaphragm during prolonged surgeries with MV, on&#xD;
      mitochondrial function, single fiber contractile properties and catabolic muscle pathways in&#xD;
      human diaphragm. Using a within-subjects experimental design, muscle samples from a&#xD;
      stimulated hemidiaphragms will be compared with samples from the unstimulated hemidiaphragm.&#xD;
      The study team will investigate mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress during&#xD;
      prolonged CTS/MV, and the potential of ES to attenuate or prevent VIDD. Next, the study team&#xD;
      will investigate the effects of ES on single fiber contractile properties and Titin&#xD;
      integrity. Finally, the study team will study the effect of ES on proteolytic pathways&#xD;
      (caspase, calpain and ubiquitin-proteasome) and ribosomal RNA markers of decreased protein&#xD;
      synthesis implicated in VIDD.&#xD;
