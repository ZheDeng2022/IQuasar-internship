  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two Phase III trials showed superiority in terms of efficacy and tolerance of nivolumab in&#xD;
      second-line treatment compared to docetaxel in metastatic NSCLC in the general population, so&#xD;
      it is important to evaluate this treatment in PLWHIV (Patient Living With HIV) in maximum&#xD;
      security conditions, taking into account their specificities and complex underlying&#xD;
      immunological status. As NSCLC in PLWHIV is a rare tumour, a phase 2 trial, using DCR&#xD;
      (Disease Control Rate) data, would be able to recruit a sufficient number of patients, in a&#xD;
      reasonable period of time, to provide a proof of concept of the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      nivolumab in this population. Therefore, we think that an open-label, one arm phase 2 trial,&#xD;
      with a rapid accrual, would be currently a crucial approach and a window of opportunity to&#xD;
      explore whether nivolumab could find its place in PLWHIV with NSCLC. Such a trial is&#xD;
      typically a trial for an academic sponsor, experienced in PLWHIV with NSCLC, which previously&#xD;
      showed its ability to recruit patients with such a rare disease as the IFCT did with the&#xD;
      IFCT-1001 CHIVA trial, testing carboplatin plus pemetrexed followed by pemetrexed.&#xD;

             limit of normal) except subjects with documented Gilbert's syndrome (≤ 5 × ULN) or&#xD;
             liver metastasis, who must have a baseline total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must receive appropriate care and treatment for HIV infection including ART&#xD;
             when clinically indicated and subjects should be under the care of a physician&#xD;
             experienced in HIV management. In case of recent introduction of cART and CD4 levels&#xD;
             &lt;50 cells/ml, inclusion will be possible provided subjects had at least 4 weeks of&#xD;
             treatment prior to inclusion, to avoid clinical type IRIS (immune inflammatory&#xD;
             syndrome reconstitution). All antiretroviral treatments are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male&#xD;
             partner must use a highly effective method of contraception for 28 days prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of investigational product, and must agree to continue using such&#xD;
             precautions for 6 months after the final dose of investigational product; cessation of&#xD;
             contraception after this point should be discussed with the referent physician.&#xD;
             Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable&#xD;
             methods of contraception. They must also refrain from egg cell donation for 6 months&#xD;
             after the final dose of investigational product. Men receiving nivolumab and who are&#xD;
             sexually active with women of childbearing potential will be instructed to adhere to&#xD;
             contraception (appendix I) for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Persons deprived of liberty could be eligible because the expected benefice&#xD;
             (improvement of disease control rate) justifies the foreseeable risk (adverse reaction&#xD;
             of nivolumab).&#xD;
&#xD;

             an external trigger are permitted to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Active or history of inflammatory bowel disease (eg, diverticulitis, colitis, Crohn's,&#xD;
             coeliac disease or other serious gastrointestinal chronic conditions associated with&#xD;
             diarrhea). Note that diverticulosis is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Symptomatic cerebral metastasis unless treated by brain radiotherapy which will be&#xD;
             completed for at least 15 days before the beginning of the treatment; subjects with&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or&#xD;
             any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint&#xD;
             pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The last dose of prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy (with the exception of&#xD;
             palliative radiotherapy) was received less than 3 weeks prior to inclusion;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of primary immunodeficiency, history of organ transplant that requires&#xD;
             therapeutic immunosuppression and the use of immunosuppressive agents within 28 days&#xD;
             of inclusion or a prior history of severe (grade 3 or 4) immune mediated toxicity from&#xD;
             other immune therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;&#xD;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14&#xD;
             days of inclusion. Intranasal/inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement&#xD;
             steroid doses ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of&#xD;
             active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding or male or female patients of&#xD;
             reproductive potential who are not employing an effective method of birth control.&#xD;
