  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the phase 1b/2 study is to determine whether Onvansertib given orally daily&#xD;
      for 5 consecutive days every 28 days is safe and tolerable in adult patients who have&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), or are ineligible for intensive induction&#xD;
      therapy, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose of&#xD;
      Onvansertib in combination with decitabine or Onvansertib in combination with low-dose&#xD;
      cytarabine. In the phase 2 portion of the study, Onvansertib in combination with decitabine&#xD;
      will be studied to provide further data on the safety profile of the combination and to&#xD;
      preliminarily assess the activity of the chosen combination in patients with untreated AML&#xD;
      who are not candidates for aggressive induction therapy, or who have received one prior&#xD;
      treatment for their AML.&#xD;

             excluded.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Sexually active, fertile women must use two effective forms of contraception&#xD;
                  (abstinence, intrauterine device, oral contraceptive, or double barrier device)&#xD;

               2. Sexually active men and their sexual partners must use effective contraceptive&#xD;
                  methods from the time of participant informed consent and until at least 3 months&#xD;
                  after discontinuing study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Serum creatinine ≥2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart disease, active ischemia or any other&#xD;
             uncontrolled cardiac condition, or hypertensive or metabolic condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Myocardial infarction in the previous 12 weeks (from the start of treatment)&#xD;

             electrocardiogram) interval with Fridericia's correction [QTcF] &gt;450 milliseconds. The&#xD;
             QTcF should be calculated as the arithmetic mean of the QTcF on triplicate ECGs. In&#xD;
             the case of potentially correctible causes of QT prolongation (e.g., medications,&#xD;
             hypokalemia), the triplicate ECG may be repeated once during screening and that result&#xD;
             may be used to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Active and uncontrolled disease (other than AML) or infection as judged by the&#xD;
             treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Treatment with systemic therapy for the primary disease within 14 days (except for&#xD;
             hydroxyurea or isolated doses of cytarabine or decitabine for white blood cell&#xD;
             control)&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Grade 2 or greater toxicities from prior therapy, except for Grade 2 toxicities that&#xD;
             are not expected to resolve and that in the judgment of the Investigator do not pose a&#xD;
             significant safety risk to subject participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Participants with any other medical condition, including mental illness or substance&#xD;
             abuse, deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with the participant's&#xD;
             ability to sign the informed consent form or his/her ability to cooperate and&#xD;
             participate in the study, or to interfere with the interpretation of the results.&#xD;
