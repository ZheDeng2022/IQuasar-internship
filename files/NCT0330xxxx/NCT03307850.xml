      This clinical trial will identify exercise-related and emotional stress related effects on&#xD;
      glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes using sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) on an insulin pump will be studied for 5 weeks in the&#xD;
      outpatient setting performing their normal activities, to include their normal diet and&#xD;
      exercise, while assessing the amount of type of exercise performed, and emotional stress&#xD;
      levels, using stress sensor, questionnaires and salivary cortisol levels.&#xD;

    <description>Examine the impact of Stress and Exercise on CGM Glucose Levels, determining how these factors affect time within target glucose range 70-180 mg/dl. Correlate these factors that influence glycemic control to inform future algorithm development for an artificial pancreas (AP) device to better handle exercise and stress related events to be used in a future study.</description>

    <description>Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) on an insulin pump will be studied for 5 weeks in the outpatient setting performing their normal activities, to include their normal diet and exercise, while assessing the amount of type of exercise performed, and emotional stress levels, using stress sensor, questionnaires and salivary cortisol levels.&#xD;
Subjects at the William Sansum Diabetes Center will perform graded exercise on a treadmill for up to 45 minutes with all activity and stress monitors running, achieving 30 and 60% calculated heart rate reserve, once during the study. Subjects at Mayo Clinic will perform a graded exercise test on a treadmill to determine V02max and ensure stable cardiac status, once during the study.</description>

             meningitis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled arterial hypertension (Resting diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg and/or&#xD;
             systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg) at the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled microvascular complications such as current active proliferative diabetic&#xD;
             retinopathy defined as proliferative retinopathy requiring treatment (e.g. laser&#xD;
             therapy) in the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A recent injury to body or limb, muscular disorder, use of any medication, any&#xD;
             carcinogenic disease, or other significant medical disorder if that injury, medication&#xD;
             or disease in the judgment of the investigator will affect the completion of the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
