      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of talimogene laherparepvec in&#xD;
      combination with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and chemoradiation&#xD;
      before surgery in treating patients with rectal cancer that has spread from where it started&#xD;
      to nearby tissue and lymph nodes. Drugs used in immunotherapy, such as talimogene&#xD;
      laherparepvec, may stimulate the body's immune system to fight tumor cells. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy&#xD;
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving talimogene laherparepvec,&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine and chemoradiation before surgery&#xD;
      may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      talimogene laherparepvec in combination with chemotherapy and radiation in rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish safety and feasibility of the combination. II. To determine the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      rectal (NAR) score of talimogene laherparepvec with chemotherapy and radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate genomic information including RAS, RAF mutation status with response, disease&#xD;
      free survival (DFS) and/or overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine immunomodulatory changes following talimogene laherparepvec, chemotherapy&#xD;
      and radiation treatment including proportions of immune cell infiltrates in serially&#xD;
      collected peripheral blood and/or frozen tumor samples (pre-, on treatment, and at post&#xD;
      progression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based features including MRI&#xD;
      circumferential margin (mrCRM) at baseline or post-therapy mrCRM, MRI tumor regression grade&#xD;
      (mrTRG) to define determinants of response, DFS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of talimogene&#xD;
      laherparepvec with chemotherapy and radiation in patients undergoing curative resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the pathological complete response (pCR) rate of talimogene laherparepvec&#xD;
      with chemotherapy and radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of talimogene laherparepvec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intralesionally via endoscopy on weeks 1, 4, 6, and&#xD;
      8. Patients receive 5-fluorouracil intravenously (IV) by bolus and over 46 hours, leucovorin&#xD;
      IV bolus, and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on weeks 2 and 4. Patients also receive&#xD;
      capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) followed by radiation therapy for 28 fractions on&#xD;
      days 1-5 of weeks 8-13. Patients undergo resection surgery on weeks 21-25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and up to 5 years&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
