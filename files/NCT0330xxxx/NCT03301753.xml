  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today the majority of pregnant women in the United States are either overweight or obese at&#xD;
      conception with their offspring having greater adiposity at birth, a 2-fold greater risk of&#xD;
      later obesity, and neonatal insulin resistance. It was long thought that breast milk&#xD;
      composition was fairly uniform among women, having been optimized through evolutionary time&#xD;
      to provide adequate sole nutrition for the growing infant regardless of the environmental&#xD;
      circumstances. However, recent evidence shows that breast milk is a highly complex fluid with&#xD;
      significant inter-individual variation in hormonal and cytokine concentrations. Pervasive&#xD;
      maternal obesity is an evolutionarily novel condition for the human species but little effort&#xD;
      has yet been made to systematically examine how this novel condition is associated with&#xD;
      breast milk adipose-tissue derived hormone and cytokine (adipocytokine) variation, or whether&#xD;
      that variation relates to infant metabolic status. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      comprehensively assess the &quot;lactational programming&quot; hypothesis, that is, whether or not&#xD;
      recently documented variation in breast-milk composition is related to both maternal&#xD;
      adiposity and to infant metabolic status. The central hypothesis is that a graded,&#xD;
      dose-response relationship between maternal adiposity and adipocytokine concentrations in&#xD;
      breast milk exists and that milk adipocytokine concentrations are associated with altered&#xD;
      body composition in their exclusively breast-fed offspring. The results of the study will be&#xD;
      used to design interventions to reduce maternal weight during pregnancy and lactation and to&#xD;
      augment lactation education materials to focus on the needs of obese breast-feeding women.&#xD;

      General Study Design A prospective observational pregnancy cohort of 360 non-diabetic&#xD;
      mothers, who exclusively breastfeed their infants to at least 1 month post-partum, will be&#xD;
      recruited in the second trimester of pregnancy, across a wide range of maternal pre-pregnancy&#xD;
      BMI, with equal numbers of normal weight, overweight, and obese women. The women will be&#xD;
      recruited at two study centers (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma&#xD;
      City, OK and Health Partners Research Foundation in Saint Paul/Minneapolis, MN), with&#xD;
      maternal and infant diet, body composition and metabolic health followed prospectively at 1,&#xD;
      3 and 6-months post-partum in Specific Aims 1 and 2. In Specific Aim 3, a subset of 60 of&#xD;
      these mother/infant dyads &quot;Mothers in Focus&quot; (30 OB and 30 NW mothers) will be recruited for&#xD;
      additional biospecimen collection, including milk samples at 2 and 6-months, maternal body&#xD;
      composition changes using DXA, infant DXA, metabolomic comparison of serial milk samples, and&#xD;
      follow-up to 12 rather than 6-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal Adiposity. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI status (NW, OW, OB) is the primary exposure&#xD;
      used to power the study. Pre-pregnancy BMI will be determined using first (baseline) clinic&#xD;
      weights from the electronic medical records (EMR) (no more than 90 d. after last menstrual&#xD;
      period), and stature measured by research staff at the mother's first visit to our research&#xD;
      centers. BMI will be categorized as underweight (BMI &lt;18.5), normal weight (BMI 18.5 - &lt;25),&#xD;
      overweight (BMI 25 - &lt;30) and obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gestational weight gain (GWG) and postpartum weight loss/retention:Total GWG will be&#xD;
      calculated as the difference between delivery weight and baseline weight (as documented&#xD;
      above). If weight at delivery is not available, the last prenatal weight in the EMR, ≤14 days&#xD;
      from birth, will be used. Trimester specific GWG will be calculated from the EMR. GWG will be&#xD;
      used as a continuous and as a categorical exposure (excessive, appropriate, and insufficient,&#xD;
      according to the IOM 2009 guidelines. Early PP weight loss (from delivery to 1-month&#xD;
      postpartum), and later PP weight loss from 1-month to 3-months PP will be calculated.&#xD;
      Concurrent changes in maternal weight and milk adipocytokine levels from 0 - 1 month and 1 -&#xD;
      3 months will be examined, hypothesizing that greater PP weight loss (lower weight retention)&#xD;
      is associated with lower levels of milk adipocytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Milk Collection: Changes in milk composition will be assessed from 1 to 3 months. Definition&#xD;
      of exclusive breast feeding: Study staff will confirm that all infants have been exclusively&#xD;
      breast milk fed (i.e. no formula, no liquid other than water and no solids) at least 14 days&#xD;
      prior to the 1-month visit and plan to continue exclusively breastfeed to 3 months. Exclusive&#xD;
      breast milk feeding will include any combination of expressed breast milk and breast milk fed&#xD;
      via the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast Milk Collection Protocol: Mother and child will report to the study site at 1 and&#xD;
      3-months (± 5 days) postpartum, between 8:00-10:00 am, at least 1½ hours since the last&#xD;
      feeding and while the mother has fasted at least 1 hour. A pre-feeding infant weight will be&#xD;
      obtained using a high sensitivity scale, the mother will be encouraged to feed the child ad&#xD;
      libitum from both breasts until volitionally satisfied, and a postfeeding infant weight will&#xD;
      be obtained (difference = milk output). Questionnaire information, maternal anthropometry,&#xD;
      and infant body composition data will be collected, and 2 hours later, the mother will&#xD;
      provide a single breast expression sample using an electric breast pump (Medela, Inc.,&#xD;
      provided by the study team). Breast milk will be mixed, aliquoted and stored at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Milk Adipocytokine Assays: Milk samples will be thawed in the refrigerator and vortexed. Milk&#xD;
      fat will be separated from the aqueous phase by centrifugation at 3,000g for 10 minutes at&#xD;
      4°C. The resulting skimmed milk will be assayed using commercially available immunoassay kits&#xD;
      for insulin, IGF-1/BP, high molecular weight adiponectin, visfatin, leptin, IL-1β, IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-10, and TNF-α. Glucose will be measured by the glucose oxidase method. To examine&#xD;
      additional cytokine and growth factor concentrations (e.g., interleukins, interferons, TGF-&#xD;
      β) in a manner that conserves sample, a multiplex assay (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and&#xD;
      the Luminex 200 Multiplex analyzer will be employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis for Specific Aim 1: For each of the milk adipocytokines (continuous dependent&#xD;
      variables), separate mixed effects regression models (to account for serial milk data) will&#xD;
      be constructed, first testing crude associations of milk IL-6 at both 1 and 3-months with&#xD;
      each maternal adiposity variable (excessive GWG, pre-pregnancy BMI status, total GWG,&#xD;
      trimester-specific GWG, early and later PP weight loss), and then minimally adjusted models&#xD;
      (also adjusting for infant sex and gestational age, study center (OK or MN), maternal age,&#xD;
      parity, ethnicity, and maternal socioeconomic status) and finally fully-adjusted regression&#xD;
      models including those variables determined to be potential confounders. In secondary&#xD;
      analyses, possible effect modification of the maternal adiposity associations will be&#xD;
      assessed by adding interaction terms. If the interaction term is significant, a stratified&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection for Specific Aim 2 Infant Body Composition. Total body composition will be&#xD;
      measured using air displacement plethysmography (ADP) i.e. Pea Pod (v 3.1.1), a rapid, valid,&#xD;
      highly reliable (% fat CV%&lt; 2.5% in our hands) method of total body volume estimation from&#xD;
      which total body fat (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) is determined using prediction equations.&#xD;
      Both the University of Minnesota and the University of Oklahoma have the same ADP (same&#xD;
      manufacturer, model and software versions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant insulin secretion and resistance at 6 months: C-peptide, or connecting peptide, as a&#xD;
      marker of insulin secretion will be collected. Serum C-peptide is secreted in equimolar&#xD;
      amounts by the pancreas as insulin, but is a more stable measure because it is not prone to&#xD;
      degradation following hemolysis. C-peptide was used as a marker of fetal beta cell function&#xD;
      in the HAPO (Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Out-come) study to assess the effects of&#xD;
      maternal obesity and gestational diabetes on adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes. Insulin&#xD;
      resistance will be estimated using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). Blood will be&#xD;
      obtained via heel-stick in the infant at the time of the 6 month visit to the study center,&#xD;
      as is routine in our laboratories, which yields ~ 1.0 cc of blood. Whole blood will be kept&#xD;
      on ice until centrifugation in our laboratories, and 0.5 mL of serum aliquoted at stored at&#xD;
      -80 C until shipped to Dr. Fields' laboratory for analysis using ELISA (Millipore, Billerica,&#xD;
      MA; Intra-assay CV = 5%; Inter-assay CV = 6%). Interpretation of C-peptide requires blood&#xD;
      glucose level which will be measured in the same blood sample using the glucose oxidase&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Milk Macronutrient Content: Total fat content will be measured by the Mojonnier method Fatty&#xD;
      acid composition will be assessed by gas chromatography using the International Dairy&#xD;
      Federation (IDF) methods. Other standard methods will quantitate total nitrogen, ash,&#xD;
      moisture, and carbohydrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant Appetite, Satiety, and Diet: Shortened versions of the infant diet questionnaires used&#xD;
      in the Infant Feeding Practices Study II at 1 month, 3-months, and 6-months will assess&#xD;
      maternal report of infant dietary intake. Maternal perception of infant appetite will be&#xD;
      measured using the Baby Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Infant Sleep: The Sadeh Brief Infant&#xD;
      Sleep Questionnaire has been validated against actigraphy and will be used to assess sleeping&#xD;
      behavior at each visit. Additional Potential Confounders: See Specific Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis(Specific Aim 2) Statistical Analysis: The over-arching primary hypothesis is&#xD;
      that milk adipocytokine concentrations will be associated with altered body composition from&#xD;
      ages 1 to 6-months, and with elevated C-peptide or HOMA-IR at 6 months, independent of&#xD;
      potential confounders. Example Hypothesis 2.a1: Higher levels of the appetite suppressing&#xD;
      hormone leptin at 1 and/or 3-months will be associated with lower infant weight gain,&#xD;
      reflecting specifically lower FFM gain from 1 - 6 months. We will use mixed effects linear&#xD;
      and logistic regression as the primary analysis approach to address this and related&#xD;
      hypotheses. Growth and body composition data will be serial (0 [for weight], 1, 3, and&#xD;
      6-months), which will be examined using mixed effects models which models the covariance&#xD;
      structure of the repeated measures within subject and allows for subject-specific intercept&#xD;
      and slopes to be modeled. Milk adipocytokines are the independent variables of interest.&#xD;
      Because their individual relationships to infant growth and other outcomes may not be linear,&#xD;
      quintiles or quartiles of milk adipocytokines as well as continuously distributed variables&#xD;
      will be examined. Multiple milk adipocytokines will be included simultaneously in final&#xD;
      models, to test their independent effects on infant outcomes and to assess their aggregate&#xD;
      effects (variance explained).&#xD;
