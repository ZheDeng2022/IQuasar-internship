  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a world widely common syndrome, characterized by widespread pain, often&#xD;
      accompanied by general fatigue, soreness, and abnormal sensations (like &quot;pins and needles&quot;).&#xD;
      The reasons and the mechanisms (pathogenesis) of FM are still poorly understood. Efficacious&#xD;
      therapies cannot be developed without understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of the&#xD;
      disease or syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FM patients suffer from pain and sense of weakness and fatigue in the muscles, and often&#xD;
      report difficulty in relaxing their muscles. So far, the studies on muscle activation in&#xD;
      fibromyalgia (mostly using surface electromyography) have shown some unusual functioning, a&#xD;
      kind of overuse, but the results have been somewhat contradictory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FM symptoms share some features with small fibre neuropathy, which is a disease or&#xD;
      abnormality of small nerve fibres with a diverse aetiology. Recently, several research groups&#xD;
      have shown (studying both the electrical function of superficial nerves and nerve endings of&#xD;
      skin samples) that up to 50% of the FM patients with severe symptoms have small fibre&#xD;
      neuropathy: their small nerves do not function properly and small nerve fibre density in&#xD;
      their skin is reduced. However, as this phenomenon is common but not a rule, it might be&#xD;
      rather a consequence of some underlying mechanisms of the syndrome, creating even more&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to investigate whether there would exist metabolic changes in FM patients that&#xD;
      would create pain and lead to functional changes and damage in small nerve fibres. The&#xD;
      investigators also aim to explore the muscle function particularly in distressed situations&#xD;
      and at rest. The hypothesis is that a towards-overuse-altered function would create&#xD;
      unfavourable metabolic changes. Third, the aim is to investigate some psychological factors&#xD;
      (such as tendency to get anxious or distressed) to find out, if there is any association&#xD;
      between them and muscle function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FM patients as well as healthy control subjects will be recruited at Helsinki University&#xD;
      Hospital Pain Clinic and from primary care at Vantaa Health Care Centre. The voluntary test&#xD;
      subjects will attend&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A muscle function examination of 30 minutes with electromyography using surface&#xD;
           electrodes, including mentally distressing tasks and relaxing periods. At the same&#xD;
           session, the subject will reply to some questionnaires regarding their symptoms and&#xD;
           measuring some psychological factors. Actual pain level will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A glucose tolerance test, with other blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A bicycle ergometer exercise test of 20 - 30 minutes, with both physiological and&#xD;
           chemical (blood samples) recordings. Actual pain level will be assessed as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this stage, 40 patients and 20 healthy control subjects will be recruited.&#xD;
