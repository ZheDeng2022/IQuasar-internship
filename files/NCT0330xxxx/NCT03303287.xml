  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pakistan is a developing country and there have been a considerable rise in obesity and&#xD;
      hypertension in children in recent years. In this setting a focus on primary prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases is more cost effective than spending resources on secondary or&#xD;
      tertiary prevention,. Primary prevention includes interventions to promote physical activity&#xD;
      (&gt; 30 minutes/day in school), healthy dietary habits (decreased consumption of sweetened&#xD;
      beverages and snacks, and increased consumption of fruit and vegetables) and health education&#xD;
      focusing on cardiovascular risk factors in school children. This would translate into&#xD;
      healthier cardiovascular outcomes (eg. less hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes) in adult&#xD;
      life. The investigators propose a school health education program for Pakistan (SHEPP) for&#xD;
      children aged 9-11 years in 3 schools in Karachi for a period of one year. This program will&#xD;
      comprise of 140 minutes physical activity/week (including aerobics):30 minutes aerobic&#xD;
      PA(30*2=60) + 10 minutes (10*5=50)physical activity in assembly daily+ 1 minute between&#xD;
      periods(1*6*5=30) and healthy diet and healthy heart teaching. Additionally teaching will&#xD;
      also be given to teachers and parents, who will further reinforce these habits in children.&#xD;
      We hypothesise that SHEPP will improve physical activity levels, dietary habits and knowledge&#xD;
      about healthy heart in children, will decrease blood pressure, body mass index, waist&#xD;
      circumference, at the end of the year. If this healthy behavior is carried on to adult life&#xD;
      it will serve as an excellent primary prevention measure. The investigators , later on plan&#xD;
      to study long term outcomes after implementation of this intervention.&#xD;

      1.1.Interventions to reduce childhood obesity School based programs have also been introduced&#xD;
      as interventions to assess the impact on blood pressure ant weight. In effectiveness trial&#xD;
      done by Yin et al on the impact of 8 months after school physical activity programme&#xD;
      demonstrated a reduction in percentage body fat, but no effect on blood pressure.(52) Schools&#xD;
      have been unable to provide sufficient time and resources for students to meet all the&#xD;
      objectives of standard physical education, the concept of &quot;health-related&#xD;
      PE&quot;.(13)Traditionally, the role of schools in providing and promoting physical activity has&#xD;
      been during the school day (eg, PE, recess) and/or on the school campus immediately after&#xD;
      school. Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls (TAAG) is a large-scale randomized trial&#xD;
      involving 36 schools at 6 study sites across the United States and sponsored by the National&#xD;
      Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This large-scale study is examining the effects of a&#xD;
      school-community linked intervention on overall physical activity in middle school girls.(53)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity and behavior of change theory The effectiveness of physical activity&#xD;
      interventions would benefit from a better understanding of this behavior. (54) Theory of&#xD;
      planned behavior has demonstrated usefulness in studies of health-related behavior.(55) Only&#xD;
      children's intention and self-identity as a result of their cognition is related to&#xD;
      participation in physical activity to some extent(56). This suggests that educational&#xD;
      strategies aimed at increasing children's motivation remainan important strategy to promote&#xD;
      physical activity. Physical activity interventions have been done focusing on designing&#xD;
      interventions to overcome cultural, socioeconomic barriers in performing physical activity&#xD;
      based on psychosocial cognitive theory.(57)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of carefully designed studies incorporating health-related PE concepts and physical&#xD;
      activity in PE classes have been conducted. Dietary or physical activity behavior produce a&#xD;
      significant and clinically meaningful reduction in body mass index status of children and&#xD;
      adolescents in preventing obesity (58, 59) Alternatively behavioral prevention and&#xD;
      situational prevention elements have been combined to increase physical activity, decrease&#xD;
      the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, and decrease time spent with screen media(60).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies reporting positive outcomes implemented physical activity sessions that lasted at&#xD;
      least 30 min d(-1)?. Several studies showed that children are most active in the first 10-15&#xD;
      min. The existence or installation of playground markings or fixed play equipment had no&#xD;
      effect, whereas the presence or addition of portable play equipment was positively correlated&#xD;
      with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of Parents and Teachers One of the interventions in promoting healthy lifestyle in&#xD;
      children is focusing on children, parents and teachers simultaneously by introducing learning&#xD;
      sessions and materials for healthy lifestyle.(32, 61)Teacher training may be a key element&#xD;
      for successful interventions. To overcome time constraints, a suggested solution is to&#xD;
      integrate physical activity into daily routines and other areas of the preschool&#xD;
      curriculum.(62)Additionally parental barriers are associated with the time that children&#xD;
      spend in both active and sedentary pursuits.(63) Knowledge about risk factors for obesity and&#xD;
      myocardial infarction is suboptimal in Pakistani adults(64).Only 42% adult students had a&#xD;
      good level of knowledge of modifiable risk factors of heart disease among patients with acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction in Karachi.(65)Health education on physical activity and healthy diet&#xD;
      using multiple level intervention is essential to be given at schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Rationale Dietary behaviors, physical activity and sedentary lifestyle are independent&#xD;
      predictors of overweight and higher BMI among Pakistani primary school children.(66) Your&#xD;
      study does not focus on preschool children so it is better to write about school children.&#xD;
      Children skipping breakfast (8%), eating fast food and snacks â‰¥once a week (43%) and being&#xD;
      involved in sedentary lifestyle&gt;one hour a day (49%) were significantly more likely to be&#xD;
      overweight and obese while those participating in physical activity&gt;twice a week (53%) were&#xD;
      significantly less likely to be overweight and obese.(67) Approximately 85% of the students&#xD;
      had a predominantly sedentary life style, due to tuitions, television viewing or internet&#xD;
      surfing or indoor games like play stations in affluent schools of Karachi.(68)Most public&#xD;
      sector schools do not have designated physical trainers to encourage physical activity in&#xD;
      school children. Additionally unhealthy food including fast food, sugar sweetened beverages&#xD;
      are commonly available in the school canteens. Furthermore the television watching and&#xD;
      computers have added to physical inactivity making the children more sedentary. Most schools&#xD;
      do not have any health education curriculum which could be taught to children and no such&#xD;
      trial has been conducted in Pakistan A feasibility study using a similar design was done&#xD;
      including 276 children, in which 60 % spent &gt; 3 hours daily in watching TV or working on&#xD;
      computer. It was conducted in four public sector schools in Karachi. However due to limited&#xD;
      length of intervention of 20 weeks, clear benefits on cardiovascular outcomes like blood&#xD;
      pressure could not be observed (unpublished data).Additionally incorporating 30 min physical&#xD;
      activity was a challenging task and was not sustainable. Maybe this is something for the&#xD;
      summary since you already have said it :Schools are probably the most pragmatic place where&#xD;
      such shifts in lifestyle can be incorporated in adolescents.( figure 1) Strategies for&#xD;
      promoting physical activity at school level have been tested worldwide , however not at large&#xD;
      in Pakistan. Strategies need to be built in on large scale in adolescents, which can be&#xD;
      incorporated within their school boundry and time limitations. A multipronged approach&#xD;
      involving children, parents and teachers simultaneously is needed in school setup to make it&#xD;
      more successful. Using a multilevel approach to childhood obesity prevention including staff,&#xD;
      parents, and community partners is beneficial.(69) )&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3.Main aim The main aim of the study is to incorporate a healthy lifestyle in children in&#xD;
      terms of increased physical activity, healthier dietary habits, and basic health education.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the programme will increase the level of physical activity not only at&#xD;
      school time but also at leisure time, increase the healthy dietary habits and have an effect&#xD;
      on cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Research Questions 1.4a. Research question I&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the effect of a 10 months school health education program in Pakistan(SHEPP): vs&#xD;
           routine physical activity levels (in school, out of school, moderate to vigorous&#xD;
           physical activity and sedentary time) in school children ? 1.4b. Research questions II&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the effect of a 10 months school health education program in Pakistan(SHEPP): vs&#xD;
           routine on intake of fruits and vegetable, sugar sweetened beverages and snacks&#xD;
           taken/day in school children ? 1.4c.Research question III&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the effect of a 10 months school health education program in Pakistan(SHEPP)vs&#xD;
           routine on cardio metabolic risk factors; systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood&#xD;
           pressure, body mass index and waist circumference and body fat percentage in school&#xD;
           children?&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5. Objectives 1.5a. Objective I&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effect of a 10 months school health education program in Pakistan(SHEPP):&#xD;
           vs routine on physical activity levels (in school, out of school, moderate to vigorous&#xD;
           physical activity and sedentary time) in school children 1.5b. Objective II&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effect of a 10 months school health education program in Pakistan(SHEPP):&#xD;
           vs routine on intake of fruits and vegetable, sugar sweetened beverage and snacks&#xD;
           taken/day in school children 1.5c.Objective III&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effect of a 10 months school health education program in&#xD;
           Pakistan(SHEPP)vs routine on cardio metabolic risk factors; systolic blood pressure,&#xD;
           diastolic blood pressure, body mass index and waist circumference and body fat&#xD;
           percentage in school children&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. Methods 2.1 Study Design Study design and participants: Three schools under the Aga&#xD;
           Khan Education Service in Karachi will be included in a two-arm parallel cluster&#xD;
           intervention trial. All schools belong to lower to middle income class, at different&#xD;
           locations, all having the same school curriculum. Baseline data will be collected from&#xD;
           all three schools during a three month period by trained research staff. This would&#xD;
           comprise of data on sociodemographic factors, FFQ for diet, youth physical activity&#xD;
           questionnaire for physical activity, blood pressure ,weight, height and waist&#xD;
           circumference, body fat percentage measurements using validated instruments. Each school&#xD;
           will then be assigned to intervention or control (intervention in one school , and&#xD;
           control in 2 schools). All children aged 8-11 years enrolled in these schools will be&#xD;
           included. The rationale for this is that it is the period 8-11 years age where physical&#xD;
           activity starts to decline mainly in girls.(70) Follow up will be done after 10 months&#xD;
           of intervention. Ten months cutoff has been chosen as benefits on cardiovascular risk&#xD;
           factors are more pronounced at 10 month follow-up.(39)&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Study Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schools under the Aga Khan Education Service will be selected since they are all part of Aga&#xD;
      Khan Development network. These are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aga Khan School, Kharadhar&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aga Khan School, Garden&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sultan Mohamed Shah Aga Khan School, Karachi The reason for selection of these school is&#xD;
           that they follow a uniform curriculum across the school system. Additionally since they&#xD;
           are apart of the Aga Khan Development network, it would be more practical to work with&#xD;
           them. All schools are located in urban Karachi and Hyderabad. They have ample space to&#xD;
           conduct physical activity sessions, auditoriums and discussion room. Each school has&#xD;
           approximately 2000 students, both boys and girls. Each school comprises of 10 levels of&#xD;
           classes with 3-4 sections. The study is expected to be completed in 18 months to 20&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention School health education program in Pakistan(SHEPP): The health education program&#xD;
      will be directed towards children, parents and teachers. The basis of designing such&#xD;
      intervention is to overcome cultural, socioeconomic barriers in performing physical activity&#xD;
      and is based on psychosocial cognitive theory.(57)The primary focus will be the&#xD;
      children.(figure II) Children 4. Programmed physical activity 140 minutes / week will be&#xD;
      targeted. i. 30 minutes twice a week will be delivered by teachers trained by expert physical&#xD;
      trainers. It would comprise of warm up, moderate to vigorous physical activity and cool&#xD;
      down(71).(30*2=60 min/week). These sessions will be lead by the school physical trainer under&#xD;
      supervision of an expert physical trainer (trained in aerobics) Different exercises is&#xD;
      introduced every month and discussions with students will be done by the research team as&#xD;
      well. A manual will be built to keep uniformity in the interventions. This has been&#xD;
      previously tested(71) ii. 10 minutes physical activity daily during assembly(10*5=50&#xD;
      minutes/week) iii. 1 minute between class warm up. (1*6*5=30 minutes/week) Children will be&#xD;
      encouraged to perform brake time physical activity by selecting leaders within a class&#xD;
      group(who will facilitate such PA in brake time)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform such PA in leisure time 4 times a week(atleast half an hour)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before class exercises(2 minutes between periods)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease levels of sedentary behavior(not more than hour) 5. Healthy diet teaching will&#xD;
           be given to children by a trained nutritionist. Healthy diet is based on food&#xD;
           pyramid.(72)There would be three sessions in all of one hour duration i. Encouragement&#xD;
           to increase fruits and vegetables intake serving in a day ii. Encouragement to avoid&#xD;
           sugar sweetened beverages iii. Encouragement to avoid fast food items 6. Healthy heart&#xD;
           teaching will be given by a trained physician. This would comprise of total 7 sessions&#xD;
           (one hour each). The study material for the children will be adapted from &quot;my heart&quot;&#xD;
           (www.bookgroup.org.pk, Children health fund). This material has been pilot tested&#xD;
           earlier in schools. It has basic information about heart. (AppendixA)&#xD;

             1. Health problems in Pakistan&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Physical activity as a preventive measure&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Healthy diet as a preventive measure Parents will then reinforce these habits in&#xD;
                their children and will ask them atleast twice a week.(Did ypu do physical activity&#xD;
                at school and home?Did you have atleast one fruit or vegetable today?) Teachers The&#xD;
                teachers will be trained by a team of experts including a physician, a nutritionist&#xD;
                and a physical activity expert. A teachers guide will be developed.(Appendix B)This&#xD;
                comprises of&#xD;
