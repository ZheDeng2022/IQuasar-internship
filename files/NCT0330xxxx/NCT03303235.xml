  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insufficient uterine tone resulting in atony can potentiate hemorrhage and adverse outcomes&#xD;
      for the parturient. Oxytocin is the first pharmacologic agent used, followed by&#xD;
      methylergonovine, carboprost, and misoprostol. The American Congress of Obstetricians and&#xD;
      Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends the sequential use of oxytocin, followed by methylergonovine,&#xD;
      carboprost, misoprostol, then surgical intervention for cases of refractory uterine atony.&#xD;
      Many studies have examined the effect and dosage of intravenous uterotonics, including&#xD;
      oxytocin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are anecdotal reports of using intravenous bolus or rapid infusion of&#xD;
      methylergonovine, no randomized trial has compared efficacy and side effects of these two&#xD;
      routes of administration. Investigators hypothesize that intravenous methylergonovine reduces&#xD;
      the time to adequate uterine tone (the tone at which the uterus is adequately contracted to&#xD;
      prevent atony after delivery of neonate), decreases the total dose of methylergonovine to&#xD;
      contract the uterus, and therefore produces fewer side effects of hypertension, nausea, and&#xD;
      vomiting. Reducing the time to achieve adequate uterine tone is likely to decrease postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The United States is one of the few modern countries in which maternal peripartum mortality&#xD;
      continues to rise. One of the three most important causes of maternal mortality is severe&#xD;
      hemorrhage. Controlling postpartum uterine tone remains an important role for the obstetric&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. Insufficient uterine tone resulting in atony can potentiate hemorrhage and&#xD;
      adverse outcomes for the parturient. Oxytocin is the first pharmacologic agent used, followed&#xD;
      by methylergonovine, carboprost, and misoprostol. The American Congress of Obstetricians and&#xD;
      Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends the sequential use of oxytocin, followed by methylergonovine,&#xD;
      carboprost, misoprostol, then surgical intervention for cases of refractory uterine atony.&#xD;
      Many studies have examined the effect and dosage of intravenous uterotonics, including&#xD;
      oxytocin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylergonovine maleate is a semi-synthetic ergot alkaloid. Methylergonovine(200 mcg) is&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly when oxytocin has been administered but has not contracted the&#xD;
      uterus sufficiently. It is not without side effects, however. Due to its vasoconstrictive&#xD;
      properties, methylergonovine has been shown to elevate blood pressures and is avoided in&#xD;
      preeclamptic patients who may not tolerate abrupt increases in blood pressures. Although&#xD;
      there are anecdotal reports of using intravenous bolus or rapid infusion of methylergonovine,&#xD;
      no randomized trial has compared efficacy and side effects of these two routes of&#xD;
      administration. Investigators hypothesize that intravenous methylergonovine reduces the time&#xD;
      to adequate uterine tone (the tone at which the uterus is adequately contracted to prevent&#xD;
      atony after delivery of neonate), decreases the total dose of methylergonovine to contract&#xD;
      the uterus, and therefore produces fewer side effects of hypertension, nausea, and vomiting.&#xD;
      Reducing the time to achieve adequate uterine tone is likely to decrease postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage.&#xD;
