  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended as a Proof of Concept and dose confirmation study. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to observe safety and tolerability of idronoxil (NOX66) in&#xD;
      combination with radiotherapy (at palliative doses) in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and to confirm dose in order to progress to Phase&#xD;
      2/3.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate three escalating doses of NOX66 in combination with palliative&#xD;
      dose of radiation therapy to establish safety profile and / or obtain efficacy signals and to&#xD;
      determine the optimal dose for future radiation therapy combination studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key hypotheses to be tested in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. That NOX66 can be safely added to palliative dose radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. That NOX66 may sensitise tumours to palliative doses of radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. That NOX66 in combination with radiation therapy may trigger or augment an abscopal&#xD;
           effect&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a minimum of 1 symptomatic lesion amenable to radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation therapy will be delivered at a 20Gy dosage over 5 fractions. NOX66 will be taken on&#xD;
      13 consecutive days starting 1 day prior to radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response of irradiated and non-irradiated target tumour lesions will be measured by&#xD;
      CT/MRI scan and RECIST1.1 criteria at three time points post treatment. Pain response will be&#xD;
      evaluated using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) instrument at five time points&#xD;
      post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be suitable for the study as they become indicated for palliative radiation&#xD;
      therapy for management of their cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enrol up to 24 patients in 3 NOX66 dose level cohorts of 4 patients (n=12)&#xD;
      and an expansion cohort of 12 patients. Dose escalation decisions will be based on patients&#xD;
      who experience adverse events directly related to NOX66 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the review of accumulated safety data, disease status and treatment efficacy&#xD;
      signals at WEEK 6 for the first 12 patients, the Study Steering Committee will determine the&#xD;
      dose at which to continue treatment for the expansion patient Cohort 4 in the study. A&#xD;
      further 12 patients will be recruited at this dose level.&#xD;

    <description>Safety will be assessed through reported incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (AEs), including SAEs, dose limiting toxicities, AEs leading to withdrawal, events of at least CTCAE Version 4.03 Grade 2 in severity. Treatment emergent AEs are those with an onset on or after the initiation of therapy. Timepoints for AE /SAE assessment are Day 2 (start of radiation therapy treatment and one day after start of NOX66 treatment), Day 6, End of treatment (Day 16-17) and from enrolment up to week 6, week 12, week 24.</description>
