  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Administration of intravenous fluids is a key step in the management of the post-operative&#xD;
      patient. Fluid management has been identified as one area that can affect rates of&#xD;
      post-operative complications and outcomes. It is important to give the right amount of fluid,&#xD;
      enough to optimise cardiovascular function, but not so much that we flood the cells. To guide&#xD;
      this, we use a fluid challenge, administration of a small amount of fluid to test the&#xD;
      cardiovascular response. At present there is significant inter-user variability in the method&#xD;
      of administration of a fluid challenge. To ensure accuracy and reliability in assessing the&#xD;
      response to a fluid challenge, the optimal method of administration needs to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the optimal rate to give a fluid challenge over.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to receive a fluid challenge over either 5 or 20 minutes. Both of&#xD;
      these rates are within the currently accepted range. All patients will receive a dose of&#xD;
      4ml/kg of intravenous fluid. Previous work has shown this to be the optimal dose to reliably&#xD;
      stress the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of the mean pressure in the cardiovascular system (mean systemic filling pressure&#xD;
      or Pmsf) during the administration of a fluid challenge will be used to assess which rate of&#xD;
      administration effectively challenges the cardiovascular system. Pmsf is measured using a&#xD;
      pneumatic tourniquet inflated for sixty seconds, above an arterial line. The invasive&#xD;
      arterial pressure is observed to then determine Pmsf. Cardiac output will also be monitored&#xD;
      during and after administration of the fluid challenge. Since the microcirculation may remain&#xD;
      impaired despite stabilisation of the macrocirculation, we will also observe this at&#xD;
      baseline, on completion of the fluid challenge, and at 5 minute intervals for 15 minutes.&#xD;
      This is observed using a handheld camera placed under the tongue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that administration of a fluid challenge at a faster rate, over 5 minutes&#xD;
      as opposed to 20 minutes, will be a more effective test of the cardiovascular response. An&#xD;
      effective fluid challenge is defined as one that causes a significant rise in mean systemic&#xD;
      filling pressure. As such, a higher proportion of responders will be seen in response to the&#xD;
      faster rate of fluid challenge. A responder is defined by an increase in cardiac output or&#xD;
      stroke volume of more than 10% from baseline in response to a fluid challenge.&#xD;
