      This qualitative study will use focus groups, small group interviews, and individual&#xD;
      interviews (both in person and over the phone) to compile a range of perspectives on service&#xD;
      members' decision-making processes and information needs related to Stellate Ganglion Block&#xD;
      (SGB). Participants will include service members, spouses, and providers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The qualitative (acceptability) study will use focus groups, small group interviews, and&#xD;
      individual interviews (both in person and telephonic) to compile a range of perspectives on&#xD;
      service members' decision-making processes and information needs related to SGB. Participants&#xD;
      will include service members, spouses, and providers. Data collection will occur at each&#xD;
      study site because attitudes conveyed by leadership and chain of command may vary across&#xD;
      installation. Scheduling will be based on the accumulation of ample service members&#xD;
      indicating an interest in participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All service members enrolled in the clinical effectiveness trial (Study Number: NCT03077919)&#xD;
      will be eligible for the qualitative study if they have received at least one SGB study&#xD;
      procedure during the three months prior to qualitative data collection. When qualitative data&#xD;
      collection is scheduled, the study team will approach service members who indicated initial&#xD;
      interest in participating in the acceptability if they still meet the eligibility criteria.&#xD;
      Service members will not be contacted for qualitative study participation if the Research&#xD;
      Coordinator or treating provider considers that participation would cause undue distress&#xD;
      based on their most recent contact with the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Service members who did not participate in the clinical effectiveness trial are eligible for&#xD;
      the qualitative study if they have received at least one SGB for PTSD symptoms at a study&#xD;
      site in the three months prior to qualitative data collection and if participation would not&#xD;
      cause undue distress. These participants will be recruited in the clinic as well as through a&#xD;
      medical record search conducted by the Site PI or other clinical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment to specific focus groups will be based on pay grade and subjective assessment of&#xD;
      change as reported at the 4-Week assessment or at the time of screening for the qualitative&#xD;
      study. In order to maximize homogeneity, lower enlisted service members and non-commissioned&#xD;
      officers (NCOs) will be assigned to different groups. These groups will be further divided so&#xD;
      that those reporting positive change since the procedure will be assigned to a different&#xD;
      group than those reporting no change or feeling worse than at the time of the procedure.&#xD;
      Depending on the number of eligible participants by pay grade, officers may be interviewed&#xD;
      individually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible service members, both clinical trial and non-clinical trial participants, may be&#xD;
      assigned to a service member/spouse dyad subgroup if they meet the above criteria and their&#xD;
      spouse has expressed an interest in participating in the qualitative study. Those service&#xD;
      members who participate as part of the dyad subgroup will not be eligible to participate in&#xD;
      the service member only focus groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants for the provider focus groups will be Behavioral Health or other (e.g.,&#xD;
      Family Medicine) clinicians who have referred or could potentially refer service members for&#xD;
      SGB for PTSD symptoms, as well as physicians who provide SGBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned focus group interviews will be structured discussions on a particular topic&#xD;
      involving a small number of people under the direction of a moderator (Krueger &amp; Casey,&#xD;
      2000). The method relies on both the interactive social context of the discussion and on the&#xD;
      individual experiences of each of the group members to produce a rich discussion in which&#xD;
      shared experiences stimulate individual contributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative study will explore participants' perceptions of SGB in relation to other&#xD;
      options for treatment of PTSD, from the perspectives of service members, service&#xD;
      member/spouse couples, and providers. Broad topics covered in service member focus groups,&#xD;
      service members/spouse interviews, and provider focus group are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Context for mental health and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advantages and drawbacks of treatment options&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information and decision-making&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experience and expectations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus groups and small group interviews will take approximately 90 minutes, service&#xD;
      member-significant other interviews will take approximately 60 minutes, and individual&#xD;
      interviews will take approximately 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All focus groups and interviews will be led by a study team member with prior experience in&#xD;
      qualitative data collection with clinicians and service members engaged in mental health&#xD;
      treatment. Real-time notes will be collected by a second team member but each focus group or&#xD;
      interview will also be audio-recorded if all participants give permission to do so. The&#xD;
      purpose of the audio recordings is to augment any notes taken by the second team member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from focus groups and interviews will be summarized in topline notes as soon as feasible&#xD;
      after data collection. In-depth analysis will employ standard qualitative methods. All notes&#xD;
      will be entered into qualitative data base software such as NVivo 9 (QSR International Pty&#xD;
      Ltd. Version 9, 2010) to facilitate coding and retrieval. Analysis will be both deductive,&#xD;
      following a hierarchical coding structure based on topic guide questions, and inductive,&#xD;
      creating queries to assess patterns observed in the data and hypotheses emerging from&#xD;
      preliminary analyses. Analytical matrixes to compare responses across respondent types will&#xD;
      also be constructed. Comparisons of interest include enlisted, NCO, officer; service member,&#xD;
      spouse; service member, provider; self-assessed improvement, no self-assessed improvement;&#xD;
      Behavioral Health clinicians, Family Medicine physicians; and study sites&#xD;
