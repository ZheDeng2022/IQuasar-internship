  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystectomy with urinary diversion (ileal conduit, orthotopic ileal bladder substitute,&#xD;
      continent catheterizable pouch) is the best treatment option for patients with&#xD;
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This intervention is one of the most challenging in urology&#xD;
      and has a high rate of postoperative complications including around 30% of postoperative&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) is widely accepted as a crucial preventive measure&#xD;
      to reduce the incidence of surgical site infections (SSI). The rationale for PAP is the&#xD;
      reduction of the local bacterial load at the site and time of intervention, and therefore a&#xD;
      short duration of PAP of 24 to maximal 48 hours is recommended for all clean to&#xD;
      clean-contaminated procedures..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence supporting the optimal duration of PAP for radical cystectomy with urinary diversion&#xD;
      is lacking. Based on data extrapolated from abdominal surgery, current guidelines recommend&#xD;
      short-term PAP (â‰¤24h) for all clean-contaminated procedures including radical cystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a recent evaluation revealed a significant inter-hospital variability of PAP and&#xD;
      showed that extended use (&gt;48h) was common in patients undergoing radical cystectomy.&#xD;
      Importantly, this study also demonstrated that longer duration of PAP incurred higher costs&#xD;
      and was associated with an increased rate of C. difficile colitis. A small, prospective,&#xD;
      non-randomized study showed equal efficacy of short-term PAP in preventing postoperative&#xD;
      infections in patients undergoing radical cystectomy with ileum conduit compared to extended&#xD;
      PAP. Nonetheless, larger randomized clinical trials supporting these findings are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unwarranted extended use of antibiotics is a major concern as exposure to antibiotics is&#xD;
      a driving force for the development of (multi-) resistant bacteria and will lead to an&#xD;
      increasing number of difficult-to-treat infections. This has been recognized on both national&#xD;
      and international levels and is addressed within antimicrobial stewardship frameworks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare current practice (&gt;48h PAP, &quot;extended PAP&quot;) with the guideline&#xD;
      recommended approach (24h PAP, &quot;short term PAP&quot;) in a single-centre, prospective, randomised&#xD;
      clinical non-inferiority trial. The primary outcome is the rate of SSI within 90 days post&#xD;
      surgery. The aim of the study is to generate currently lacking evidence allowing for an&#xD;
      optimised PAP strategy in a challenging surgical setting.&#xD;
