    <description>TSR-022 is a monoclonal antibody against TIM-3 (also called HAVCR2), an immune checkpoint receptor. Immune checkpoint proteins are molecules that help to regulate the immune system so it does not mistakenly attack healthy cells. However, they can also keep immune cells from recognizing and killing cancer cells.&#xD;
TIM-3 is found on the surface of certain T-cells, including tumor-infiltrating T-cells, that have left the bloodstream and migrated into the tumor environment. By binding to and blocking TIM-3, TRS-022 allows for T-cells to become activated so as to enhance T-cell-mediated attacks on tumors. These attacks reduce their growth.</description>
