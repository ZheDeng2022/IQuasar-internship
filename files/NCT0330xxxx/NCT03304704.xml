      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the world's population is at risk of malaria. Malaria is a disease that affects many&#xD;
      people in Mali and other parts of Africa. It is caused by germs spread by mosquito bites.&#xD;
      Malaria may be mild. But it can also be serious or can lead to death if it is not diagnosed&#xD;
      and treated promptly. Researchers want to learn more about the disease so they can develop&#xD;
      new approaches to malaria control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect data on how mosquitoes spread malaria and how many people get malaria in the&#xD;
      community by comparing different areas, seasons, and years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents of a certain area of Mali who are of any age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have at least 1 visit. They will answer questions about their health&#xD;
      and malaria. They may have a physical exam. They will have blood collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have 1 visit every month for 3 years. They will repeat the procedures&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These participants will have mosquitoes collected in their home monthly. They may be able to&#xD;
      catch some of the mosquitoes alive or may need to use a spray to kill the mosquitoes.&#xD;
      Participants in this part of the study can be up to 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will also have about 60 mosquitoes directly feed on their arm or leg for&#xD;
      15-20 minutes each month. These participants must be 5-65 years old.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A vaccine that interrupts malaria transmission is critical to eradicate the disease, but&#xD;
      improved assays are needed to measure the efficacy of vaccines. Transmission-blocking&#xD;
      vaccines (TBVs) work by inducing antibodies in vaccinees that inhibit parasite development in&#xD;
      the mosquito interrupting transmission. Efficacy of vaccines may be estimated by in vitro&#xD;
      membrane feeding assays using immune sera and laboratory mosquitoes, but qualified assays&#xD;
      that measure transmission in the field are needed to assess transmission-blocking&#xD;
      interventions in natura. Clinical trials of TBV have started in Bancoumana and Doneguebougou,&#xD;
      and we expect to expand TBV studies here and in adjacent areas in the future. This protocol&#xD;
      will use a longitudinal cohort to gather information on mosquito feeding and infection&#xD;
      patterns in Bancoumana, Doneguebougou and surrounding villages in Mali. Individuals actively&#xD;
      participating in LMIV vaccine trials will be approached first for participation, including&#xD;
      permission to contact their household and neighbors of their compound for participation.&#xD;
      Households will be identified using census data and individuals will be consented for&#xD;
      participation. Malaria smears will be obtained at monthly visits, in conjunction with&#xD;
      mosquito collections in/around village residences and with direct skin feeds (DSFs) using&#xD;
      insectary-raised mosquitoes. Parasite transmission to mosquitoes will be assessed&#xD;
      longitudinally for differences by season and year, and compared between wild-caught and&#xD;
      laboratory-raised mosquitoes. Data will also be obtained on gametocyte and parasite carriage&#xD;
      rates by season and year. Genotyping of individual subjects will be performed to pair with&#xD;
      the bloodmeals of wild-caught mosquitoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 3,200 volunteers from Bancoumana, Doneguebougou and surrounding areas will be&#xD;
      enrolled into three distinct cohorts. The Genotype Only Cohort (n=1000), which will include&#xD;
      the vaccine trial participants, will complete a single visit to obtain a blood sample for&#xD;
      genotyping with no additional follow up. The DSF Cohort (n=1200) will enroll subjects aged 5&#xD;
      to 65 years for monthly blood sampling, DSF, and mosquito collection at their household. The&#xD;
      Parasite Surveillance Cohort (n=1000) will enroll subjects under the age of 5 years (as young&#xD;
      as 6 months) and subjects of any age who are unwilling to participate in DSF; they will have&#xD;
      monthly blood sampling and mosquito collection at their household. Enrollment into the&#xD;
      Genotype and Parasite Surveillance Cohorts will be linked to full enrollment of the DSF&#xD;
      Cohort. Participants in the Parasite Surveillance and DSF cohorts, will be followed for up to&#xD;
      3 years, to collect data that will guide the design of future community-based trials of TBV.&#xD;
