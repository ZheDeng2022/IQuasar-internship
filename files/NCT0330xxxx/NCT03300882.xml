  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to establish a personalized test to measure&#xD;
      individualized cytomegalovirus (CMV) specific immunity in lung transplant recipients in an&#xD;
      effort to guide antiviral prophylaxis duration in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted participants are those:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  enrolled in clinical research study CTOT-20 (Clinical Trials.gov ID: NCT02631720) who&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are CMV recipient positive by serology as determined using methods in accordance with&#xD;
           current local organ procurement organization policies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus. The virus is spread from one person to another&#xD;
      through infected body fluids. In those with a normal immune system, CMV does not cause much&#xD;
      of a problem. The immune system keeps the virus under control so most people do not have any&#xD;
      symptoms. Once infected, the virus usually stays dormant (inactive) in the body for a&#xD;
      person's entire life. This means some of the cells in the body are infected and the virus can&#xD;
      become active again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung transplant recipients take anti-rejection medicines to prevent the body from rejecting&#xD;
      the transplanted lung(s). Although anti-rejection medications help protect the transplanted&#xD;
      lung(s) from the body's immune system, these medications also decrease the body's ability to&#xD;
      fight infections. This reduces the immune system's ability to control viruses like CMV. Many&#xD;
      transplant recipients take an antiviral medication early after transplant to help the body&#xD;
      control the CMV virus. This is the time that risk of infection would be highest. Sometimes&#xD;
      recipients get an active CMV infection after stopping these medicines. If this happens, the&#xD;
      infection is treated and monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators are trying to determine whether a blood test can predict&#xD;
      development of active CMV infection in lung transplant recipients. Specifically, the clinical&#xD;
      research study will prospectively assess the performance of an immune signature based on the&#xD;
      &quot;ex vivo&quot; measurement of T cell CMV specific immunity in predicting freedom from future CMV&#xD;
      infections among recipient positive (R+) lung transplant participants receiving standard&#xD;
      durations of valganciclovir prophylaxis.&#xD;
