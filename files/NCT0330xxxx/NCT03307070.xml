  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first aim of this study is to develop a structured, cognitive behavioral treatment manual&#xD;
      for major depressive disorder (MDD) adapted for individuals with moderate to severe traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury (TBI) (CBTx-TBI), as well as evaluate its acceptability and tolerability in an&#xD;
      open 12-week pilot trial (N=10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim is to evaluate the acceptability and tolerability of, and adherence to,&#xD;
      CBTx-TBI in a randomized waitlist-controlled, 12-week pilot trial (N=40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third, exploratory aim is to evaluate the potential efficacy of CBTx-TBI for MDD in the&#xD;
      randomized pilot trial (N=40) and possible moderators and mediators of outcome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to develop a highly acceptable, manualized treatment&#xD;
      (CBTx-TBI) for MDD in patients with moderate to severe TBI. After developing the manual&#xD;
      (Phase 1), a nonrandomized trial (Phase 2) will be conducted to test its acceptability and&#xD;
      tolerability. Based on objective and qualitative feedback from participants and input from&#xD;
      mentors and consultants, the CBTx-TBI manual will be revised (Phase 3). The investigators&#xD;
      will then pilot test the efficacy of the intervention to reduce depressive symptoms (IDS-C)&#xD;
      after 12 weeks using the revised CBTx-TBI manual compared to a waitlist control group in a&#xD;
      randomized pilot trial (Phase 4). Once the randomized pilot study is complete, the CBTx-TBI&#xD;
      manual will be finalized with additional feedback from subjects, mentors, and therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both phases of recruitment, the same study procedures will be used (unless procedures are&#xD;
      modified in Phase 3). The proposed study involves the following points of contact: (1)&#xD;
      Obtaining informed consent and screening (may be broken up into multiple visits), (2)&#xD;
      biweekly clinician assessments of depressive and neuropsychiatric symptoms (weeks 2, 4, 6, 8,&#xD;
      10), (3) weekly self-report assessments of depressive symptoms for those receiving the&#xD;
      intervention, (4) 12 weekly individual CBTx-TBI sessions for those randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention, (5) a comprehensive assessment at week 12 (primary endpoint), which includes&#xD;
      the neuropsychological battery, and (6) a 3-month follow-up assessment for those who received&#xD;
      the intervention (randomized pilot only, phase 4). Assessment visits during the 12 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment may be completed by phone. The week 12 visit can be split into two parts, with the&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessment occurring during the second part, in order to accommodate&#xD;
      subjects' potential limitations due to fatigue.&#xD;
