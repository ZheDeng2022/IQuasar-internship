    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of shared-decision-making (SDM) to&#xD;
      manage chronic and breakthrough pain in patients with cancer. Providers will receive&#xD;
      evidence-based education on shared decision-making strategies and comprehensive pain&#xD;
      management at study start up. In addition, the information will be available on the Carevive&#xD;
      platform for reference at the point of care. This multisite study will enroll 105 patients&#xD;
      from three cancer institutions. This project will explore the SDM model using a&#xD;
      touchscreen-based expanded pain assessment (EPA) to evaluate the impact of the&#xD;
      shared-decision-making model on pain management, and explore its relationship to pain&#xD;
      management care planning. Patients will use the Carevive Systems software in the clinic to&#xD;
      answer questions regarding decision making preferences and complete a comprehensive&#xD;
      assessment of their pain status. Treatment recommendations and a care plan will be provided&#xD;
      to the patient at the time of the visit. At each clinic visit over 4 months, the patient will&#xD;
      again complete the pain assessment and receive appropriate treatment recommendations and a&#xD;
      revised care plan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cancer-related pain is a significant clinical challenge that impacts patient outcomes and&#xD;
      remains a significant problem for patients with cancer and their providers. The overall&#xD;
      prevalence of cancer pain is high; a recent meta-analysis of 52 studies reported cancer pain&#xD;
      prevalence ranging between 52%-77%. Another update reports rates of 39% after curative&#xD;
      treatment, 55% during treatment, and 66% in advanced, metastatic or terminal disease.&#xD;
      Moderate to severe pain was reported by 38% of all patients. Cancer pain may be cancer&#xD;
      related, due to tumor burden causing bone, nerve, and/or organ compression, and/or treatment&#xD;
      related, due to procedures, surgery, and side effects of chemotherapy or radiation. The&#xD;
      prevalence of pain after breast cancer treatment ranges from 13%-93%; women with metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer often have bone pain from metastases and bisphosphonates. In a nationwide lung&#xD;
      cancer study (N = 450), pain was reported by 92% of patients with advanced (stage IIIB/IV)&#xD;
      NSCLC. Similar reports indicate pain ranges from 74% to 92%. Uncontrolled pain is the most&#xD;
      common chief complaint of unplanned hospitalizations and readmissions. One study reported&#xD;
      over half of the chief complaints provided by breast cancer patients with an emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) visit were related to poorly controlled pain, respiratory or gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms. Finally, there is evidence that high symptom burden and poor management of symptoms&#xD;
      and side effects also leads to suboptimal adherence to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of cancer pain requires that the patient be screened for the presence of pain at&#xD;
      every clinical contact. A comprehensive assessment should be conducted if the patient is&#xD;
      experiencing pain, including specific questions about location, duration, severity, quality,&#xD;
      timing, duration, and impact on quality of life. A thorough understanding of pain also&#xD;
      considers the temporal characteristics of the pain experience, determining if the pain is&#xD;
      intermittent, that is bursts of severe pain without persistent chronic pain, persistent, with&#xD;
      moderate to severe pain present throughout the day, and/or breakthrough pain described as the&#xD;
      transient exacerbation of pain despite adequately controlled persistent pain. Breakthrough&#xD;
      pain is reported to occur daily in 21%-70% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of psychosocial and physical symptom distress in cancer is so compelling that&#xD;
      the Commission on Cancer, the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS), American Society of Clinical&#xD;
      Oncology (ASCO), and the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)'s Patient-Centered&#xD;
      Oncology Care Standards all require distress screening that includes pain screening and&#xD;
      assessment as a quality mandate in their accreditation and quality certification programs. In&#xD;
      addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMMS)'s Oncology Care Model (OCM)&#xD;
      requires a care management plan that includes symptom management. Included as quality&#xD;
      measures are NQF384, pain intensity quantified, and NQF 383, plan of care for pain. In&#xD;
      addition, value based care payment models seek to decrease emergency department (ED) visits&#xD;
      and hospitalization days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carevive recently completed a project designed to improve adherence to quality metrics in&#xD;
      breast cancer through education plus use of a tablet-based technology to screen for and&#xD;
      manage identified distress, pain, and other breast cancer quality indicators available within&#xD;
      ASCO's Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI) program. The Breast National Quality&#xD;
      Standards project used QOPI metrics to evaluate outcomes of a CME intervention and use of the&#xD;
      Carevive CPS. Preliminary data from this project showed improvement in key areas. Provider&#xD;
      adherence to quality metrics was measured in 151 non-metastatic BC patients, 77 of which&#xD;
      served as historical controls with no CME/clinical intervention, and 74 received the&#xD;
      intervention after their provider participated in certified continuing medical education&#xD;
      (CME) activities designed to educate about evidence-based assessment, decision-making, and&#xD;
      management strategies for BC patients. Preliminary analysis showed that the intervention&#xD;
      improved provider adherence to four pain quality measures: a. pain assessed by second office&#xD;
      visit, b) pain intensity quantified by second office visit, c) plan of care documented, and&#xD;
      d) pain assessed on either of the two most recent office visits. This project will build on&#xD;
      that work to incorporate a comprehensive assessment and a more multi-faceted intervention&#xD;
      that engages the care team in a SDM process around cancer pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with an imperative to formalize a pain management plan is the rising importance of&#xD;
      incorporating shared-decision-making, the cornerstone of patient centered care, into all care&#xD;
      decisions. When making treatment decisions, the provider must incorporate current literature,&#xD;
      patients' current clinical status, and patient preferences. One challenge with measuring&#xD;
      quality through electronic chart abstraction is the difficulty of identifying when patient&#xD;
      preference has influenced treatment decisions. Little data currently exist on the level of&#xD;
      patient engagement in decision-making for pain management and the perception of patients with&#xD;
      MBC, LC, or AC of shared-decision-making in developing a pain management care plan. Dr.&#xD;
      Jeannine Brant and colleagues have developed the Pain Care Quality Survey (PainCQ©). The&#xD;
      PainCQs are two tools that measure the quality of nursing and interdisciplinary care related&#xD;
      to pain management as perceived by hospitalized individuals. These tools will be modified in&#xD;
      this project to capture the variable contributions of different members in the care team,&#xD;
      including oncology nursing staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies to better manage chronic and breakthrough cancer pain are critical. Many cancer&#xD;
      centers have incorporated distress screening using either the National Comprehensive Cancer&#xD;
      Network (NCCN) Distress Thermometer or the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) tools.&#xD;
      However, structured processes are typically lacking within the clinical workflow to&#xD;
      seamlessly integrate and conduct a more in-depth assessment of those patients who score&#xD;
      positively for pain. Processes and technologies that facilitate better integration of pain&#xD;
      assessment and pain management care strategies into the oncology team's clinical workflow,&#xD;
      while simultaneously integrating algorithms for treatment of pain have the potential to&#xD;
      further drive evidence-based care.&#xD;
