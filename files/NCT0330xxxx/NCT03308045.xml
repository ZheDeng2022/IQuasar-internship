      Primary objective: safety and tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: additional indicators of long term safety and indicators of clinical&#xD;
      activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives: to characterize EYS606 biodistribution, immunogenicity and biomarkers&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The maximum study duration per patient is 51 Weeks (including an up to 3 week screening&#xD;
      period + 48 weeks follow-up after treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation phase which will investigate&#xD;
      three pEYS606 doses levels (lower, intermediate and higher dose) over 3 cohorts. Part 1 of&#xD;
      the study has been completed. Part 2, the extension phase, which is now ongoing will confirm&#xD;
      to safety of the maximum tolerated higher dose from Part 1 and allow a preliminary assessment&#xD;
      of efficacy.&#xD;
