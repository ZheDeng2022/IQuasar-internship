        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject who is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Health condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with optimal&#xD;
             participation in the study or place the volunteer at increased risk of adverse events&#xD;
             (AEs). Study clinicians, in consultation with the principal investigator, will use&#xD;
             clinical judgment on a case-by-case basis to assess safety risks under this criterion.&#xD;
             The PI will consult with the medical monitor as appropriate. • Clinically significant&#xD;
             abnormalities on physical examination.&#xD;
