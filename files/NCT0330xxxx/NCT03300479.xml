  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is responsible for 10-15% of primary strokes. ICH is a dynamic&#xD;
      process with three phases: initial hemorrhage, followed by hematoma expansion and&#xD;
      perihematoma edema formation. Hematoma volume is correlated with disease progression and&#xD;
      outcome. Contemporary evidence proposes that elevated blood pressure is associated with&#xD;
      hematoma expansion while more than 90% of patients with ICH present with acute hypertension.&#xD;
      Uncontrolled blood pressure is a leading cause of ICH and it seems also to be a factor of&#xD;
      poorer outcomes. Therefore, rapid reduction and control of blood pressure might ease disease&#xD;
      progression and improve the outcome. Clevidipine (Cleviprex®), an ultrashort-acting&#xD;
      dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist, with its rapid onset and short duration might be&#xD;
      more effective than conventional antihypertensives to achieve rapid blood pressure control in&#xD;
      patients with acute ICH.&#xD;

      After admission to the ICU the patients presenting with primary intracerebral hemorrhage&#xD;
      (ICH) are evaluated for enrollment. If systolic blood pressure (SBP) is higher than 160 mmHg&#xD;
      or SBP &lt;160 mmHg under intravenous antihypertensive drug (e.g. Urapidil), started less than 3&#xD;
      h before randomization, the patient will be randomized in one of the two study groups and&#xD;
      intravenous therapy with Clevidipine (Cleviprex®) or Urapidil (Ebrantil®) will start&#xD;
      immediately. Data of systemic haemodynamics will be collected continuously by online&#xD;
      monitoring, starting at baseline and ending after 24h (study data measurements). In&#xD;
      particular, all blood pressure measurements are extracted via an arterial line, which is&#xD;
      placed as standard of care in these patients. If the target values are not attained within 30&#xD;
      minutes, the investigators can add or switch to alternative antihypertensive drugs of their&#xD;
      choice. 24h after initiation of Clevidipine (Cleviprex®) or Urapidil (Ebrantil®), all&#xD;
      patients receive Nicardipine (Cardene®) (standard care in daily clinical routine) for another&#xD;
      24h followed by orally administered antihypertensive medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intracerebral hematoma volume will be determined by readings of noncontrast brain computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scans using the ABC/2 rule to calculate the volume. As a standard in these&#xD;
      patients a CT scan is performed 6 hours after admission to the ICU.&#xD;
