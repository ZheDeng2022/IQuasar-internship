  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treating and caring for people with long term conditions accounts for a substantial&#xD;
      proportion of health care resources. Self-management is advocated as a mechanism that can&#xD;
      empower service users with long term conditions to choose healthier options and also&#xD;
      transform the relationship between service user and caregivers from one in which the former&#xD;
      is a passive recipient of care to one in which they are an active partner in decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is one such long term condition. Patients with ILD often&#xD;
      express concern about the lack of information on possible rehabilitation programmes and other&#xD;
      services that could potentially improve self-management of the disease. In addition, there is&#xD;
      a general perception about a lack of co-ordination between health care professionals&#xD;
      especially in relation to referral to services for comprehensive management of the disease.&#xD;
      Therefore, the needs of patients with ILD and their carers, and possible gaps in service&#xD;
      provision need to be explored further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators propose to explore the needs of ILD patients from all types&#xD;
      of ILD and all stages of severity and to also involve carers and clinicians. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct three focus groups for patients and carers and six one-to-one&#xD;
      interviews with clinicians to explore perceptions about service gaps and needs in two ILD&#xD;
      centres in South and North London, UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide valuable information to develop the building blocks of a&#xD;
      self-management resource and will enable the investigators to make it specific to the&#xD;
      different types of ILD.&#xD;
