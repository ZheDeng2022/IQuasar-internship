    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of mogamulizumab in combination&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with diffuse large B&#xD;
      cell lymphoma that have come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or does not&#xD;
      respond to treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      mogamulizumab and pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) when administered in combination with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed, refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. (Phase I) II. To assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) when administered in combination with&#xD;
      MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in patients with relapsed, refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
      (Phase I) III. To assess the progression-free survival of KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) when&#xD;
      administered in combination with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) compared to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab)&#xD;
      alone in patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase I) II. To assess the overall response&#xD;
      rate, complete response rate, partial response rate, duration of response of KW-0761&#xD;
      (mogamulizumab) and MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) compared to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) alone in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether the progression-free survival of KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) and MK-3475&#xD;
      (pembrolizumab) when administered to patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large&#xD;
      B-cell lymphomas differs based on the presence or absence of mutations in B2M or CD58 or&#xD;
      amplifications in PD-L1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether the progression-free survival of KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) and MK-3475&#xD;
      (pembrolizumab) when administered to patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large&#xD;
      B-cell lymphomas differs based on changes in CD8 T-cell, natural killer (NK) cell, and FoxP3+&#xD;
      regulatory T cell (Treg) prevalence in response to therapy as measured by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) and MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) alters the&#xD;
      prevalence of peripheral blood CCR4+/FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells as well as effector CD4 and&#xD;
      CD8 T-cells by multi-parametric flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of mogamulizumab followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      mogamulizumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1, then day 1 of subsequent&#xD;
      courses. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21&#xD;
      days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's&#xD;

             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) is an&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab), breastfeeding should be&#xD;
