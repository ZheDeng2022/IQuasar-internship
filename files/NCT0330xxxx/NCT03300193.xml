    <textblock>
      The study will investigate Essential Tremor and Parkinson's Disease patients who underwent&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (MRgFUS). We will evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      lesion characteristics on tremor and on quality of life after the procedure as compared with&#xD;
      the baseline prior to the procedure.&#xD;

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of lesion characteristics in ExAblate&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (MRgFUS) of the Vim&#xD;
      thalamic nucleus. Clinical measures will be used to study patients suffering from&#xD;
      medication-refractory tremor, Essential Tremor or idiopathic Parkinson's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a prospective, observational, and clinical study. Assessments will&#xD;
      be made before and after MRgFUS for; clinical tremor relief, quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      improvements, assessment of adverse events, and correlations of these measures with the size&#xD;
      and shape of the lesion and the surrounding edema .&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Men and women, between 18 and 80 years.&#xD;

          -  Patients who underwent the MRgFUS procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are able and willing to give consent and able to attend all study visits&#xD;
             and Radiologic follow-up examination by MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of ET or Idiopathic PD as confirmed from clinical history and examination&#xD;
             preformed by a movement disorders neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ET patients: tremor severity score of greater than or equal to 2 in the treated&#xD;
             hand/arm as measured by postural or action item on the Clinical Rating Scale for&#xD;
             Tremor (CRST).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PD patients: tremor severity score of equal or greater than 3 on either item 20 or&#xD;
             item 21 of motor part in the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Substantial disability in the performance of at least two daily activities from the&#xD;
