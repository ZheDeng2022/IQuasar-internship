      Rationale: 30-70% of comatose patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after&#xD;
      cardiac arrest never regain consciousness as a result of post anoxic encephalopathy (PAE).&#xD;
      Early identification of patients without potential for recovery of brain functioning may&#xD;
      prevent inappropriate continuation of medical treatment and improve communication between&#xD;
      doctors and patients. However, current diagnostic and prognostic measures can identify only&#xD;
      20-50% of the patients with irreversible brain damage, precluding cerebral recovery and&#xD;
      awakening. Also, the pathophysiology of brain damage is largely unclear. New magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) sequences hold potential to substantially improve outcome prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: 1. To estimate the additional value of early MRI monitoring for the prediction of&#xD;
      neurological outcome of comatose patients after cardiac arrest. 2. To gain insight in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of PAE by associating MRI findings with histopathological studies of brain&#xD;
      tissue obtained from non-survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: prospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 100 subsequent comatose patients after cardiac arrest, admitted to the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: In addition to standard treatments, patients will undergo MRI of the brain at&#xD;
      day 3, 7, and three months after cardiac arrest. A subgroup of patients will be scanned&#xD;
      within 24 hours after cardiac arrest, to assess feasibility and to gain more insight in the&#xD;
      evolution of brain damage in PAE. Survivors will be followed for one year. Outcome&#xD;
      measurements will focus on disabilities, quality of life, and depression. MRI measures will&#xD;
      be related to outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measure is neurological outcome, defined&#xD;
      as the score on the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) at six months, dichotomized as good&#xD;
      (CPC 1-2 = no or moderate neurological disability) or poor (CPC 3-5 = severe disability,&#xD;
      coma, or death). Secondary outcome measures include cognitive functioning, depression, and&#xD;
      quality of life at one year, as well as histopathological damage of brain tissue of&#xD;
      non-survivors.&#xD;

      Standard procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored and treated according to guidelines for post out of hospital&#xD;
      cardiac arrest treatment as described in local ICU protocols. Patients do not suffer any&#xD;
      harm, disadvantage of discomfort while participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment includes targeted temperature management, hemodynamic monitoring and&#xD;
      stabilisation, continuous EEG monitoring, blood sampling through the jugular bulb catheter,&#xD;
      Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), and transcranial doppler (TCD) measurements. The patient's&#xD;
      status is repeatedly assessed and treatment is based on the clinical findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MRI A total of 3 MRI scans is planned for each patient: at day 3 ± 1, and day 7 ± 2&#xD;
           after cardiac arrest, and 3 months ± 2 weeks after cardiac arrest. The imaging protocol&#xD;
           will consist of structural MRI (including FLAIR and ADC maps) to detect ischemic damage,&#xD;
           a 3D T1 for structural analysis and SWI sequences to detect micro bleeds), structural&#xD;
           connectivity measurement by DTI, and functional connectivity measurement by resting&#xD;
           state BOLD functional MRI. Estimated time to prepare the patient and transport to and&#xD;
           from the MRI scanner will be approximately 30 minutes, the scan itself will take&#xD;
           approximately 30 minutes, as well. No intravenous contrast agent is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Acute phase MRI To estimate the feasibility of MRI scanning in the acute phase and&#xD;
           to gain more insight in the dynamics of PAE, a subgroup of patients will be scanned&#xD;
           within 24 hours after cardiac arrest. Patients will be included in this subgroup&#xD;
           dependent on availability of the MRI facility, the clinical stability of the patients&#xD;
           and after the patients legal representatives signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Transport to the radiology department&#xD;
&#xD;
           The transport to and from the radiology department will be performed as described in the&#xD;
           local protocols on patient transportation. Transport to and from other departments is a&#xD;
           frequent procedure in ICU patients. During transport, the patient will be accompanied by&#xD;
           a physician and ICU nurse. The MRI scans for this project will be handled as 'elective',&#xD;
           which indicates that only patients with a stable hemodynamic and respiratory status will&#xD;
           be transported to and undergo the MRI. For this, a patient has to meet all the following&#xD;
           criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Hemodynamic stable condition, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  mean arterial pressure &gt; 60 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  no or low inotropes or vasopressors (dosage norepinephrine &lt; 0,3 ug/kg/min and/or&#xD;
                dobutamine &lt; 10 ug/kg/min or equivalent), dosage adjustments less than 0.1&#xD;
                ug/kg/min in the last hour before MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Stable cardiac rhythm, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  sinus rhythm 50 - 120 beats per minute&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  atrial fibrillation or flutter with ventricle response 60 - 120 per minute&#xD;
&#xD;
           C. Pulmonary stable condition, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arterial oxygen saturation &gt; 95%&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  maximum fraction inspired oxygen &lt; 60% with maximum level of positive end&#xD;
                expiratory pressure of 10 cm H2O&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  peak inspiratory pressure &lt; 30 cmH2O or &lt;5 l/min oxygen trough nasal cannula (for&#xD;
                patients not on mechanical ventilation)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mechanical ventilation during transport and scanning will be provided by an MRI&#xD;
           compatible ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Extensive monitoring of vital functions will not be interrupted during transport or MRI&#xD;
           scanning, by using a mobile trolley with MRI compatible monitoring and ventilation&#xD;
           equipment. At all times, a physician and trained ICU nurse will accompany the patient.&#xD;
           The medical team accompanying the patient can change treatment during transport and&#xD;
           scanning to pursue optimal hemodynamics, pulmonary state, and/or comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Clinical evaluation of MRI scans All structural MRI scans will be assessed by a&#xD;
           radiologist and results are added to a patient's medical file. Patients and their&#xD;
           families will be informed. However, MRI findings will not be taken into account for&#xD;
           decisions on withdrawal of treatment. BOLD fMRI and DTI data will be analysed later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Outcome At 3 and 6 months, CPC score will be assessed by a telephone interview by a&#xD;
           trained investigator. Additionally, at twelve months, for assessment of cognitive&#xD;
           outcome, depression, quality of life, and care giver strain, the patient will be invited&#xD;
           to the hospital or visited at his / her place of residence. If a patient dies during the&#xD;
           follow-up, the cause of death will be requested from the general practitioner or medical&#xD;
           specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post mortem analysis From all patients that die in the hospital after PAE, permission to&#xD;
           perform autopsy is sought for. Permission will be asked from the legal representative in&#xD;
           the context of current care, after the patient has died. According to current care,&#xD;
           brains will be removed and samples fixated within 24 hours at the local pathology&#xD;
           departments. On samples from 8 brain areas (sensory- and motor cortex, thalamus, basal&#xD;
           ganglia, upper brain stem) evaluation of the agonal state is performed on&#xD;
           hematoxylin-eosin staining. Additionally, predefined sections, including all cortical&#xD;
           layers and white matter, will be formalin fixed for further analyses.&#xD;
