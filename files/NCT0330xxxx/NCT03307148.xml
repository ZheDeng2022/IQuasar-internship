  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (PDAC) is the fourth highest cancer killer worldwide and is responsible for&#xD;
      6% of cancer deaths. Around 80% of patients are diagnosed at a late stage when cancer has&#xD;
      spread and surgical removal is no longer possible. At present there are no treatments&#xD;
      available which will shrink the tumour to enable surgical removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A main factor in the lack of treatment options for patients is that pancreatic cancer is&#xD;
      surrounded by a thick scar tissue called the stroma, which forms a barrier to prevent&#xD;
      chemotherapy from entering and shrinking the tumour. Research carried out in laboratories has&#xD;
      shown that a derivative of Vitamin A, All Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA), may have the ability to&#xD;
      break down this stroma allowing chemotherapy to reach the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAR_PAC will test the combination of ATRA with two chemotherapy drugs; Gemcitabine and&#xD;
      Nab-Paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. There are&#xD;
      two parts to the study; the first will test different doses of the drugs on around 24&#xD;
      patients to find the highest dose patients can take without too many side effects. The second&#xD;
      part will test this dose on around 10 patients to find the dose that will produce the desired&#xD;
      effect with limited side effects. Patients will take ATRA for up to 6 cycles and chemotherapy&#xD;
      until their cancer worsens and will be followed up for 12 months. The study will also explore&#xD;
      the ability of a type of scan, DW-MRI, to detect changes in the cancer (optional for&#xD;
      patients). Patients can also opt to donate additional tumour samples (biopsies) and normal&#xD;
      cell samples (cheek cells and hair samples).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be recruited through NHS Clinics and should have histologically&#xD;
      confirmed locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer according to RECIST criteria and&#xD;
      must have received no prior treatment for this cancer.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Locally advanced or metastatic disease which is measurable according to the Response&#xD;
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Received no prior systemic therapy for metastatic or locally advanced disease. Prior&#xD;
             adjuvant chemotherapy (with Gemcitabine or any other drug/s) is allowed if completed&#xD;
             at least 6 months previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate hematologic and end organ function, defined by the following laboratory&#xD;
             results obtained within 14 days prior to the first study treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute Neutrophil Count ≤ 1.5 x 109/l (without granulocyte colony-stimulating&#xD;
                  factor support within 2 weeks prior to the first study treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelet count ≤ 100 x 109/l (without transfusion within 2 weeks prior to the&#xD;
                  first study treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Haemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dl (transfusion permitted to establish target haemoglobin&#xD;
                  levels prior to the first study treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Calculated creatinine clearance (e.g. Cockcroft-Gault) ≤ 50 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 ULN (patients with known Gilbert disease who have bilirubin&#xD;
                  levels ≤ 3 x ULN may be enrolled). Patients must be able to undergo biliary&#xD;
                  stenting if required before or, if required, during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. AST or ALT &lt;2.5 x ULN or &lt;5 x ULN in the presence of liver metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &lt;2.5 x ULN or &lt;5 x ULN in the presence of liver and/or&#xD;
                  bone metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. INR and aPTT ≤1.5 x ULN; this applies only to patients who are not receiving&#xD;
                  therapeutic anticoagulation; patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation&#xD;
                  should be on a stable dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female patients of child-bearing potential are eligible, provided they have a negative&#xD;
             serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment, preferably as close to the first dose as possible. All patients with&#xD;
             reproductive potential must agree to use a medically acceptable method of&#xD;
             contraception throughout the treatment period and for 1 month after discontinuation of&#xD;
             ATRA and / or Gemcitabine/nab-Paclitaxel (whichever is the latest) and for 6 months&#xD;
             after discontinuation for male patients. Acceptable methods of contraception include&#xD;
             IUD, oral contraceptive, sub-dermal implant and double barrier (condom with a&#xD;
             contraceptive sponge or contraceptive pessary). Micro-dosed progesterone preparations&#xD;
             (&quot;mini-pill&quot;) are an inadequate method of contraception during treatment with ATRA. If&#xD;
             patients are taking this pill they should be instructed to stop and another form of&#xD;
             contraceptive should be prescribed instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Able to follow protocol requirements as assessed by the Principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
