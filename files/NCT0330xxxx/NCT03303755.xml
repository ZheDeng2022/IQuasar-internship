  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most frequent disability in children. The vast majority of these&#xD;
      patients are malnourished. In this population, there are practical difficulties to perform a&#xD;
      nutritional and growth assessment which makes it difficult to treat and follow up, because of&#xD;
      the lack of reference growth in Argentina, and the difficulty in taking anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements of weight and height because of their motor compromise, posture and muscle tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to design and validate predictive models for the nutritional and growth&#xD;
      assessment of children and adolescents with CP and instruments for estimating weight and&#xD;
      height from body segments, in order to improve care, quality of life of these patients to&#xD;
      promote their social inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and method: It will be an observational, descriptive and cross-sectional study.&#xD;
      There will be two parts of the study, in the first part the population will be healthy&#xD;
      children from 2 to 18 years old from Cordoba, Argentina. The sample size was calculated based&#xD;
      on growth WHO standards data, for α=0.05 and 1-β=0.80, creating an stratified sampling&#xD;
      divided in 16 age groups for each age. This first part will help to establish which body&#xD;
      segments to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part, the population will be children and adolescents from 2 to 18 years old&#xD;
      with diagnosis of CP from Córdoba, Argentina. A stratified sequential sampling shall be&#xD;
      performed. The sample size will be 192 patients, 12 per age stratum. The variables studied&#xD;
      will be: weight, height, body segments, sex, age, CP type, feeding path and type of feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of the data the normal continuous variables will be described in means with&#xD;
      their respective standard deviations and those of non-normal distribution in medians with&#xD;
      their ranges. For the development of the predictive equations using body segments measures, a&#xD;
      generalizable linear regression model will be used. The correlation coefficient r,&#xD;
      determination R2 and test of F will be calculated with p &lt;0.05. To generate predictive growth&#xD;
      models, the percentiles from 3 to 97 will be calculated, using the LMS method and a q-q&#xD;
      graph.&#xD;

      The aim is to design predictive models of weight and height, through predictive equations&#xD;
      using segmental measurements and to develop specific growth patterns, for the nutritional and&#xD;
      growth evaluation of children and adolescents with cerebral palsy from different provinces of&#xD;
      Argentina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is a cross-sectional study, which consisted of two stages. First, data were&#xD;
      collected from children and adolescents aged 2 to 18 years with typical development from&#xD;
      which the anthropometric variables associated with weight and height were determined and then&#xD;
      used for the analysis of the population with CP. A stratified sampling was made with 17&#xD;
      strata according to age for each sex, pre-establishing a minimum of 20 children for each&#xD;
      stratum. Data were collected transversely in two hospitals and two schools in the City of&#xD;
      Córdoba until all strata were completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second stage, data is collected from children and adolescents diagnosed with CP between&#xD;
      the ages of 2 and 19 years. Data were included from 17 rehabilitation centers and therapeutic&#xD;
      educational centers in 5 provinces of the country (Córdoba, Buenos Aires (CABA), Jujuy,&#xD;
      Santiago del Estero and Catamarca). A sequential non-probabilistic sampling was made,&#xD;
      including all possible cases of each participating institution. The variables studied were&#xD;
      demographic variables, anthropometric measures, nutritional status, type of malnutrition and&#xD;
      in the case of the population with PC also variables such as data on access to health,&#xD;
      diagnosis, co-morbidities and feeding were included. Normal continuous variables were&#xD;
      described as mean and standard deviations, while those of non-normal distribution in medians&#xD;
      with their interquartile ranges. Variables are compared by means of t-test or Mann-Whitney as&#xD;
      appropriate. Categorical data are expressed in percentages with a 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      [95% CI]. To analyze association between variables, Chi square of Mantel-Haentzel was&#xD;
      calculated, and OR with its 95% CI. For the development of predictive equations, a&#xD;
      generalizable linear regression model will be used. The correlation coefficient r,&#xD;
      determination R2 and F test were calculated with a p &lt;0.05. Growth patterns were made using&#xD;
      the Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) method. Nutritional&#xD;
      status was assessed using the WHO Anthro Plus V1.0.4 program using the WHO standards (2007).&#xD;
      The approval of the local ethics committee was obtained and written informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained from the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of nutrition in patients with PC is an emerging field, for which this work plan&#xD;
      seeks to develop methodologies that promote social inclusion by making substantial and&#xD;
      necessary contributions to improve the treatment of this pathology.&#xD;
