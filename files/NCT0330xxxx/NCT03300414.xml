  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of the study is to identify viral factors and host immune responses that&#xD;
      differentiate HBV-related HCC patients from HBV patients who have not progressed to HCC. To&#xD;
      that end, the investigators will compare gene expression levels between HCC patients and&#xD;
      non-HCC patients categorized into high and low risk profiles. The investigators will perform&#xD;
      ANOVA to compare three groups (HCC, high risk, low risk). Multiple comparison corrections&#xD;
      will be performed using Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) with a 90%&#xD;
      confidence that the discovery lists will contain no more than 5% false positives (FDR&lt;0.05)&#xD;
      (PMID: 12584122, 11682119). A p-value &lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant using&#xD;
      this multiple comparison correction approach. Post-hoc Student-Newman-Keuls or Tukey tests&#xD;
      will be used following ANOVA for comparisons of HCC patients with high risk and low risk. If&#xD;
      data are not normally distributed when log-transformed, then Kruskall-Wallis tests will be&#xD;
      used. ANCOVA will be used to adjust for the effects of covariates, such as age, gender, and&#xD;
      HBV genotype (B or C). Further, the investigators often use an additional 2-fold change&#xD;
      criterion for significance because the investigators consider a fold change of this magnitude&#xD;
      to be biologically significant. Hierarchical clustering analyses and principal component&#xD;
      analyses will be used to visualize how well the genes separate the groups, or to discover new&#xD;
      subgroups. For the analysis of SNVs, the exact binomial test will be performed and p-values&#xD;
      will be adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg correction.&#xD;

      2) Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide&#xD;
      (Jemel et al CA Cancer J Clin 2011). Asian and Pacific Islander (API) Americans are&#xD;
      perennially the most affected racial group with regard to HCC incidence and HCC-related&#xD;
      mortality due to the high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). While APIs carry the&#xD;
      greatest burden of CHB-related HCC, differences in outcome exist amongst the different Asian&#xD;
      ethnic groups. The investigators have previously analyzed ethnically disaggregated data from&#xD;
      6,068 Californians of Asian ancestry with HCC diagnosed between 1998 and 2007 (Ryerson et al&#xD;
      Cancer 2016). Cause-specific mortality was significantly higher among Laotian/Hmong (hazard&#xD;
      ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.78-2.44) and Cambodian patients (hazard ratio 1.26; 95% CI,&#xD;
      1.06-1.51). Notably, Laotian/Hmong patients presented at an early age and with more advanced&#xD;
      stages of HCC suggesting that these differences were not related to delays in diagnosis or&#xD;
      presentation, but rather biologic differences in the behavior of the HCC. In fact, both viral&#xD;
      factors and host immune responses have been associated with the prognosis of CHB-related HCC.&#xD;
      Currently, the investigators are investigating these potential mechanisms in Hmong/Laotian,&#xD;
      Chinese, and Vietnamese individuals infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). In contrast to&#xD;
      evaluating mechanisms associated with poor outcomes once HCC has developed, the current&#xD;
      proposal will build upon the data the investigators have collected with the goal to identify&#xD;
      markers of HCC development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central hypothesis is that prior to the development of HBV-related HCC, there are specific&#xD;
      biologic responses reflected in the gene expression profile of whole blood that can&#xD;
      differentiate CHB patients with and without HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test this hypothesis the investigators will perform the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 (Aim #1): Associate viral sequences and host gene expression signatures with&#xD;
      established HCC risk factors in Asian Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to meet this aim, blood samples will be obtained from 10 consented subjects. The DNA&#xD;
      extracted from these samples will be used as part of an ongoing study comparing viral&#xD;
      sequences and gene expression profiles across Asian ethnic groups, the investigators will&#xD;
      analyze the same data comparing individuals with high and low HCC risk factors (i.e. the&#xD;
      presence and absence of cirrhosis, high HBV viral load, men who have sex with men).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (Aim #2): Investigate HBV-related HCC tissue for HCC-associated viral sequences and&#xD;
      human proteins. HCC tissue sections on slides with no personal health information will be&#xD;
      obtained from UC Davis Cancer Center Biorepository (CCB) and other biobanks including, but&#xD;
      not limited to, Cooperative Human Tissue Network. From previously banked HCC tissue, the&#xD;
      investigators will 1) extract and sequence HBV DNA from tumor tissue and compare it to our&#xD;
      collection of non-HCC HBV sequences and 2) stain the tissues for proteins corresponding to&#xD;
      genes identified in whole blood gene expression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to an analysis of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database,&#xD;
      API had the highest age-adjusted HCC incidence rates from 2006-2010 at 4.7 per 100,000&#xD;
      followed by Hispanics (3.2), Blacks (2.5), and whites (1.4). The highest age-specific HCC&#xD;
      incidence rate found was 54.7 per 100,000 in API greater than 65 years of age. In this&#xD;
      analysis, HCC-related mortality among API was the highest compared to other racial groups&#xD;
      (2.8 per 100,000 compared to 0.9 per 100,000 for whites) (Altekruse et al. AJG 2014). This&#xD;
      increased risk for HCC and its complications among API has been attributed to chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis B (CHB) (El Sarag et al. Gastroenterology 2012). For persons with CHB, there is a&#xD;
      strong association between increasing hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels and increasing&#xD;
      incidence of HCC and cirrhosis (Chen et al. JAMA 2006). The most common routes of HBV&#xD;
      transmission are vertical from infected mothers to infants and horizontal in early childhood&#xD;
      among those living in areas of high HBV endemicity (Nguyen et al. J Cancer Educ 2007) Despite&#xD;
      the availability of a preventative vaccine, global vaccine coverage is only 75% and does not&#xD;
      address the disease burden in the estimated 350 million people infected with HBV worldwide&#xD;
      (Meireles et al. World J Hepatol 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viral factors include viral load, genotype, and specific mutations. Notably, genotype B is&#xD;
      associated with the early onset of HCC and poor prognosis (Yin et al. Carcinogenesis 2008)&#xD;
      Viral mutants including the A1762T/G1764A basal core promoter mutations and Pre-S region&#xD;
      deletions are also associated with poor HCC outcomes and may be the result of selection by&#xD;
      host immune responses and activation of endogenous cytidine deaminase by pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines (e.g. TNF-alpha) induced by NFkappa-B leading to G-to-A hypermutation (Chen et al.&#xD;
      Eur J Cancer 2012). Other immune response pathways have been associated with outcomes from&#xD;
      HBV-related HCC including the presence of natural killer cells, CD8+ T cells, regulatory T&#xD;
      cells as well as IL-2 and IL-15 levels in the tumor microenvironment (Bowlus CL, Tumor&#xD;
      Immunology 2007)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applicability of NGS to sequencing of HBV:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NGS will allow the investigation of viral factors at multiple levels, including the frequency&#xD;
      of genotypes and mutations, viral diversity, and mutation rates as a possible indication of&#xD;
      cytidine deaminase activity. In addition, this technology will be used to explore the immune&#xD;
      responses based upon transcript profiling. Further, analysis can also be done on T cell&#xD;
      receptor usage and HLA alleles, which have been associated with HBV-related outcomes as well&#xD;
      as association analysis of SNV within transcription profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the R21, the investigators are utilizing NGS on blood samples from treatment na√Øve&#xD;
      Chinese, Vietnamese, and Laotian/Hmong patients to identify viral sequences and expression&#xD;
      profiles from whole blood that may segregate with Laotian/Hmong origins and thus be&#xD;
      candidates that explain the poor HCC outcomes in this population. In addition, this data can&#xD;
      be used to identify viral sequences and expression patterns which associate with known&#xD;
      HCC-risk factors and may then be developed as potential biomarkers for the HCC surveillance&#xD;
      among HBV infected people. The first step in this biomarker development process will need&#xD;
      testing in a cohort of patients with HBV-related HCC and is the thrust of this protocol .&#xD;
      Enrollment for this study has been completed (n = 99) and blood samples are currently being&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted a pilot study using NGS for transcriptome profiling of whole&#xD;
      blood samples to demonstrate the power of blood genomics for identifying molecular profiles&#xD;
      associated with specific disease states and providing ultra-sensitive detection of molecular&#xD;
      pathways associated with HBV pathogenesis (Caruccio et al. Methods Mol Bol 2011). RNA&#xD;
      sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on total RNA isolated from whole blood samples obtained&#xD;
      from a cohort of 10 Asian American individuals, composed of 3 healthy individuals (2 Chinese,&#xD;
      1 Filipino), 6 HBsAg-positive subjects without HCC (5 Chinese, 1 Vietnamese), and 1&#xD;
      HBsAg-positive Laotian subject with HCC. The HCC patient possessed a distinctive expression&#xD;
      signature defined by 634 differentially expressed genes. Meta-analysis of the 173-gene&#xD;
      overexpression cluster with immune cell transcriptome data (Li et al. Bioinformatics 2009)&#xD;
      revealed that this &quot;HBV-related HCC signature&quot; contained prominent neutrophil- and&#xD;
      macrophage-driven components, as well as up-regulated expression of regulatory T cell&#xD;
      (TReg)-related genes, which is associated with worse prognosis for HCC (Tepper et al ICG&#xD;
      Americas 2012 International Conference). Gene ontology analysis indicated over-represented&#xD;
      processes consistent with HCC pathogenesis, including inflammation. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      validate this &quot;HBV-related HCC signature&quot; in a larger cohort of patients with HBV-related&#xD;
      HCC.&#xD;
