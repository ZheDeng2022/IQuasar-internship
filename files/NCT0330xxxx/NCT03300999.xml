      -  Day 1: Subjects will sign informed consent and will go over the introduction, purpose,&#xD;
           procedures, and compliance with student investigators. Subjects will then be given a&#xD;
           sample of ginger tea that will be used for the study and will be asked if they think&#xD;
           they can drink this daily for a month. They will also be asked if they have regular&#xD;
           menstrual cycles and agree to stop home remedies and stop taking pain medications or&#xD;
           herbal supplements for a period of three menstruation cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start/During the first menstruation cycle: Subjects will meet with student investigators&#xD;
           at a convenient location to the subject and will complete surveys and questionnaires.&#xD;
           Subjects will be given visual analog pain scales and symptom checklists that need to be&#xD;
           completed during their second menstruation cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of the first menstruation cycle - Start of the second menstruation cycle: Subjects&#xD;
           will not take ginger tea, avoid home remedies, and refrain from taking pain medications&#xD;
           or supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start of the second menstruation cycle - End of the second menstruation cycle: Subjects&#xD;
           will rate discomfort using the visual analog pain scales and symptom checklist during&#xD;
           menstruation. Subjects will meet with student investigators at a convenient location to&#xD;
           the subject and will complete surveys and questionnaires. Subjects will be given daily&#xD;
           logs, visual analog pain scales, symptom checklists, and supplies for the ginger tea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of the second menstruation cycle - Start of the third menstruation cycle: Subjects&#xD;
           will take ginger tea daily, avoid home remedies, refrain from taking pain medications&#xD;
           and supplements, and keep track of ginger tea intake by placing a check mark each day in&#xD;
           the daily log checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start of the third menstruation cycle - End of the third menstruation cycle: Subjects&#xD;
           will rate discomfort using the visual analog pains scales and symptom checklist during&#xD;
           menstruation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the third menstruation cycle ends: Subjects will meet with student investigators&#xD;
           at a location convenient to the subject to turn in daily logs, visual analog pain&#xD;
           scales, and symptom checklists.&#xD;

    <description>• The Visual Analogue scale is a form of a Likert scale that gives the interviewee maximum freedom to estimate their pain intensity. The interviewee will mark a line along the 10-cm scale which they perceive corresponds best to their exact pain intensity every day for the duration of the study. A score of zero indicated no pain and a score of 10 indicated the most severe pain felt.</description>

    <measure>SF-36 Quality of Life Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>On any day between Day 1 and Day 28 of the first menstruation cycle. Cycle is 28 days.</time_frame>
    <description>RAND developed this validated survey and it is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. These measures rely upon patient self-reporting and are now widely utilized by managed care organizations and by Medicare for routine monitoring and assessment of care outcomes in adult patients. This survey consists of eight scaled scores which are the weighted sums of the questions in each section. The sections include vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, physical role functioning, general health perception, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Each scale is transformed into a 0-100 scale and the lower score indicates more disability while the higher represents less disability. It can take participants at least half an hour to complete and will be assessed over a one-month period.</description>
