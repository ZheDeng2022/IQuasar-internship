  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Rest tremor in Parkinson's disease is notoriously difficult to treat through&#xD;
      pharmacological measures, currently only predictably attenuated by the invasive deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation surgery. The investigators hope to find some predictable and clinically&#xD;
      meaningful attenuation of tremor with targeted use of onabotulinum toxin on muscles involved&#xD;
      in creating the tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 16 subjects who meet United Kingdom (UK) brain bank criteria for Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease with medically refractory rest tremor of at least 3 cm amplitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Subjects will be blinded to receive either sham saline injection versus&#xD;
      onabotulinum toxin injections directed to muscle groups felt to be clinically involved in&#xD;
      causing the oscillatory movement of the tremor. Assessment of tremor severity and functional&#xD;
      improvement from baseline after injection will occur within group (i.e. each subject will&#xD;
      serve as their own control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. (A) Onabotulinumtoxin A significantly attenuates the amplitude of medically-refractory&#xD;
      rest tremor of the upper limb in Parkinson's patients as compared to sham injections; as&#xD;
      measured by reduction in the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating&#xD;
      Scale (MDS-UPDRS) tremor subscore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. (B) Onabotulinumtoxin A significantly improves the limb function of Parkinson's patients&#xD;
      with medically-refractory rest tremor of the upper limb as compared to sham injections; as&#xD;
      measured by an increase in Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) scores.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For purposes of properly identifying muscles intended for injection, a portable&#xD;
      electromyography will be attached to an appropriate gauge electromyography-guided botulinum&#xD;
      toxin needle, which in turn will be used to hear/see motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to activate the muscle while needle is inserted to ensure proper placement of&#xD;
      the needle in the desired muscle prior to injection of study solution.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the MDS-UPDRS Tremor Subscore</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to onabotulinumtoxinA injection and at 30 days after injection</time_frame>
    <description>The Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a clinimetric assessment of subjective and objective symptoms and signs of Parkinson's disease created by the Movement Disorder Society. MDS-UPDRS retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales. The subscale used in this study is Part III's tremor subscore (3.17). The subscale has a 0-4 rating, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. Higher MDS-UPDRS scores reflect worse tremor/motor function. Larger differences will infer greater effect size for the intervention. Score drops over time imply improvement in tremor/motor function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the ARAT Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to onabotulinumtoxinA injection and at 30 days after injection</time_frame>
    <description>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is an evaluated measure to assess specific changes in limb function after neurologic sequelae. It assesses a person's ability to handle objects differing in size, weight and shape and therefore can be considered to be an arm-specific measure of activity limitation. The ARAT is a 19 item measure divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement). Performance on each item is rated on a 4-point ordinal scale: 3: Performs test normally 2: Completes test, but takes abnormally long or has great difficulty 1: Performs test partially 0: Can perform no part of test. The maximum score on the ARAT is 57 points (possible range 0 to 57). Higher ARAT scores reflect greater preservation of function in tested arm. Larger differences will infer greater effect sizes for the intervention. Score drops over time imply worsening limb function.</description>

    <measure>Correlation Between MDS-UPDRS Tremor Subscore and Px1 Tremor Amplitude</measure>
    <time_frame>At Visit 1, prior to 1st injection through Visit 4, 30 days after last injection</time_frame>
    <description>MDS-UPDRS retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales. The subscale used is Part III's tremor subscore 3.17. The subscale has a 0-4 rating: (0=no tremor, 1=&lt;1cm, 2=1-3 cm, 3=3-10 cm, 4=&gt;10cm). Higher scores reflect worse tremor amplitude. Larger differences infer greater effect size. The Px1 is a novel, external measuring device using motion-capture technology to determine the frequency, direction and amplitude of movement between hand joints. Movement is captured without ever applying direct pressure on the limb. Output includes tremor frequency in Hz and distance traveled by a hand joint as compared to other joints on the hand in cm. The largest tremor amplitude measured by Px1 was acquired 3x/visit, values averaged then compared with the amplitude range corresponding to MDS-UPDRS tremor subscore. This process was repeated for all subjects for Visits 1-4 comparing all values using Spearman correlation coefficient.</description>

        <title>Change in the MDS-UPDRS Tremor Subscore</title>
        <description>The Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a clinimetric assessment of subjective and objective symptoms and signs of Parkinson's disease created by the Movement Disorder Society. MDS-UPDRS retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales. The subscale used in this study is Part III's tremor subscore (3.17). The subscale has a 0-4 rating, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. Higher MDS-UPDRS scores reflect worse tremor/motor function. Larger differences will infer greater effect size for the intervention. Score drops over time imply improvement in tremor/motor function.</description>

        <title>Change in the ARAT Score</title>
        <description>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is an evaluated measure to assess specific changes in limb function after neurologic sequelae. It assesses a person's ability to handle objects differing in size, weight and shape and therefore can be considered to be an arm-specific measure of activity limitation. The ARAT is a 19 item measure divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement). Performance on each item is rated on a 4-point ordinal scale: 3: Performs test normally 2: Completes test, but takes abnormally long or has great difficulty 1: Performs test partially 0: Can perform no part of test. The maximum score on the ARAT is 57 points (possible range 0 to 57). Higher ARAT scores reflect greater preservation of function in tested arm. Larger differences will infer greater effect sizes for the intervention. Score drops over time imply worsening limb function.</description>

        <title>Correlation Between MDS-UPDRS Tremor Subscore and Px1 Tremor Amplitude</title>
        <description>MDS-UPDRS retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales. The subscale used is Part III's tremor subscore 3.17. The subscale has a 0-4 rating: (0=no tremor, 1=&lt;1cm, 2=1-3 cm, 3=3-10 cm, 4=&gt;10cm). Higher scores reflect worse tremor amplitude. Larger differences infer greater effect size. The Px1 is a novel, external measuring device using motion-capture technology to determine the frequency, direction and amplitude of movement between hand joints. Movement is captured without ever applying direct pressure on the limb. Output includes tremor frequency in Hz and distance traveled by a hand joint as compared to other joints on the hand in cm. The largest tremor amplitude measured by Px1 was acquired 3x/visit, values averaged then compared with the amplitude range corresponding to MDS-UPDRS tremor subscore. This process was repeated for all subjects for Visits 1-4 comparing all values using Spearman correlation coefficient.</description>

        <description>The Px1 is a novel, external measuring device which uses motion-capture technology to determine the frequency, direction, and amplitude of movement between joints within the hand. Oscillatory movement is captured using a camera system and without ever applying any direct pressure upon the limb. Output includes tremor frequency in (Hertz Hz), and distance traveled by a hand joint as compared to other joints on the hand in centimeters (cm)</description>

        <population>Given that the Px1 tool was simultaneously undergoing validation during the trial, using the tool to determine the differences in tremor amplitude was deemed inappropriate.</population>
