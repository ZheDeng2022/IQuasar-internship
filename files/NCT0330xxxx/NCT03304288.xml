  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, open-label, multicentre study to assess the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      combination of low-dose rituximab and ATRA in patients with steroid-resistant/relapsed ITP.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a severe bleeding disorder. Approximately 2/3 of patients&#xD;
      achieve remission from first-line therapies. However, the underlying mechanism of&#xD;
      steroid-resistant or relapsed ITP is not well understood; thus, treatment remains a great&#xD;
      challenge. Rituximab has been shown to partly improve the complete remission rate of ITP.&#xD;
      All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has an immunomodulatory effect on haematopoiesis, making it a&#xD;
      possible treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicentre prospective study was performed in non-splenectomized ITP patients who were&#xD;
      either resistant to a standard dose of corticosteroids or had relapsed. Patients were&#xD;
      randomized to the low-dose rituximab+ATRA and the low-dose rituximab monotherapy groups.&#xD;
      Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment.&#xD;
      Interim analysis was scheduled at 50% through recruitment. Adverse events are also recorded&#xD;
      throughout the study, in order to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of&#xD;
      low-dose rituximab and ATRA in patients with steroid-resistant/relapsed ITP.&#xD;
