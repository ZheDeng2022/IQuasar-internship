  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 participants will be recruited, with 20 participants in each of the following&#xD;
      subcategories:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) High grade lymphoma (DLBCL, FL grade 3b, transformed FL) (n=20) B) Low grade lymphoma&#xD;
      (e.g. FL grade 1, 2 or 3a, MZL, MCL) (n=20)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose for having two experimental treatment arms is to provide a comparator for&#xD;
      the translational endpoints, i.e. to assess whether the differences observed are due to the&#xD;
      addition of varlilumab to rituximab. The only difference between Arm A and Arm B is the delay&#xD;
      in administration of varlilumab in cycle 1, which is on Day 2 in Arm A and Day 8 in Arm B. As&#xD;
      the post-treatment tissue collection occurs on Day 7/8, prior to administration of varlilumab&#xD;
      in Arm B, samples will be obtained from participants that have either been treated with&#xD;
      rituximab alone, or both rituximab and varlilumab. To minimise any potential risks to the&#xD;
      patient as a result of a repeat biopsy on Day 7/8, a prerequisite for entry to the trial is&#xD;
      that the participants must have accessible sites for biopsy. Difference in response rates&#xD;
      between Arm A and Arm B are not expected.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A multicentre, randomised, phase IIa study in participants with relapsed or refractory CD20+&#xD;
      B-cell malignancies. The study will be conducted in 2 stages as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 - Safety During the safety phase, 6 participants (3 from each Arm and from any&#xD;
      subtype) will be treated as detailed in section 6.1. The number of dose limiting toxicities&#xD;
      (DLTs) experienced by these participants in each arm after having completed the first cycle&#xD;
      will dictate whether the trial will proceed to the second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In each arm, if out of these 3 participants 0 experience a DLT, then that arm will&#xD;
           proceed to stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In each arm, if out of these 3 participants 1 or 2 experience a DLT, then that arm will&#xD;
           be expanded to 3 more participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If 1 or 2 out of 6 participants experience a dose limiting toxicity, the arm will&#xD;
                proceed to Stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If 3 or more out of 6 participants experience a DLT, recruitment for that arm will&#xD;
                be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If out of these 3 participants, 3 experience a dose limiting toxicity, recruitment for&#xD;
           that arm will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, the first patient will be entered into the trial. Providing there are no serious&#xD;
      or unexplained safety issues during the first 2 weeks, as determined by the Safety Review&#xD;
      Committee (SRC), then dosing of subsequent participants will continue as they are identified.&#xD;
      Should toxicity findings of concern occur, the SRC may choose to stagger the start of dosing&#xD;
      for subsequent participants and/or cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of Stage 2 is to obtain some further information on the safety of the&#xD;
      intervention in a larger sample, information on activity (response rate overall and per&#xD;
      lymphoma subtype) and feasibility of administrating rituximab and varlilumab together. During&#xD;
      Stage 2, recruitment will continue so (including those in Stage 1), there is a total of 10&#xD;
      participants per arm and per disease category (a total of 20 participants per disease&#xD;
      category, 40 participants in the trial in total).&#xD;

    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Varlilumab</intervention_name>
    <description>Rituximab is a so-called direct-targeting mAb, which binds to the CD20 molecule on the surface of normal and malignant B cells. The mAb then engages immune effectors cells, such as macrophages, through Fc:Fc gamma receptor interaction, leading to tumour cell killing by antibody directed cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis (ADCC/ADCP).&#xD;
Varlilumab (1F5, CDX-1127) is a recombinant and fully human IgG1kappa mAb that binds to human CD27 with high affinity (62). As far as we are aware, it is the only anti-CD27 mAb in clinical development. Once bound, varlilumab blocks CD70 binding to CD27.</description>
