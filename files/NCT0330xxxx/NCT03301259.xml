      The aim of this study is to evaluate the post treatment pain after instrumentation of root&#xD;
      canals with a single file reciprocating (Wave-One Ni Ti file, DENTSPLY Maillefer) or&#xD;
      rotary(One Shape, Micro Mega, France) file system in patient with asymptomatic necrotic&#xD;

      post-obtuation pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      if the success rate (no pain) for wave one subjects is 0.3, we will need to study 17 patients&#xD;
      in each group to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the failure rates for&#xD;
      experimental and control subjects are equal with probability (power) 0.8. the type 1 error&#xD;
      probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis. This no is to be increased to&#xD;
      total no 42 to compensate for losses during follow up , the sample size was calcukated by the&#xD;
      PS program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are recruited for the clinical trial from the clinic of endodontics at the Faculty&#xD;
      of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University to meet the target sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A random sequence will be generated by computer software, (http://www.random.org/) in the&#xD;
      Center of Evidence Based Dentistry, Cairo University. This table will be kept with a&#xD;
      co-investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operator finds an eligible participant, then to assign the Participant to either group&#xD;
      according to the generated random sequence.&#xD;

      The operator finds an eligible participant, then to assign the Participant to either group&#xD;
      according to the generated random sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will generate the random sequence, assign the participants to the intervention or control&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operators will enroll the participants after they find the eligible ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatients of the clinic of endodontics at the Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo&#xD;
      University, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dental Unit is Adec 200 U.S.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The x-ray Machine is ViVi, S.r.I, Italy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The x-ray films are Kodac, speed D, size 2 or Digital (RVG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The operator is a master degree student in the department of Endodontics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic examination using periapical radiographic film which shows normal periapical&#xD;
      tissues with normal lamina dura and width of the periodontal membrane space and absence of&#xD;
      periapical lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of pre-operative pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to record the level of pain on a VAS. The patient will be trained&#xD;
      that 0 is no pain, 10 is the worst pain, and he will be asked to estimate the pain from 0 to&#xD;
      10 which then will be scored as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 No pain. From 1-3 mild pain. From 4-5 moderate pain. From 7-10 severe pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard procedure for both groups in single visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard access cavity will be prepared. Isolation will be performed using rubber dam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      K file 10 or 15 will be used to check the patency of the canal. ENDOFLARE will be used for&#xD;
      enlarging the coronal third of the canal in cases which will be treated with One Shape&#xD;
      Lubricant gel will be used as a lubricant and 2.5% NaOCl as irrigant. Determination of the&#xD;
      working length of canal will be done by electronic apex locator and confirmed by periapical&#xD;
      radiograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group Root canal preparation will be done with theWaveOne System with strict&#xD;
      adherence to the manufacturer's instructions. After coronal preflaring with File ISO 21 taper&#xD;
      8% instrument with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite as the irrigant, working length was determined&#xD;
      and a glide path will created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Red file R 25 taper 8% will be used for preparing the mesial canal; and the Black ISO 40&#xD;
      taper 8% file will be used for preparing the distal canals where there is only a single&#xD;
      canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: canals will be prepared by OneShape (MICRO-MEGA) rotary nickel-titanium file&#xD;
      at 400 rpm. The preparation will be stopped by One Shape N°25 - .06 in mesial canals and&#xD;
      distal roots with 2 canals; while in case of a single distal canal, the preparation will be&#xD;
      stopped by One Shape apical N°30 - .06 rotary files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obturation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After instrumentation and final irrigation, canals will be dried with paper points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teeth will be obturated during the initial appointment using epoxy resin sealer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be asked to take a placebo if they experience pain after the&#xD;
      procedures. If the patient experience moderate pain he is allowed to take 50mg diclofenac&#xD;
      potassium (cataflam 50mg). Any of the patients with intolerable pain will be requested to&#xD;
      visit the clinician for emergency treatment. The patients will be asked to record the no. of&#xD;
      pills taken and the time at which it was taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of post-operative pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative pain is defined as any degree of pain that occurs after initiation of root&#xD;
      canal treatment, while flare up is defined as the development or continuation of pain and/or&#xD;
      swelling after endodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The will be asked to record the level of pain at 6 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 7days after&#xD;
      obturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be trained that 0 is no pain, 10 is the worst pain that interfere with his&#xD;
      daily routine, and he will be asked to estimate the pain as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 No pain. From 1-3 mild pain. From 4-5 moderate pain. From 7-10 severe pain&#xD;

    <description>The reciprocating single file systems WaveOne (Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) provide more flexibility of the M-wire Ni-Ti alloy, greater resistance to cyclic fatigue and better handling of narrow and curved canals than the traditional Ni-Ti instruments Root canal preparation will be done with theWaveOne System with strict adherence to the manufacturer's instructions. After coronal preflaring with File ISO 21 taper 8% instrument with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite as the irrigant, working length was determined and a glide path will created.&#xD;
The Red file R 25 taper 8% will be used for preparing the mesial canal; and the Black ISO 40 taper 8% file will be used for preparing the distal canals where there is only a single canal.</description>
