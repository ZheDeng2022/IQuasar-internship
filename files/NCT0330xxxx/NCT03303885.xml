  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liposarcomas are the most common type of soft tissue sarcomas (STS). Among liposarcomas,&#xD;
      well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS)/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) are the most&#xD;
      frequent types. WDLPS are composed mostly of mature fat whereas DDLPS contain both a WDLPS&#xD;
      component and a non-lipomatous sarcoma component mostly of high grade. More than 50% of DDLPS&#xD;
      will relapse locally. A significant proportion of patients will remain with a non-resectable&#xD;
      disease that will metastasize in 20% of cases. Standard chemotherapy is poorly efficient and&#xD;
      alternative options are so far limited. Identification of new therapeutic targets is urgent&#xD;
      and mandatory. the recent preliminary results as well as data from the literature led us to&#xD;
      hypothesize that the FGF (Fibroblast Growth factor)/FGFR pathway is involved in&#xD;
      liposarcomagenesis and might therefore be a novel relevant therapeutic target in WDLPS/DDLPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the project The project associates 4 teams with a longstanding collaboration :&#xD;
      3 teams fom Nice (Nice University Hospital/IRCAN, Nice University Hospital, Comprehensive&#xD;
      Cancer Center Centre Antoine Lacassagne and one team from Bordeaux (Comprehensive Cancer&#xD;
      Center Institut Bergonié). These 4 teams are experts in the clinics, pathology and molecular&#xD;
      genetics of sarcomas as well as in biostatistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Expression studies on the role of the syndecan-1 (SDC1)/FGFR pathway in WDLPS/DDLPS&#xD;
           tumorigenesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           The recent studies provide original results that may have a direct application in&#xD;
           treatments of liposarcomas. They suggest that SDC1 -an effector of the FGF/FGFR pathway-&#xD;
           might be involved in DDLPS tumorigenesis. Staff will analyse:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The pattern of expression and localisation of syndecans, FGFs and FGFRs in&#xD;
                WDLPS/DDLPS both in a large collection of 249 primary tumors and in our in-house&#xD;
                panel of high quality and validated human WDLPS/DDLPS cell lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The prognostic value of SDC1, FGF2 and FGF18 expression by correlation to the&#xD;
                patient clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fonctional studies of the role of the SDC1/FGFR pathway in WDLPS/DDLPS tumorigenesis. We&#xD;
           will analyse:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The effects of modulating SDC1, FGFR expression in WDLPS and DDLPS cells on cell&#xD;
                proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and on their capacity to differentiate in&#xD;
                adipocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The sensitivity of WDLPS and DDLPS cells to the FGFR inhibitor JNJ-427556493 as a&#xD;
                single agent or in combination with other antagonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to JNJ-427556493 by phosphoproteomic&#xD;
                analysis of WDLPS and DDLPS cells before and after JNJ-427556493 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The involvement of SDC1 in the dedifferentiation process of liposarcoma. Expected&#xD;
                results staff expect to demonstrate the relevance of the SDC1/FGFR pathway in&#xD;
                liposarcomas. We also expect to link drug activity to genomics and proteomics data.&#xD;
                This will allow the characterization of the activity of FGFR inhibitors and the&#xD;
                identification of powerful preclinical biomarkers of drug activity and mechanisms&#xD;
                of resistance in DDLPS. The availability of xenograft models will allow us to&#xD;
                validate our in vitro findings in the in vivo setting with the ultimate goal to&#xD;
                improve patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The availability of an early clinical trial unit in Institut Bergonié, managed by A.&#xD;
      Italiano, will give the immediate opportunity to transfer our data to the management of&#xD;
      metastatic liposarcoma patients.&#xD;
