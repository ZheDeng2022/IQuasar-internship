    <textblock>
      This study has two portions. The main goal of the Phase Ib portion of this research study is&#xD;
      to see at what time Yttrium-90 (Y-90) radioembolization therapy and nivolumab can safely be&#xD;
      given to patients without having too many side effects. Other purposes of this research study&#xD;
      will be to study any tumor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase II portion of the study will test how many patients show shrinkage in their tumor&#xD;
      with this combination of medicines and what changes occur inside the cancer cells and blood&#xD;
      cells after treatment. The study team will pick the part of the study each subject&#xD;
      participates in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Y-90 radioembolization therapy is minimally invasive procedure that combines two types of&#xD;
      therapy (embolization which blocks certain blood vessels, and radiation therapy, which kills&#xD;
      cancer cells) to treat cancer tumors in the liver. This works with tiny glass or resin beads&#xD;
      filled with the radioactive isotope yttrium-90 (Y-90). They are placed inside the blood&#xD;
      vessels that feed the tumor in the liver. This blocks the supply of blood to the cancer cells&#xD;
      and delivers a high dose of radiation to the tumor while sparing normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is an FDA approved medicine that is used for the treatment of different types of&#xD;
      cancers and metastases (second growths from cancer).&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib: To determine the safety and tolerability of Y-90 radioembolization therapy when&#xD;
      given in conjunction with neoadjuvant/adjuvant nivolumab as assessed by CTCAE version 4, in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who undergo Y-90 radioembolization to hepatic&#xD;
      metastases and have additional disease located outside of the radioembolization field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: To determine the objective response rate (RR) as assessed by RECIST criteria of&#xD;
      metastases located outside of the Y-90 radioembolization treatment field in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer who undergo Y-90 radioembolization to hepatic metastases and&#xD;
      receive neoadjuvant/adjuvant nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the response rate (RR) of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who undergo&#xD;
      standard Y-90 radioembolization therapy to hepatic metastases as well as neoadjuvant/adjuvant&#xD;
      nivolumab as assessed by measurement of foci located outside of the Y-90 radioembolization&#xD;
      field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the progression free survival (PFS) of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer&#xD;
      who undergo standard Y-90 radioembolization therapy to hepatic metastases as well as&#xD;
      neoadjuvant/adjuvant nivolumab as assessed by measurement of metastatic foci located outside&#xD;
      of the Y-90 radioembolization field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the 1-year and 2-year overall survival (OS) rate of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer who undergo standard Y-90 radioembolization therapy to hepatic metastases&#xD;
      as well as neoadjuvant/adjuvant nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize the baseline expression and localization of immune markers including&#xD;
      Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), Programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1),&#xD;
      Programmed cell death protein ligand 2 (PD-L2), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain&#xD;
      containing-3 (TIM-3), Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3), Tumor necrosis factor receptor&#xD;
      superfamily, member 4 (OX40) and Cluster of Differentiation 137 (CD137) within the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment and correlate this with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the change in density of Cluster of Differentiation (CD8)+/Kiel-67 (Ki-67) high&#xD;
      tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and expression levels of PD-L1 in the tumor parenchyma prior&#xD;
      to and following treatment with Y-90 and nivolumab as assessed in a lesion outside of the&#xD;
      radioembolization field. Changes in biomarkers will be correlated with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess baseline and changes in the immune signature of Y-90 na√Øve colorectal cancer in&#xD;
      patients with liver metastases who receive Y-90 radioembolization and nivolumab therapy.&#xD;
      Human transcriptome gene expression arrays will be performed and expression data will be used&#xD;
      to identify immune cell subsets using CIBERSORT and immune signatures will be assessed using&#xD;
      ImmuneSigDB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess baseline and changes in non-targeted tumor antigens using Proto Array Human Protein&#xD;
      MicroArray Profiling and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) quantification in patients with liver&#xD;
      metastases who receive Y-90 radioembolization and nivolumab therapy. Changes in profile will&#xD;
      be correlated with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single arm phase Ib/II trial assessing the safety and toxicity (phase Ib) followed&#xD;
      by the antitumor activity (response rate) (phase II) of nivolumab when administered in&#xD;
      combination with Y-90 radioembolization therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will undergo Y-90 radioembolization to one side of the liver according to&#xD;
      standard practice as directed by an interventional radiologist. Yttrium-90 will be given as&#xD;
      biocompatible resin-based microspheres and will be introduced to the tumor(s) on one side of&#xD;
      the liver through a catheter placed in the right or left hepatic artery (depending on the&#xD;
      lobe treated). The dose of radiation will be determined by a radiologist and will be based on&#xD;
      body surface area and tumor burden. During the phase Ib portion of the study, nivolumab will&#xD;
      be administered per the scheduling algorithm at a flat dose of 240 mg intravenously over 30&#xD;
      +/- 5 minutes. Depending on the schedule being assessed, this may include a neoadjuvant dose&#xD;
      to be given prior to Y-90, and will contain an adjuvant dose following Y-90 therapy. During&#xD;
      the phase II portion of the study, nivolumab will be administered as determined during the&#xD;
      phase Ib portion of the study. Nivolumab will continue to be administered on an every 2 week&#xD;
      basis for a total of 48 weeks or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      discontinuation due to patient/physician preference. Patients will be evaluated with a&#xD;
      history and physical exam as well as laboratory parameters once every 2 weeks throughout the&#xD;
      duration of the study. Patients will undergo CT scans of the chest and pelvis as well as MRI&#xD;
      of the liver to assess disease status 2 months following the Y-90 radioembolization&#xD;
      procedure, then every 3 months for a total of 2 years. Upon completing treatment, patients&#xD;
      will be followed monthly for another 100 days for toxicity monitoring. Archived tissue&#xD;
      specimens will be obtained at baseline and a post-treatment biopsy of a metastatic lesion&#xD;
      located outside of the Y-90 radioembolization field will be obtained 60 +/- 5 days following&#xD;
      treatment with Y-90 radioembolization for assessment of intratumoral immunogenicity.&#xD;
      Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels will be assessed at baseline, then once monthly for 6&#xD;
      months, then every 3 months for a total of 2 years. Patients will have a pre-treatment serum&#xD;
      sample collected as well as post-treatment samples collected approximately 6 weeks, 12 weeks&#xD;
      and 20 weeks after treatment with Y-90 radioembolization for banking, to be used in the&#xD;
      future assessment of putative biomarkers.&#xD;

             blood flow determined by Technetium microaggregated albumin (MAA) scan (if conducted&#xD;
             prior to study enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had a standard of care pre-assessment angiogram that demonstrates&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases will be&#xD;
             excluded. Patients with brain metastases are eligible if metastases have been treated&#xD;
             and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for at least&#xD;
             4 weeks after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             nivolumab administration. There must also be no requirement for immunosuppressive&#xD;

             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding will be excluded from the study due to the&#xD;
             potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects that may result from nivolumab or Y-90&#xD;
             Theraspheres. Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with nivolumab and Y-90,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with nivolumab and Y-90.&#xD;
             These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with nivolumab. In addition, these&#xD;
             subjects are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             immunosuppressive agents. Screening HIV testing is not required.&#xD;
