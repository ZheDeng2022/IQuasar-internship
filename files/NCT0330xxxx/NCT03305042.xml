  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimal human data exist on actual liver vitamin A compared with blood biomarkers. One blood&#xD;
      biomarker, the percent of total serum retinol (vitamin A) in the form of retinyl esters, has&#xD;
      been suggested to diagnose hypervitaminosis A with cutoffs of 5% and 10%. In this study,&#xD;
      investigators aim to compare total liver vitamin A reserves with the percent total serum&#xD;
      retinol as retinyl esters to evaluate hypervitaminosis A using autopsy samples from US&#xD;
      adults. Investigators also evaluate the sensitivity (the ability of the biomarker to&#xD;
      correctly identify those with deficiency) and specificity (the ability of the biomarker to&#xD;
      correctly identify those without deficiency) of serum retinol to determine vitamin A&#xD;
      deficiency, variation of liver vitamin A concentration among lobes, and liver alpha retinyl&#xD;
      ester concentrations, a cleavage product of alpha-carotene, a vitamin A precursor. To conduct&#xD;
      the study, matched serum and liver samples were procured from 27 US adult cadavers (from&#xD;
      donors age 49-101 years) and their vitamin A biomarkers were analyzed.&#xD;

      Minimal human data exist on actual liver vitamin A compared with blood biomarkers. One blood&#xD;
      biomarker, the percent of total serum retinol (vitamin A) in the form of retinyl esters, has&#xD;
      been suggested to diagnose hypervitaminosis A with cutoffs of 5% and 10%. In this study,&#xD;
      investigators aim to compare total liver vitamin A reserves with the percent total serum&#xD;
      retinol as retinyl esters to evaluate hypervitaminosis A using autopsy samples from US&#xD;

      deficiency, variation of liver vitamin A concentration among lobes, and liver alpha retinyl&#xD;
      ester concentrations, a cleavage product of alpha-carotene, a vitamin A precursor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct the study, matched serum and liver samples were procured from 27 US adult cadavers&#xD;
      (from donors age 49-101 years) and their vitamin A biomarkers were analyzed. Matched human&#xD;
      liver and serum samples were collected from 27 cadavers, 13 male and 14 female, and acquired&#xD;
      as a consecutive sample through a request to the National Disease Research Interchange&#xD;
      service. De-identified clinical history summaries were also obtained. The donor criteria were&#xD;
      as follows: no restrictions on race or sex, no history of chemotherapy and/or radiation, no&#xD;
      history of prolonged endotracheal intubation or ventilation, no evidence of sepsis or&#xD;
      infectious disease (negative serology panel), and age ranges of 21-54 y, 55-74 y, and &gt;75 y&#xD;
      (target collection was 5 male and 5 female donors per age range to provide a non-homogenous&#xD;
      sample). After 10 individuals were acquired in each age range (i.e., 55-74 y and &gt;75 y),&#xD;
      samples were no longer requested. All tissues and sera were procured within 16 h post-mortem&#xD;
      from September 2013 through August 2016. The procurement protocol numbers were DWEN1 002 022,&#xD;
      002 023, and 002 024 for frozen liver, embedded liver, and serum, respectively. Serum samples&#xD;
      were isolated via gel separation and then frozen; primary liver samples were snap frozen in&#xD;
      liquid N2; a second liver sample from each donor was embedded in optimal cutting temperature&#xD;
      compound (OCT) and snap frozen in a cryomold. Two livers were procured almost whole and&#xD;
      evaluated for VA distribution within and among lobes. Samples were shipped on dry ice to&#xD;
      Madison, WI, and stored in a -80°C freezer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT-embedded liver samples were prepared as 5-µm frozen sections using a cryostat and stained&#xD;
      using routine hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome protocols and reagents (Newcomer&#xD;
      Supply, Middleton, WI). Images were captured using a Nikon E-600 bright field microscope&#xD;
      (Melville, NY) and Olympus DP-71 digital microscopy camera (Center Valley, PA). Liver samples&#xD;
      (1 g) for VA and carotenoid analyses were weighed and then ground with sodium sulfate (4-5 g)&#xD;
      in a mortar and pestle using published methods with minor modifications. Purified C-23&#xD;
      beta-apo-carotenol was added to determine extraction efficiencies. Samples were extracted&#xD;
      repeatedly with dichloromethane and filtered through WhatmanTM #1 (GE Healthcare Life&#xD;
      Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) into 50-mL volumetric flasks. An aliquot (5 mL) was dried under&#xD;
      nitrogen, re-dissolved in 300 µL methanol:dichloroethane (75:25, volume:volume) and an&#xD;
      aliquot of 1 µL was injected into a Waters Acquity H-Class ultra-pressure liquid&#xD;
      chromatograph (UPLC®) system equipped with a photodiode array detector (Milford, MA).&#xD;
      Aliquots were further saponified for quantification of total alpha-retinol as described below&#xD;
      for the lobe analyses. For the liver lobe sample evaluations, 1 g samples were extracted in&#xD;
      triplicate from each available lobe. A 5-mL aliquot of the extract was saponified with 400 mL&#xD;
      potassium hydroxide:water (50:50, weight:volume) at 45°C for 1 h. The reaction was quenched&#xD;
      with 0.5 mL water and extracted three times with 0.5 mL hexanes. The hexane layers were&#xD;
      pooled and dried under nitrogen, redissolved in 150 µL methanol:dichloroethane (75:25,&#xD;
      volume:volume), and an aliquot of 1 µL was injected into the UPLC® system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum samples (0.5 mL) were aliquoted into test tubes for retinol and RE determination; 1.25&#xD;
      X volume of ethanol was added to denature proteins. The internal standard was&#xD;
      C23-β-apo-carotenol. Samples were extracted three times with 0.75 mL hexanes; the supernatant&#xD;
      fractions were pooled and dried under nitrogen and reconstituted in 100 µL methanol:&#xD;
      dichloroethane (75:25, volume:volume). Two µL was injected into the UPLC® under the&#xD;
      conditions described below. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP)&#xD;
      were analyzed to evaluate inflammation using ELISA kits (CRP: Cayman Chemical Company; AGP:&#xD;
      Abcam). Lycopene and alpha- and beta-carotene concentrations were determined by routine HPLC&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultra-high Performance Liquid Chromatograph (UPLC) method A Waters Acquity UPLC HSS C18 1.8&#xD;
      µm VanGuard pre-column was used in conjunction with a Waters Acquity UPLC® HSS C18 column&#xD;
      (1.8 µm, 2.1 x 150 mm). The method utilized two solvent mixes programmed for a 29-min&#xD;
      gradient. Solvent A was acetonitrile-water-isopropanol (70:25:5, volume:volume:volume) with&#xD;
      10 mmol/L ammonium acetate and solvent B was methanol-isopropanol (75:25, volume:volume). The&#xD;
      column temperature was set to 32°C and flow rate was 0.4 mL/min. The gradient began by&#xD;
      holding 100% solvent A for 7 min, followed by a 4-min linear transition to 5% A, and another&#xD;
      transition to 1% A over 12 min. The solvent gradient was then reversed to 100% A in 2 min and&#xD;
      equilibrated for 4 min. Chromatograms were generated at 311 nm for α-retinol and α-REs, 325&#xD;
      nm for retinol and REs, and 450 nm for carotenoids. alpha-REs, derived almost exclusively&#xD;
      from beta-carotene in the diet, were quantified as a proxy for long-term vegetable exposure.&#xD;
      The concentrations were calculated using standard curves derived from authentic HPLC-purified&#xD;
      standards of α-retinol and retinol.&#xD;
