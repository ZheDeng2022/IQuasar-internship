      This investigator driven Phase Ib study will examine the safety, efficacy and biological&#xD;
      effects of two schedules of pembrolizumab, an antibody targeted against anti-programmed cell&#xD;
      death 1 (PD-1), which will be given either before or after stereotactic ablative body&#xD;
      radiotherapy (SABR) for metastatic NSCLC.&#xD;

             pregnancy within 7 days of randomisation. If the urine test is positive or cannot be&#xD;
             confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Female patients of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has had previous high dose radiotherapy (biological equivalent of &gt;30Gy in 10#) to an&#xD;
             area to be treated which includes vertebral bodies (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Previous high dose radiotherapy is defined as a biological equivalent dose to&#xD;
             above that of 30 Gy in 10 fractions using an alpha/beta ratio (50) of 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Where a patient has received radiotherapy to an equivalent or lower dose than defined&#xD;
             above, stereotactic radiotherapy of the area may be considered. In doing so,&#xD;
             assessment of the volume and total dose received by any overlap region must be made,&#xD;
             and documented by generating a cumulative plan incorporating both the previous and&#xD;
             current treatment fields. It is the treating radiation oncologist's responsibility to&#xD;
             review both the current plan and the cumulative plan inclusive of previous&#xD;
             radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has had previous thoracic radiotherapy of &gt; 36Gy within the 6 months prior to&#xD;
             randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis. Patients with small asymptomatic or previously treated brain metastases&#xD;
             may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging&#xD;
             for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic&#xD;
             symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of enlarging brain metastases,&#xD;
             and are not using steroids for intracranial neurological symptoms at least 7 days&#xD;
             prior to trial randomisation. This exception does not include leptomeningeal disease&#xD;
             which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has evidence of Spinal Cord Compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has a Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score ≥ 7 unless lesion reviewed by a&#xD;
             neurosurgical service and considered stable (see Appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Requires surgical fixation of bone lesion for stability. All surgical fixation and&#xD;
             instrumentation must be completed before randomisation on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study&#xD;
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Has a hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             randomisation or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse&#xD;
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has diagnosed and/or treated additional malignancy within 5 years prior to&#xD;
             randomisation with the exception of: curatively treated basal cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, curatively treated early stage cervical&#xD;
             cancer, breast cancer or prostate cancer with no evidence of active disease. Other&#xD;
             exceptions may be considered following consultation with the principal investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current&#xD;
             pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has had any systemic anti-cancer therapy or radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has known interstitial lung disease&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of randomisation. Note: Seasonal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however&#xD;
             intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu- Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are&#xD;
             not allowed. -&#xD;
