      Total of 48 subjects were randomly assigned to treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      UT Health Science Center at San Antonio Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients require a maxillary non-molar extraction site that is planned to be replaced by a&#xD;
      dental implant and crown. This includes Straumann BL SLActive: Narrow (3.3mm) &amp; Regular&#xD;
      (4.1mm) Crossfit implants in all available lengths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly selected to receive either FDBA (test) or Autogenous bone + DBBM&#xD;
      (control/standard) for contour augmentation.&#xD;

      This comparative, randomized, prospective clinical study is designed to compare clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and facial bone height and thickness of two different bone grafting techniques after&#xD;
      augmentation in (Type 2) early implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human subjects who could potentially qualify with the said inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      evaluated and screened. 24 human subjects who qualify for the procedure will have a thorough&#xD;
      evaluation performed after obtaining consent from the patient. All subjects will require&#xD;
      extraction of maxillary teeth (incisors, canines, premolars), followed by early implant&#xD;
      placement of the missing teeth after 4 to 8 weeks extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two subject groups in this study in which the 24 human subjects in will&#xD;
      randomly be placed by selecting the number &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; from a hat. 24 human subjects will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups including 12 subjects using control group design and 12 subjects&#xD;
      using test group design. 12 subjects will be placed randomly into Group 1 and will undergo&#xD;
      the flapless extraction and early implant placement with GBR procedure using the control&#xD;
      group design. 12 subjects will be placed randomly into Group 2 and will undergo the flapless&#xD;
      extraction and early implant placement with GBR procedure using the test group design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the implant placement visit after 4 to 8 weeks of extraction, patient will be asked to&#xD;
      select a number from a hat. If the number showed &quot;1&quot; as a control group, autograft , BBM and&#xD;
      collagen membrane will be used as GBR materials after implant placement. If the number showed&#xD;
      &quot;2&quot; as a test group, FDBA and collagen membrane will be used as GBR materials after implant&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extraction sites will include maxillary teeth (11,12,13,14,15,21,22,23,24,25 according to&#xD;
      FDI) having intact adjacent teeth. Implants placed for this study will have a SLActive&#xD;
      surface, bone level design, Straumann NC 3.3mm or RC 4.1mm in diameter at all available&#xD;
      implant lengths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: early implant placement with autograft plus BBM (Bio-Oss, Geistlich Pharm AG,&#xD;
      Wolhausen, Switzerland) plus two layers of collagen membrane (BioGide®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test group: early implant placement with FDBA (Straumann Allograft GC®) plus two layers of&#xD;
      collagen membrane (BioGide®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These procedures will follow the guidelines as described by Buser et al. (2008). Implant&#xD;
      placements will follow standard protocols utilizing tapping and placement with the hand&#xD;
      ratchet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A CBCT radiograph will be made during the screening visit to determine eligibility for the&#xD;
      study and immediately following implant placement with GBR procedure to provide facial bone&#xD;
      height and thickness measurements. The second CBCT procedure is not typically a standard of&#xD;
      care procedure. After 12 months post loading healing time, the patient will receive another&#xD;
      CBCT. This CBCT is also not a standard of care procedure but can accurately assess the amount&#xD;
      of facial bone height and thickness maintained during the follow-up period.&#xD;
