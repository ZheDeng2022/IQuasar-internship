      This project tests the feasibility of implementing a smartphone application - Ginger.io - in&#xD;
      the UC Davis Early Psychosis Program, and investigates whether mobile health technology can&#xD;
      improve treatment delivery and outcomes in individuals with early psychosis. Ginger.io is a&#xD;
      smartphone application that utilizes methods of passive data collection (i.e. data gathered&#xD;
      without active interaction/contribution from the user) to gather communication, movement, and&#xD;
      interaction data from smartphone devices to model individuals' social, physical, and mental&#xD;
      health. These models are used to infer health-related outcomes and could inform treatment. By&#xD;
      implementing the Ginger.io application in the UC Davis Early Psychosis Program with an&#xD;
      integrated clinical and research infrastructure, the investigators will be able to quickly&#xD;
      determine its feasibility for use in early psychosis populations, while simultaneously&#xD;
      developing its ability to systematically capture aspects of relapse and recovery that are&#xD;
      unique to this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This project has three principle objectives related to early psychosis care: 1)&#xD;
      improve treatment delivery, 2) improve patient outcomes, and 3) lower treatment costs. The&#xD;
      project will target individuals in the early stages of psychotic illness, including&#xD;
      individuals at high risk for developing a psychotic illness (termed &quot;clinical high risk&quot; or&#xD;
      CHR) and individuals within three years of their first psychotic episode (termed &quot;first&#xD;
      episode psychosis&quot; or FEP). The early stages of psychotic illness represent a critical period&#xD;
      for intervention; early identification of clinical deterioration and subsequent targeted&#xD;
      intervention is crucial for rapid remission of symptoms and reduced relapse rates. However,&#xD;
      without the information necessary to identify patients in need of such intervention,&#xD;
      providers are limited in their ability to respond rapidly. Within the UCD Early Psychosis&#xD;
      Program, a mobile health application such as Ginger.io has the potential to equip the&#xD;
      providers and caregivers with valuable insight into a patient's status in real-time without&#xD;
      the burden of increased appointments and intrusive monitoring, allowing the identification of&#xD;
      early psychosis patients most in need of outreach, and routing of treatment resources to the&#xD;
      right patients at the right time.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project comprises two phases. In both phases, patients will use the Ginger.io app on&#xD;
      their mobile device to complete daily surveys assessing mood and social interactions, and&#xD;
      weekly surveys assessing symptoms. Patients will also complete monthly gold-standard clinical&#xD;
      interviews at the UC Davis Early Psychosis Program. Once enrolled, the investigators will ask&#xD;
      patients to participate for the duration of the study, a total of 14 months across Phase I&#xD;
      and II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I involves the collection of pilot data to assess feasibility and conduct exploratory&#xD;
      analyses. Participants will include individuals in the earliest stages of psychosis (CHR and&#xD;
      FEP). The investigators will recruit 60 participants to allow for 15% dropout, aiming to&#xD;
      obtain complete data on 50 participants. Given the emphasis on feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      in Phase I, research staff will monitor patient Dashboards daily and provide clinicians with&#xD;
      weekly summaries for each patient. Clinicians and patients will provide ratings on&#xD;
      satisfaction and effect of Ginger.io on treatment at the end of Phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims for Phase I are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of Ginger.io in an early&#xD;
      psychosis population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility will be measured by utilization of the application (i.e. number of enrolled and&#xD;
      active participants versus total patient population invited). Acceptability will be measured&#xD;
      with satisfaction survey ratings of Ginger.io by patients and clinicians. Analysis will&#xD;
      include summary statistics reporting utilization rates and satisfaction ratings. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize high utilization of Ginger.io and low dropout, as well as high&#xD;
      satisfaction and endorsement of continued use of Ginger.io.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Identify passive behavior data associated with gold-standard measures of&#xD;
      clinical symptoms and social functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will examine associations between passive and active data collected via&#xD;
      Ginger.io. The investigators will then validate both the active and passive behavior data by&#xD;
      examining associations with symptom and social functioning ratings obtained via gold-standard&#xD;
      clinical interviews conducted at monthly research evaluations. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      patients' passive interaction data will positively associate with active survey data of&#xD;
      symptoms and social interactions (e.g. increase reports of mood will relate to more&#xD;
      texts/calls), and that both active and passive data regarding symptoms and social behavior&#xD;
      will relate to gold-standard clinical measures of symptoms and social functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Identify Ginger.io data related to key patient outcomes to inform calibration&#xD;
      of patient status alerts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses using regression models and repeated measure GLMs will examine whether&#xD;
      the passive and active data from Ginger.io statistically predict key patient outcomes,&#xD;
      including psychotic symptom flares, increased clinic contact, psychiatric ER visits or&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and progression from a high risk state to first episode psychosis. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize reductions in phone calls/text messages and/or increases in&#xD;
      self-reported ratings of basic symptoms will predict psychotic symptom flares, increased&#xD;
      clinic utilization, psychiatric ER visits and hospitalizations. This analysis will be used to&#xD;
      calibrate patient status alerts for Phase II that will notify clinicians which patients are&#xD;
      at risk of symptom exacerbation and relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: Evaluate effect of Ginger.io on key treatment variables. Key variables of&#xD;
      interest are medication adherence, therapeutic alliance, and insight. All three variables&#xD;
      will be measured using self-report questionnaires (see Procedures Involved) administered to&#xD;
      patients at the beginning and end of the project, and as part of the monthly clinical&#xD;
      interviews, enabling the evaluation of change over time. The investigators hypothesize that,&#xD;
      following three months of Ginger.io use, patients will report improved medication adherence,&#xD;
      therapeutic alliance, and insight into their illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II will extend the findings of Phase I through the implementation of Ginger.io in the&#xD;
      UC Davis Early Psychosis Programs (EDAPT and SacEDAPT) to allow clinicians to directly&#xD;
      interact with the Dashboard and integrate its information directly into patient care.&#xD;
      Patients will continue to complete daily and weekly surveys via Ginger.io, and monthly&#xD;
      clinical assessments with research staff. Additionally, clinicians will monitor patient&#xD;
      Dashboards on a daily basis and will respond to patient status alerts as they arise (see Aim&#xD;
      2 below). Phase I participants will be asked to remain in the study through Phase II,&#xD;
      yielding a more comprehensive longitudinal dataset. Phase II will involve a total of 120&#xD;
      participants (combined Phase I and newly recruited participants) to account for 15% dropout,&#xD;
      aiming to obtain data for at least 100 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II has four specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Continue to validate predictive value of Ginger.io data related to key&#xD;
      patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a direct extension of Aim 3 in Phase I and will be addressed through continued linear&#xD;
      modeling of passive and active data from Ginger.io to identify and test statistical&#xD;
      predictors of key patient outcomes. This will facilitate continued calibration of patient&#xD;
      status alerts used in the Dashboard to notify clinicians when patients are at risk of&#xD;
      clinical deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate effect of patient status alerts on treatment delivery. Key variables&#xD;
      of interest include clinician-rated utility of the patient status alerts, clinician choice of&#xD;
      treatment delivery following an alert, and the action response time following notification of&#xD;
      an alert. In response to each alert, clinicians will indicate the type of clinical&#xD;
      intervention they pursued (e.g. &quot;called patient to check in&quot;, &quot;scheduled appointment with&#xD;
      psychiatrist&quot;). All treatment will be clinician-driven and provided in a naturalistic manner,&#xD;
      and data will be collected on the types of treatments chosen for a given alert. Clinicians&#xD;
      will also rate the utility (e.g. not useful/useful) of the alert based on information&#xD;
      gathered during follow-up. Action response time will be recorded via Dashboard interaction.&#xD;
      Preliminary analyses will be exploratory and will inform continued improvements to the&#xD;
      Dashboard and calibration of patient status alerts. Summary statistics regarding clinician&#xD;
      responses, average response time, and utility ratings will be included. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that clinicians will rate patient status alerts as useful and informative to&#xD;
      their treatment planning and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Analysis of the impact of Ginger.io on cost of care. Key variables of&#xD;
      interest include cost of outpatient care, and psychiatric ER visits and hospitalizations. To&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of Ginger.io, the historical average monthly and annual cost of care per&#xD;
      patient will be compared to the average monthly and annual cost of care during and following&#xD;
      completion of the project. The investigators hypothesize that implementation of Ginger.io&#xD;
      will reduce the number and duration of psychiatric ER visits and hospitalizations, thereby&#xD;
      reducing costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: Continued evaluation of feasibility and acceptability of Ginger.io in an&#xD;
      early psychosis population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will continue to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of Ginger.io in&#xD;
      both patients and clinicians using satisfaction surveys. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      patients will continue to endorse high satisfaction rates and continued use of Ginger.io.&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that clinicians will report high satisfaction&#xD;
      rates with the Dashboard and endorse its continued use in clinical care.&#xD;
