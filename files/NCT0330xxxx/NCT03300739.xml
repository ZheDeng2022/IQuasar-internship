      This is an observational pilot study focused on collecting data on clinical variables that&#xD;
      can improve the understanding of potential predictors of disease exacerbation and&#xD;
      readmissions in COPD patients. The study aim is to understand how the variability of clinical&#xD;
      parameters (respiratory rate, forced expiratory volume in one second, and oxygen saturation),&#xD;
      physical activity and quality of life is associated with the risk of exacerbation in COPD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      The investigational product to be used in this trial is the ResMed Biomotion Sensor (ResMed&#xD;
      Sensor Technologies, Dublin, Ireland). This device uses very low power radio waves (~1/100th&#xD;
      of the strength of a mobile phone signal) to detect respiratory movements of a person while&#xD;
      asleep- without physical contact with the individual. The device is designed to measure up to&#xD;
      5 feet, so that only the person on the side of the bed nearest the device is monitored.&#xD;
      Algorithms have been developed to analyze the respiratory movement signals and extract&#xD;
      information about respiration rate, bodily movements, sleep/wake patterns and sleep&#xD;
      disordered respiration.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Medically stable and ambulatory COPD (primary diagnosis) patients who have had an&#xD;
             emergency room visit or hospitalization for an acute exacerbation of COPD within the&#xD;
             past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Sufficient understanding of the English language to be able to read and understand&#xD;
             study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Currently on admission in the hospital, on non-invasive positive airway pressure&#xD;
             ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Visual, hearing or cognitive impairments at the discretion of their physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Currently participating in a COPD telemonitoring program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No AT&amp;T cellular coverage at their primary residence&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any other medical or psychological condition that, in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             may present an unreasonable risk to the study participant as a result of his/her&#xD;
             participation in this study, may make participant's participation unreliable, or may&#xD;
             interfere with study assessments.&#xD;
