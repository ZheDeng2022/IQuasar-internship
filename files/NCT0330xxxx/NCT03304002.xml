  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Routine incorporation of decision aids into oncology practice has the potential to&#xD;
      significantly improve patients' experiences with cancer by increasing the likelihood that&#xD;
      they make informed treatment decisions aligned with their values. Unfortunately, only a&#xD;
      minority of the more than 1.6 million patients diagnosed annually with cancer ever receive&#xD;
      one due to limited clinic resources for administration and challenges in timely&#xD;
      identification of appropriate patients. Online delivery directly to patients addresses some&#xD;
      of these barriers but is insufficient on its own to ensure accessibility for patients at the&#xD;
      time they most benefit from support.19 It is critical that active, multi-faceted&#xD;
      implementation strategies that target barriers to the widespread use of web-based decision&#xD;
      aids be identified, as these tools have the potential to significantly improve the quality of&#xD;
      oncologic care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on strong preliminary work, the investigators have developed and piloted a package of&#xD;
      implementation strategies that effectively overcomes barriers to delivery of a web-based&#xD;
      breast cancer surgery decision aid in an academic and community clinic. Although the strategy&#xD;
      was successful, patients were white and educated; further investigation is imperative in&#xD;
      settings that provide care to underserved patients to ensure the intervention will mitigate,&#xD;
      rather than worsen, existing disparities in breast cancer care. This is especially critical&#xD;
      given that underserved patients may benefit most from shared decision-making interventions&#xD;
      such as the one described. To study this, the investigators propose a pilot study within a&#xD;
      clinic that serves a catchment area with a high proportion of African American, rural and low&#xD;
      income patients. The investigators will iteratively assess and enhance our implementation&#xD;
      package using concepts outlined in the Knowledge-to-Action Cycle, which emphasizes local&#xD;
      context in balancing fidelity and flexibility. The specific aims are: 1) To identify patient&#xD;
      and clinic level barriers to implementation of a web-based breast cancer surgery decision aid&#xD;
      in a clinic that cares for underserved patients, and 2) To test and expand our current&#xD;
      implementation package's ability to address barriers in a clinic that cares for underserved&#xD;
      patients. The investigators will determine the reach of implementation and acceptability of&#xD;
      this method of decision aid delivery to stakeholders.&#xD;
