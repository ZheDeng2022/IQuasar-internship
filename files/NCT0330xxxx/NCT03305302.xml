  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In terms of incidence, cancer of the tongue is one of the leading cancers in France.&#xD;
      Moreover, this cancer is associated with physiological complications ranging from swallowing&#xD;
      disorders to loss of taste. Following surgery, impaired perception of food taste may lead to&#xD;
      cachexia. It is therefore necessary to carry out research in the field of impaired taste,&#xD;
      notably with regard to the regeneration of taste buds. However, there is currently no&#xD;
      available functional model of taste bud cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore necessary to obtain a cell line of human taste cells. These immortalised&#xD;
      human cells will allow us to better orient our investigations for applications in humans:&#xD;
      search for and characterisation of &quot;taste modifiers&quot; synthesised using organic chemistry,&#xD;
      able to trigger the perception of food in cases of taste loss or taste impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, given recent studies conducted by the investigating team proposing the existence of&#xD;
      a fatty taste and its implication in obesity, the work of the team could be oriented towards&#xD;
      the synthesis of lipid-receptor agonists, by analogy with artificial sweeteners instead of&#xD;
      sugar. The availability of these chemical molecules would lead to a reduction in lipid intake&#xD;
      as these agents contain no (or very few) calories. They will act as an organoleptic decoy.&#xD;
