    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of Schroth scoliosis-specific&#xD;
      exercises (SSE) on patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) during bracing. The&#xD;
      goal is to determine if Schroth SSE combined with bracing can is superior in controlling&#xD;
      curve progression when compared with bracing alone. Curve progression is defined as worsening&#xD;
      of coronal Cobb angle of 6 degrees or more.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent Idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional deformity of the spine,&#xD;
      characterized by a lateral curvature and vertebral rotation. Its prevalence is estimated to&#xD;
      be 2.5% in children between aged 10 and 16 in Hong Kong. Curve progression occurs during&#xD;
      pubertal growth spurt. If the primary curve does not exceed 40 degree at skeletal maturity,&#xD;
      it is unlikely to continue to progress, and there are little or no long-term clinical&#xD;
      consequences. However, if the curve progresses beyond 50 degree during adolescence, it may&#xD;
      cause functional limitation, accelerated disc degeneration with potential neurological&#xD;
      deficit, cosmetic concerns, decreased quality of life, and possible progression in adulthood.&#xD;
      Thus, surgical correction of the deformity with instrumented spinal fusion is usually&#xD;
      recommended if the curve reaches 50 degree during adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, spinal bracing is the only the only non-operative treatment supported with&#xD;
      high-quality evidence that can prevent curve progression. In a randomized controlled trial,&#xD;
      Weinstein et al. recently reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that bracing was&#xD;
      effective in preventing curve progression to threshold for surgery in 72% of cases. The trial&#xD;
      was terminated early due to the treatment benefit in favor of bracing. Nonetheless, the&#xD;
      authors reported a treatment failure rate of 25% in the randomized cohort, which was similar&#xD;
      to previous published studies. Hence, despite the best available non-operative treatment, the&#xD;
      number of adolescents ultimately requiring surgery remains substantial. Surgery is associated&#xD;
      with medical comorbidities, can cause psychosocial stress to the children and their families,&#xD;
      and has significant financial impact on healthcare, with the total costs of spinal surgery to&#xD;
      correct AIS ranked second only to appendicitis among children 10 to 17 years of age.&#xD;
      Consequently, further effective strategies to prevent scoliosis progression in children are&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scoliosis-specific exercise (SSE) has been proposed as an additional non-operative&#xD;
      intervention that may reduce curve progression during the adolescent growth spurt. However,&#xD;
      the standard of care for non-operative treatment of AIS varies widely between North America&#xD;
      and Europe, and the use of SSE is not universally accepted. SSE is a potentially low-cost&#xD;
      intervention that will be of substantial benefit even if a relative risk reduction in curve&#xD;
      progression or reaching the threshold for surgery is reduced in a modest proportion of those&#xD;
      participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SSE, as opposed to generalized physiotherapy, consists of individually-adapted exercises that&#xD;
      aim to promote spinal realignment through self-correction and stabilization, as well as&#xD;
      modulating patterns of trunk muscles recruitment. Electromyography (EMG) of paraspinal and&#xD;
      abdominal muscles in AIS patients revealed disrupted patterns of muscles recruitment, which&#xD;
      are associated with a disparity in trunk isometric rotation strength between sides. AIS&#xD;
      patients demonstrate proprioceptive and balance control problems, along with a distorted body&#xD;
      schema, resulting in a mismatch between the actual spinal alignment and the patients'&#xD;
      internal representation of the body. SSE aims to reverse the anomalous patterns of muscle&#xD;
      recruitment through training, and modify the body schema with visual and somatosensory&#xD;
      feedback. This forms the theoretical neurophysiological basis for using this treatment&#xD;
      strategy for AIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schroth SSE is one of the most studied and widely-used schools of SSE. It is a technique&#xD;
      tailored to the type of scoliosis and the curve magnitude of each patient. It is based on&#xD;
      vertebrae deflections and sagittal corrections that result in horizontal vertebrae&#xD;
      de-rotation. It uses rotational breathing and postural auto-correction to reverse the&#xD;
      underlying impairments in spinal muscle function, postural control and proprioception which&#xD;
      contribute to the development of curvature in AIS. Patients will also be given cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral strategies to empower them to self-manage their conditions.&#xD;

Recruited patients will be randomly assigned to either SSE group or control group in a ratio of 1:1.
