  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid addiction among youth (including both adolescents and young adults) is a growing&#xD;
      health problem with catastrophic consequences for young people and their families. The&#xD;
      current opioid epidemic disproportionately affects youth. Furthermore, compared to adults,&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults tend to have poorer engagement in and response to treatment than&#xD;
      older adults. Relapse prevention medications are the clear standard of care for the treatment&#xD;
      of opioid addiction in adults, but the evidence base for effectiveness including&#xD;
      implementation is not well-established in youth, and concerns from the field emphasize poor&#xD;
      adherence and retention. Further there is no consensus regarding models of care, psychosocial&#xD;
      treatments and platforms for delivery of medications. Extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX)&#xD;
      has proven effectiveness in adults and is a promising pharmacotherapy for youth, but the&#xD;
      field needs further clarification of its optimal use and delivery in this target population,&#xD;
      in the context of developmentally informed models of care. There is inadequate current&#xD;
      capacity for specialty opioid specific treatment that integrates pharmacotherapy (relapse&#xD;
      prevention medication) with psychosocial treatment in a context that is youth welcoming and&#xD;
      family empowering.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While retention in youth opioid treatment has generally been poor, assertive outreach has not&#xD;
      been standard. There may be models from other populations with elements worth considering,&#xD;
      such as Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) for severe and persistent mental illness or&#xD;
      Assertive Continuing Care (ACC) for adolescents with cannabis use disorders. These are&#xD;
      programs providing wrap-around services that include home-based services and medication&#xD;
      administration visits, assertive outreach, intense case management, family engagement in&#xD;
      order to address engagement barriers. ACC has considerable developmental validity, has been&#xD;
      used widely and been scaled by SAMHSA in broad implementations for youth SUDs (other than&#xD;
      OUD). ACT has become a broad standard of care for adults with chronic severe mental illness&#xD;
      such as schizophrenia, who struggle with non-adherence and poor outcomes in conventional&#xD;
      treatment. ACT also typically includes a medication home-delivery component. Most states have&#xD;
      also developed standard public sector reimbursement models for ACT. But very little work has&#xD;
      been done to adapt or adopt these models to the population of youth with opioid addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, limitations on adherence to XR-NTX under non-research conditions have been a&#xD;
      barrier to optimal effectiveness. One study reported that among 62 adult patients completing&#xD;
      inpatient detoxification who received an XR-NTX prior to discharge, 55% returned for a second&#xD;
      injection and 16% received a third injection. In the LA County evaluation, only 17% of the&#xD;
      171 adults who received an XR-NTX injection received their third injection. The&#xD;
      investigators' first case series of 16 youth receiving XR-NTX for opioid addiction, the&#xD;
      average total number of outpatient doses received within 4 months of outpatient treatment was&#xD;
      1.5, corresponding to 38% of the potential 4 monthly doses, with 25% dropping out before&#xD;
      receiving any outpatient doses. A naturalistic study published by the investigators, of young&#xD;
      adult opioid treatment with either buprenorphine or XR-NTX and high intensity psychosocial&#xD;
      treatment support included 13 cases treated with XR-NTX. This cohort had 40% retention at 6&#xD;
      months, no difference between the buprenorphine and XR-NTX groups, with an average number of&#xD;
      3.1 outpatient doses received within 6 months, corresponding to 52% of the potential 6&#xD;
      monthly doses. And while 54% received a 3rd outpatient dose, this was a low-volume program&#xD;
      that selected highly motivated patients willing to accept the requirements and burdens of&#xD;
      frequent attendance and intensive structure, and included only those who had initiated&#xD;
      outpatient treatment following inpatient treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these gaps discussed above, the investigators propose N=45 (~5 pilot intervention&#xD;
      cases prior to randomization; see protocol) participants with OUD to be randomized to&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU) or YORs intervention, which incorporates XR-NTX into a&#xD;
      developmentally informed, multi-component model of care - Youth Opioid Recovery Support&#xD;
      (YORS; see protocol for additional detail on the intervention).&#xD;
