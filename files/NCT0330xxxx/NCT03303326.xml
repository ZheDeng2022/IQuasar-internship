  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates how Arab American women's cultural values and sexual health are related&#xD;
      to their physical and emotional health. The study will also examine whether engaging in a&#xD;
      sexual health interview affects women's physical and emotional health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sexuality is an important aspect of health, in part because emotional conflicts over&#xD;
      sexuality as well as unwanted sexual experiences can impact physical and psychological&#xD;
      health; yet no studies have examined sexual health among Arab American women in the U.S.&#xD;
      These women face the task of negotiating their heritage culture and the American culture in&#xD;
      which they reside. This may result in bicultural identity conflict for some women as they try&#xD;
      to negotiate these two identities, which may have implications for sexuality and sexual&#xD;
      health due to the two cultures' disparate views on sexuality. Confidential discussion of&#xD;
      these sensitive topics with a knowledgeable interviewer may yield beneficial effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of the current study is to fill the gap in the literature on Arab American&#xD;
      sexual health by examining how sexual health is related to physical and psychological health.&#xD;
      This will be accomplished using both: a) correlational findings about sexual, physical, and&#xD;
      psychological health from information gathered through self-report questionnaires and a&#xD;
      60-minute women's health interview; and b) an experimental test of the effects of the women's&#xD;
      health interview on physical and psychological health. A sample of young adult Arab American&#xD;
      women will be assessed at baseline via questionnaires for various constructs (sexual&#xD;
      attitudes, cultural and religious identity, and physical and mental health), and then&#xD;
      randomized to either an immediate or delayed health interview, with a 5-week follow-up&#xD;
      reassessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that lower sexual well-being, negative sexual self-schemas, and unwanted&#xD;
      sexual experiences will correlate with more somatic and psychological health symptoms and&#xD;
      lower satisfaction with life. It is also hypothesized that participants who have the&#xD;
      immediate interview will report greater reduction in somatic and psychological symptoms and a&#xD;
      greater willingness to discuss sexual health with medical providers compared to participants&#xD;
      who are not interviewed (i.e., have a delayed interview after follow-up assessment).&#xD;
