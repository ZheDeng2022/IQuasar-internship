  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of the proposed study is that an electrophysiology-based algorithmic&#xD;
      approach is superior to standard clinical follow-up with 30-day monitoring in reducing the&#xD;
      combined endpoint of syncope, hospitalization, and death in patients in patients with new of&#xD;
      left bundle branch block following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population consists of pacemaker-free patients that are 18 years or older&#xD;
      undergoing a TAVI with new onset left bundle branch block. Patient consent is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the&#xD;
      following two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: electrophysiology-based algorithmic approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: standard clinical follow-up with transcutaneous cardiac monitoring.&#xD;

    <description>Transcutaneous cardiac patches will allow continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for a 30-day period. For the first randomized patients at the Montreal Heart Institute, Icentia was used and then was changed to a m-Health® device which allows continuous cardiac monitoring. The PocketECG from m-Health® is attached to 3 electrodes on the chest and contains a SIM card that transmits to a server located in Burlington, Ontario .The COME-TAVI coordinating center and the associated site will be informed rapidly of any events that occur . These events include:&#xD;
Ventricular fibrillation; Sustained ventricular tachycardia Any RR interval &gt;5 sec; Third-degree AV block or Mobitz 2 AV block;</description>
