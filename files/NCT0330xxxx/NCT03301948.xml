  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy male participants are recruited to observe potentially deleterious changes in&#xD;
      appetite regulation and metabolic control. Participants will be provided with an energy&#xD;
      intake representative of their daily requirements on the first day of one trial and will be&#xD;
      provided with an additional 50% energy intake on the first day of another trial. Outcome&#xD;
      variables will be assessed during the second day of each trial in response to a fixed mixed&#xD;
      macronutrient meal tolerance test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All testing will take place within the Carnegie Research Institute, Leeds Beckett University.&#xD;
      We will ask all the participants to visit on five occasions for the completion of a&#xD;
      preliminary screening trial and two single-blind counterbalanced experimental trials which&#xD;
      each require the participants to visit the laboratory on two consecutive days. The&#xD;
      experimental trials will be separated by a minimum of one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Preliminary Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before an individual can take part in the experiment, they will need to undergo screening.&#xD;
      Individuals will need to complete a Health Screen Questionnaire. Individuals will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study if they are not currently in good health, have any condition that would alter&#xD;
      their metabolism and/or have had significant medical problems in the past that may affect the&#xD;
      outcomes of the study. Individuals will also be asked to be complete a Three-Factor Eating&#xD;
      Questionnaire, to check that they are not restrained eaters, and an International Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to ensure that all participants are either sedentary or&#xD;
      moderately active. All individuals will be asked to confirm that they have been weight stable&#xD;
      for at least six months before participating and that they are not currently dieting. Height,&#xD;
      body mass and age will be collected to calculate the energy requirements for the main trials&#xD;
      based on the Mifflin equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5: Experimental Trials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be asked to record their food intakes and activity patterns during the&#xD;
      three days prior to the first experimental test using a food and physical activity diary.&#xD;
      They will then be instructed to repeat this diet and activity pattern prior to the second&#xD;
      experimental trial. Participants will be required to arrive at the laboratory for all&#xD;
      experimental trials after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours and having refrained from&#xD;
      any strenuous activity for 48 hours, and alcohol and caffeine consumption in the previous 24&#xD;
      hours. Two hours before arriving at the laboratory on the day of the experimental trials,&#xD;
      participants will be required to ingest 300 mL of water to standardise hydration levels for&#xD;
      the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Day One of each experimental trial, participants will consume a porridge-based&#xD;
      breakfast, soup- and pasta-based lunch, and rice-based evening meal under laboratory&#xD;
      observation. The meals will contain macronutrient contents representative of current dietary&#xD;
      recommendations of 50% carbohydrate, 15% protein and 35% fat. These meals have been selected&#xD;
      to facilitate manipulation of the energy content, while matching the meals for appearance and&#xD;
      palatability. During one trial, these meals will provide the calculated energy requirement&#xD;
      for each individual based on the Mifflin equation and a physical activity factor of 1.4. The&#xD;
      meals will be covertly manipulated to provide an additional 50% energy intake during the&#xD;
      other trial. The provision of 150% of the estimated energy requirements for participants has&#xD;
      been used in previous research for five day periods but will only be provided for a single&#xD;
      day in the present study. Participants will be required to consume all of the diet during the&#xD;
      standardised phase (i.e. either their daily energy requirements or the 50% overfeed) and will&#xD;
      be blinded to the energy content of the trials. After the consumption of the evening meal&#xD;
      (~6pm), participants will have fulfilled the requirements for day one and will be asked not&#xD;
      to consume any food prior to returning to the laboratory between 7am and 9am the next&#xD;
      morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day Two of each experimental trial day, participants will arrive at the laboratory after&#xD;
      an overnight fast and an Introcan Safety Cannula will be placed into a vein in the&#xD;
      anticubital space for regular venous blood sampling. Blood samples will be collected in the&#xD;
      fasted state and every 30 min after consumption of a standardised breakfast for a period of&#xD;
      three hours. After the collection of the final blood sample, the cannula will be removed and&#xD;
      participants will be provided with an ad libitum pasta meal (50% carbohydrate, 15% protein,&#xD;
      35% fat) for the assessment of energy intake. Participants will consume ad libitum meals in&#xD;
      isolation to prevent any social influences and will be instructed to eat until 'satisfied'.&#xD;
