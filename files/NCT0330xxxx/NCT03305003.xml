      Throughout the Military Health System, pregnant mothers are issued a spiral-bound guide that&#xD;
      provides week by week information about pregnancy, preventive health messages, appointment&#xD;
      information, and space to record their experiences throughout their pregnancy. When used&#xD;
      accordingly, the evidence-based guide is an effective tool for motivating patients to&#xD;
      participate in their own healthcare and achieve care goals. However, the spiral-bound paper&#xD;
      modality results in patients forgetting the book for appointments or losing it. By testing a&#xD;
      mobile application (app) from the current publication, the MHS leverages the efforts which&#xD;
      created the guide while increasing patient and provider use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multisite testing (randomized controlled trial) of a mobile application developed from&#xD;
      the current spiral-bound &quot;Pregnancy and Childbirth: A Goal Oriented Guide to Prenatal Care&quot;&#xD;
      created by the VA and DoD provides an innovative, cost-effective opportunity to improve&#xD;
      provider-patient communication and patient care.&#xD;

      The study was conducted in the women's health and family medicine departments of one&#xD;
      community hospital and two medical centers across three states (Georgia, Nevada, and&#xD;
      Virginia). In this hospital system, women are distributed a spiral notebook at their&#xD;
      obstetric care intake appointment, which generally is scheduled for 8-10 weeks gestation. The&#xD;
      spiral notebook is designed for two purposes: 1) patient education of what happens throughout&#xD;
      pregnancy, and 2) patient record keeping of the patient's own pregnancy experience, including&#xD;
      space for recording weight, blood pressure, and journaling about what they experience between&#xD;
      prenatal appointments. The mobile app used in this study was designed for the same two&#xD;
      purposes and contained identical content, though through a mobile design interface (available&#xD;
      on both Android and iOS platforms). After the pilot study, patient feedback on the mobile app&#xD;
      was used to create a beta version. Notable differences were a feature for users to change&#xD;
      font size, a search function, and weekly reminders. No substantive content changed. This&#xD;
      randomized controlled study had one intervention (mobile application) and one control&#xD;
      (standard of care - spiral notebook) group. The study was approved by the first author's&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each medical center, the obstetrics intake nurse serially screened new obstetrics patients&#xD;
      for inclusion criteria from May to November 2015. If patients met inclusion criteria, the&#xD;
      nurse invited the patient to talk to a research assistant about the study. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      included conditions that would elevate the patient's care to complicated obstetrics care&#xD;
      (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, renal disorder, etc.). This was intended to&#xD;
      capture a low-risk obstetrics patient population that would follow a standard 4-week pathway&#xD;
      of care, in which patients attend a prenatal appointment once every four weeks during&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study used pre-assigned block randomization (each block n = 40) to balance the conditions&#xD;
      throughout recruitment. Following consent and baseline measures, participants were randomized&#xD;
      to the two conditions. Providers were blinded to patient participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys were completed at four prenatal appointments, 10-12 weeks, 28 weeks, 32 weeks, and 36&#xD;
      weeks gestation. All data collection was conducted with paper-and-pencil surveys in the&#xD;
      clinic, immediately before and following each clinical appointment. At each appointment,&#xD;
      patient weight and blood pressure were also recorded from the patient's electronic medical&#xD;
      record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, self-reported measures included demographics, health literacy, and patient&#xD;
      activation. Health literacy was assessed using the self-reported Functional, Communicative,&#xD;
      Critical Health Literacy Scale (Ishikawa, Takeuchi, &amp; Yano, 2008) Patient activation was&#xD;
      assessed with the validated, licensed patient activation measure (PAM) (Greene &amp; Hibbard,&#xD;
      2012; Greene, Hibbard, Sacks, &amp; Overton, 2013; Hibbard, Mahoney, Stockard, &amp; Tusler, 2005;&#xD;
      Hibbard et al., 2004), which uses 13 Likert-type items to create a continuous patient&#xD;
      activation measure on a scale of 0 (not activated) to 100 (most activated). PAM was also&#xD;
      replicated at time 4 (32 week appointment). As a surrogate measure, patient activation was&#xD;
      also assessed at a behavioral level by asking patients at 36 weeks how many mobile apps they&#xD;
      had used throughout their pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use was assessed with three measures. Before each appointment, patients completed two items&#xD;
      regarding use of the education and engagement tool. First they indicated if they had brought&#xD;
      the mobile app/notebook to the appointment with them (yes/no). Then, they reported how&#xD;
      frequently they had used the tool over the past month 1) to look for information and 2) to&#xD;
      record information (never = 0, once = 1, weekly = 4, or daily = 28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following each appointment, patients completed five subscales of the validated Prenatal&#xD;
      Interpersonal Processes of Care (PIPC) scale (Wong et al., 2004), including&#xD;
      elicitation/responsiveness to the patient, explanations of care, empowerment,&#xD;
      patient-centered decision making, and emotional support. Responses to each item were&#xD;
      transformed onto a 0 (negative perception) to 100 (positive perception) scale, and items are&#xD;
      averaged to create subscales. Then subscales are averaged to calculate the overall PIPC&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At delivery, outcomes were recorded from the health record: gestational age, birth weight,&#xD;
      and mode of delivery (vaginal or Caesarean section).&#xD;
