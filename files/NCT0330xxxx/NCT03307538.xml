      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, surgery is the only treatment modality that&#xD;
      can result in cure. Unfortunately, in the majority of these patients the tumors are found to&#xD;
      be unresectable at presentation due to local invasive tumor growth or the presence of distal&#xD;
      metastases. For patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma palliative chemotherapy is the&#xD;
      standard treatment yielding an estimated median overall survival of 12-15.2 months. There is&#xD;
      no evidence from randomized trials that support the routine use of stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy (SBRT) for cholangiocarcinoma. However, small and most often retrospective&#xD;
      studies combining chemotherapy with SBRT showed promising results with overall survival&#xD;
      reaching up to 33-35 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon these observations, the investigators designed a local feasibility trial with SBRT&#xD;
      after chemotherapy in patients with unresectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in order to try&#xD;
      to confirm the observed tolerability of adding SBRT to standard chemotherapy. The expected&#xD;
      time to include the required patients for this pilot study will be one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess feasibility of SBRT as add on treatment after standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local feasibility trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, 18 years of age or older, T1-4 N0-1 M0&#xD;
      (AJCC 7th Edition), after completion of standard chemotherapy. Exclusion criteria are local&#xD;
      tumor growth into either stomach, colon, duodenum, pancreas or abdominal wall. Sample size&#xD;
      will be 6 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBRT will be delivered in 15 fractions of 3 to 4.5Gy after 8 cycles of chemotherapy. In case&#xD;
      of toxicity causing premature termination of systemic treatment, the patient can still&#xD;
      proceed to SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is feasibility measured by radiotherapy induced toxicity&#xD;
      according to CTC v4.0.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cellular radiosensitivity.&#xD;

      For patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, surgery is the only treatment modality that&#xD;
      can result in cure. Unfortunately, in the majority of these patients the tumors are found to&#xD;
      be unresectable at presentation due to local invasive tumor growth or the presence of distant&#xD;
      metastases. For these patients palliative chemotherapy is the standard treatment yielding an&#xD;
      estimated median overall survival of 12-15.2 months. There is no evidence from randomized&#xD;
      trials that supports the routine use of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for&#xD;
      unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. However, small and most often retrospective studies&#xD;
      combining chemotherapy with SBRT showed promising results with overall survival reaching up&#xD;
      to 33-35 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is designed as a first step to confirm and extend these findings. Up to six&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with unresectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma will be treated with&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy followed by SBRT in order to assess possible severe side effects of the&#xD;
      treatment. As part of this research, patients will be followed with CT- or MRI-scan and blood&#xD;
      tests exams until progression. In addition to this clinical evaluation, the investigators&#xD;
      will also work towards developing a predictive assay for radiotherapy response of both normal&#xD;
      and tumor tissue by establishing normal tissue and tumor organoids and determining several&#xD;
      key parameters for their response to ionizing radiation treatment.&#xD;
