    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each participant must have documented Human immunodeficiency virus type1 (HIV-1)&#xD;
             infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each participant must be on suppressive antiretroviral treatment (ART) for at least 48&#xD;
             weeks prior to randomization and on stable suppressive ART for at least 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to screening. Changes in antiretrovirals (ARVs) can be made for safety/tolerability&#xD;
             reasons only until 4 weeks prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each participant must have started ART outside of the acute or early phase of&#xD;
             infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each participant must have a plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) less than (&lt;) 50&#xD;
             copies/ milliliter (mL) at screening and at least one documented evidence of plasma&#xD;
             HIV RNA &lt;50 copies/mL after the last ART change. In case of ART change within the 48&#xD;
             weeks prior randomization, at least one additional more recent documented plasma HIV&#xD;
             RNA &lt;50 copies/mL is required. One blip of HIV RNA greater than (&gt;)50 and &lt;200&#xD;
             copies/mL within 24 weeks prior to screening is acceptable, provided that the 2 most&#xD;
             recent (after last ART change, tested before and/or during screening) HIV RNA results&#xD;
             are &lt;50 copies/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each participant must be medically stable as confirmed by medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory&#xD;
             tests performed at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant while enrolled&#xD;
             in this study, or within 3 months after the last vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone with contraindication to intramuscular injections and blood draws example,&#xD;
             bleeding disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone with acute illness (this does not include minor illnesses such as diarrhea or&#xD;
             mild upper respiratory tract infection) or temperature greater than or equal to (&gt;=)&#xD;
             38.0ºC (degree centigrade) within 24 hours prior to the first dose of study vaccine;&#xD;
             enrollment at a later date is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone with a history of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are&#xD;
             squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or&#xD;
             malignancy, which is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone with a history of an underlying clinically significant acute or uncontrolled&#xD;
             chronic medical condition or physical examination findings for which, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the&#xD;
             participant (example, compromise the well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or&#xD;
             confound the protocol-specified assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone with a history of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness&#xD;
             according to Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) criteria based on&#xD;
             available medical history and assessed by the investigator as clinically relevant. A&#xD;
             case summary for every participant with AIDS-defining illnesses assessed by the&#xD;
             investigator as clinically irrelevant must be provided to the sponsor and Protocol&#xD;
             Safety Review Team (PSRT), who will determine eligibility on a case-by-case basis&#xD;
             prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone with a history of CD4+ less than (&lt;) 200 cells per millimeter cube&#xD;
             (cells/mm^3), based on available medical history and assessed by the investigator as&#xD;
             clinically relevant. A case summary for every participant with history of CD4+ &lt;200&#xD;
             cells/mm^3 assessed by the investigator as clinically irrelevant must be provided to&#xD;
             the sponsor and PSRT, who will determine eligibility on a case-by-case basis prior to&#xD;
             randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone with chronic active hepatitis B (measured by hepatitis B surface antigen test)&#xD;
             or active hepatitis C (measured by hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody test; if positive,&#xD;
             HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction test will be used to confirm active versus past HCV&#xD;
             infection) or syphilis infection that has not been effectively treated. Positive&#xD;
             syphilis serology due to past effectively treated infection is not exclusionary&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone who received or plans to receive: a) licensed live attenuated vaccines within&#xD;
             28 days before or after planned administration of any of the study vaccinations; b)&#xD;
             other licensed (not live) vaccines - within 14 days before or after planned&#xD;
             administration of any of the study vaccinations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone who received an investigational drug or used an invasive investigational&#xD;
             medical device within 30 days or received an investigational vaccine within 6 months&#xD;
             before the planned administration of the first dose of study vaccine. Receipt of&#xD;
             prophylactic or therapeutic HIV vaccine candidate at any time is always exclusionary.&#xD;
             Exceptions: Participants can be included where the vaccine received was subsequently&#xD;
             licensed. Participants with proof of having received only a placebo vaccine can also&#xD;
             be included&#xD;
