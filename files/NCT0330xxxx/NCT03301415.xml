      This is a phase II, open-label trial to evaluate valganciclovir as a treatment to prevent&#xD;
      development of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in infants with asymptomatic congenital&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The trial will be conducted in two phases - screening of&#xD;
      newborns to identify eligible subjects, and treatment of those newborns who have confirmed&#xD;
      CMV infection at birth but without outward manifestations of congenital CMV infection. 229&#xD;
      newborns with confirmed CMV infection but without baseline SNHL and who meet all&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the treatment phase. Study duration is 5&#xD;
      years. Primary objective of this study is to estimate the proportion of subjects with&#xD;
      asymptomatic congenital CMV infection who, following treatment with 4 months of oral&#xD;
      valganciclovir, develop SNHL by 6 months of life.&#xD;

      This is a phase II, open-label trial to evaluate valganciclovir as a treatment to prevent&#xD;
      development of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in infants with asymptomatic congenital&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The trial will be conducted in two phases - screening of&#xD;
      newborns to identify eligible subjects, and treatment of those newborns who have confirmed&#xD;
      CMV infection at birth but without outward manifestations of congenital CMV infection.&#xD;
      Approximately 48,250 newborn infants with no outward manifestations of congenital CMV&#xD;
      infection will be screened to detect approximately 241 neonates with asymptomatic congenital&#xD;
      CMV infection; these 241 newborns then will have audiology examinations to determine baseline&#xD;
      hearing, with approximately 229 having normal hearing in both ears. Those 229 newborns with&#xD;
      confirmed CMV infection but without baseline SNHL and who meet all inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be enrolled into the treatment phase. Enrolled subjects will be treated for&#xD;
      four months with oral valganciclovir (16 mg/kg/dose, administered two times per day).&#xD;
      Audiologic assessments will be made during the Screening Period and Study Months 4 (end of&#xD;
      treatment), 6, 12, and 18. Treated infants will be followed for safety throughout the first 6&#xD;
      months of the study (including for 2 months post-treatment). Study duration is 5 years.&#xD;
      Primary objective of this study is to estimate the proportion of subjects with asymptomatic&#xD;
      congenital CMV infection who, following treatment with 4 months of oral valganciclovir,&#xD;
      develop sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) by 6 months of life. Secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
      1) define the safety and tolerability of valganciclovir in enrolled subjects, 2) estimate the&#xD;
      proportion of subjects with asymptomatic congenital CMV infection who, following treatment&#xD;
      with 4 months of oral valganciclovir, develop SNHL over the first 18 months of life.&#xD;
