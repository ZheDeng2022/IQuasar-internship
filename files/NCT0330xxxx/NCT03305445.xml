  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center study open-label trial will enroll a single cohort of relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients whom are ineligible for autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (ASCT) due to 1) insensitivity to salvage chemotherapy, or 2) inability to&#xD;
      tolerate high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy. All patients will receive dual checkpoint&#xD;
      blocking antibody (DCBA) therapy with established doses currently being used in phase III&#xD;
      trials of ipilimumab (1mg/kg) and nivolumab (3mg/kg) given at three week intervals, two times&#xD;
      before, and two times following &quot;immunotransplant&quot; in which T cells (in whole PBMCs) are&#xD;
      cryopreserved and re-infused (adoptive T cell transfer or ATCT) following lymphodepleting&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen, currently being employed in adoptive T cell therapies.&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;

             after enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. HIV positive with detectable viral load, or anyone not on stable anti-viral (HAART)&#xD;
