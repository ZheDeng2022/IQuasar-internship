  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Automated delivery of propofol using computer-controlled closed loop anaesthesia device&#xD;
      delivers propofol based on patient's frontal cortex electrical activity as determined by&#xD;
      bi-spectral index (BIS). Evaluation of anaesthesia delivery by these systems has shown that&#xD;
      they deliver propofol and maintain depth of anaesthesia with far more precision as compared&#xD;
      to manual administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By automatically controlling anaesthesia depth consistency they provide time to the&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist to focus on other aspects of patient care such as managing intra-operative&#xD;
      hemodynamics and ventilation perturbations during major surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closed loop anaesthesia delivery system (CLADS) is an indigenously developed continuous&#xD;
      automated intravenous infusion system which delivers propofol based on patients EEG profile&#xD;
      (BIS) feedback. Although a few studies have already evaluated these automated systems in&#xD;
      patients undergoing thoracic surgery, but suffered from significant limitations (small number&#xD;
      of patients, not dedicated to thoracic surgery cohort). Currently, there is no data available&#xD;
      regarding CLADS performance vis a vis adequacy of GA and haemodynamic profile in patients&#xD;
      undergoing thoracic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We contend that propofol as delivered by CLADS will proffer greater consistency to&#xD;
      anaesthesia depth, intra-operative hemodynamic stability, and rapid recovery upon anaesthesia&#xD;
      discontinuation than manual means of delivering propofol TIVA. This randomised controlled&#xD;
      study aims to compare the efficiency of CLADS-driven propofol TIVA versus manually controlled&#xD;
      propofol TIVA in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After Ethics Committee approval and written informed consent, thirty-participants (30 per&#xD;
      group) aged 18-65 years, ASA physical status I-III, of either sex, and undergoing unilateral&#xD;
      open thoracic surgery or unilateral video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) will be included&#xD;
      in this single centre (Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi-110060, India) prospective,&#xD;
      single-blinded, two-arm, randomised controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who qualify inclusion criteria and consent for recruitment will be randomly&#xD;
      divided into one of the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group-1 [CLADS Group, n=15, Study group]: Anaesthesia will be induced and maintained with&#xD;
      propofol administered using the automated CLADS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group-2 [Manual Group, n=15, Control group]: Anaesthesia will be induced and maintained with&#xD;
      propofol administered using manually controlled infusion pumps titrated to BIS scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample-size Estimation In a previous multi-centre study, the percentage of time the BIS was&#xD;
      within 10 percentage of the target BIS was 81.4 percent in the CLADS group versus 55.34&#xD;
      percent in the manual group. Based on the above, to detect 20 percent difference in the two&#xD;
      groups, a sample size of 12 patients per group to provide 90 percent power with a bilateral&#xD;
      alpha risk value of 0.05 will be required. We plan to recruit a total of 30 patients to cover&#xD;
      up for unanticipated losses after the recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation, Allocation Concealment The patients will be randomly allocated to one of the&#xD;
      two groups based on a computer-generated random number table. Randomisation sequence&#xD;
      concealment will include opaque-sealed envelopes with alphabetic codes whose distribution&#xD;
      will be in control of an independent analyst. The envelopes will be opened; patient's&#xD;
      data-slip will be pasted on them, and will be sent back to the control analyst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Strategy Inside the OR, the attending anaesthesiologist will not be blinded to the&#xD;
      technique utilised to administer GA and the recovery parameters immediately after extubation.&#xD;
      However, the postoperative patient recovery profile will be evaluated by an independent&#xD;
      assessor blinded to the GA technique and periextubation profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of Anesthesia Two peripheral venous lines (18G/20G catheter) will be secured.&#xD;
      Invasive vascular access (arterial line for direct continuous blood pressure assessment,&#xD;
      central venous catheter) will be secured as per the requirement of surgery. Standard&#xD;
      monitoring (EKG, NIBP, pulse oximeter, EtCO2) will be applied. A BIS sensor (Covidien IIc,&#xD;
      Mansfield, USA) will be applied over the patient's forehead according to manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions (Model DSC-XP, Aspect medical system, USA) prior to induction of anaesthesia for&#xD;
      continuous monitoring of depth-of-anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia Technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will receive pre-induction fentanyl-citrate 2 mcg/kg and anesthesia will be&#xD;
      induced with propofol. In the CLADS group, propofol administration rate will be controlled by&#xD;
      a feedback loop facilitated by BIS monitoring. A BIS value of 50 will be used as the target&#xD;
      point for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. The Manual group would comprise manual&#xD;
      propofol administration by an intravenous infusion pump to maintain a target BIS of 50 during&#xD;
      induction and maintenance of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction of anesthesia, atracurium besylate 0.05mg/kg will be given to facilitate&#xD;
      tracheal intubation. In order to facilitate one lung ventilation (OLV) patients trachea will&#xD;
      be intubated using appropriate-sized double-lumen tube in all the patients. Oxygen-air&#xD;
      mixture (FiO2 0.50) will be used for intraoperative ventilation in both the groups. In&#xD;
      addition, starting the period after tracheal intubation, all the patients will receive 1&#xD;
      mcg/kg/hr fentanyl infusion for intraoperative analgesia. Intraoperative muscle relaxation&#xD;
      will be maintained using atracurium infusion controlled by train-of-four response on&#xD;
      peripheral neuromuscular monitor (Infinity TridentNMT Smartpod, Draeger Medical Systems, Inc&#xD;
      Telford, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients undergoing open thoracic surgery, a thoracic epidural catheter will be placed&#xD;
      in the indicated intervertebral space for facilitating postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty minutes before the end of surgery, non-opioid analgesics, such as paracetamol 1-gm,&#xD;
      tramadol 100 mg and/or diclofenac 75 mg will be administered to all the patients. Propofol&#xD;
      delivery will be stopped at the point of completion of skin closure. Residual neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade (assessed with train-of-four response) will be reversed with neostigmine (50 µg/kg)&#xD;
      and glycopyrrolate (20 µg/kg). Tracheal extubation will be undertaken if planned&#xD;
      post-extubation ventilation is not instituted and the patients are wide awake and obeying&#xD;
      commands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Parameters Intraoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adequacy of anaesthesia depth will be determined by the percentage of the valid CLADS&#xD;
           time during which the BIS remained within 10% of the target BIS (50), median absolute&#xD;
           performance error (MDAPE), wobble and global score (Varvel criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Haemodynamic parameters such a heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure will be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Early recovery from anaesthesia profile which includes time to eye opening and time to&#xD;
           extubation after discontinuation of anesthesia will be noted&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sedation will be assessed using Modified Observer's assessment of alertness/sedation&#xD;
           scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incidence of awareness will be determined using Modified Brice Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discontinuation of anaesthesia delivery (0-time point) the time to eye opening and time&#xD;
      to extubation will be determined. After tracheal extubation, the patients will be shifted to&#xD;
      postoperative recovery room adjoining OT suites and will be closely observed for oxygenation&#xD;
      and ventilation status, pain (numeric rating score) and sedation. Patients with epidural&#xD;
      catheter in-situ will be started with PCEA pump for pain relief. Patients will be analysed&#xD;
      for intra-operative awareness using Modified Brice Questionnaire (24 hours, 48 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively).&#xD;
