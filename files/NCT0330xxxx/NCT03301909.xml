  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility, prospective, single center, open label, uncontrolled clinical study,&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of the different R&amp;D changes made and&#xD;
      implemented in the existing PillCam Capsule products family, PillCam Endoscopy System&#xD;
      subunits, the Patency system and bowel preparation procedure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a screening - enrollment phase, a possible preparation phase followed&#xD;
      by the PillCam Endoscopy or Patency procedure visit and a post procedure telephone, follow up&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be assigned to any of the sub-assays done within this study as long as they&#xD;
      fulfill all the inclusion and exclusion criteria and depends on their availability and their&#xD;
      willingness to participate in a specific sub-assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject may participate in up to 15 sub-assays during his/her participation in the&#xD;
      study, each ingestion will be separated in between by at least two weeks interval. A&#xD;
      following capsule may be ingested only upon verification of previous capsule excretion.&#xD;
      Subjects can participate in a specific sub-assay only once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, under the study protocol, per a single procedure, each subject will undergo a&#xD;
      possible preparation phase followed by the PillCam endoscopy or Patency procedure and&#xD;
      telephone follow up visit. Overall the expected duration for subject's participation in the&#xD;
      study is expected to be up to 10 years, until subject will complete participation in up to 15&#xD;
      sub-assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject may withdraw consent at any time and will be considered as completed once completed&#xD;
      at least one capsule ingestion (PillCam or Patency) or completed one of the possible&#xD;
      procedures which are not involving capsule ingestion during the study period.&#xD;

    <description>A PillCam procedure will be assessed for raw data generation in the data recorder (similar to standard of care procedure), by confirming presence of the procedure output files (technical outcome). A nominal scale of Yes/No will be used to determine whether the raw data has been generated by the data recorder or not.</description>
