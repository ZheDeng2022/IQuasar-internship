    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Headache-related efficacy endpoints were derived from headache variables collected using an eDiary. On each day, the subjects were asked to enter headache data in the electronic headache diary for the previous 24-hour period.&#xD;
Subjects who reported headache on the previous day answered questions about the headache (ie, occurrence of headache, duration of headache, maximum severity of headache, presence/absence of associated symptoms, and use of acute headache medications).&#xD;
Overall headache duration was recorded numerically, in hours, as well as number of hours with headache of at least moderate severity.&#xD;
If headache was reported, then headache severity was subjectively rated by the subject as follows: Mild headache, Moderate headache, Severe headache. Subjects also recorded the presence or absence of photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, or vomiting, and the status of use of any acute headache medications.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Disability Score, as Measured by Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) Questionnaire at 4 Weeks After the Final (Third) Dose of IMP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Using the MIDAS questionnaire, subjects assessed the degree of headache-related disability based on lost days of activity in 3 domains (work, household work, and nonwork) over the last 3 months. The MIDAS questionnaire was a 5-item instrument. The total of the scores of the first 5 questions was used for grading the level of disability, with scores of 0 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 20, and ≥ 21 interpreted as disability grades I (little or no disability), II (mild disability), III (moderate disability), and IV (severe disability), respectively.</description>

        <description>Headache-related efficacy endpoints were derived from headache variables collected using an eDiary. On each day, the subjects were asked to enter headache data in the electronic headache diary for the previous 24-hour period.&#xD;
Subjects who reported headache on the previous day answered questions about the headache (ie, occurrence of headache, duration of headache, maximum severity of headache, presence/absence of associated symptoms, and use of acute headache medications).&#xD;
Overall headache duration was recorded numerically, in hours, as well as number of hours with headache of at least moderate severity.&#xD;
If headache was reported, then headache severity was subjectively rated by the subject as follows: Mild headache, Moderate headache, Severe headache. Subjects also recorded the presence or absence of photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, or vomiting, and the status of use of any acute headache medications.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Disability Score, as Measured by Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) Questionnaire at 4 Weeks After the Final (Third) Dose of IMP</title>
        <description>Using the MIDAS questionnaire, subjects assessed the degree of headache-related disability based on lost days of activity in 3 domains (work, household work, and nonwork) over the last 3 months. The MIDAS questionnaire was a 5-item instrument. The total of the scores of the first 5 questions was used for grading the level of disability, with scores of 0 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 20, and ≥ 21 interpreted as disability grades I (little or no disability), II (mild disability), III (moderate disability), and IV (severe disability), respectively.</description>
