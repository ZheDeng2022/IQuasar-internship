  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following endoscopic therapy of variceal bleeding, the issue of when to refeed these patients&#xD;
      has rarely been investigated. This may imply that feeding is generally regarded as a&#xD;
      negligible factor in the management of bleeding varices. On the other hand, it is usually&#xD;
      believed that systematic fasting is required in case of patients with upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some researchers in their studies demonstrated that immediate refeeding has similar outcomes&#xD;
      to delayed refeeding among patients with low risk of nonvariceal bleeding. The situation of&#xD;
      variceal bleeding is quite different from that of peptic ulcer bleeding as demonstrated by&#xD;
      studies of other researchers who made a review on feeding of patients with upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding, and recommended that feeding should be delayed for at least 48&#xD;
      hours after endoscopic therapy because early refeeding may cause a shift in blood flow to the&#xD;
      splanchnic circulation, which in turn could lead to an increase in pressure and an increased&#xD;
      risk of rebleeding from the varices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other important reason of delay in feeding may be ascribed to the fear of occurrence of&#xD;
      early rebleeding induced by refeeding. In addition, repeated endoscopic examination and&#xD;
      therapy may be required in patients with very early rebleeding. The decision to delay feeding&#xD;
      is usually based on clinicians 'experience or experts' opinion rather than evidence based.&#xD;
      That is why we planned this study.&#xD;

      There has not been much studies conducted to address this issue however most of the&#xD;
      recommendations are made in view of preventing any complications following procedures.&#xD;
      Stiegmann and Goff 4 were the first to employ EVL to treat esophageal varices. They did not&#xD;
      mention any specific restriction of feeding on patients receiving band ligation however they&#xD;
      did mentioned that following the band ligation of varices, the ligated varices and tissues&#xD;
      may evoke transient dysphagia to solid food.5 A study conducted by Gin Ho Lo et al 6&#xD;
      demonstrated that early feeding with a liquid diet in conscious patients after successful&#xD;
      endoscopic therapy of varices can shorten the hospital stay. The two groups which were&#xD;
      created in this study were the early-feeding group and the delayed-feeding group. Patients in&#xD;
      the early-feeding group were asked to fast for only 4 hours following endoscopic treatment.&#xD;
      Subsequently, a liquid diet (fruit juice, soybean juice, milk, rice in liquid form) was&#xD;
      instituted for 3 days. Additionally, &lt;500 cc intravenous fluid with proper electrolyte&#xD;
      supplement per day was administered. Thereafter, a soft diet was provided for 3 days, after&#xD;
      which a regular diet was resumed since the seventh day after endoscopic treatment. Patients&#xD;
      in the delayed-feeding group were asked to absolutely fast for 48 hours after endoscopic&#xD;
      treatment, and 1500 cc/day intravenous fluids (normal saline or glucose water) with proper&#xD;
      electrolytes were administered for 2 days. After 2 days of fasting, a liquid diet was given&#xD;
      for 1 day, and subsequently, a soft diet was given for 3 days, and then a regular diet was&#xD;
      instituted on the seventh day after endoscopic treatment. If rebleeding occurred within 7&#xD;
      days of endoscopic therapy, patients in both groups were again asked to fast for 48 hours,&#xD;
      and then put on a liquid diet for 1 day followed by a soft diet for 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment failure was defined as failure to control acute bleeding episodes or very early&#xD;
      rebleeding or death within 5 days. Failure to control acute variceal bleeding was defined as&#xD;
      the occurrence of any of the following events within 48 hours of enrollment, based on the&#xD;
      modified criteria of the Baveno III consensus:7 (1) fresh hematemesis after enrollment; (2)&#xD;
      sudden onset of reduction in blood pressure of _20 mmHg and/or an increase in pulse rate of&#xD;
      20 beats/minute with 2 g drop in hemoglobin; (3) transfusion of four units of blood required&#xD;
      to increase the hematocrit to above 27% or hemoglobin to above 9 g/dL; and (4) death. Very&#xD;
      early rebleeding was defined as when the criteria for failure to control acute variceal&#xD;
      bleeding occurred between 48 hours and 120 hours after enrollment in patients achieving&#xD;
      control of acute bleeding. Control of acute bleeding (initial hemostasis) was defined as when&#xD;
      the criteria for failure did not occur within 48 hours of enrollment. A 5-day hemostasis was&#xD;
      defined as when the criteria for failure to control acute variceal bleeding and very early&#xD;
      rebleeding did not occur within 5 days of enrollment. A nasogastric tube was not routinely&#xD;
      inserted after initial endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rebleeding rates associated with EVL varied greatly between studies, and rates ranging&#xD;
      from 2% to 54% have been recorded.8,9 Aside from other reasons, this discrepancy is very&#xD;
      likely to be related to the variation in timing of refeeding after EVL. However, this factor&#xD;
      was rarely mentioned in the methodology of these studies A review article by Xavier&#xD;
      HeÂ´buterne 10 concluded that In patients hospitalized for acute upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding due to an ulcer with high risk of rebleeding (Forrest I-IIb) or with variceal&#xD;
      bleeding it is recommended to wait at least 48 h after endoscopic therapy before initiating&#xD;
      oral or enteral feeding. In case of ulcer with low risk of rebleeding (Forrest IIc and III)&#xD;
      or in patients with gastritis, Mallory-Weiss, oesophagitis, or angiodysplasia, there is no&#xD;
      need to delay refeeding, and they can be fed as soon as tolerated. Understanding the cause of&#xD;
      the diagnosis is always necessary to adapt nutrition in patients with upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
