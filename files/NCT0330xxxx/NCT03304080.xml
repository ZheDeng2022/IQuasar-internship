  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, phase I/II trial of anastrozole, palbociclib, trastuzumab, and&#xD;
      pertuzumab is proposed as first-line therapy in metastatic hormone receptor-positive,&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast cancer patients. In this phase I/II clinical trial, the researchers aim&#xD;
      to establish the safety and efficacy of dual HER2 therapy in combination with palbociclib and&#xD;
      anastrozole, which represents a novel and all biologic approach to the treatment of HR+,&#xD;
      HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. Additionally, the researchers aim to examine potential&#xD;
      biomarkers of response to palbociclib including cyclin D1, cyclin E1 and cyclin E2 expression&#xD;
      levels, CDK 2, 4, and 6 levels, phosphorylated retinoblastoma expression and p16 levels. The&#xD;
      researchers intend to use RNA sequencing to assess for other predictors of response in an&#xD;
      unbiased manner to see if this correlates with inhibition of Ki-67 and phosphorylated&#xD;
      retinoblastoma expression as well as evaluate for potential mechanisms of resistance.&#xD;

    <measure>Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for palbociclib when administered in combination with anastrozole, trastuzumab and pertuzumab. A DLT will be defined as:&#xD;
Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity&#xD;
Grade 3 neutropenia lasting greater than 21 days&#xD;
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with neutropenic fever or&#xD;
Grade 4 hematologic toxicity events experienced within the first 4 weeks (1 cycle) of study treatment. These will be assessed via the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI's CTCAE) v4.0 toxicity criteria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for palbociclib when administered in combination with anastrozole, trastuzumab and pertuzumab. If &gt; 33 % of patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at any dose level, the dose level below that level will be considered the MTD. Or if the highest level has been reached and ≤ 33% of patients have experienced dose limiting toxicity (DLT), that will be considered the MTD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</measure>
