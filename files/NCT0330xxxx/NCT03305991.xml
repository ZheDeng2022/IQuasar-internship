  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women living in low-income countries are at elevated risk of death in connection to&#xD;
      pregnancy, as well as infants born to women in such settings. It is probable that several&#xD;
      factors are involved, such as poverty, lack of education and access to healthcare. Infectious&#xD;
      diseases constitute important threats to maternal health in resource-limited settings.&#xD;
      Tuberculosis (TB) is reported to be the third leading cause of maternal death globally.&#xD;
      Furthermore, TB can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, with high risk of&#xD;
      severe consequences for the infant. Despite these data, neither the role of TB in relation to&#xD;
      co-existing risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, nor the mechanisms involved, are&#xD;
      well understood. It is likely that TB interacts with other characteristics, in particular&#xD;
      socio-economic condition and HIV infection, which could obscure associations between TB and&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes. For this reason, it is critical to design studies so that the independent&#xD;
      role of TB can be deduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to investigate how TB infection in women affects the risk of adverse&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes in relation to co-existing factors, and how exposure to TB infection may&#xD;
      impact growth and development of infants born to women with TB. In addition, mechanisms in&#xD;
      which TB and the immune system during pregnancy will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is conducted at public health facilities in Ethiopia, where 2 000 women will be&#xD;
      recruited during antenatal care. These women will be followed until 4 years after delivery,&#xD;
      along with their offspring born during the study period. Detailed data is collected at&#xD;
      inclusion and at study visits during follow-up, with submission of samples for TB testing and&#xD;
      immunological analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better knowledge on the characteristics of TB infection in association with pregnancy, and&#xD;
      how TB affects maternal and child health, can be used to construct new guidelines for&#xD;
      management of TB in women of fertile age. This may contribute to reductions in adverse&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes, including maternal and infant deaths.&#xD;

      Objective The overall objective of this project is to investigate longitudinal patterns and&#xD;
      consequences of tuberculosis (TB) infection in a prospective cohort of women recruited during&#xD;
      pregnancy. The relation between maternal TB infection and pregnancy outcomes, as well as&#xD;
      infant health and development, will be evaluated over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether maternal TB infection is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the excess risk of incident active TB during pregnancy and post-partum,&#xD;
           with regard to the prevalence of latent TB infection at registration in antenatal care&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate long-term health and survival in infants in relation to maternal TB and&#xD;
           adverse pregnancy outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study setting and participants This project will be conducted in public health&#xD;
      facilities in the city of Adama, Central Ethiopia. Participants will be recruited and&#xD;
      followed at antenatal care (ANC) clinics until delivery. After delivery their children will&#xD;
      be followed at clinics for extended program for immunization (EPI); continued follow-up of&#xD;
      the mothers after the first post-natal visit will also take place in these clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study procedures, including interviews, physical examination, and collection of informed&#xD;
      consent, will be performed by regular health facility staff (nurses and midwives) in the&#xD;
      respective clinics. Biological samples including blood and sputum will be collected at the&#xD;
      respective health facility laboratory. Study samples will be transported to the Adama&#xD;
      Regional Laboratory. At this laboratory, additional analyses and storage of plasma will be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For supervision and monitoring of data collection, as well as for data entry, the project&#xD;
      will use staff and infrastructure in a field research station which has been established in&#xD;
      Adama since 2010 by the research group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure Both scheduled and unscheduled study visits can occur for participants in&#xD;
      this project. Scheduled study visits coincide with routine antenatal and postnatal visits and&#xD;
      visits at the EPI clinics for the infant's immunization following National guidelines.&#xD;
      Unscheduled visits will occur in case of symptoms suggestive of active TB (according to the&#xD;
      study definitions) in the pregnant/postnatal/non-pregnant woman, or in the child, at any time&#xD;
      in between these routine visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antenatal care visits At inclusion, structured information on socio-demographic conditions,&#xD;
      education, occupation, and poverty indicators will be collected; as well as medical history&#xD;
      (in particular for obstetric, gynecological and TB-related details). Physical and obstetric&#xD;
      examination will be performed. Apart from the study procedures and investigations,&#xD;
      participants will receive care according to current Ethiopian ANC guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the inclusion visit blood and urine samples will be obtained for routine care and for&#xD;
      study specific investigations from all participants. At the health facility laboratory, the&#xD;
      following analyses will be performed: HIV rapid test, malaria microscopy and urine dipstick.&#xD;
      Ten mL of venous blood will be collected. This sample will be used for analysis of complete&#xD;
      blood count, blood/Rh group, syphilis serology, creatinine and fasting glucose. The remaining&#xD;
      plasma will be aliquoted and stored at -80Â° C for research analyses that will be performed at&#xD;
      the completion of inclusion. Blood will be collected separately for QuantiFERON TB Plus (QFT)&#xD;
      testing, in order to determine the prevalence of LTBI. For the last 500 women included in the&#xD;
      study, QFT testing will be repeated at the 3rd antenatal care visit. From HIV positive women&#xD;
      blood for viral load and CD4 count will be drawn at each scheduled visit pre- and&#xD;
      post-delivery except from 2nd and 3rd antenatal care visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed up four times in accordance with WHO recommended focused&#xD;
      antenatal visits until delivery or term of pregnancy. They will also be instructed to contact&#xD;
      the study clinic in between these visits in case of health-related events. In case of&#xD;
      delivery (or other unintended termination of pregnancy) in another place than any of the&#xD;
      study health facilities, they will be asked to communicate this to their study site for&#xD;
      further follow-up examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants with suspected active TB according to the study definition (irrespective of&#xD;
      Quantiferon results) at enrolment and/or during follow up will be asked to submit samples for&#xD;
      bacteriological TB investigations. These will encompass liquid culture, smear microscopy and&#xD;
      PCR (using Xpert MTB/RIF technique). All these tests will be performed on two consecutive&#xD;
      morning sputum samples. Lymph node aspirates will be obtained from participants with enlarged&#xD;
      peripheral lymph nodes. Moreover, acquisition of blood for QuantiFERON testing will be&#xD;
      repeated for all women investigated for suspected active TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stored aliquots of plasma will be analyzed at the end of inclusion for potential blood&#xD;
      biomarkers of TB infection during pregnancy. These analyses will be performed using ELISA&#xD;
      and/or Luminex technique, and they will include the following markers of immune activation&#xD;
      and inflammation: C-reactive protein (CRP), neopterin, soluble urokinase-plasminogen&#xD;
      activator receptor (suPAR), interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postpartum follow-up visits for women Further follow-up visits for women will be scheduled&#xD;
      for 6 weeks and 9 months after delivery or termination of pregnancy, coinciding with the&#xD;
      routine child visits for immunization. The first postnatal visit will take place at the ANC&#xD;
      clinic, whereas all subsequent visits will take place at the respective EPI clinics (where&#xD;
      infant follow-up will also occur). At the 6 week postnatal visit details on delivery outcome&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For investigation of long-term health effects after delivery, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      come for further annual visits with similar assessments until 54 months after termination of&#xD;
      pregnancy. At all follow-up visits symptoms and signs on physical examination will be&#xD;
      recorded using structured questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At inclusion, and repeatedly on scheduled follow-up visits, participants will be informed&#xD;
      about symptoms and signs that may indicate active TB. Study subjects will be instructed to&#xD;
      contact the study site clinic (ANC during antenatal period, EPI during postnatal period)&#xD;
      directly if they develop such symptoms for unscheduled study visits (in order to assess&#xD;
      incident active TB during follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all visits, whether scheduled or unscheduled, bacteriological testing (smear microscopy,&#xD;
      Xpert MTB/RIF assay, and liquid culture) will be performed according to the study protocol in&#xD;
      case study criteria for suspected active TB are met. These tests will be performed on two&#xD;
      morning sputum samples for women; in addition, lymph node aspirates may be sent for TB&#xD;
      analysis in case of suspected lymphadenitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case study participants do not come for their scheduled study visits they will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone by the study site staff and/or the research study team. If the participant&#xD;
      cannot be reached, her contact person will be contacted by phone. At mid-time in between the&#xD;
      scheduled visits, women will be contacted by phone by a member of the local research team to&#xD;
      assess whether any health events or symptoms compatible with TB have occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated sampling for QFT testing will occur for all women at 4 years after inclusion&#xD;
      (irrespective of previous QFT results), with storage of incubated plasma for further analysis&#xD;
      of immune markers of TB infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits for infants If consent has been provided by the mother, infants will be&#xD;
      registered and included in a separate infant follow-up cohort as soon as possible after&#xD;
      birth. Birth details, including delivery method, weight, length, APGAR score, and head&#xD;
      circumference will be registered at inclusion of the infant. Follow-up of included infants&#xD;
      will take place in the EPI clinic at the respective study health facilities. Follow-up visits&#xD;
      will be scheduled at the same time interval as the mother, i.e. at 6 weeks and 9 months and&#xD;
      subsequently at annual intervals congruent with the mothers until four and a half year after&#xD;
      birth. The two first visits coincide with routine immunization visits. On all study visits,&#xD;
      parameters of growth, nutritional and neurological development will be recorded using&#xD;
      structured questionnaires. In addition, data on socio-demographic characteristics,&#xD;
      health-related events and feeding details will be recorded, as well as data on known or&#xD;
      suspected exposure to TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At inclusion, and repeatedly on scheduled follow-up visits, caretakers will be informed about&#xD;
      symptoms and signs that may indicate active pediatric TB. Study infant caretakers will be&#xD;
      instructed to contact the study site EPI clinic directly if the infants develop such symptoms&#xD;
      for unscheduled study visits (in order to assess incident active TB during follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If criteria for suspected TB are met at any time during follow-up bacteriological&#xD;
      investigations (liquid culture, PCR and microscopy) will be performed on gastric lavage&#xD;
      specimens (or cerebrospinal fluid in case of suspected meningitis; or fine-needle lymph node&#xD;
      aspirates in case of peripheral lymphadenopathy). These investigations will be performed by&#xD;
      trained health care staff at the Department of Pediatrics, Adama Regional Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stored aliquots of plasma will be analyzed at the end of inclusion for potential blood&#xD;
      biomarkers of TB in young children. These analyses will be performed using ELISA and Luminex&#xD;
      technique, and they will include the following markers of immune activation and inflammation:&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP), neopterin, soluble urokinase-plasminogen activator receptor&#xD;
      (suPAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case infant participants do not come for their scheduled study visits their caretakers&#xD;
      will be contacted by phone by the study site staff and/or the research study team. If the&#xD;
      caretaker cannot be reached, the contact person will be contacted by phone. At mid-time in&#xD;
      between the scheduled visits, caretakers will be contacted by phone from a study investigator&#xD;
      to assess whether any health events or symptoms compatible with TB have occurred in the&#xD;
      infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
