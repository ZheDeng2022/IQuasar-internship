  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research of fecal microflora and dysbiosis status in ulcerative colitis (UC) has shown its&#xD;
      influential role on the disease pathogenesis. Vedolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      blocking the migration of leukocytes into inflamed intestinal tissue, has been shown to&#xD;
      achieve remission in about half of active UC patients. Dietary intervention in UC patients&#xD;
      has not been adequately studied. There is a significant clinical gap to achieve a higher&#xD;
      efficacy and better clinical outcomes on the treatment of active UC patients. This study&#xD;
      proposes to assess the integrated effect of normalization of intestinal dysbiosis through a&#xD;
      structured semi-vegetarian dietary intervention in active UC patients who will also be under&#xD;
      the standard of care medical therapy (vedolizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of investigation for innovation: The pathogenesis of UC has been found to be&#xD;
      multi-factorial, including host genetics and dysregulated inflammatory response, and recent&#xD;
      research has shown the influential role of gut environmental factors - dysbiosis which has&#xD;
      been found the key feature of UC. Vedolizumab has been shown effective (e.g. 47% clinical&#xD;
      response rate vs. 25% in placebo group) and is part of the current standard of care treatment&#xD;
      in UC. With the observation of drastic increase of IBD patients in Asia, in which has&#xD;
      historically low incidence of IBD, it is generally accepted that the westernized diet and&#xD;
      urbanization of life style play an important role in IBD pathogenesis. Enteral nutritional&#xD;
      therapy has been demonstrated effective in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) patients; however,&#xD;
      the application to adult IBD patients has not been widely accepted partly because of the&#xD;
      compliance issue. In addition, unlike CD, neither enteral nutrition nor non-enteral nutrition&#xD;
      in patients with active UC has been adequately studied. Therefore, this study proposes a&#xD;
      novel approach to assess the integrated effect of a structured dietary intervention in active&#xD;
      UC patients who will also be under the current standard of care medical therapy&#xD;
      (vedolizumab). After this study achieves the proposed primary or secondary outcome, it will&#xD;
      further support the hypothesized synergistic interactive therapeutic effect between the&#xD;
      normalization of dysbiosis in the intestine (through dietary intervention) and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory biologics (vedolizumab).&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be investigated: the integrated treatment effect of controlling inflammatory&#xD;
      process through vedolizumab in active UC patients can be synergistically enhanced with a&#xD;
      structured semi-vegetarian dietary intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research of fecal microflora in UC has shown its influential role on the disease&#xD;
      pathogenesis. In UC patients, the adaptive immune system is dysregulated and hyper-reactive&#xD;
      to the commensal intestinal microﬂora in susceptible individuals and the diversity of&#xD;
      intestinal ﬂora decreases, called dysbiosis, by 30% to 50%. For the treatment of moderate to&#xD;
      severe UC, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, although efficacious but predispose&#xD;
      patients to serious infection. Vedolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically&#xD;
      recognizes the α4β7 heterodimer, selectively blocking the migration of leukocytes into&#xD;
      inflamed intestinal tissue, has been shown to achieve clinical response and clinical&#xD;
      remission in patients with moderate to severely active UC (clinical response 47% vs. 25%&#xD;
      (placebo) at week 6 and clinical remission 42% vs. 16% (placebo) at week 52) in patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severely active UC. In epidemiological study, western diet characterized with&#xD;
      high in animal fat and low in fruits and vegetables has been found associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of IBD. In murine models, diets high saturated animal fats has been shown to&#xD;
      be associated with dysbiosis, increased intestinal permeability, decreased mucus layer, and&#xD;
      increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additive in processed food, such as&#xD;
      emulsifiers, has been recently found with impact on the mouse gut microbiota promoting&#xD;
      colitis and metabolic syndrome. Enteral nutritional therapy has been demonstrated effective&#xD;
      in pediatric IBD patients; however, the application to adult IBD patients has not been widely&#xD;
      accepted partly because of compliance and adherence to the diet. Recently, non-enteral&#xD;
      dietary interventions, such as semi-vegetarian diet, specific carbohydrate diet, and IBD&#xD;
      exclusion diet, have gained attention based on small non-randomized trials. In a small&#xD;
      prospective clinical trial in CD patients, semi-vegetarian diet was well tolerated and 93%&#xD;
      (16 out of 17) of patients remained in clinical remission, compared with 33% (2 out of 6&#xD;
      patients) in an omnivorous diet group, at 2 years. A well-designed randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      using a structured dietary intervention, which integrates the merits of previously proposed&#xD;
      diets, is warranted, especially in conjunction with the current standard of care (e.g.&#xD;
      vedolizumab) and the novel normalization of dysbiosis through structured semi-vegetarian&#xD;
      dietary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design or Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot study of evaluating the synergistic effect of vedolizumab in&#xD;
      conjunction with structured semi-vegetarian dietary intervention on the treatment of active&#xD;
      UC patients who will be under the treatment of Vedolizumab. Subjects will be screened at&#xD;
      outpatient clinic visit appointments and interested, qualified subjects will be consented and&#xD;
      offered participation in this trial. Once consent has been obtained, baseline values will be&#xD;
      established and subjects will begin treatment. A final visit for evaluation and collection of&#xD;
      lab samples will be conducted at the end of the study at week 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigative Agent: vedolizumab in conjunction with semi-vegetarian dietary intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single interventional group: vedolizumab (300mg) IV infusions at week 0, 2, 6, 14 (as current&#xD;
      standard of care) and concurrently on structured semi-vegetarian diet Duration of Therapy: 14&#xD;
      weeks; Duration of time on study: 14 weeks Structured semi-vegetarian dietary intervention&#xD;
      (see supplementary material): Eligible study subjects will be counseled with a registered&#xD;
      dietician and complete a Food Frequency Questionnaire to record and monitor the dietary&#xD;
      pattern that the patient has at different time points, including prior to UC flare, current&#xD;
      diet, diet during and after study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be on a structured semi-vegetarian diet described below: (Specific recipes&#xD;
      and food preparation will be provided during the counselling session with a dietician).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gradually increase calories, up to 25-30 kcals/kg/day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gradually add fiber (ex. white rice 2-5 days, then mixed rice 70% white to 30% brown&#xD;
           rice) in an instructed regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily vegetables, fruits, legumes, potatoes, probiotic food (miso, pickled vegetables),&#xD;
           plain yogurt&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Encourage no smoking, regular physical exercise, moderate to no use of alcohol,&#xD;
           regularity of meals, no snacking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Foods to strictly limit/avoid: bread, cheese, margarine, fast foods, carbonated&#xD;
           beverages, highly processed foods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diet excludes completely: Animal fat and Trans saturated fats, red meat and processed&#xD;
           meat, sugar, emulsifiers (CMC, PS-80)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is a pilot study, no formal study power and sample size calculation is needed. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to recruit 10 study subjects for the single interventional group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome: Clinical response at week 6 (which is defined as ≥3 improvement in Mayo&#xD;
      score (see page 4 for reference table), and a decrease of at least 30% from the baseline&#xD;
      score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome: Clinical response at week 14(which is defined as ≥3 improvement in&#xD;
      Mayo score (see page 4 for reference table), and a decrease of at least 30% from the baseline&#xD;
      score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also collect stool samples before (week -1) and after (week 14) the&#xD;
      dietary interventions for microbiome study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate descriptive statistics and frequency distributions will be calculated, as&#xD;
      appropriate for all variables including the primary and secondary outcomes. Baseline values&#xD;
      for demographic, clinical, and outcome variables (primary and secondary) will be tabulated&#xD;
      for the single interventional group. Primary outcome (clinical response rate at week 6) of&#xD;
      this pilot study result will be non-analytically compared to the previously reported 47.1%&#xD;
      from the previous clinical trial of vedolizumab alone in moderately to severe UC patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility and Time Frame:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study and 10 study subjects will be enrolled by the end of 2017. Based on the&#xD;
      current volume of eligible patients at the institution, it will be expected to complete the&#xD;
      recruitment in 3 to 4 months. The completion of this study is estimated to be within 4&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
