      Osteoporosis (op) is a disorder of bone characterized by reduced mineral density and bone&#xD;
      mass. The first step in the prevention and treatment of Op is ensuring adequate intake of&#xD;
      calcium and vitamin D . While calcium supplementations clearly slow bone loss in both&#xD;

      randomized, placebo controlled trial in 1471 postmenopausal women (mean age 74) reported in&#xD;
      the BMJ (2 February 2008) found an increased rate of vascular events in healthy older women&#xD;
      receiving calcium supplementation. The mechanism is not clear .we are trying to identify a&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Osteoporosis (op) is a disorder of bone characterized by reduced mineral density and&#xD;
           bone mass. The first step in the prevention and treatment of Op is ensuring adequate&#xD;
           intake of calcium and vitamin D . While calcium supplementations clearly slow bone loss&#xD;
           in both sexes,(1,2) their effects on fracture risk are less certain.(3,4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Experimental data suggest that . vitamin D 25 affects cardiac muscle directly; controls&#xD;
           PTH secretion, regulates the rennin-angiotensin - aldosterone system, and modulates the&#xD;
           immune system.(5) Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with hypertension; several&#xD;
           types of vascular disease and heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evidence suggests that high calcium intake might protect against vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that calcium intake might impact on serum lipid concentrations.(6) There is&#xD;
      also evidence that calcium supplementation reduces blood pressure,(7) and that CV mortality&#xD;
      is lower in hard water areas.(8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to the above a recent randomized, placebo controlled trial in 1471 postmenopausal&#xD;
      women (mean age 74) reported in the BMJ (2 February 2008) found an increased rate of vascular&#xD;
      events in healthy older women receiving calcium supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures were assesed over 5 years and included death, myocardial infarction, ,&#xD;
      stroke, transient ischaemic attack and development of angina pectoris.A composite end point&#xD;
      of major adverse events (MACE= major advrse cardiac events) included myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      stroke, or sudden death. MACE was also more common in the calcium group (101 events in 69&#xD;
      women v 54 events in 42 women, P=0.008). Adjudicated myocardial infarction was more common in&#xD;
      the calcium group (24 events in 21 women v 10 events in 10 women, relative risk 2.12, 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval 1.01 to 4.47).For stroke the relative risk was 1.37 (0.83 to 2.28) and&#xD;
      the rate ratio was 1.45 (0.88 to 2.49). The authors concluded that calcium supplementation in&#xD;
      healthy postmenopausal women is associated with upward trends in cardiovascular event rates&#xD;
      and that this potentially detrimental effect should be balanced against the likely benefits&#xD;
      of calcium on bone. (9) Possible mechanisms: The finding of an adverse trend in vascular&#xD;
      events with calcium supplementation is not necessarily surprising, since calcium supplements&#xD;
      acutely elevate serum calcium levels possibly accelerating vascular calcification, which is&#xD;
      predictive of vascular event rates. Multiple observational studies have shown that cardiac&#xD;
      event rate increases markedly over several years of follow-up with increasing levels of&#xD;
      CAC(Coronary artery calcium) independently of conventional risk factors. CAC scoring has been&#xD;
      advocated asa screening test for coronary disease risk in individuals at intermediate risk&#xD;
      for coronary events&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS of current study: To define the relationship between calcium in the diet and&#xD;
      supplementation to the level of TSH : PTH; vitamin D; creatinine in blood; calcium and&#xD;
      Phosphor in blood and urine and the calcium score in the coronary blood vessels .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective study One center study includes Carmel hospital ;Line clinic and Zvolon clinic.&#xD;
      Collaboration between the radiologic department in Carmel hospital and the endocrine&#xD;
      department in Line and Zolon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Includes 500 participants how recent or planned cardiac CT in the Carmel hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will sign an informed consent before the collection of blood tests for calcium,&#xD;
      phosphor, creatinin, vitamin D, and PTH , TSH, urine tests for calcium if they don't have a&#xD;
      recent tests(three month) in the OPHEQ .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire. -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent or planned coronary artery calcium scoring performed at Carmel Hospital With or&#xD;
      without simultaneously performed cardiac CT angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and Female. Aged 50-80 years. Hebrew speakers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Below age 50 years. Above age 80 years. Previous cardiac surgery . Inadequate cardiac CT&#xD;
      study&#xD;
&#xD;
      End point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlation between calcium score and the level of VIT D,PTH;TSH in the blood Calcium&#xD;
      phosphor in blood and urine and calcium in diet and supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard statistical analysis techniques SPSS 14 (T TEST, ANOVA, Spearman&amp;Pearson&#xD;
      correlation, will used in order to find the correlation between calcium score and blood&#xD;
      levels of the above.&#xD;
