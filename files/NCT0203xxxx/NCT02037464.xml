      The purpose of this study is to determine the chemopreventive properties of capsaicin, the&#xD;
      active compound in chili peppers, in prostate cancer patients enrolled in the active&#xD;
      surveillance program or patients scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy.&#xD;

      Rationale A large body of evidence supports the role of dietary factors in prostate cancer&#xD;
      development and progression. Most of this evidence suggests that diet high in fat including&#xD;
      red meat and low in micronutrients and other anti-oxidants, increases the risk of disease. We&#xD;
      are interested in the therapeutic potential of the dietary agent, capsaicin (CAP). Capsaicin&#xD;
      is the active compound in chili peppers, and related plants. Pre-clinical studies have found&#xD;
      that capsaicin has potent growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects. It is thought that&#xD;
      consumption of a capsaicin supplement may have a clinical benefit for subjects with localized&#xD;
      prostate cancer who have chosen to be managed by active surveillance or improve surgical&#xD;
      outcome of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective(s) Primary • To assess the effect of capsaicin daily therapy on the expression of&#xD;
      ki67 and p27 biomarkers in a post-treatment biopsy or prostate specimen from RP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of therapy with repeat oral dosing of capsaicin two times daily on&#xD;
           Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) kinetics in men on active surveillance for localized&#xD;
           prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of therapy with repeat oral dosing of capsaicin two times daily on&#xD;
           grade and the presence of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in a post-treatment&#xD;
           biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of therapy with repeat oral dosing of capsaicin two times daily on&#xD;
           the expression of markers of apoptosis, cell cycle, TRP-V1 and TRP-V6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of capsaicin therapy in men on active surveillance&#xD;
           (AS) for prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess alterations in prostate volume and time to recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint(s) Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Determine effect of capsaicin therapy on expression of ki67 and p27 biomarkers in a&#xD;
      post-treatment biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine effect of capsaicin daily therapy on PSA kinetics in men on active&#xD;
           surveillance for localized prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of capsaicin daily therapy on grade and the presence of prostatic&#xD;
           intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in post treatment biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of capsaicin therapy on the expression of markers of apoptosis,&#xD;
           cell cycle, TRP-V1 and TRP-V6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and Tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical laboratory evaluations (PSA, electrolytes, biochemistry, hematology,&#xD;
           cholesterol)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacodynamic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Levels of serum capsaicin (CAP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Levels of serum testosterone (T)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a phase II, open label, single centre study to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of repeat oral dosing of one CAP capsules twice times daily for 6 months prior to a&#xD;
      prostate biopsy in men on active surveillance for localized prostate cancer, as well as 6&#xD;
      weeks prior to radical prostatectomy (RP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population One hundred men men monitored (sixty from active surveillance (AS) and forty&#xD;
      patients scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy) will be eligible for participation.&#xD;
      Subjects must satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria. A sufficient number will be&#xD;
      enrolled to achieve at least 100 completed subjects&#xD;
