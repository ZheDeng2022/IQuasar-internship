      Background: Psychotherapy is an effective treatment for generalized anxiety disorder in&#xD;
      comparison to no-treatment controls. Instead of creating more and more new overall&#xD;
      treatment-packets within a medical meta-model, a complementary approach to investigate&#xD;
      clinical research designs may lie into the understanding of already effective&#xD;
      psychotherapies. Treatment manuals and protocols allow a relatively high degree of freedom of&#xD;
      therapists' behaviors on how to implement the overall treatment manuals. There is a lack of&#xD;
      systematical knowledge of how therapists have to customize these overall protocols. The&#xD;
      present design experimentally examines 3 types of conducting a 15 session time-limited&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol and its relation to the therapists' protocol&#xD;
      adherence and treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/design: This trial investigates 3 different types of how to customize a&#xD;
      well-introduced CBT-protocol using dyadic peer tutoring methodology (primings). The&#xD;
      individuals with GAD are randomly assigned to 3 priming conditions (resource priming vs.&#xD;
      supportive resource priming vs. adherence priming). Participants' treatment allocation is&#xD;
      performed randomly, therapist's assignment to the peer tutoring partner and the priming&#xD;
      condition is based on mutual agreement. Treatment outcomes are assessed at following levels:&#xD;
      Observer based in-session outcomes, post-session outcomes from session 1 to 15, treatment&#xD;
      outcome at post assessment and at 6-months follow-up assessments.&#xD;

      Aims of the trial. This trial investigates 3 different types of how to customize a&#xD;
      well-introduced CBT-protocol (Zinbarg, Craske, &amp; Barlow, 2006) using dyadic peer tutoring&#xD;
      methodology (primings). The participants are randomly assigned to 3 priming conditions: (a)&#xD;
      Resource priming (Flückiger, Wüsten et al., 2010; Flückiger &amp; Grosse Holtforth, 2008a); (b)&#xD;
      Supportive resource priming and (c) Adherence priming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In-session outcomes. Using the videotapes, observer-based videoanalyses will be&#xD;
           conducted: (a) Do the resource priming conditions show comparable observer-based&#xD;
           therapist's adherence in comparison to the adherence priming condition (Zinbarg et al.,&#xD;
           2007)? (b) Do the resource priming conditions show more resource activating micro&#xD;
           interventions than the adherence priming condition (ROMA; Flückiger &amp; Grosse Holtforth,&#xD;
           2008a/b)? (c) Are the in-session processes predictors and mediators of session and&#xD;
           therapy outcomes (Flückiger et al., 2009; Flückiger et al., 2013)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post-session outcomes. Are there differences in the post-session outcomes of the 3&#xD;
           priming conditions? Furthermore: Are the post-session outcomes along with symptom change&#xD;
           predictors and mediators of therapy outcome (Flückiger et al., 2009; Flückiger et al.,&#xD;
           2012)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment outcomes. Do show the resource priming conditions comparable efficacy on GAD&#xD;
           outcomes, general outcomes and dropout rates in comparison to the adherence priming&#xD;
           condition?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design. This study is a randomized controlled trial with three active treatment arms.&#xD;
      This trial is conducted at the Swiss psychotherapy outpatient clinic from the Department of&#xD;
      Psychology at the University of Zürich. The treatments are based on the same treatment&#xD;
      protocol (Zinbarg et al., 2006). Overall, a 3 x 4 design with one between-subject factor&#xD;
      (resource priming vs. supportive resource priming vs. problem priming) and one within-subject&#xD;
      factor (time: pre, mid (session 6), post (session 14), 6-months follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. Participants will be included in the study if&#xD;
      they: (a) are 18 years or older; (b) agree to the informed consent, (c) have sufficient&#xD;
      knowledge of German; and (d) fulfill the diagnostic criteria of GAD DSM-IV criteria.&#xD;
      Participants will be excluded if they have: (a) a score of 2 or higher on the suicide item of&#xD;
      the BDI and/or with active suicidal plans according to the diagnostic screening interview,&#xD;
      (b) a current medication of psychotic or bipolar disorder, (c) a current treatment by a&#xD;
      professional psychotherapist. Further, prescribed medications for anxiety or depressive&#xD;
      disorders do not lead to exclusion if the dosage has remained constant for at least one&#xD;
      month. The presence of a comorbidity does not result in exclusion if GAD is in the foreground&#xD;
      according to the severity rating of the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment. Participants will be recruited by means of advertisements in newspapers and&#xD;
      through internet forums. The high-circulation newspapers are delivered for free in the Swiss&#xD;
      public transport systems. Interested individuals in participation will contact the study&#xD;
      office via SMS, e-mail or phone. Screened positive patients are invited for an intake&#xD;
      assessment to verify the inclusion and exclusion criteria based on a standardized interview.&#xD;
      Participants that are not screened positive are informed about more appropriate treatments&#xD;
      via phone call or if requested by a further face-to-face contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and treatment allocation. After meeting the inclusion criteria, patients are&#xD;
      randomized to the 3 conditions (resource priming, supportive resource priming, adherence&#xD;
      priming). Treatment allocation is performed randomly by online application of a full&#xD;
      randomization. In this way, we aim to ensure that trial arms are balanced with respect to the&#xD;
      patients' baseline characteristics. Randomization procedure is conducted by two independent&#xD;
      research assistants. Because all patients are treated by the same CBT-manual, patients are&#xD;
      blinded for the treatment allocation and are not informed about the randomization procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GAD treatment protocol. CBT-manual (Zinbarg et al., 2006): Traditional cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      therapy (CBT) for GAD typically consists of psycho education of generalized anxiety disorder,&#xD;
      relaxation training (RT), cognitive restructuring (CR) and with some in-vivo situational&#xD;
      exposure for patients with overt behavioral avoidance (e.g., Barlow, Rapee, &amp; Brown, 1992;&#xD;
      Borkovec &amp; Costello, 1993). Furthermore, imagery exposure as a GAD-specific form of in-sensu&#xD;
      exposition will be applied to reduce experiential avoidance based on a well-introduced&#xD;
      CBT-manual (Zinbarg et al., 2006). The manualized therapy follows an usual time-limited&#xD;
      treatment format of 14 sessions to 50 minutes and a booster session after 6-months (total 15&#xD;
      sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tandem peer tutoring (priming).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate various types of how to conduct a standardized CBT-protocol, all therapists&#xD;
      are tutored in peer dyads (tandem peer tutoring). Immediate before sessions 1 to 5, the&#xD;
      therapists are required to contact the tandem-partner face-to-face or via self-phone to&#xD;
      deliberate the forthcoming session by a 5 to 10 minute brief communication (primings; for a&#xD;
      comparable procedure see Flückiger &amp; Grosse Holtforth, 2008). The tandem peer tutoring are&#xD;
      grouped in three conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resource priming: Immediately before sessions 1 to 5, therapists have a five-minute&#xD;
           conversation about how to implement strengths-based micro-interventions in the&#xD;
           forthcoming session. Strengths-based micro-interventions addresses therapists explicit&#xD;
           focus on patients' preexisting strengths and abilities, subtle changes and improvements&#xD;
           during therapy (potential recources) as well as motivational preparedness, readiness and&#xD;
           goals (motivational resources; Grawe, 2006; Flückiger et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Supportive resource priming: The supportive resource priming condition has the very same&#xD;
           protocol as the resource priming condition (5 brief tandem peer tutorings). The only&#xD;
           difference in the procedure is that the therapists are allowed to integrate a helpful&#xD;
           significant person of the patients (such as the partners or the best friends) around&#xD;
           session 1 and 7 to encourage and support the patient to realize their treatment plans&#xD;
           (active integration of interpersonal resources). However, the integration of a&#xD;
           significant other person does not touch the CBT-treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adherence priming: Immediately before sessions 1 to 5, therapists have a five-minute&#xD;
           conversation about how to implement the disorderspecific interventions that are&#xD;
           described in the treatment protocol. These communications are focused on therapists'&#xD;
           understanding of patients GAD and the related comorbidities and how these issues can be&#xD;
           addressed in the prescriptive treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapists. Twelve advanced trainees with at least 2 years post-graduate training are&#xD;
      recruited from local (CBT)-training centers. The majority of the therapists have experience&#xD;
      as study therapists in a prior randomized controlled trial. All the therapists participate in&#xD;
      an initial 16-hour workshop presented by the developer of the treatment manual (Zinbarg et&#xD;
      al., 2006). In addition to the peer-tutorings (primings), the therapists have regular&#xD;
      supervision in small groups on a 14-day basis. The supervision is conducted in mixed groups&#xD;
      over the 3 priming conditions. All the supervisors also participate in the initial 16-hour&#xD;
      workshop. To respect and coordinate the therapists' preferences (e.g. preferences in working&#xD;
      days and time schedules) they were assigned in a joint face-to-face session at study start.&#xD;
      All the therapists gave verbal and written consent to the selected peer-tutoring partner and&#xD;
      priming condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments. At intake, GAD-diagnosis and its core symptomatology are identified according to&#xD;
      the structured interview section for GAD (DIPS; Margraf, Schneider, &amp; Ehlers, 1994).&#xD;
      Furthermore, GAD-criteria are assessed by self-reports. The individual worries are identified&#xD;
      using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) and the Worry Domain Questionnaire (WDQ).&#xD;
      Mental disorders on Axis I are assessed using face-to-face diagnostic interviews for Axis I&#xD;
      (Diagnostisches Interview für Psychische Störungen für DSM-IV, SCID-I) and for Axis II&#xD;
      (Strukturiertes Klinisches Interview für DSM-IV, Achse-II, Persönlichkeitsstörungen, SKID-II;&#xD;
      Wittchen, Zaudig, &amp; Fydrich, 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSWQ, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the State-Trait Anxiety (STAI) are used as&#xD;
      GAD-outcomes. Premature termination from the trial, the interpersonal problems and strengths&#xD;
      inventories, the behavioral inhibition and activation scale, as well as the resource&#xD;
      potential questionnaire are used as general outcomes. The outcome measures are taken at&#xD;
      intake, directly after session 6 (end of primings), session 14 (post-assessment), and at 6-&#xD;
      month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following process measures are examined: (a) Post-session reports (Flückiger et al.,&#xD;
      2010), working alliance (Munder et al., 2009) and symptom change (BAI) are conducted from&#xD;
      session 1 to 15 and (b) In-session processes: Using the recorded videotapes, adherence&#xD;
      ratings (Zinbarg et al., 2007), the Resource-Oriented Microprocess Analysis (ROMA-P/T,&#xD;
      Flückiger &amp; Grosse Holtforth, 2008) and the level of explication scale (Sachse, 1992) are&#xD;
      conducted at session 2, 5 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study from the participants view. After contaciting the study administration, the&#xD;
      participant's information contained a precise description of the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, the structure of the treatment manual as well as the data collection procedure&#xD;
      including the video recordings. Confidentiality of the collected data is confirmed.&#xD;
      Volontarines of participation is emphasized by the opportunity to terminate the treatment at&#xD;
      every timepoint during treatment and the cancelation of all conducted data. Furthermore, an&#xD;
      insurance for possible negative outcomes of clinical trials is contracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis. In order to handle the hierarchical data structures (sessions at Level&#xD;
      1 nested within patients at Level 2 and therapists at Level 3), hierarchical linear model&#xD;
      (HLM) with time as a within-groups factor and treatment condition as a between-groups factor&#xD;
      will be used for the main research questions. The analyses will be conducted on the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat sample as well as on the completer sample. To investigate if possible&#xD;
      patients' and therapists' effects have an impact to the therapy outcomes, patients' and&#xD;
      therapists' pretreatment characteristics are investigated as outcome predictors at Level 2&#xD;
      and 3. Clinical significance will be defined as (a) a statistically reliable change according&#xD;
      to the Reliable Change Index (RCI), and (b) being within two standard deviations of a&#xD;
      nonclinical group at post-assessment or follow-up (Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991). All the analyses&#xD;
      will be run by HLM and R packet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size. Based on a power analysis with G*Power the optimal sample size with an&#xD;
      Alpha-error of 5 %, and a Beta-error of 80% as well as a correlation coefficient of r = .30&#xD;
      of the repeated assessments are 60 participants, i.e. 20 participants in each priming&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
