      Chlorthalidone might offer an effective, safe and inexpensive anti-hypertensive treatment for&#xD;
      kidney transplant patients who have resistant hypertension on multi-drug therapy. We will&#xD;
      collect initial data on the safety and efficacy of Chlorthalidone in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with resistant hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To Examine the efficacy of chlorthalidone as an anti-hypertensive agent in the treatment of&#xD;
      resistant hypertension among stable kidney transplant recipients&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study involves transplant recipients presenting to the transplant Clinic Gateway 7th&#xD;
      floor with resistant hypertension. The initial contact will take place in the transplant&#xD;
      clinic study consist of approximately eight out patient visits over a 8 week period:&#xD;
      Screening, and follow-up visits will be conducted at the Clinical Research Services (CRS)&#xD;
      Unit. The Baseline (Week 1), Visit 1 Enrollment (Week 1) Day 1 and 2, Visit 2, (Week 3) Day 1&#xD;
      and 2, and Visit 3 End of Study, (Week 7) Day 1 and 2. Additional visits maybe required to&#xD;
      accommodate adverse reactions. The study will require approximately four (4) time points&#xD;
      where blood pressure, pulse and weight is obtained, safety blood collections approximately&#xD;
      2-3 tablespoons drawn by venipuncture and 24 hour urine collection periods. Home blood&#xD;
      pressure readings will be required at two (2) time points during the study. The subject will&#xD;
      be required to stop taking current medications for seven weeks, take study medication for 6&#xD;
      weeks and report adverse reactions and concomitant medications at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Enrollment visit, the subject will be identified, informed consent obtained,&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, past medical history, co-morbid illnesses, current medications,&#xD;
      and home and office blood pressures will be recorded to assess for eligibility criteria. This&#xD;
      data will be collected prospectively by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial clinical assessment at the time of the patient's screening visit will be performed at&#xD;
      the outpatient testing center in the transplant clinic. A three day window will be allowed&#xD;
      for all visits. The following measurements will occur at this visit: Biometric measurements:&#xD;
      vitals ( blood pressure and pulse) body weight, EKG, Arm circumference, confirmation of&#xD;
      hypertension by 24-h ABPM , urine studies: 24 hour urine collection and evaluation, safety,&#xD;
      8-10AM sitting upright Plasma Aldosterone/Renin Ratio, clinical safety laboratory test: bone&#xD;
      morphogenetic protein, Mg/phosphorus level, Parathyroid hormone, vitamin D level and HbA1c,&#xD;
      review and document concomitant medications, including current furosemide prescription.&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will start&#xD;
      Baseline (Week 1) Measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Baseline (Week 1) the current furosemide prescription will be documented and discontinued.&#xD;
      This will begin the washout period. The washout period will continue for one week. At the end&#xD;
      of the washout period the subject will be instructions to return to the CRS unit for Visit 1&#xD;
      Enrollment measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 Enrollment Measurements Week 1, Day 1, include the following measurements: Biometric&#xD;
      measurements: Body Weight, confirmation of hypertension by 24-h ABPM Urine studies: start 24&#xD;
      hour Urine collection, safety laboratory evaluations: bone morphogenetic protein , document&#xD;
      concomitant medications, and adverse reactions. Visit 1 Enrollment Measurements Week 1 Day 2&#xD;
      the subject will return the 24-hour urine collection and the 24 hour ABPM will be removed.&#xD;
      The study medication chlorthalidone will be started. The subject will take study medication&#xD;
      for 3 weeks before returning for the next study visit: Visit 2 (Week 3) Day 1 . A three day&#xD;
      window will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2 (Week 3) Day 1 and 2. Biometric measurements: Body Weight and home B/P recordings,&#xD;
      start 24 hour Urine collection. Review pill count for compliance, concomitant medications and&#xD;
      adverse reactions will be obtained. Day 2: the subject will return the 24-hour urine&#xD;
      collection. Review study removal criteria After taking the study medication for three weeks,&#xD;
      the subject will return to the CRS unit for Visit 3 End of Study, (Week 7) Day 1 and 2 Visit&#xD;
      3 End of Study, (Week 7) Day 1 and 2. On day 1, Biometric measurements: Body Weight, start&#xD;
      24-h ABPM , Urine studies: start 24 hour Urine collection, safety laboratory evaluations:&#xD;
      8-10AM sitting upright Plasma Aldosterone/Renin Ratio, collect safety labs: bone&#xD;
      morphogenetic protein, Mg/phosphorus level, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D level and HbA1c,&#xD;
      document pill count, concomitant medications, home blood pressure readings and adverse&#xD;
      Reactions. Day 2: the subject will return the 24-hour urine collection and the 24 hour ABPM&#xD;
      will be removed If blood pressure is adequately controlled on study medication subject may&#xD;
      continue study medication. If blood pressure not adequately controlled on study medication&#xD;
      the subject may return to pre-study medication or a medication prescribed by physician.&#xD;
