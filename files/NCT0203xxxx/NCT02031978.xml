  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to be a current examination of infant and toddler feeding practices&#xD;
      among families receiving WIC services. It has been more than 10 years since the last study of&#xD;
      such feeding practices, and in the interim important changes have taken place in the WIC&#xD;
      program, in society, and in the science of nutrition. The study will include exploration of&#xD;
      breastfeeding practices and support, more general feeding practices, nutritional intake of&#xD;
      infants and toddlers, transitions in infant and toddler feeding practices, early precursors&#xD;
      of obesity, and family factors that may influence all of these nutrition-related issues. It&#xD;
      will also explore characteristics of the WIC program in selected sites, and how these relate&#xD;
      to infant and toddler feeding decisions and practices. This study is important both to update&#xD;
      knowledge about the WIC population, and to uncover possible new avenues of inquiry regarding&#xD;
      early childhood obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Update on November 25, 2020:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WIC ITFPS-2 will now follow participants through child age 9 years. This unprecedented&#xD;
      opportunity will provide FNS with a better understanding of the impact of WIC participation&#xD;
      on health and nutrition outcomes in childhood.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This observational study will employ a national probability sample of WIC participants and a&#xD;
      longitudinal design to examine infant and toddler feeding behaviors and associated decision&#xD;
      making. We will recruit and follow a core sample of infants and toddlers from birth through&#xD;
      their second birthday and will oversample a supplemental group of WIC participants with low&#xD;
      prevalence characteristics in the population to ensure representation of those groups (for&#xD;
      instance, African-American mothers who breastfeed - a group with generally low levels of&#xD;
      breastfeeding). The study will also gather information from key WIC Staff about the program,&#xD;
      particularly about their breastfeeding policies and nutrition education activities. There are&#xD;
      two categories of people from/about whom we will collect data - WIC Participants and WIC&#xD;
      Program Representatives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WIC Participants: The target study participant is the infant/toddler, but we will&#xD;
           recruit and conduct interviews with the mother (or primary caregiver), who are&#xD;
           henceforth referred to as the participants. Participants must be at least 16 years old&#xD;
           and parental consent and adolescent assent will be obtained for those under the age of&#xD;
           majority in their state. The study will collect data about WIC participants in two ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews: Sampled WIC participants will be recruited and assigned to either a core or&#xD;
           supplemental group. We will interview the core group up to thirteen times over a&#xD;
           three-year period, with a prenatal interview (for those enrolled prenatally) and&#xD;
           interviews every two months from the child's birth through age one, and about every&#xD;
           three months between ages 1 and 2, and every 6 months between ages 2 and 3 (at ages 1,&#xD;
           3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months). The supplemental group will only&#xD;
           participate in four interviews (at ages 1 or 3, 7, 13, and 24 months). Study&#xD;
           participants will also be asked at each interview about their child's food intake in the&#xD;
           previous 24 hours using the USDA Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM) and supporting&#xD;
           materials; and a 10 percent subsample of the core group will be asked to report a second&#xD;
           day of intake 7-10 days after the initial interviews at 13, 15, 18, 24 and 36 months.&#xD;
           The interviews will be conducted over the phone using a Computer-Assisted Telephone&#xD;
           Interview (CATI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health Data: The study will also collect data from hospital birth records on the&#xD;
           infants' weight at birth; and from WIC administrative records on the infants' length and&#xD;
           weight and WIC package prescription at four times during the study (at ages 6, 12, 24&#xD;
           and 36 months). When participants consent to enroll in the study, we will ask them to&#xD;
           sign a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) form releasing the&#xD;
           records for the study. If a child in the core sample has dropped out of WIC, we will&#xD;
           request data from their health care provider or ask the participant to travel to the&#xD;
           nearest WIC site to be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WIC Program Representatives: Following the Sampling Plan described below the research&#xD;
           team will recruit 80 WIC sites in 27 State Agencies to participate in the study and&#xD;
           speak with them about the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  State and Local WIC Administrators: The study will conduct one, hour-long,&#xD;
           semi-structured key informant interview with a State WIC administrator in each sampled&#xD;
           State Agency, and a local WIC administrator for each sampled WIC site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WIC Site Staff: The study will also gather information from all staff (not to exceed 10)&#xD;
           at sampled WIC sites through a one-time, 30-minute web-based survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WIC enrollees will be sampled from a stratified, nationally representative sample of 80&#xD;
      WIC sites in 27 State Agencies. In addition to facilitating access to and creating efficient&#xD;
      sampling frames for recruiting WIC participants, WIC program representatives in the WIC State&#xD;
      and Local Agencies will provide important information to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use sampling methods to select the WIC site sample and the WIC participant&#xD;
      sample. We will sample the lowest WIC unit that delivers services to WIC participants, called&#xD;
      a &quot;service site&quot;. Within each service site we will sample new WIC enrollees within a&#xD;
      pre-determined recruitment window.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sampling WIC Service Sites. We plan a two-stage sampling approach that uses the WIC 2010&#xD;
           Participant Characteristics data (WIC PC 2010) to develop the WIC site sampling frame&#xD;
           and a stratified sample design to select the sample of sites. In the first-stage we will&#xD;
           use a group of characteristics to stratify the WIC sites into 40 strata. Because of&#xD;
           uncertainties about the eligibility of the first-stage sampling units, these units will&#xD;
           be selected in two phases. In the first phase a total of 160 sampling units in 42 State&#xD;
           Agencies will be selected-4 from each of the 40 strata. After the phase 1 selection, we&#xD;
           will list the service sites associated with each first-stage sampling unit selected and&#xD;
           determine the eligibility of each unit. To be eligible for the study, a site must have&#xD;
           an average minimum daily flow of 1.5 new WIC ITFPS-eligible enrollees per day and must&#xD;
           be expected to remain in operation and enrolling new WIC participants during the WIC&#xD;
           ITFPS recruitment period. In the second phase we will subsample eligible first-stage&#xD;
           sampling units to arrive at the final sample of 80 first-stage sampling units (2 from&#xD;
           each of the 40 strata). In first-stage sampling units that are local agencies with more&#xD;
           than one eligible service site, a second stage of sampling will be conducted to select&#xD;
           one service site. The final sample will consist of 80 eligible service sites. Once the&#xD;
           second-stage sampling is complete, recruitment efforts will begin in earnest. Although&#xD;
           due diligence will be used to recruit service sites, we anticipate that some sites may&#xD;
           be unable or unwilling to cooperate. Such service sites will be replaced by members of a&#xD;
           matched sample. This replacement of service sites by matched substitutes is similar to&#xD;
           imputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sampling WIC participants within a sampled recruiting window. The WIC participant sample&#xD;
           will be designed such that the total target number of sampled WIC enrollee is spread&#xD;
           uniformly across the 80 sampled sites; that is, the recruitment of study participants&#xD;
           will be designed so that each site will be expected to yield 98 sampled WIC enrollees.&#xD;
           An important part of our sampling plan is the concept of recruiting &quot;windows.&quot; A&#xD;
           recruiting window will be a string of consecutive workdays during which we will be&#xD;
           recruiting new WIC enrollees at each sampled service site. These windows will vary in&#xD;
           length from 7 to 66 workdays. The length of the window will be pre-determined, based on&#xD;
           typical daily enrollment volumes (obtained from the State following selection of the&#xD;
           phase 1 sample of first-stage sampling units) and will be calculated in such a way as to&#xD;
           yield an average of 98 sampled WIC enrollees per site. The 80 windows will be randomly&#xD;
           assigned to a spread of starting dates across the 20-week field period for recruiting,&#xD;
           with the pool of possible starting dates for a given site determined based on its&#xD;
           average daily enrollments and enrollment schedule. Due to the variations in actual WIC&#xD;
           enrollments over time, the actual number of sampled enrollees who enroll in WIC during&#xD;
           the specified recruiting window will vary from site to site.&#xD;

      Update on November 25, 2020:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study has been extended and will now follow children through age 9 years&#xD;
      to examine the associations between prior WIC participation and children's health and&#xD;
      nutrition outcomes. The core sample of participants will be interviewed 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,&#xD;
      13, 15, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, and 72 months, and the supplemental sample will be&#xD;
      interviewed at 1 or 3, 7, 13, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, and 72 months; both core and&#xD;
      supplemental sample participants will also receive a follow-up interview around the child's&#xD;
      ninth birthday. In addition to the interviews at the aforementioned months, the study team&#xD;
      will also ask participants to provide height and weight data around ages 6, 12, 24, 36, 48,&#xD;
      60, and 72 months and around age 9 years.&#xD;
