  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strategies to reduce the burden of diabetes in Rwanda, like in other resource poor settings,&#xD;
      include involving diabetic patients in their own care and targeting modifiable risk factors&#xD;
      through adopting appropriate dietary and lifestyle habits. According to previous research&#xD;
      carried out in developed countries, lifestyle modifications may have effect on the&#xD;
      development of diabetes and prevention of its complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, direct evidence to show whether lifestyle intervention is beneficial for diabetic&#xD;
      patients in resources limited countries like Rwanda is an open question. Though in these&#xD;
      countries, access to healthy diet is claimed to be the barrier of implementation of&#xD;
      therapeutic lifestyle based initiatives, we hypothesize that knowledge gaps are more&#xD;
      important barriers than access to healthier diets and other lifestyle habits. We therefore&#xD;
      would like to carry out this intervention to assess the effects of lifestyle education&#xD;
      programs on glycemic control among people with diabetes followed up at CHUK.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial with two groups (one interventional and one&#xD;
      control) to be followed up for 12 months. It will be carried out in Kigali University&#xD;
      Teaching Hospital, the main referral hospital in Rwanda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle intervention will consist in group counselling on dietary habits (meals&#xD;
      composition, importance and ways to reduce unhealthy foods: salty (especially because&#xD;
      hypertension is of concern among diabetic people and blood pressure will be one of the&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures), sugar, unsaturated fats, smoking, alcohol abuse and adapt&#xD;
      healthier regimens including fruits &amp; vegetables), effects of regular physical activity,&#xD;
      importance of adherence to medications (including taking medications as directed, regular&#xD;
      medical follow up,etcâ€¦), diabetes complications, actions to control blood sugar and ways of&#xD;
      coping with stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education &amp; counselling sessions will be provided by a team of registered dietitians, nurses&#xD;
      and counselors who will have been trained for this purpose prior to the intervention and will&#xD;
      be taking between 45 to 60 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline data collection, subjects in the control group will continue to receive usual&#xD;
      care delivered by attending physicians and nutritionists at CHUK. This includes usual monthly&#xD;
      medical follow up and individual conselling on dietary habits and lifestyle change delivered&#xD;
      by attending physicians and/or dietitians&#xD;
