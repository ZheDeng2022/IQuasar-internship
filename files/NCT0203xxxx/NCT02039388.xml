      The current study aims at answering the scientific question, whether exfoliated cells from&#xD;
      STICs get transported into the uterine cavity via the fallopian tube, and whether it is&#xD;
      possible to detect those cells in the lavage fluid from the uterine cavity and proximal&#xD;
      fallopian tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this question, the investigators will study 20 lavage samples and their 20&#xD;
      corresponding STIC-positive tissue samples in women who opt for risk-reducing bilateral&#xD;
      salpingo-oophorectomy (rrBSO) because of increased risk of high grade serous carcinoma of the&#xD;
      pelvis (HGSC) (mostly carrying a BRCA mutation), without a history of tubal occlusion for&#xD;
      sterilization. Women who opt to have the fallopian tubes removed but the ovaries preserved&#xD;
      are eligible for the study too, as are women who opt for rrBSO plus hysterectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The term &quot;high grade serous carcinoma&quot; (HGSC) describes a group of ovarian, tubal and&#xD;
      peritoneal cancers with an aggressive biological behavior. HGSC is the leading cause of death&#xD;
      from gynecologic malignancy in western civilized countries. Women affected, usually have&#xD;
      advanced stage disease with metastatic spread throughout the abdominal cavity at time of&#xD;
      diagnosis. Five-year survival rates are in the range of 10 to 30 percent. The specificity of&#xD;
      current diagnostic tools (CA-125 and transvaginal ultrasonography) is low and ineffective at&#xD;
      detecting HGSC early enough to improve clinical outcomes. Definitive diagnosis of HGSC mostly&#xD;
      relies on surgical confirmation. These findings underline the need for an effective test for&#xD;
      early detection of HGSC. In the general population, the lifetime risk is 1.5 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with germ line mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene or a strong family history of&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancer carry a high risk for breast cancer and/or HGSC development.&#xD;
      Familial or inherited syndromes account for approximately 13 percent of cases of invasive&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian and fallopian tube cancer. The lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is 35 to 46&#xD;
      percent in women with BRCA1 gene mutations and 13 to 23 percent in those with BRCA2&#xD;
      mutations. Again, even in this population with high-risk for HGSC, the specificity of CA-125&#xD;
      and transvaginal ultrasonography is still too low and ineffective to improve clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last years, increasing scientific evidence conglomerated that a large proportion of&#xD;
      not only familial HGSC develop primarily in the lining of the fallopian tube, that resembles&#xD;
      Müllerian epithelium. These precursor lesions are called &quot;serous tubal intraepithelial&#xD;
      carcinomas&quot; (STICs) and are characterized by p53 overexpression on immunohistochemistry and&#xD;
      high Ki-67 labelling index indicating a high proliferation index. In over 90 percent, STICs&#xD;
      carry mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for today, risk reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (rrBSO) is the most effective&#xD;
      approach to reducing the risk of HGSC in high risk women. Among women with an increased risk&#xD;
      of HGSC (most with BRCA mutations) who underwent rrBSO, 4 to 17 percent are found to have a&#xD;
      STIC or even invasive neoplasm, and approximately 80 percent of these neoplasms are in the&#xD;
      ampullar part of the fallopian tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent findings highlighted the malignant potential of STICs. On histopathological specimen,&#xD;
      intraluminal shedding of tumor cells from STICs can be frequently demonstrated in the&#xD;
      fallopian tube. This shedding of tumor cells from STICs appears to be a risk factor for early&#xD;
      transperitoneal metastasis frequently found in HGSC. There is a strong clinical need for&#xD;
      screening for STICs, since they are the precursor lesion of HGSC. These facts underline the&#xD;
      importance of an effective - non-invasive - test for early detection of STICs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ovarian surface, the fallopian tubes, the uterine cavity and the peritoneal cavity all&#xD;
      together form a communicating compartment. The physiological function of the ciliated lining&#xD;
      of the tubes is to transport the egg into the uterine cavity after ovulation thus making it&#xD;
      likely that exfoliated cells from STICs can be found in the uterine cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising approach for the detection of STICs has been established by Paul Speiser and&#xD;
      Robert Zeillinger (Molecular Oncology Group, Department of General Gynaecology and&#xD;
      Gynaecologic Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria). This approach is called the&#xD;
      ALPINE technique (Austrian Lavage Procedure for the Detection of tubal Intraepithelial&#xD;
      Neoplasms) (manuscript under preparation). To facilitate an quick and easy lavage of the&#xD;
      uterine cavity and proximal tubes, a special catheter was developed (MEDICOPLAST, MF 13005,&#xD;
      catheter for uterine and tubal lavage). The ALPINE technique includes a lavage of the uterine&#xD;
      cavity and proximal fallopian tubes and subsequent analysis of this lavage fluid for the&#xD;
      presence of pre-malignant and malignant cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the proof of principle that tumor cells from ovarian cancer are shed and can be found in&#xD;
      the lavages of the uterine cavity, uterine lavages were collected before a surgical&#xD;
      intervention for suspected ovarian malignancy at our institution and at the Catholic&#xD;
      University Leuven, Division Gynaecological Oncology, Belgium. After malignancy was confirmed,&#xD;
      genetic changes in the TP53 and KRAS genes were determined in tumor tissue. In a set of 9&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancer patients (EOC) and 1 ovarian metastases of a signet ring carcinoma,&#xD;
      the presence of these genetic changes was examined in lavage samples, using digital droplet&#xD;
      PCR (ddPCR). 10 genetic changes were identified in tumor tissue of these patients and 9/10&#xD;
      (90%) of these changes were detected in the corresponding lavage specimen too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, a filter approach, followed by p53 immunofluorescence staining was established,&#xD;
      confirming the presence of tumor cells in the lavage sample of one additional patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a next step, lavage samples of 23 ovarian carcinoma patients, and if applicable&#xD;
      corresponding tumor tissue, were analysed through deep sequencing by the group of Bert&#xD;
      Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA). The presence of genetic changes,&#xD;
      indicative for ovarian cancer, could be confirmed in 18/23 (78.3%) lavage specimen including&#xD;
      both, early and advanced stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results are proof that ovarian cancer cells are shed into the fallopian tubes and&#xD;
      uterine cavity, and can be collected through our ALPINE technique. The fact that ovarian&#xD;
      cancer cells were detected with high sensitivity in the lavage of the uterine cavity and&#xD;
      proximal tubes shows that this approach has potential in early diagnosis. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators are confident that this method could be applied in detection of premalignant&#xD;
      changes in high risk patients, as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims at answering the scientific question, whether exfoliated cells from&#xD;
      STICs get transported into the uterine cavity via the fallopian tube, and whether it is&#xD;
      possible to detect those cells in the lavage fluid from the uterine cavity and proximal&#xD;
      fallopian tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this question, the investigators will study 20 lavage samples and their 20&#xD;
      corresponding STIC-positive tissue samples in women who opt for rrBSO because of increased&#xD;
      risk of HGSC (mostly carrying a BRCA mutation), without a history of tubal occlusion for&#xD;
      sterilization. Women who opt to have the fallopian tubes removed but the ovaries preserved&#xD;
      are eligible for the study too, as are women who opt for rrBSO plus hysterectomy.&#xD;
