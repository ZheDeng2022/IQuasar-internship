  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A central goal of health care is to maximize patient functioning and well-being. This has&#xD;
      prompted measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) that encompasses physical,&#xD;
      psychological, and social functioning. While obese people have generally impaired HRQOL,&#xD;
      people seeking bariatric surgery for obesity appear to have poorer HRQOL than obese&#xD;
      individuals seeking non-surgical treatment or obese individuals not seeking weight-loss&#xD;
      treatment. HRQOL improves significantly after bariatric surgery, but often with large&#xD;
      individual variations in outcome. As gastric bypass is an invasive procedure with&#xD;
      irreversible influences on eating behaviour and possible serious adverse events, it is&#xD;
      important to identify potential risk factors for a poorer long-term result. In Denmark,&#xD;
      bariatric surgery is free of charge for patients fulfilling the Danish Health and Medicines&#xD;
      Authority guidelines, which until 2011 were in line with international guidelines. However,&#xD;
      in 2011 access to surgery was dramatically restricted and the annual number of operations&#xD;
      reduced from 0.9 per 1000 inhabitants (2010) to 0.2 per 1000 inhabitants (2012). The&#xD;
      restrictions involved a tightening of the criteria for patients without manifest obesity&#xD;
      comorbidities, raising lower body mass index (BMI) threshold from 40 to 50 and increasing the&#xD;
      lower age limit from 18 to 25 years (11). It is not known whether patients fulfilling the&#xD;
      tighter criteria benefit more from surgery than patients who only met the previous criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study assessed HRQOL changes associated with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with follow-up&#xD;
      over an average of 22 months. The aim was to explore whether postoperative HRQOL variations&#xD;
      were associated with identifiable socio-demographic or clinical characteristics. In&#xD;
      particular, whether HRQOL changes differed for patients fulfilling the current Danish&#xD;
      criteria and patients only fulfilling the previous criteria.&#xD;
