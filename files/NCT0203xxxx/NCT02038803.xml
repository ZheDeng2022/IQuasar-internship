  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled tobramycin is a Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommended effective treatment for&#xD;
      individuals with cystic fibrosis for the management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway&#xD;
      colonization and improves the FEV1 and reduces the number of acute pulmonary exacerbations of&#xD;
      CF. Patients typically use the inhaled tobramycin for a period of 28 days. Unfortunately, the&#xD;
      standard nebulizer method for delivering tobramycin inhaled solution (TIS) is time-consuming&#xD;
      and may result in missed therapy doses and suboptimal care. A new inhaled formulation and&#xD;
      delivery device, the TOBI Podhaler (TPI), is a quicker, more efficient method of&#xD;
      administering inhaled Tobramycin. This new pocket-sized disposable inhaler is maintenance&#xD;
      free, requires no refrigeration or power source, and should greatly increase patient mobility&#xD;
      and improve time management.&#xD;

      Adult cystic fibrosis patients from the Rush University Medical Center Adult Cystic Fibrosis&#xD;
      Program will be recruited for a prospective before and after cohort study to evaluate patient&#xD;
      preference for either the TOBI Podhaler or inhaled tobramycin solution and compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of the TOBI Podhaler to tobramycin inhaled solution. This project will evaluate the&#xD;
      potential differences in efficacy, medication adherence, treatment time, side effects/adverse&#xD;
      effects, quality of life, and identify patient preferences between the use of TIP and TIS.&#xD;
      Measurements after a 28-day cycle of tobramycin inhaled solution, first 28-day cycle of TOBI&#xD;
      Podhaler and third 28-day cycle of TOBI Podhaler will include FEV1, number of acute pulmonary&#xD;
      exacerbations, adherence, cough frequency, sputum characteristics, and side effects or&#xD;
      adverse events. The quality of life as assessed by the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised&#xD;
      (CFQ-R) will be measured after a 28-day cycle of tobramycin inhaled solution and the third&#xD;
      28-day cycle of TOBI Podhaler. The FEV1 values, number of missed treatments, and total&#xD;
      treatment time will be analyzed through a repeated measures analysis of variance. Comparisons&#xD;
      of the CFQ-R data before and after the switch to the TPI will be made with the Student's&#xD;
      t-test. The chi square test will be used to evaluate differences in categorical data. All&#xD;
      tests will be tested at an alpha equal to 0.05. Responses for the adverse reactions or side&#xD;
      effects will be listed and categorized. The percentages of patients preferring each inhaled&#xD;
      solution will be reported.&#xD;

    <description>Adults with cystic fibrosis who have respiratory colonization with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. The actual study will involve instructing adult patients with CF on the use of a new form of Tobramycin for inhalation (powder) and then assessing this new form of TOBI podhaler vs the old TOBI solution related to patient preference on use, time involved in taking the new medication vs the old, and impact on their pulmonary function and subsequent exacerbation rate plus quality of life.</description>
