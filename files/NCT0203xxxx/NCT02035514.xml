      Immunomodulatory therapies to treat the relapsing-remitting phase of multiple sclerosis (MS)&#xD;
      are designed to ameliorate the inflammatory processes that mediate the damage to the central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) and to delay progression of the disease. To date, there is no effective&#xD;
      means to stop the progression of disease and induce remyelination. Adult stem cells therapy&#xD;
      show great promise and is rapidly developing as alternative therapeutic strategy. We propose&#xD;
      the use of bone marrow-derived autologous Mesenchymal (BM-MSC) Stem Cells transplantation to&#xD;
      treat patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), despite immunomodulatory therapy. Taking&#xD;
      advantage of the potential that MSC possess strong immunomodulatory properties thought to&#xD;
      play a role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance and in the control of autoimmunity and&#xD;
      that may stimulate repair and regeneration of lesions, we plan a trial of a single injection&#xD;
      of autologous BM-MSC into eight patients. First, we aim to assess the feasibility, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of autologous MSC therapy in RRMS. Second, we plan to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      BM-MSC transplantation on MS disease activity by clinical, neurophysiological, immunological&#xD;
      and imaging assessments. Autologous MSC will be obtained from bone marrow aspirates, purified&#xD;
      by culture and characterized by surface antigen expression. A single dose of autologous&#xD;
      BM-MSC will be injected intravenously. Clinical, neurological and immunological assessments&#xD;
      will be scheduled at baseline (before BM-MSC transplantation) at 1, 3, and 6 months after&#xD;
      transplant. The imaging will be performed at 3 and 6 months after transplant. Proposed trial&#xD;
      will enable us to ascertain whether autologous BM-MSC transplantation is a feasible and safe&#xD;
      procedure, and whether BM-MSC can establish an environment of immune tolerance and through&#xD;
      the local production of neurotrophic/growth factors, might induce neuroprotection and&#xD;
      improvement in CNS function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, demyelinating disease of the CNS. Onset typically&#xD;
      occurs in early adulthood. Patients present with intermittent symptoms that are partially&#xD;
      reversible; this form is termed relapsing-remitting (RRMS). Over time, most patients develop&#xD;
      secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) which manifests as irreversible and gradual neurological&#xD;
      impairments that often progress without acute relapses. Beta-interferons or glatiramer&#xD;
      acetate represents the first line therapeutic option for RRMS. Clinical trials confirm that&#xD;
      show partial efficacy, though they do not prevent the onset of secondary progression. SPMS,&#xD;
      is the consequence of axonal loss and neurodegeneration and no current therapy has been&#xD;
      effective. Stem cell therapy show great promise and is rapidly developing as alternative&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy. Clinical indications for adult stem cells, which can be safely&#xD;
      harvested and normally behave well without formation of tumours, are rapidly increasing. The&#xD;
      majority of human stem cell trials have focused on clinical applications for haematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cells (HSC), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), or both, which can be easily obtained in&#xD;
      clinically sufficient numbers from peripheral blood, bone marrow, adipose tissue, or&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood and placenta. MSC can readily be isolated from a small sample of bone&#xD;
      marrow and rapidly expanded so as to generate large numbers of cells for autologous&#xD;
      therapies. When administered intravenously have an immune suppressive effect that can&#xD;
      ameliorate animal autoimmune diseases. MSC transplantation significantly improves clinical&#xD;
      outcome in experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), the animal model of MS. When&#xD;
      intravenously injected, MSC may migrate to inflammatory brain lesions and promote survival of&#xD;
      brain-resident cells. Several disease models demonstrate axonal neuroprotection following MSC&#xD;
      therapy, with some evidence that this is potentially mediated through the production of&#xD;
      neurotrophic/growth factors, and/or immunomodulatory effects of MSC. For that reasons, MSC&#xD;
      have become the focus of research as a potential cell therapy for inducing neuroprotection in&#xD;
      human neurodegenerative diseases such as MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing body of literature confirms the therapeutic MSC biological properties, and provide&#xD;
      a plausible mechanism of action to guide clinical trial design with a number of phase I/II&#xD;
      trials in MS patients now underway. Experimental clinical trials in MS are being considered&#xD;
      or have recently been initiated by several research groups, which are testing the therapeutic&#xD;
      potential of different sources of MSC. Learning from previous clinical studies, and taking&#xD;
      advantage of the potential that adult BM-MSC may stimulate repair and remyelination, to plan&#xD;
      a clinical trial in patients with inflammatory MS seems reasonable. We propose a safety trial&#xD;
      of a single intravenous injection of autologous bone marrow-derived MSC into 8 subjects with&#xD;
      RRMS. The trial proposed here will enable us to ascertain whether autologous BM-MSC&#xD;
      transplantation is a safe procedure, and whether BM-MSC therapy during the&#xD;
      relapsing-remitting phase of MS can establish a immunomodulatory and regenerative&#xD;
      microenvironment and reverse neurological disability in RRMS patients.&#xD;
