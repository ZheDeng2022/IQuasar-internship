    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is when a person stops breathing repeatedly during sleep.&#xD;
      Breathing stops because the airway collapses and prevents air from getting into the&#xD;
      lungs.This airway closure results in a decrease in the amount of oxygen that is in the blood.&#xD;
      Anesthetics given during surgery are known to increase the tendency for a patient's airway to&#xD;
      close immediately after surgery in the recovery room and to reduce the amount of oxygen in a&#xD;
      patient's blood immediately after surgery. These two factors combined could have a profound&#xD;
      effect on a patient's well being after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in general anesthesia, pain medications, and surgical techniques have made&#xD;
      outpatient surgery more common. Due to the increase in outpatient surgeries, pain management&#xD;
      techniques that will work efficiently and for longer periods of time are necessary. One of&#xD;
      these techniques is a nerve block, which coats the nerve with a numbing medication and blocks&#xD;
      all pain from that area. Nerve blocks are routinely used along with general anesthesia for&#xD;
      outpatient surgeries and help reduce or eliminate the need for IV or oral pain medicine after&#xD;
      the surgery. Nerve blocks can provide good pain relief with early recovery and fewer side&#xD;
      effects (nausea, vomiting, etc.) related to narcotic pain medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there are no studies that look at the effect of anesthesia and nerve blocks on&#xD;
      breathing patterns and oxygen saturation levels after discharge from outpatient surgery. We&#xD;
      therefore propose to study the changes in lung function tests and blood oxygen levels after a&#xD;
      nerve block and general anesthesia for outpatient shoulder surgery. We would like to conduct&#xD;
      a home sleep study including measuring oxygen levels while subjects are sleeping, before,&#xD;
      during and after surgery, and test lung function both before and after surgery to see if&#xD;
      there are any differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 10 subjects with eligibility based on clinically indicated shoulder surgery&#xD;
      and a nerve block. The study will be non-interventional during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that future screening for out-patient shoulder surgery includes preoperative&#xD;
      overnight oxygen saturation measurement to identify patients at high-risk of changes in&#xD;
      oxygen levels. These patients may benefit from hospital admission after surgery for close&#xD;
      observation. Thus, this study could have significant implications for patient safety and&#xD;
      resource utilization.&#xD;

      History &amp; Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a syndrome of sleep related airway obstruction (snoring) and&#xD;
      reduction in blood oxygen levels affecting between 2% and 24% of the general population1. In&#xD;
      other words, a person stops breathing repeatedly during sleep when they have OSA. Breathing&#xD;
      stops because the airway collapses and prevents air from getting into the lungs. The impact&#xD;
      of OSA on systemic heart and lung disease is slow and progressive over a course of years.&#xD;
      Exposure to anesthesia increases the tendency for postoperative airway obstruction and&#xD;
      reduction in oxygen levels2, both of which could have significant impact on patient&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in general anesthetics, opioid analgesic drugs and surgical techniques have&#xD;
      made outpatient surgery common for a significant proportion of patients. It is estimated that&#xD;
      approximately 50% of procedures currently performed in the University of Michigan Health&#xD;
      System are day-case procedures, the vast majority of which require deep sedation or general&#xD;
      anesthesia. The reduction in postoperative hospital based care has placed considerable&#xD;
      emphasis on the efficient delivery of pain relief and has resulted in an increased usage of&#xD;
      peripheral nerve blocks to reduce the need for intravenous sedative opioid analgesics and&#xD;
      deep levels of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder surgery is a particularly good example where a nerve block in the neck region&#xD;
      (typically an inter-scalene brachial plexus block) placed before anesthesia provides good&#xD;
      pain relief with early recovery and less side effects directly related to opioid analgesics.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, one of the side effects of the interscalene nerve block is temporary (12-18&#xD;
      hours) weakness of the diaphragm muscle on the same side as the block, due to phrenic nerve&#xD;
      blockade. As a result, there is a change in the patient's breathing pattern which is&#xD;
      typically compensated by increased work by other muscles in the respiratory system3. However,&#xD;
      it is important to note that shoulder joint disease is more common in middle-aged patients&#xD;
      who are typically at greater risk of OSA. The baseline abnormalities in respiration in OSA&#xD;
      patients put them at increased risk of breathing abnormalities after the inter-scalene nerve&#xD;
      block. As a result, this surgery presents unique challenges to the anesthesiologist looking&#xD;
      to balance the benefit and risks of inter-scalene nerve blocks. Unfortunately, there are no&#xD;
      studies that look at the effect of anesthesia and inter-scalene blocks on breathing patterns&#xD;
      and oxygen saturation levels after discharge from outpatient surgery, as measured by&#xD;
      spirometry, sleep studies and pulse oximetry. We therefore propose to study the changes in&#xD;
      lung function tests and blood oxygen levels after an inter-scalene block and general&#xD;
      anesthesia for outpatient shoulder surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that future screening for out-patient shoulder surgery includes preoperative&#xD;
      overnight oxygen saturation measurement to identify patients at high-risk of changes in&#xD;
      oxygen levels. These patients may benefit from hospital admission after surgery for close&#xD;
      observation. Thus, this study could have significant implications for patient safety and&#xD;
      resource utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that all patients undergoing inter-scalene block and general anesthesia for&#xD;
      shoulder surgery will develop a doubling of significant oximetric changes based on standard&#xD;
      measures used in sleep studies. At least 8 patients are required for a study with 5% type-I&#xD;
      and 20% type-II error to prove this hypothesis. We plan to recruit 10 patients for the study,&#xD;
      with each patient doubling as their own control, to allow for a 20% (2 subjects) withdrawal&#xD;
      rate. We anticipate having 50 screen failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for this study is the incidence of postoperative sleep disordered&#xD;
      breathing (apnea-hypopnea index) defined as ≥5 episodes per hour of &gt;50% reduction of&#xD;
      expiratory air flow associated with a ≥4% reduction in oxygen saturation (referred to as ODI4&#xD;
      or oxygen desaturation index &gt; or = to 4 points drop in SpO2) that lasts for at least 10&#xD;
      seconds each as measured by the pulse oximeter. Secondary outcome measures include changes in&#xD;
      lung function tests and lowest and mean oxygen saturation levels during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational longitudinal study, wherein each patient acts as their own control.&#xD;
      10 patients with high risk prediction factors of OSA, as screened by the Perioperative- Sleep&#xD;
      Apnea Prediction Score(P-SAP) of ≥6, presenting for outpatient shoulder surgery, will be&#xD;
      approached for participation in this study.The P-SAP score consists of three demographic&#xD;
      variables (age&gt; 43 years, male gender and obesity), three medical history variables (history&#xD;
      of snoring, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension) and three airway measures (thick neck,&#xD;
      modified Mallampati class of 3 or 4 and reduced thyromental distance) and the number of&#xD;
      significant variables present in a given patient is the P-SAP score. The respiratory effects&#xD;
      of the anesthetic and block will be assessed by using pulse oximetry, spirometry, and&#xD;
      overnight sleep studies. Preoperative and postoperative values will be compared for&#xD;
      significant differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard monitoring will be employed during anesthesia including continuous&#xD;
      electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure measurement every 3 minutes, continuous&#xD;
      pulse oximetry, continuous capnography, continuous respiratory gas measurements,&#xD;
      neuromuscular function monitoring and continuous body temperature. Anesthesia technique will&#xD;
      include the preoperative interscalene block, followed by induction of anesthesia with&#xD;
      midazolam, fentanyl, propofol and muscle relaxation with succinylcholine and/or vecuronium as&#xD;
      indicated. This will be followed by tracheal intubation to protect the airway and ensure&#xD;
      conduit for adequate intraoperative controlled ventilation. Anesthesia will be maintained&#xD;
      with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), oxygen and air, titrated to ensure adequate depth&#xD;
      of anesthesia. Additional analgesia will be provided with bolus or continuous infusion&#xD;
      remifentanil as needed. Institutional protocols for prevention of nausea and vomiting will be&#xD;
      employed. At the end of the surgical procedure, full recovery of neuromuscular function will&#xD;
      be facilitated by use of neostigmine and glycopyrrolate, before removal of the endotracheal&#xD;
      tube. On arrival to the post anesthesia care unit, the patient will be monitored and managed&#xD;
      to ensure safe and comfortable recovery from the surgical procedure. Additional fentanyl will&#xD;
      be used for pain relief if needed and standard postoperative protocols for management of care&#xD;
      will be followed. Discharge from the PACU will be done on full recovery to satisfy&#xD;
      institutional PACU discharge criteria. Prior to discharge from PACU a second set of pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests will be performed by the research assistant. Patients will be discharged home&#xD;
      on standard postoperative analgesia including acetaminophen and hydrocodone or at surgical&#xD;
      resident's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Rationale The American Society of Anesthesiologists' practice guideline on&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea (Anesthesiology 2006) clearly supports the use of regional anesthesia&#xD;
      and analgesia as a way to reduce perioperative opioid usage. The technique described in our&#xD;
      proposal is essentially a &quot;single intervention&quot; as the anesthetic always includes a general&#xD;
      anesthesia. As this is the standard of care, we would not be able to employ a randomized&#xD;
      control design that denies this &quot;better care&quot; randomly to some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-random selection of cases to study the effects of general anesthesia vs. block would be&#xD;
      difficult because in the absence of the block, the patients get higher doses of opioids and&#xD;
      general anesthetics. This makes it impossible to compare perioperative sleep disturbances&#xD;
      with patients who get the additional inter-scalene block (as both opioids and general&#xD;
      anesthetic agents directly impact the severity of sleep related breathing disturbances) Also,&#xD;
      since these patients have medical or personal reasons to avoid the block, this would&#xD;
      negatively impact our likelihood of recruiting comparable study populations We will use a&#xD;
      longitudinal study design and pre-block and postoperative spirometry, as a way to account for&#xD;
      inter-individual differences in the effects of scalene block on lung volumes. At lower lung&#xD;
      volumes, patients are more likely to develop airway obstruction. As a first step, we would&#xD;
      like to test the influence of this lung volume change on the outcomes, rather than identify&#xD;
      which part of the anesthetic is causing the lung volume change. We therefore, will not&#xD;
      include a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-Operative Clinic Visit Patients will be approached based on the inclusion criteria&#xD;
           stated above. Patients will be screened and consented for the study during their visit&#xD;
           to the Dominos Preoperative Clinic. The subject will receive a phone call two days&#xD;
           before their scheduled surgery to answer any questions they may still have, to remind&#xD;
           them to use the portable sleep study machine (Compumedics Somte System Ambulatory&#xD;
           Cardio-respiratory system) at night, and to remind them to bring the Somte sleep device&#xD;
           with them on the day of their scheduled surgery. Once patients are consented for the&#xD;
           study, study measurements will begin the day prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-Operative At Home The study team will call the subject and arrange a convenient time&#xD;
           to come to the subject's house to teach them how to use a portable sleep study machine&#xD;
           that has an elastic band that fits around their chest and a pulse oximeter, which&#xD;
           records the level of oxygen in their blood. The subject will keep the portable sleep&#xD;
           study machine and pulse oximeter in their home and wear these two nights before the&#xD;
           scheduled shoulder surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pre-Operative Day Of Surgery On the morning of the scheduled surgery after the subject&#xD;
           arrives at the outpatient surgical center, the subject will be given a baseline lung&#xD;
           function test. After this procedure is completed, an interscalene nerve block will be&#xD;
           placed by the anesthesiologist before the subject goes to the operating room. An&#xD;
           interscalene nerve block is a procedure done to make the shoulder and arm numb for the&#xD;
           first hours after surgery to help with pain after an operation. It is an injection of a&#xD;
           numbing medication, similar to what a dentist would use, around or near the nerves in&#xD;
           the area that is being operated on to temporarily control pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Most shoulder surgeons, recommend having this nerve block placed by the anesthesiologist&#xD;
           as part of the normal standard of care before surgery. Before the block is placed, the&#xD;
           subject will have an IV put in and monitors hooked up, including heart rate, blood&#xD;
           pressure, breathing rate, and a pulse oximeter. These procedures are all part of normal&#xD;
           pre-operative care. Sedation or general anesthesia is used for the nerve block, as&#xD;
           decided by the anesthesiologist, but the subject is not completely asleep for the&#xD;
           procedure. An ultrasound machine and a nerve stimulating device are used to find the&#xD;
           correct nerves and help with accurate placement of the block at the base of the neck.&#xD;
           After the block is placed, the subject will go to the operating room and general&#xD;
           anesthesia for the shoulder surgery per normal standard of care will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Post-Operative Day of Surgery After the surgery another spirometry lung function test&#xD;
           will be performed. The subject will use the Somte device the night of surgery as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After Going Home The subject will wear the portable sleep study elastic band and pulse&#xD;
           oximeter at home for the first night after surgery. We will arrange for a convenient&#xD;
           time to have someone pick up these two items from the subjects home. The patient's&#xD;
           involvement in the study ends the day after surgery.&#xD;
