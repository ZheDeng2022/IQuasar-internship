  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men with early prostate cancer face a number of options which lie at the extremes of care. On&#xD;
      one hand, active surveillance involves monitoring the disease and on the other, immediate&#xD;
      treatment involves surgery or radiotherapy. The difference between these two strategies in&#xD;
      terms of reducing the chance of a man dying from his disease is small. Not only is the&#xD;
      benefit small, surgery or radiotherapy carry significant side-effects. These occur because of&#xD;
      damage to surrounding tissue resulting in incontinence of urine (1 in 5), erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction (1 in 2) and back-passage bleeding, diarrhoea or discomfort (1 in 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have been working on new forms of treatment that use heat, light or cold to&#xD;
      destroy tissue and minimise treatment-related harms. The investigators have not yet found one&#xD;
      that delivers the ideal treatment. The ideal treatment is one that can be done under local&#xD;
      anaesthetic, can effectively destroy areas of cancer, limit damage to surrounding tissues, is&#xD;
      repeatable, and adaptable to future discoveries such as molecular targeting of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators think magnetic thermoablation may be able to deliver on these ideal&#xD;
      attributes. Magnetic thermoablation involves injecting magnetic iron nanoparticles directly&#xD;
      into the cancer. When a magnetic field is applied close to them, these nanoparticles heat up&#xD;
      to very high temperatures that kill cells. Magnetic thermoablation does not use x-rays or&#xD;
      surgical incisions. The investigators have done a lot of the preclinical work already to&#xD;
      develop this type of treatment. The investigators now need to develop a system that can be&#xD;
      used to treat prostate cancer. However, before the investigators can do this, they need to&#xD;
      test whether the magnetic nanoparticles actually stay where they are injected. The&#xD;
      consequences of them moving to areas that they should not can be serious. First, the&#xD;
      nanoparticles could move away from the cancer which means the cancer will not be heated&#xD;
      effectively. Second, the nanoparticles could move to sensitive structures around the prostate&#xD;
      (back-passage, bladder, sphincter muscle controlling urine flow, nerves controlling&#xD;
      erections). If this happens, damage of those sensitive structures could occur leading to&#xD;
      side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a study to try and find out what happens to those nanoparticles.&#xD;
      The study will involve approaching men who are having their prostates removed by radical&#xD;
      surgery. If these patients agree to participate, the investigators will inject their prostate&#xD;
      with varying amounts of nanoparticles. The investigators will NOT heat them up. The&#xD;
      investigators will use special scans and, once they have had their surgery, to look at the&#xD;
      pathology specimens to see where the nanoparticles have gone. The actual nanoparticles are&#xD;
      not harmful but the process of injection can carry a small amount of harm. If the&#xD;
      nanoparticles stay where they are injected, the investigators will then be able to run&#xD;
      another study in which we treat men who have prostate cancer with magnetic thermoablation.&#xD;
