  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mortality related with cardiac arrest in anesthetized children has diminished over several&#xD;
      decades from 2.9 per 10000 anesthesias in 1961 to 0.21 per 10000 anesthesias in 2007.(1) Even&#xD;
      though the mortality rate related to pediatric anesthesia is much lower than before,&#xD;
      respiratory complications related with peri-operative cardiac arrest are as high as 27%&#xD;
      according to the Pediatric Peri-operative Cardiac Arrest (POCA) Registry.(2).Therefore,&#xD;
      peri-operative respiratory event (PRE) in pediatric anesthesia such as laryngospasm, stridor,&#xD;
      bronchospasm, desaturation and reintubation are crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stridor and reintubation occur after the children are extubated, mostly in the PACU period.&#xD;
      Laryngospasm, stridor, bronchospasm and wheezing can lead to desaturation and the need for&#xD;
      reintubation. Those PRE, especially peri-operative desaturation, can prolong PACU stay&#xD;
      especially if PRE develops in the PACU.(8,9) PRE occurring during the intraoperative period&#xD;
      can also prolong PACU stay if children are observed at PACU and not transferred directly to&#xD;
      the intensive care unit (ICU). Some children require oxygen therapy in the PACU and continue&#xD;
      at the ward. Some need endotracheal tube intubation with spontaneous breathing or are placed&#xD;
      on mechanical ventilator. Thai AIMS (10) reported that desaturation at PACU was associated&#xD;
      with re-intubation, prolonged mechanical ventilation and unplanned ICU admission. Oxygen&#xD;
      supplement need, prolonged mechanical ventilation or unplanned ICU admission can produce&#xD;
      extra days of hospitalization or increase the cost of hospitalization from extra-cost payment&#xD;
      eg; oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilator, cost of ICU stayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the short-term sequelae regarding cost of hospitalization of children who&#xD;
      develop PRE has never been evaluated or compared with the cost in children who do not develop&#xD;
      PRE. Higher cost of hospitalization after occurrence of PRE in anesthetized children will&#xD;
      have an impact to the hospital policy maker. Minimizing PRE can save on the cost of hospital&#xD;
      care to the public hospital or other health sectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we would like to compare days of hospitalization and cost differences of&#xD;
      hospitalization between children who develop PRE and children who do not develop PRE at a&#xD;
      tertiary care hospital in southern Thailand&#xD;

      1. Study design A prospective observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study setting Children aged &lt; 15 years who received general anesthesia in&#xD;
           Songklanagarind Hospital between November 2012 and December 2013&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study samples Inclusion criteria Children aged &lt; 15 years who received general&#xD;
           anesthesia and developed PRE or who had no PRE in Songklanagarind Hospital between&#xD;
           November 2012 and December 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ASA classification 4 or 5&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preoperative SpO2 &lt; 95% at room air&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Required preoperative endotracheal tube intubation (ETT) or mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Had congenital cyanotic heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Study size Sample size calculation The sample size calculation is based on a comparison&#xD;
      between groups of the outcomes of days and cost of hospitalization between PRE and non-PRE&#xD;
      group 5. Sampling technique Purposive identification of children aged &lt; 15 years old who&#xD;
      receive general anesthesia and develop Peri-operative respiratory event (PRE) between&#xD;
      November 2012 and December 2013.was selected for PRE or exposed group. Peri-operative&#xD;
      respiratory event (PRE) is defined as any respiratory event eg; laryngospasm, stridor,&#xD;
      wheezing, bronchospasm, reintubation, with or without desaturation, which occurs during the&#xD;
      intraoperative or PACU period. For non-PRE or non-exposed group, the matching with exposed&#xD;
      group on the same demographic data will be performed as below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Matching on the same year of anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Matching on the same type of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Matching on the same type of anesthesia After matching the same type of surgery and&#xD;
           anesthesia with exposed group, non-exposed group will be randomly selected by simple&#xD;
           random sampling technique if there are more than 4 suitable non-exposed subjects&#xD;
           available. The ratio of exposed group and non-exposed group will be 1 to 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6 Outcome variables The outcome variables are divided into days of hospitalization and&#xD;
           cost of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days of hospitalization Days of hospitalization is the days that the children stay in the&#xD;
      hospital until discharge home Days of hospitalization will be compared between PRE group and&#xD;
      non-PRE group Cost of hospitalization Cost of hospitalization is the total cost of&#xD;
      hospitalization including direct and indirect costs (25,26)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Direct cost are the hospital charge multiplied by cost-to-charge ratio (CCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital charges are all the medical cost including medication, procedure related with&#xD;
           anesthesia or surgery, material cost related with procedure, extra-cost from&#xD;
           complication postoperatively: ICU stay, cost of ventilator or oxygen therapy,&#xD;
           accommodation and meals charge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indirect costs are the cost including transportation (T), productivity loss eg; cost of&#xD;
           work leave (L)/day Therefore, cost of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  (hospital charge* CCR) + T + (L* days of hospitalization) According to the payer&#xD;
                perspective, the CCR is equal to 1 Cost of hospitalization will be compared between&#xD;
                PRE group and non-PRE group. The total cost of hospitalization from each group is a&#xD;
                transfer payment not a real payment because 80% of the hospital charge is&#xD;
                subsidized with the insurance coverage by government eg; universal coverage (UC),&#xD;
                social security, government corporation or Comptroller General Department, which&#xD;
                cannot reflect the societal cost. Moreover, we do not consider the cost of&#xD;
                hospitalization following the disease related groups (DRG) payment in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
                7. Independent variables Patient related factors&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Age&#xD;

&#xD;
                  7. History of parental smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
                  8. History of snoring: yes vs no&#xD;

&#xD;
                     - Related to anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Related to anesthesia and surgery Anesthetic related factors&#xD;
&#xD;
                1. Type of surgery 2. Choice of general anesthesia 3. Technique of general&#xD;
                anesthesia 4. Induction agent 5. Intubation agent 6. Inhalation agent used 7. Gas&#xD;
                mixed with oxygen used 8. Type of narcotic 9. Duration of anesthesia 10. Period of&#xD;
                PACU stayed 11. Developed any respiratory events : Yes vs no 12. Peri-operative&#xD;
                respiratory event 13. The period of respiratory events developed : intraoperative&#xD;
                vs PACU 14. The lowest oxygen saturation of respiratory events developed 15.&#xD;
                Postoperative on oxygen therapy 16. Postoperative on mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
                8. Data processing and analysis Descriptive component Analysis will be performed&#xD;
                with the R program version 2.14.1. Descriptive statistics will be computed for all&#xD;
                variables and include frequency, proportion, mean + SD and median (range).&#xD;
                Predictor variables will be categorical data either originally or if continuous,&#xD;
                categorized by selected suitable cut points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic component The days of hospitalization will be compared between PRE and non-PRE group&#xD;
      using simple linear regression model. The other explanatory variables that may be related to&#xD;
      prolonged hospitalization will be analyzed using multiple linear regression models if showing&#xD;
      some evidence of differing across outcome categories in univariate analysis (p ≤ 0.2). The&#xD;
      magnitudes and precision of associations will be indicated by adjusted coefficient and their&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total cost of hospitalization will be compared between PRE and non-PRE group using simple&#xD;
      linear regression model. Cost of hospitalization will be calculated both using CCR 0.4&#xD;
      (hospital perspective) and 1 (payer perspective). The other explanatory variables that may be&#xD;
      related to higher cost of hospitalization will be analyzed using multiple linear regression&#xD;
      models if showing some evidence of differing across outcome categories in univariate analysis&#xD;
      (p ≤ 0.2). The magnitudes and precision of associations will be indicated by adjusted&#xD;
      coefficient and their 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both days and cost of hospitalization, if the distribution is not suitable for linear&#xD;
      regression or the assumption of linear regression is not met, the other alternative analysis&#xD;
      methods may be preferred eg; logarithmic transform, quantile regression or Cox regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In multivariate modeling techniques, association with outcome will be considered significant&#xD;
      if the likelihood ratio p-values are ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
