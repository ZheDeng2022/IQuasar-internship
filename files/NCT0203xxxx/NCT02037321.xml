    <textblock>
      Vegetarian diets have been associated with a reduced risk of preventable diseases such as&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These effects may be mediated through direct or&#xD;
      indirect pathways. Although the high intakes of nuts, legumes, dietary fibre, whole grains,&#xD;
      and unsaturated plant oils have each individually been associated with lower risk of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and cardiovascular disease, so too has the displacement of red meats, processed&#xD;
      meats, and saturated animal fats. One of the most important considerations in moving from&#xD;
      animal-based diets to more plant-based diets is the replacement of animal proteins (e.g.&#xD;
      meat, fish, dairy, eggs) with vegetable proteins (e.g. legumes, nuts, and seeds). It is&#xD;
      unclear whether this particular replacement alone results in advantages for metabolic and&#xD;
      cardiovascular health. To improve evidence-based guidance for dietary guidelines and health&#xD;
      claims development, we propose to conduct a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of&#xD;
      the effect of plant-based protein in exchange for animal protein on blood lipids, glycemic&#xD;
      control, blood pressure, body weight, uric acid, markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&#xD;
      (NAFLD), and kidney function and injury. The systematic review process allows the combining&#xD;
      of the results from many small studies in order to arrive at a pooled estimate, similar to a&#xD;
      weighted average, of the true effect. The investigators will be able to explore whether the&#xD;
      effects of replacing animal-based protein for plant-based protein hold true across different&#xD;
      sexes, age groups, and background disease states and whether the effect depends on the&#xD;
      protein source, dose, or background diet. The findings of this proposed knowledge synthesis&#xD;
      will help improve the health of Canadians through informing recommendations for the general&#xD;
      public, as well as those at risk of heart disease and diabetes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Vegetarian diets have been associated with a reduced risk of preventable&#xD;
      cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It is unclear&#xD;
      whether the replacement of animal protein with vegetable protein has cardiometabolic&#xD;
      advantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To improve evidence-based guidance for dietary guidelines and health claims&#xD;
      development, we propose to conduct a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the&#xD;
      effects of plant-based protein in replacement for animal protein on cardiometabolic risk&#xD;
      factors including: (1) blood lipids, (2) glycemic control, (3) blood pressure, (4) body&#xD;
      weight, (5) uric acid, (6) markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and (7)&#xD;
      kidney function and injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The planning and conduct of the proposed meta-analyses will follow the Cochrane&#xD;
      handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The reporting will follow the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be&#xD;
      searched using appropriate search terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: Long term (≥ 3 weeks), randomized, controlled trials that investigate the&#xD;
      effect of exchange of plant proteins for animal proteins on the outcomes previously mentioned&#xD;
      in humans will be included. Studies that have an acute feeding design, are not randomized, or&#xD;
      lack a suitable control will not be included. Both isocaloric and non-isocaloric studies will&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Independent investigators (≥2) will extract information about study design,&#xD;
      sample size, subject characteristics, pulse form, dose, follow-up, and the composition of the&#xD;
      background diets. Mean±SEM values will be extracted for all outcomes. Standard computations&#xD;
      and imputations will be used to derive missing variance data. Risk of bias and study quality&#xD;
      will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Heyland Methodological Quality&#xD;
      Score (MQS), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The proposed syntheses will each assess a set of outcomes related to a different&#xD;
      area of cardiometabolic risk: (1) blood lipids (established therapeutic targets for the&#xD;
      prevention of cardiovascular disease - LDL-C, apo-B, non-HDL-C), (2) glycemic control&#xD;
      (glycated blood proteins, fasting glucose and insulin, and Homeostasis model assessment of&#xD;
      insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]), (3) body weight, (4) uric acid, (5) blood pressure (systolic&#xD;
      BP and diastolic BP), (6) markers of NAFLD (imaging and spectroscopy endpoints of liver fat&#xD;
      and biomarkers of hepatocellular injury [transaminases]), and (7) kidney injury and function&#xD;
      (creatinine, urea, creatine clearance, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR],&#xD;
      albumin-to-creatine ratio [ACR], albuminuria, proteinuria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Separate pooled analyses will be conducted for each area of cardiometabolic&#xD;
      control using the Generic Inverse Variance method. Random-effects models will be used even in&#xD;
      the absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more&#xD;
      conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity. Exceptions&#xD;
      will be made for the use of fixed-effects models where there is &lt;5 included trials&#xD;
      irrespective of heterogeneity or small trials are being pooled with larger more precise&#xD;
      trials in the absence of statistically significant heterogeneity. Paired analyses will be&#xD;
      applied to all crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be tested by Cochran's Q statistic and&#xD;
      quantified by the I2 statistic. Sources of heterogeneity will be explored by sensitivity and&#xD;
      subgroup analyses. A priori subgroup analyses will include study design, dose, vegetable&#xD;
      protein type, animal protein comparator, follow-up, baseline values, and study quality.&#xD;
      Significant unexplained heterogeneity will be investigated by additional post hoc subgroup&#xD;
      analyses (e.g. age, sex, level of feeding control [metabolic, supplemented, dietary advice],&#xD;
      washout in crossover trials, energy balance of the background diet, composition of the&#xD;
      background diet [total % energy from fat, carbohydrate, protein], change in cholesterol&#xD;
      intake, change in glycemic index, etc.). Meta-regression analyses will assess the&#xD;
      significance of subgroups analyses. Publication bias will be investigated by the inspection&#xD;
      of funnel plots and application of Egger's and Begg's tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: Results will be disseminated through traditional means such as&#xD;
      interactive presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and&#xD;
      publication in high impact factor journals. Innovative means such as webcasts with e-mail&#xD;
      feedback mechanisms will also be used. Knowledge Users will act as knowledge brokers&#xD;
      networking among opinion leaders and different adopter groups to increase awareness at each&#xD;
      stage. Four Knowledge Users will also participate directly as members of nutrition guidelines&#xD;
      committees. Target adopters will include the clinical practice, public health, industry,&#xD;
      research communities, and patient groups. Feedback will be incorporated and used to guide&#xD;
      analyses and improve key messages at each stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed project will demonstrate that the improvement in longterm health&#xD;
      measures. This demonstration will aid in knowledge translation related to the effects of&#xD;
      plant proteins on cardiometabolic risk, kidney disease management, and metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
      strengthening the evidence-base for dietary recommendations and health claims and improving&#xD;
      health outcomes through informing healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry&#xD;
      innovation, and guiding future research.&#xD;
