             includes medical history, physical examination (including a complete oropharyngeal&#xD;
             examination), ECG assessment, and clinical laboratory results (ie, serum chemistry,&#xD;

                  contraceptive film with spermicide)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  intrauterine device (IUD) with a low failure rate defined as less than 1% per&#xD;

             indication, chronic or intermittent; or subject has an underlying condition that can&#xD;
             reasonably be expected to require treatment with corticosteroids during the course of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has used topical corticosteroids in concentrations in excess of 1%&#xD;
             hydrocortisone or equivalent within 30 days before the SV; used a topical&#xD;
             hydrocortisone or equivalent in any concentration covering greater than 20% of the&#xD;
             body surface; or used any topical corticosteroids with an occlusive dressing; or has&#xD;
             an underlying condition (as judged by the investigator) that can reasonably be&#xD;
             expected to require treatment with such preparations during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has used any prohibited medication (see Section 5.3) within the prescribed&#xD;
             period before the SV.&#xD;
