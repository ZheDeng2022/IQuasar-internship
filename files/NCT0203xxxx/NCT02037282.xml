    <textblock>
      Despite currently available antivirals, influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      with 226,000 excess hospitalizations and 30,000-50,000 deaths each year in the United States&#xD;
      alone, and more therapies are needed in the armamentarium of anti-influenza medications&#xD;
      including humoral immunity-based agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of an anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous&#xD;
      immunoglobulin. Beginning with a low dose, subjects will receive anti-influenza intravenous&#xD;
      immunoglobulin (FLU-IVIG) and evaluated on Study Days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. The safety and&#xD;
      tolerability is evaluated using symptoms, clinical laboratory tests, and pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
      Utilizing serum antibody responses as determined by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays,&#xD;
      the dose will be escalated as immunogenicity is established....&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Females who are able to become pregnant (i.e., are not postmenopausal, have not&#xD;
                  undergone surgical sterilization, and are sexually active with men) must agree to&#xD;
