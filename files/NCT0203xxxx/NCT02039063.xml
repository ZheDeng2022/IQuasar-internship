    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) study to&#xD;
      evaluate mainly the safety and tolerability of 12-week repeated intravenous administration of&#xD;
      E6011. A total of 24 subjects will enroll into four cohorts. Six subjects per cohort will&#xD;
      receive repeated intravenous administration of E6011.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of Screening Phase, Observation Phase, Treatment Phase, Extension Phase,&#xD;
      and Follow-up Phase. Screening assessments will be performed between 42 to 2 days before&#xD;
      study drug administration. Observation Phase assessments will be performed a day before or on&#xD;
      a day of the initial administration to confirm the eligibility of subjects. The eligible&#xD;
      subjects will receive the repeated intravenous administration of E6011. E6011 will be&#xD;
      dissolved in physiological saline (nearly 100 mL) for approximately 30-minute infusion.&#xD;
      During the Treatment Phase, for the first and second cohorts, E6011 will be administered&#xD;
      every 2 weeks up to Week 10, a total of 6 times (with a double dose at Week 0). For the third&#xD;
      and fourth cohorts, E6011 will be administered at Weeks 0, 1 and 2, then every 2 weeks up to&#xD;
      Week 10, a total of 7 times. Under no safety concerns, Crohn's Disease Activity (CDAI) is&#xD;
      less than 150 or a decrease in CDAI from the Observation Phase is greater than 70 and a&#xD;
      subject intends to continue administrations, the subject will receive a total of 20&#xD;
      subsequent biweekly administrations (40 weeks) at stable dose (Extension Phase). Subjects&#xD;
      will be hospitalized for 24 hours after the initial and second administrations for postdose&#xD;
      monitoring and will have out-patient monitoring until 12 weeks after the initial&#xD;
      administration. If hospitalization is difficult after the second administration, the subjects&#xD;
      can be held at the hospital for 6 hours and then allowed to go home after confirmation of the&#xD;
      safety. Subjects who roll over onto the Extension Phase will have continued monitoring until&#xD;
      52 weeks after the initial administration. When the subjects complete (Week 12 or Week 52) or&#xD;
      discontinue the study, they will undergo an on-site follow-up 28 days after the study&#xD;
      completion or discontinuation and an off-site follow-up or telephone interview 70 days after&#xD;
      the final administration. The investigator will conduct full assessments of subjects safety&#xD;
      next day of the second administration (24 hours after the second administration) to confirm&#xD;
      presence of absence of study-related manifestations which may affect the study drug&#xD;
      administration of next cohort. When the sponsor is informed of investigator's judgment on the&#xD;
      sixth subject in each cohort, the appropriateness of next cohort will be judged based on the&#xD;
      safety data available including the judgment of individual investigator on the next day of&#xD;
      the second administration.&#xD;
