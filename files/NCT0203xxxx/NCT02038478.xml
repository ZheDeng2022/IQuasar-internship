  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The design of the study incorporates the following features:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This is a phase II study to determine the safety and therapeutic potential of a new&#xD;
           transplant approach (disease-free survival, graft versus myeloma effect) and to evaluate&#xD;
           its toxicity profile (immediate toxicity, graft-versus-host disease, graft rejection,&#xD;
           mortality) in a patient population with severe congenital anemias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient cohort to be studied: Those patients with severe sickle cell disease and&#xD;
           thalassemia who have risk factors for high mortality and morbidity related to their&#xD;
           disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Transplant Conditioning Regimen - Immunosuppression without myeloablation: Patients will&#xD;
           receive conditioning sufficient to allow donor lympho-hematopoietic engraftment without&#xD;
           complete marrow ablation. If the graft is rejected, the patient will reconstitute&#xD;
           autologous marrow function. We will use a combination of low dose irradiation,&#xD;
           Alemtuzumab (Campath®), and sirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor cell (PBPC) transplant: An unmanipulated&#xD;
           peripheral blood stem cell collection from a filgrastim (G-CSF) stimulated HLA-matched&#xD;
           donor should improve the chance of engraftment because of the high stem cell dose (5 x&#xD;
           106/kg CD34+ cells) and the presence of donor lymphocytes. To reduce the risk of GVHD,&#xD;
           patients will receive sirolimus before and after the transplant. The sirolimus will be&#xD;
           tapered as necessary to minimize any graft versus host disease while still maintaining&#xD;
           adequate chimerism.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor will receive filgrastim (G-CSF) 10&#xD;
      to16 µg/kg/d subcutaneously or intravenously for up to 6 days with apheresis collections of&#xD;
      PBPC on day 5 (and day 6 if required). The product will be collected by leukophoresis with a&#xD;
      goal of ≥ 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg, with a minimum of 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive a preparative regimen of Alemtuzumab to be infused on days -7 to -3,&#xD;
      followed by 300 cGy TBI given as a single dose on day -2. Sirolimus at a dose of 5mg/day to&#xD;
      maintain trough levels between 10-15ng/ml will be started on day -1. The PBPC graft targeted&#xD;
      to deliver 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg (at minimum, 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) will be infused on&#xD;
      day 0 On days +14, +30, +60 and +100 the chimeric status of patients will be assessed by&#xD;
      microsatellite analysis of the peripheral blood. More frequent monitoring may be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sickle cell patients with pulmonary hypertension will meet with a Pulmonary Medicine Consult&#xD;
      to determine appropriate management prior to SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with fever or suspected minor infection should await resolution of symptoms before&#xD;
      starting the conditioning regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron chelation must be discontinued &gt; 48 hours before initiating the conditioning regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroxyurea must be discontinued one day prior to initiating the conditioning regimen.&#xD;
