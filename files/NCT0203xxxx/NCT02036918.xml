  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      (mCRPC) undergoing treatment with sipuleucel-T for evidence of treatment-associated immune&#xD;
      activation in lymph nodes and peripheral blood.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of mCRPC patients planning to undergo therapy with sipuleucel-T&#xD;
      immunotherapy. Consenting patients will be randomized 3:1 between immediate sipuleucel-T&#xD;
      immunotherapy followed by lymph node biopsy (the post-treatment experimental group) or&#xD;
      immediate lymph node biopsy followed by sipuleucel-T immunotherapy (the pre-treatment control&#xD;
      group). Peripheral blood will be collected before, during, and after treatment with&#xD;
      sipuleucel-T and evaluated for evidence of sipuleucel-T induced immune activation. Lymph&#xD;
      nodes collected at biopsy will also be evaluated for evidence of sipuleucel-T induced immune&#xD;
      activation. Patients will be followed for 3 months for safety and 6 months for disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
