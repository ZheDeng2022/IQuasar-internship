  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unfortunately, despite the best clinical efforts with surgical intervention and chemotherapy&#xD;
      many patients with high grade and advanced stage renal cell carcinoma (RCC) progress and die&#xD;
      of their disease. In United States approximately 13,000 individuals die from RCC each year.&#xD;
      The primary cause of failure is microscopic spread of the tumor prior to complete surgical&#xD;
      extirpation of detectable disease and the heterogenous nature of the metastatic cells. These&#xD;
      cells are resistant to all forms of therapy including chemotherapy, radiation, and escape&#xD;
      from immune surveillance by a variety of mechanism. This results in low 5-year survival rates&#xD;
      (approximately 10%) in patients with metastasis. Novel immunotherapeutic strategies provide a&#xD;
      hope in circumventing the drug resistant RCC and improve the survival of patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery. RCC, like melanoma is one of the most immunogenic tumors and partial successes have&#xD;
      been achieved by a variety of immunotherapeutic strategies show partial successes. Although&#xD;
      vaccines have been highlighted in clinical trials since the mid-1970s with subcutaneous&#xD;
      autologous irradiated tumor cells most of these studies were in patients with advanced&#xD;
      disease. These approaches resulted in rare if any clinically relevant benefits to patients.&#xD;
      However, new vaccines in other cancers have shown responses equivalent to chemotherapy with&#xD;
      minimal toxicity [1]. The use of immune adjuvant strategies to increase the therapeutic&#xD;
      immune responses to tumor vaccines enhanced the proportion of patients with therapeutic&#xD;
      responses to vaccination to 10%-15% on average. Only during the last decade has it become&#xD;
      clear that failure of immune system to respond to the tumor vaccine is the main obstacle that&#xD;
      limits the efficacy of vaccine based immunotherapies. The precise reason for failure of the&#xD;
      immune system in cancers is very complex particularly as it relates to (1) the escape of&#xD;
      growing or metastasizing tumor from immune surveillance [2-4] and (2) low immunogenicity of&#xD;
      autoantigens associated with malignant neoplasms. This human clinical trial will investigate&#xD;
      the dose limiting toxicity of a polyvalent immune enhanced vaccine as a first step towards&#xD;
      developing a multipronged approach to triggering the immune system to attack and destroy&#xD;
      micrometastatic disease. Investigators hypothesize that the allogeneic RCC cell genetically&#xD;
      modified to express α (1,3)galactosyltransferase (enzyme responsible for producing the strong&#xD;
      xenoantigen on the cell surface of the cellular immunotherapy) will augment the efficacy of&#xD;
      cellular immunotherapy and thereby improve patient outcomes. In this Phase 1 Trial&#xD;
      investigators plan to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Hyperacute®-Renal (HAR)&#xD;
      immunotherapy in subjects with clinically metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
