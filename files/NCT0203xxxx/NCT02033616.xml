  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind study in which approximately 99 study patients will be randomized in a&#xD;
      2:1 ratio to receive either AVOVA-1 or MC. Patients eligible for randomization and treatment&#xD;
      will be those (1) who have undergone debulking surgery, (2) for whom a cell line has been&#xD;
      established, (3) who have undergone leukapheresis from which sufficient PMBC were obtained,&#xD;
      and (4) have an ECOG performance grade of 0 or 1 (Karnofsky score of 70-100%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this trial is death from any cause with the metric of OS from the&#xD;
      date of randomization. PFS will be a secondary endpoint and will be calculated as the time&#xD;
      from the date of randomization for treatment until subjective tumor progression or death.&#xD;
      Progression will be subjectively defined by the treating physician, and is expected to be&#xD;
      based on tumor marker levels (e.g. CA-125) and/or imaging. Secondarily, we will also define&#xD;
      PFS and OS from the date of debulking surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified into (1) no evidence of disease (NED) (no measurable or&#xD;
      non-measurable disease per RECIST and normal CA-125 levels) or (2) non-NED (measurable or&#xD;
      non-measurable disease per RECIST or elevated CA-125 levels).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0-1 (Karnofsky score of 70-100%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Successful establishment of an autologous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or&#xD;
             primary peritoneal cancer cell line by AIVITA Biomedical, Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must previously have been staged as having stage III [intraperitoneal (IP)]&#xD;
             or Stage IV (distant metastatic) ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal&#xD;
             cancer, have undergone surgical debulking, and have initiated or completed standard&#xD;
             adjuvant chemotherapy, which may include intravenous (IV) and/or IP chemotherapy using&#xD;
             standard regimens. Patients will be characterized as being NED or non-NED per physical&#xD;
             exam, CT and/or PET scans, and CA-125.&#xD;
&#xD;

             breast cancer diagnosed more than five years earlier).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection or other active medical condition that could be eminently&#xD;
             life-threatening, including active blood clotting or bleeding diathesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active central nervous system metastases at the time of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency, or disease process that involves the use&#xD;
