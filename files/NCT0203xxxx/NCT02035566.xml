  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People living in rural areas are at increased risk for poor health outcomes due to: long&#xD;
      distance to health care facilities, less available health care resources such as primary care&#xD;
      and specialty services, transportation problems, higher elderly population, poverty, high&#xD;
      uninsured rates and the lack of timely access to new technologies. Called Telehome Care&#xD;
      (THC), in the form of equipment in the home, may provide an innovative and potentially&#xD;
      cost-effective solution to enhancing chronic disease management services using technology and&#xD;
      may influence the reduction in emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations in rural&#xD;
      areas. However, telehealth research is still in its infancy, it is not well understood, and&#xD;
      is often done without an overarching scientific framework. The provision of in home health&#xD;
      monitoring and health education also may be a potential population based health research tool&#xD;
      for chronically ill patients. Demonstration of the possible benefits, patient acceptance and&#xD;
      satisfaction with THC requires a scientific approach as is used in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the nation's overall health status has improved over the past decade, disparities&#xD;
      persist among racial/ethnic minorities, low-income whites, the medically under-served, and&#xD;
      rural residents. The disparities in disease morbidity and mortality are a compelling crisis&#xD;
      and the elimination of such disparities is a national priority. With an aging population, the&#xD;
      changing demographics are increasing the disease burden attributable to chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad goal of this project is to evaluate the potential value of using THC technology in&#xD;
      chronically ill patients in rural Maryland, within the broad context of social determinants&#xD;
      of health. This builds upon a completed pilot research study in Garrett County on a small&#xD;
      scale THC program in rural Garrett County Maryland funded by the Maryland Cigarette&#xD;
      Restitution Fund (CRF) supported Other Tobacco Related Diseases (OTRD grant) (CBaquet PI) in&#xD;
      collaboration with the division of cardiology and department of family medicine. This&#xD;
      research study will look at whether the THC equipment in the home for 60 days will make a&#xD;
      difference in the health of the patients who get the unit in their home compared to the&#xD;
      patients who will not receive the unit for 60 days. And we will look at whether this&#xD;
      technology will support patient monitoring in the home. The use of the technology will be&#xD;
      evaluated to determine whether patient monitoring using THC equipment will influence the&#xD;
      hospitalization rates or emergency department visits for the patients. Evaluation of the&#xD;
      influence of the THC equipment on medical resource utilization in rural and medically&#xD;
      underserved communities will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telehome care (THC) may provide augmentation to current face to face monitoring through home&#xD;
      visits (usual method for Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) billable home health&#xD;
      services) of chronically ill patients and may provide an innovative and potentially&#xD;
      cost-effective solution to improving patients' outcomes and health care resource utilization&#xD;
      in rural areas. THC can support the coordination of care by assessing and monitoring patients&#xD;
      in their homes and giving health care providers appropriate feedback to assure patient&#xD;
      compliance with discharge instructions such as medication, home care and other aspects of&#xD;
      recommended treatment regimens. Further, THC may improve service coordination at discharge&#xD;
      and provide ongoing monitoring/engagement of patients, which is considered essential to&#xD;
      prevent re-hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Demonstration of the potential&#xD;
      benefits on care pathways, and patient and provider acceptance and satisfaction with the&#xD;
      technology requires systematic larger scale and scientifically rigorous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The project's broad goals are to evaluate the effects of telehome care (THC), a form&#xD;
      of remote patient home monitoring,(within the broad context of social determinants of health)&#xD;
      for chronic disease management among rural residing minority, low-income white, and medically&#xD;
      underserved patients by: (a) providing an innovative telehome care (THC) capacity and&#xD;
      infrastructure in two Maryland rural and medically underserved communities; and (b) using the&#xD;
      THC infrastructure to generate scientifically rigorous and high quality evidence on whether&#xD;
      the THC technology improves patient monitoring, influences clinical outcomes, and has an&#xD;
      impact on medical resource utilization. [NOTE: THC uses telecommunication technologies to&#xD;
      enable home health agency clinical staff at a rural home health agency to monitor their&#xD;
      patients in the home.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major aim for this study are: 1) To evaluate the impact of the 60-day in home THC&#xD;
      monitoring on medical resource utilization (emergency department visits; re-hospitalization&#xD;
      rates) and Quality of Life related to the management of Metabolic Syndrome/Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
      (DM), Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), Hypertension (HTN), and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary&#xD;
      Disease (COPD) compared to those patients that receive only an educational pamphlet.&#xD;
      Secondary aim hopes to support patient education to enhance acceptability, patient&#xD;
      independence and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, remote in-home patient monitoring using a THC system from VitelNet (telehealth&#xD;
      equipment vendor) will provide patient monitoring remotely or non billable services for the&#xD;
      experimental study arm for this project in addition to routine billable home health services.&#xD;
      This project does not substitute billable in-home monitoring of patients which is a&#xD;
      prerequisite for enrollment into this study(conventional home health services) but provides&#xD;
      remote monitoring for the study arm in addition to conventional/billable services delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to either THC use for 60 days with 60, 90 day follow up or &quot;usual&#xD;
      care&quot; with 60, 90 day follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, new knowledge will be generated by this study on methods for conduct of health&#xD;
      disparities research and training of non-research clinical personnel who are community based&#xD;
      in data collection and research ethics.&#xD;
