  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has previously been reported that men with prostate cancer are 1 ) reduced quality of life&#xD;
      after diagnosis and treatment, 2 ) neuroticism increases the reduction in QoL related to&#xD;
      treatment side effects, and 3) often have very involved and active spouses who seems to have&#xD;
      been handed over / taken over parts of the men's responsibility for their own health. We&#xD;
      postulate herein a new hypothesis that the stress level is elevated when harbouring&#xD;
      undetected prostate cancer. We will investigate whether those who are diagnosed with prostate&#xD;
      cancer already in beforehand have an increased degree of masculine stress ( experience of not&#xD;
      living up to their own perception of the ideal man ) and neuroticism in the typology. We will&#xD;
      examine different personality and QoL questionnaires for patients with elevated PSA, and&#xD;
      compare those whose clinical assessment later reveals prostate cancer, with three control&#xD;
      groups: 1) men with elevated PSA who are not diagnosed with prostate cancer, 2) men with&#xD;
      normal PSA treated for benign prostate enlargement and 3) patient with substantial risk of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (CRC) who undergo colonoscopy, with regard to increased level of masculine&#xD;
      stress and the personality trait neuroticism.&#xD;
