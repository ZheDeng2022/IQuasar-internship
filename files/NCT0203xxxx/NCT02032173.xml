  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Lucentis® (ranibizumab 0.5 mg) in&#xD;
      diabetic patients presenting with reduced visual acuity due to diabetic macular edema and&#xD;
      evaluating spacing out of follow-up after initial intensive treatment phase.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenteric, open-label, phase IIIb study, which comprised of 2 groups: the Main&#xD;
      Group and the Rescue Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's eligibility was assessed during a screening visit (Visit 1) which took place 14&#xD;
      days maximum before treatment initiation (Visit 2 [Day 0]). All patients were initially&#xD;
      included in the Main Group and were to receive an initial loading treatment (6 injections&#xD;
      during the intensive treatment phase i.e. every month from Day 0 to Month 5, followed by 2&#xD;
      additional injections at Months 8 and 11). Patients were to be followed-up every 3 months for&#xD;
      18 months (spaced-out follow-up period). Their visual acuity was to be checked at each study&#xD;
      visit (Months 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, and 23) to assess their response to treatment.&#xD;
      Patients who responded to treatment were maintained in the Main Group. Patients who did not&#xD;
      meet pre defined criteria were moved to the Rescue Group and treated at the investigator's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was terminated before any patient reached month 12.&#xD;

    <description>Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) letters were measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (EDTRS)-like chart while participants were in a sitting position at a testing distance of 4 meters. The range of EDTRS is 0 to 100 letters. A positive change from baseline of BCVA indicates improvement. Best value on the scale 100, worst 0. The number of participants with a stable BCVA (BCVA score at 6 months minus BCVA score at 24 months ≤4 letters) were reported.</description>

    <description>Retinal thickness is assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the study eye. The retina is the light-sensitive part of the eye. OCT is a laser-based, noninvasive, diagnostic system providing high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the retina. A negative mean change from baseline indicates an improvement and a positive mean change from baseline indicates a worsening.The absolute variations of the Central Retinal Thickness (CRT) was measured using a Spectral Domain-Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) at each visit. Values were calculated as a log OCT (=log[CRT/200]).</description>

The range of EDTRS is 0 to 100 letters. A positive change from baseline of BCVA indicates improvement. Best value on the scale 100, worst 0. The number of participants with a stable BCVA (BCVA score at 6 months minus BCVA score at 24 months ≤4 letters) were reported.</description>

        <title>Visual Acuity : Change of BCVA From Baseline in the Study Eye (ETDRS)</title>
        <description>Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) letters was measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (EDTRS)-like chart while participants were in a sitting position at a testing distance of 4 meters. The range of EDTRS is 0 to 100 letters. A positive change from baseline of BCVA indicates improvement. Best value on the scale 100, worst 0. The mean variation in BCVA was compared to the baseline BCVA value [Day 0] over a period of 24 months for patients in the Main Group.</description>

        <title>Central Retinal Thickness : Change of Log OCT From Baseline in the Study Eye</title>
        <description>Retinal thickness is assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the study eye. The retina is the light-sensitive part of the eye. OCT is a laser-based, noninvasive, diagnostic system providing high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the retina. A negative mean change from baseline indicates an improvement and a positive mean change from baseline indicates a worsening.The absolute variations of the Central Retinal Thickness (CRT) was measured using a Spectral Domain-Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) at each visit. Values were calculated as a log OCT (=log[CRT/200]).</description>

        <title>Visual Acuity : Change of BCVA From Baseline in the Study Eye (ETDRS) - Rescue Group</title>
        <description>Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) letters was measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (EDTRS)-like chart while participants were in a sitting position at a testing distance of 4 meters. The range of EDTRS is 0 to 100 letters. A positive change from baseline of BCVA indicates improvement. Best value on the scale 100, worst 0. The mean variation in BCVA was compared to the baseline BCVA value [Day 0] over a period of 24 months for patients in the Rescue Group.</description>

        <title>Central Retinal Thickness : Change of Log OCT From Baseline in the Study Eye - Rescue Group</title>
        <description>Retinal thickness is assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the study eye. The retina is the light-sensitive part of the eye. OCT is a laser-based, noninvasive, diagnostic system providing high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the retina. A negative mean change from baseline indicates an improvement and a positive mean change from baseline indicates a worsening.The absolute variations of the Central Retinal Thickness (CRT) measured using a Spectral Domain-Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) at each visit. Values were calculated as a log OCT (=log[CRT/200]).</description>
