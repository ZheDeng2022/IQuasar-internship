      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is frequent in subjects with liver cirrhosis, especially in those with liver disease&#xD;
      related to alcohol, hepatitis C, hemochromatosis and NASH, though it goes often unrecognised&#xD;
      if screened by measuring fasting glucose. These individuals might suffer from classical type&#xD;
      2 diabetes, in which β-cell dysfunction plays a major role, or from hepatogenous diabetes, in&#xD;
      which insulin resistance predominates. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) improves life&#xD;
      quality and expectancy of individuals with end-stage liver cirrhosis, thus representing the&#xD;
      elective treatment for these patients. OLT has different effects on glucose metabolism. On&#xD;
      the one hand, restoration of liver function reduces insulin resistance by improving hepatic&#xD;
      insulin clearance, thus favouring regression of hepatogenous diabetes. On the other hand, OLT&#xD;
      may worsen insulin secretion and sensitivity, due to immunosuppression and lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications, with return to free food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study is aimed at assessing insulin secretion and sensitivity by the use&#xD;
      of a mathematical modeling from oral glucose tolerance test in subjects with liver cirrhosis&#xD;
      undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), before and at various time points after&#xD;
      OLT over a 10-year follow-up and to establish the relation of alterations in insulin&#xD;
      secretion and sensitivity and their changes with transplantation with the development or&#xD;
      persistence of abnormalities of glucose metabolism after OLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are to assess in these individuals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the relation of alterations in insulin secretion and sensitivity and their changes with&#xD;
           transplantation with morbidity and mortality after OLT;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the relation of alterations in insulin secretion and sensitivity and their changes with&#xD;
           transplantation with the development or persistence of the metabolic syndrome and its&#xD;
           components (central) obesity , dyslipidemia and hypertension;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other pre-specified endpoints are to assess in these subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prevalence and incidence of unknown diabetes mellitus (and IFG/IGT);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prevalence and incidence of the metabolic syndrome and its components (central) obesity&#xD;
           , dyslipidemia and hypertension;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  morbidity and mortality from OLT-related and unrelated causes, including rejection,&#xD;
           infection, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Consecutive patients with normal fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels in waiting&#xD;
      list for OLT will be recruited from electronic records of the diabetic clinic of the&#xD;
      Endocrinology and Diabetes Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Cà Granda - Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico,&#xD;
      Milan, Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine clinical and laboratory data will be recorded at baseline and over the subsequent 10&#xD;
      years to obtain information about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, physical activity, family history of diabetes,&#xD;
           dyslipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, BMI and waist circumference,&#xD;
           total, LDL, HDL and non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, arterial blood pressure and&#xD;
           HbA1c);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, lower limb&#xD;
           ulcer/gangrene/amputation and coronary, carotid and lower limb revascularization,&#xD;
           endovascular/surgical) and deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  renal function (albumin/creatinine ratio, serum creatinine with estimation of glomerular&#xD;
           filtration rate [eGFR]);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  current glucose-, lipid- and blood pressure-lowering and anti-platelet or anti-coagulant&#xD;
           treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  other illnesses and non-cardiovascular deaths. In addition, glucose, insulin and&#xD;
           C-peptide levels from blood sample collected before and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120', 150,&#xD;
           and 180 min after a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be recorded. This test&#xD;
           is routinely performed to all cirrhotic subjects before and at various time points after&#xD;
           OLT. The response to OGTT will be evaluated by the use of a mathematical model to derive&#xD;
           measures of insulin secretion (Proportional and Derivative Control) and sensitivity&#xD;
           (OGIS, Oral Glucose Insulin Sensitivity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study was submitted for approval to the Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      Organization (Fondazione IRCCS Cà Granda - Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy) on&#xD;
      October 24, 2012. The transferral of patient records (concerning the 2007-2013 visits) from&#xD;
      the electronic database of the centre to the study database has been started on June 2013 and&#xD;
      will terminate on September 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolled patients will be followed for at least 10 years with (at least) yearly visits&#xD;
      and consultation of death records in case of drop-out for unknown reasons.&#xD;
