      Title: Phase II study of hypofractionated radio-chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus&#xD;
      oxaliplatin for unresectable nonmetastatic locally advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol code: IRST157.01&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: II&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: monocentric, prospective, open-label not randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Treatment: radio-chemotherapy schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GEMOX: Gemcitabine (GEM) 1000 mg/m2, day 1, and Oxaliplatin (OX) 100 mg/m2, day 2, every&#xD;
           2 weeks for 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypofractionated radiotherapy (35 Gy in 7 fractions in 9 consecutive days, one session&#xD;
           per day excluding Saturday and Sunday) administered 15 days after the 4th chemotherapy&#xD;
           cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further 4 cycles of GEMOX, starting 7-15 days after the end of the radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step A: primary objective = to evaluate the safety of radiotherapy treatment. Secondary&#xD;
      objective = the control of IM (internal margin) intra-fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step B: primary objective = to evaluate the proportion of the resectable patients after&#xD;
      radio-chemotherapy. Secondary objectives = overall Response Rate (ORR); safety profile of&#xD;
      combinated treatment;overall survival (OS); local progression free survival (LPFS) and&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that the probability to observe a toxicity involving the radiotherapy treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation with the new treatment is less than 20%, 11 patients are to be evaluated for&#xD;
      toxicity. If no toxicity involving the radiotherapy treatment discontinuation will be&#xD;
      observed in 11 patients, the treatment can be considered safe with a probability &gt; 90%. If 1&#xD;
      toxicity involving the radiotherapy treatment discontinuation will be observed, 7 more&#xD;
      patients needs to be recruited. If no further toxicity involving the radiotherapy treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation occurs, the treatment could be considered safe with a probability ≥ 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 2 or more toxicity involving the radiotherapy treatment discontinuation on 11 patients or&#xD;
      2 or more toxicity involving the radiotherapy treatment discontinuation on 18 patients will&#xD;
      be observed, the study will be stopped because not safe and another kind of radiotherapy&#xD;
      schedule must be designed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the radiotherapy treatment will be considered no toxic, the study will continue in Step B&#xD;
      : the goal of this phase II study is to increase the proportion of resectable patients of at&#xD;
      least 15% with the new radio-chemotherapeutic treatment. By using the single-stage design&#xD;
      (Gehan EA, J Chron Dis 1961) a total of 40 patients is required to be recruited in 2 years,&#xD;
      and a further one-year period of follow-up is requested. If at least 7 patients out of 40&#xD;
      enrolled will be resectable, the hypothesis that the proportion of resectable patients will&#xD;
      be less or equal to P1 (P1=the proportion of resectable patients with the new&#xD;
      radio-chemotherapeutic treatment) will be refused and the treatment could be considered&#xD;
      active.&#xD;
