    <textblock>
      Foretinib (GSK1363089) is an investigational, oral, multikinase inhibitor involved in&#xD;
      invasion, migration, and angiogenesis. This is a phase II, open label, uncontrolled,&#xD;
      parallel, multi-cohort, multicenter 2-stage study to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      foretinib and erlotinib combination therapy and foretinib monotherapy in genomic&#xD;
      subpopulations of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) subjects.&#xD;

             formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human non-small cell lung cancer tumor tissue; An&#xD;
             orphan receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1) chromosomal rearrangements as determined by&#xD;
             ectopic expression of the ROS1 protein by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or detection&#xD;
             of ROS1 rearrangements as determined by Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH); In&#xD;

             kinases [NRTK], Tyrosine kinase receptor for members of the glial cell line-derived&#xD;
             neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family [RET], etc.) may be enrolled as subsets of this&#xD;
             cohort if emerging data suggest they would likely respond to therapy. If genetic&#xD;

             Crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor naive subjects will be eligible for the study if&#xD;
             crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor is not available to them and participation in this trial is&#xD;
             their only option for targeted ROS1 treatment. For additional biomarker-driven&#xD;
             subsets, written documentation of entry requirements will be provided to&#xD;
             IRB(s)/IEC(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only one prior line of EGFR-TKI therapy immediately preceding enrolment into the&#xD;
             current study for Cohorts 1 or 2. Progression will have occurred on single agent&#xD;

             EGFR-TKI or crizotinib/ROS1 inhibitor within the past 3 months and may not have&#xD;
             received any intervening therapy of any kind (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc.)&#xD;
             between the time of progression on prior TKI and enrolment on this trial. Additional&#xD;
             requirements regarding prior therapy may be added for Cohort 3 subsets as they are&#xD;
             added to this study. Note: Subjects may continue treatment with the prior TKI on which&#xD;
             they progressed during this 30 day period at the discretion of investigator, but must&#xD;
             discontinue the prior TKI to allow 5 half-lives off drug prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             foretinib in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             expected EGFR-TKI toxicities of rash or diarrhea that are stable with intervention and&#xD;
             then only if agreed to by the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor and the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate baseline organ function as defined in the protocol. Note: Laboratory results&#xD;
             obtained during Screening should be used to determine eligibility criteria. In&#xD;
             situations where laboratory results are outside the permitted range, the investigator&#xD;
             may opt to retest the subject and the subsequent within range screening result may be&#xD;
