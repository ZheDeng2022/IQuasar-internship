  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of target effect-site controlled concentrations (TCI) of remifentanil have&#xD;
      gained increasing acceptance during cardiac surgery as regarding the resulting of hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability and early extubation. The use of low-dose opioid technique has been progressively&#xD;
      used nowadays because of its ceiling effect to attenuate cardiovascular responses to noxious&#xD;
      stimuli. We hypothesize that the use of low target remifentanil effect site concentrations&#xD;
      may provide comparable shorter times to tracheal extubation and hemodynamic stability to the&#xD;
      use of high remifentanil Ce during target-controlled propofol anesthesia for cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reducing the time to tracheal extubation and hence the duration of postoperative mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation could lessen postoperative complications, improve patients' outcome, shorten the&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and reduce the cost of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although high-dose opioid cardiac anesthesia has been shown to provide hemodynamic stability&#xD;
      and adequate depth of anesthesia in response to nociceptive stimulation, it may cause delayed&#xD;
      recovery and lengthening of the durations for postoperative ventilation support and (ICU&#xD;
      length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetic-based drug infusion systems, target-controlled infusion (TCI), can&#xD;
      rapidly and easily enables changes and maintenance of a constant blood concentration of&#xD;
      intravenous anesthetic drugs. We demonstrated that, the use of a TCI of sufentanil at&#xD;
      effect-site concentrations (Ce) from 0.2 to 0.3 ng/mL during TCI of propofol anesthesia for&#xD;
      valve surgery shortened the times to clinical recovery and extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remifentanil, a short-acting opioid-receptor agonist with a context-sensitive half-time of 3&#xD;
      to 5 minutes allowing rapid emergence from anesthesia, even after an infusion of several&#xD;
      hours. Compared with sufentanil (0.03 to 0.04 µg/kg/min), the use of remifentanil (0.5 to 1.0&#xD;
      µg/kg/min) during propofol anesthesia improved recovery of pulmonary function and shortened&#xD;
      postoperative hospital length of stay after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, a TCI of remifentanil at Ce of 1.5-5.0 ng/ml is more effective than a&#xD;
      constant-rate infusion in the inhibition of the stress response and the maintenance of the&#xD;
      cardiac autonomic nervous system balance during off-pump CABG. Similarly, the lowest&#xD;
      remifentanil Ce used in another study of explicit and implicit memory during cardiac surgery&#xD;
      under TCI propofol were 2 to 4 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas, others used a wide range of remifentanil Ce from 2 to 10 ng/ml. However, the use of&#xD;
      higher remifentanil Ce of 7 ng/ml (equivalent to 0.3 ng/kg/min) was associated with longer&#xD;
      time to extubation than sufentanil Ce of 0.3 ng/ml (256 (92) vs. 161.9 (32.9) min,&#xD;
      respectively).This precludes the favorable unique pharmacokinetic characteristics of&#xD;
      remifentanil . Thus the use of low target controlled infusions of remifentanil could allow&#xD;
      faster time to extubation and reduce the overall cost of the anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that using low remifentanil target-controlled Ce during TCI of propofol&#xD;
      anesthesia for cardiac surgery could decrease the time to tracheal extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be allocated randomly into the 3 groups by drawing sequentially numbered&#xD;
      sealed opaque envelopes that each contained a software-generated randomization code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be monitored by a pulse oximeter, 5-lead electrocardiograph (leads II and&#xD;
      V5) with continuous ST-segment recording, radial mean arterial blood pressure (MAP)&#xD;
      measurements, end-tidal carbon dioxide measurements, a central venous catheter or pulmonary&#xD;
      artery catheter (according to the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist), and rectal&#xD;
      and nasopharyngeal temperature measurements. Significant ischemic responses defined as&#xD;
      reversible ST-segment changes from baseline, namely a ≥1-mV ST-segment depression or a ≥2-mV&#xD;
      ST segment elevation that lasted for ≥1 minute. Response entropy (RE) and state entropy (SE)&#xD;
      will be monitored by applying entropy electrodes (Datex-Ohmeda Division, Instrumentarium&#xD;
      Corporation, Helsinki, Finland) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent anesthesiologist who is not involved in collecting patient data will initiate&#xD;
      the remifentanil Ce (the model of Minto et al) according to the patient's randomization code&#xD;
      and is allowed to titrate the target propofol and remifentanil Ce and to administer&#xD;
      vasoactive medications as needed. After preoxygenation, anesthesia induction by simultaneous&#xD;
      target propofol and remifentanil infusions using the TCI system with syringe pumps&#xD;
      (Injectomat TIVA Agilia, Fresenius Kabi, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target propofol Ce (model of Schnider et al 13) will be initiated at 1.0 µg/mL and&#xD;
      titrated stepwise by 0.5 µg/mL every 3 minutes until loss of consciousness and until an SE&#xD;
      &lt;50 and a difference &lt;10 between RE and SE (RE-SE) will be achieved. Cisatracurium, 0.2&#xD;
      mg/kg, will be given to facilitate tracheal intubation, and the lungs will ventilated with a&#xD;
      fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.5 to maintain normocapnia. The time from induction to&#xD;
      intubation will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be maintained by changing the propofol Ce at increments of 0.5 µg/mL (range,&#xD;
      1-4.5 µg/mL) every 3 minutes as necessary to maintain an SE &lt;50, RE-SE difference &lt;10, and&#xD;
      MAP and heart rate (HR) that are ≤20% of the baseline values. The remifentanil Ce will be&#xD;
      increased by a maximum of 3 increments of 0.5 ng/mL when the SE is &gt;50, the RE-SE difference&#xD;
      is &gt;10, and the MAP and HR are ≥20% of the baseline values despite a target propofol Ce &gt;4.5&#xD;
      µg/mL. When the SE is &lt;50 and the RE-SE difference is &lt;10, the propofol Ce will be decreased&#xD;
      gradually to ≥1 µg/mL, followed by gradual decreases in remifentanil Ce by 0.5 ng/mL, until&#xD;
      the randomized Ce will be achieved. Based on our pilot study, the authors considered that&#xD;
      using 0.5-ng/mL increments in remifentanil Ce would obtund the entropy and hemodynamic&#xD;
      responses to noxious stimuli. The authors expected that 4 remifentanil Ce increments of 0.5&#xD;
      ng/mL would double the infusion rate in the Ce 1-ng/mL group to 2 ng/mL ([0.5 ng/mL x 4] + 1&#xD;
      ng/mL). The HR and MAP will kept within 20% of baseline values by achieving an adequate depth&#xD;
      of anesthesia (SE &lt;50 and RE-SE difference &lt;10), optimum analgesia, and the administration of&#xD;
      nitroglycerin, 0.05 mg, and esmolol, 20 mg. Cisatracurium, 1 to 3 µg/kg/min, was used to&#xD;
      maintain surgical relaxation. All patients will receive tranexamic acid, 50 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Light anesthesia is defined as an episode with SE values &gt;50 and/or MAP and HR values &gt;20%&#xD;
      above baseline that lasted for &gt;3 consecutive minutes. The incidences of light anesthesia in&#xD;
      response to intubation, skin incision, sternotomy, maximal sternal spread, and sternal wire&#xD;
      placement will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic control will be standardized according to the authors' protocol. Hypotension&#xD;
      (defined as &gt;20% decrease in mean baseline MAP) will be treated with boluses of fluids,&#xD;
      phenylephrine 200 µg, ephedrine 5 mg, or epinephrine, 5 µg, as needed. Hypertension (defined&#xD;
      as &gt;20% increase in mean baseline MAP) will be treated by deepening anesthesia and&#xD;
      administering doses of nitroglycerin, 0.05 mg, or labetalol, 20 mg. Tachycardia (defined as&#xD;
      &gt;20% increase in mean baseline HR) will be treated with esmolol, 20 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All operations will be performed by the same surgeons. Heparin, 300 IU/kg, will be given to&#xD;
      achieve an activated coagulation time &gt;480 seconds. A standardized hypothermic&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) will be used. The target propofol Ce and remifentanil Ce will be&#xD;
      continued throughout surgery and CPB without any further adjustments because of CPB per se.&#xD;
      Before separation from CPB, all patients will be rewarmed to a rectal temperature of 36°C and&#xD;
      dobutamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and nitroglycerin will be used as needed. Heparin&#xD;
      will be neutralized with protamine sulfate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cisatracurium infusion will be discontinued and morphine 0.1 mg/kg will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously after surgical homeostasis is achieved. The target remifentanil Ce and propofol&#xD;
      Ce will be discontinued after skin closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HR, MAP, and cardiac and systemic vascular resistance indices will be recorded before&#xD;
      (baseline) and 15 minutes after endotracheal intubation, 15 minutes after skin incision, 15&#xD;
      minutes after sternotomy, and 15 and 45 minutes after discontinuing CPB. Patients will be&#xD;
      transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in a ventilated state using the synchronized&#xD;
      intermittent mandatory mode or the pressure support mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesia will be provided by intravenous paracetamol, lornoxicam, and&#xD;
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), morphine 1 mg, with a lockout interval of 8 minutes and a&#xD;
      maximum 4-hourly limit of 30 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extubation criteria included alertness, a train-of-four ratio ≥0.9, spontaneous breathing&#xD;
      with a tidal volume &gt;5 mL/kg, respiratory rates &gt;10 and &lt;28 breaths/min, a maximum&#xD;
      inspiratory pressure ≤-20 cm H2O, stable hemodynamics without high doses of inotropic support&#xD;
      or severe arrhythmias, bleeding &lt;100 mL/h, a core temperature &gt;35.5°C, a urine output &gt;0.5&#xD;
      mL/ kg/h, an arterial carbon dioxide tension ≤45 mmHg, an arterial oxygen tension &gt;100 mmHg,&#xD;
      and a fraction of inspired oxygen &lt;0.5. Blood samples will be drawn before CPB and 3, 12, 24,&#xD;
      and 48 hours after CPB to measure cardiac troponin I levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative explicit awareness will be assessed on the second postoperative day by asking&#xD;
      the patients 3 simple questions in a standard interview: What was the last thing you remember&#xD;
      happening before you went to sleep? What is the first thing you remember happening on waking?&#xD;
      Did you dream or have any other experiences while you were asleep?&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent investigator blinded to the study groups who is not involved in the patients'&#xD;
      management will collect the patient data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A priori power analysis of the published data showed that the normally distributed mean time&#xD;
      to tracheal extubation after remifentanil, 7 ng/mL, was 256 minutes (SD, 92 min). An a priori&#xD;
      power analysis indicated that a sample size of 23 for each group was sufficiently large to&#xD;
      detect 35% changes in the time to extubation after the administration of remifentanil Ce, 7&#xD;
      ng/mL, with a type-I error of 0.017 (0.05/3 possible comparisons) and a power of 90%. This&#xD;
      sample size was increased by 10% to compensate for patients dropping out during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of our amending our protocol on 2015 to compare the low remifentanil Ce 1, 2, and 3&#xD;
      ng/ml rather than the earlier considered 3 higher concentrations (2, 5, and 7 ng/ml) because&#xD;
      of the noted significant haemodynamic compromise that required high use of&#xD;
      inotropes/vasopressors, this earlier considered sample size calculation can not be valid&#xD;
      anymore. Thus we recruited cases in a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study showed that the normally distributed mean time to tracheal extubation after&#xD;
      remifentanil, 3 ng/mL, was 39 minutes (SD, 14.92 min). An a priori power analysis indicated&#xD;
      that a sample size of 21 for each group was sufficiently large to detect 15 min difference in&#xD;
      the time to extubation after the administration of remifentanil Ce, 3 ng/mL, with a type-I&#xD;
      error of 0.017 (0.05/3 possible comparisons) and a power of 90%. This sample size was&#xD;
      increased by 10% to account for patients dropping out during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Repeated-measures&#xD;
      analysis of variance will be used to analyze serial changes in the patient data at different&#xD;
      times. The Fisher exact test will be used for categorical data. Repeated measures analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA) will be used for continuous parametric variables and the differences will be&#xD;
      corrected by the post hoc Bonferroni test. The Kruskal-Wallis test will be performed for&#xD;
      intergroup comparisons for nonparametric values and post hoc pairwise comparisons were&#xD;
      performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum t test. The data will expressed as means (SD), number&#xD;
      (percentage), or median [range]. A p value &lt;0.05 is considered to represent statistical&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
