      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Hormones are naturally occurring chemicals in your body. Ghrelin is a hormone that is&#xD;
      mainly produced by the stomach and stimulates appetite. Some studies suggest it may stimulate&#xD;
      alcohol craving and use. Drugs have been developed that block ghrelin. Researchers want to&#xD;
      know if people can tolerate a particular drug that blocks ghrelin. It will be given at two&#xD;
      dose levels, combined with alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine if a drug that may decrease alcohol consumption when given along with alcohol&#xD;
      is safe and tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy adults 21-65 years old who have 14 (women) to 21 (men) drinks a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No one of childbearing potential can participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 3 inpatient clinic visits; each will last 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will have physical exam and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will have breath tests for alcohol and smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will answer health and mood questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will measure their reaction to smelling alcohol and tasting a sweet drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will eat only the food provided by the clinic. They will keep a food diary 1 day&#xD;
           before each stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will be randomly assigned to take the study drug or placebo 5 times each stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 3, they will drink alcohol after taking the drug. They will give many blood&#xD;
           samples that day through a tube inserted in their skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smokers can take smoke breaks. Once, they will smoke a cigarette through a device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One week after the last stay, participants will have a follow-up visit to answer&#xD;
           questions.&#xD;

      Objective: Ghrelin is a 28-aminoacid peptide that stimulates appetite and food intake. It is&#xD;
      an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR1a). Preclinical&#xD;
      studies suggest that ghrelin modulates alcohol reward processing. Furthermore, findings from&#xD;
      a translational human lab study at Brown University (PI: Leggio) indicate that intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) ghrelin administration, compared to placebo, results in an acute increase in craving for&#xD;
      alcohol during a cue-reactivity experiment in alcoholic individuals. Therefore, an orally&#xD;
      bioavailable, ghrelin receptor antagonist, that can pass through the blood brain barrier&#xD;
      holds particular promise as an AD treatment. This project has been recently funded by NCATS.&#xD;
      The goals of this protocol are to generate preliminary evidence on the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      a ghrelin receptor antagonist (GHSR1a antagonist), PF-05190457, an existing molecule&#xD;
      available under the NIH-Industry Pilot Program at NCATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Non-treatment seeking heavy drinkers (n =20). The study will be conducted&#xD;
      in the Inpatient Unit at the NIAAA Intramural Clinical Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Single-blind dose-escalating placebo-controlled inpatient study using&#xD;
      PF-05190457, in non-treatment seeking heavy drinking subjects. This Phase 1b study will be a&#xD;
      within-subject design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Primary objectives will be to determine: 1) the number of adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs) experienced, compared between all three PF-05190457 dose categories (0mg or placebo,&#xD;
      50mg, and 100mg b.i.d.); and 2) the total concentration of the drug, compared between the two&#xD;
      non-placebo drug doses (50mg and 100mg b.i.d.), when co-administered with alcohol. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that both doses of PF-05190457, as compared to placebo, will not result in an&#xD;
      increased number of AEs. As a secondary objective, we will determine whether PF-05190457&#xD;
      dose-dependently affects the subjective effects of alcohol and craving. We will include&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) investigations conducted at University of&#xD;
      Rhode Island (URI; Associate Investigator: Akhlaghi). The PK/PD component will include (i)&#xD;
      measuring total, unbound or tissue concentrations of the drug using liquid chromatography&#xD;
      tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and evaluation of biomarkers of effect and (ii)&#xD;
      estimation of PK and PD parameters by the use of conventional and semi-mechanistic modeling&#xD;
      approaches to assist in identifying an optimal dosing regimen of the drug in AD.&#xD;
