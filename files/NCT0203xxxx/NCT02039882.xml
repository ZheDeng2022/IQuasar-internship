    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndrome is defined as myocardial infarction or ischemia as evidenced by&#xD;
      significant coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization/revascularization or&#xD;
      reversible defect seen on stress test. Each year approximately 8-10 million patients undergo&#xD;
      an emergency department evaluation for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the United&#xD;
      States Up to 8%of patients who have myocardial infarction (MI) are inadvertently discharged.&#xD;
      Unnecessary admissions for presumed myocardial disease result in health care costs that are&#xD;
      estimated to exceed 5 billion dollars annually Currently, the cardiac biomarkers troponin and&#xD;
      Creatine phosphokinase (CPK-MB), in conjunction with ECG changes are used to evaluate a&#xD;
      patient routinely for ACS. However, these tests have limitations for identifying most&#xD;
      patients who have ACS in a rapid fashion. Purine molecules such as inosine and hypoxanthine&#xD;
      and have been shown to also be biomarkers of acute MI. High pressure liquid chromatography&#xD;
      (HPLC) is the traditional method of analysis of these purines. The HPLC method however&#xD;
      requires hours to assess biomarkers, as do the more traditionally used troponin and CK-MB&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the investigator has developed a rapid chemo luminescence method for detecting&#xD;
      purine biomarkers. This modality can provide an expeditious (requires less than 4 minutes to&#xD;
      complete analysis), bedside method of analysis for ACS through routinely acquired blood&#xD;
      samples. In this study the investigator will compare the results of the chemo luminescence&#xD;
      method with the gold standard HPLC method, and results of the traditional cardiac markers&#xD;
      troponin and Creatine phosphokinase (CK-MB) in patients undergoing an evaluation for ACS.&#xD;
      Details of noninvasive and invasive cardiac assessments performed as part of the routine&#xD;
      evaluation by the clinician for myocardial assessment and intervention in conjunction with&#xD;
      biomarker assessment will be obtained. The investigator hypothesize that the rapid chemo&#xD;
      luminescence biomarker assessment will identify patients with ACS faster than traditional&#xD;
      diagnostic methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to assess the role of rapid assessment of purine biomarkers in&#xD;
      identifying patients who may have ACS.&#xD;

      Fifty patients presenting for evaluation of ACS (acute coronary syndrome) in the hospital&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) will be studied and 50 control subjects without known cardiac&#xD;
      disease that are age ± 5years and sex matched. Pregnant women, children and prisoners as well&#xD;
      as individuals with hemoglobin less than 9 g/dL will be excluded. Blood will be drawn to&#xD;
      analyze for the biomarkers inosine, and hypoxanthine at the time standard of care biomarker&#xD;
      troponin is sampled. The levels of the biomarkers inosine and hypoxanthine will be measured&#xD;
      by our research laboratory, using LC/mass spectrometry(MS) and luminescence methodologies.&#xD;
      Troponin levels will be measured as standard of care in the routine fashion by the hospital&#xD;
      laboratory (CLIA accredited) at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center. Demographic&#xD;
      and clinical information will be obtained and the clinical course followed. EKG data, cardiac&#xD;
      angiography and other cardiac assessment data (e.g. ECHO, rest and stress myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion imaging) that is performed as part of the standard of care evaluation will be&#xD;
      collected and evaluated. A maximum of (6) 10 ml blood samples (heparin anticoagulant) for&#xD;
      analysis will be drawn throughout the hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty Five patients presenting with ACS not requiring an immediate (PCI) Percutaneous&#xD;
      Coronary Intervention: will have samples drawn at 0, 3 and 6 hours after vascular access has&#xD;
      been acquired. Blood samples for analysis as standard of care for troponin are at 0, 3 and 6&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty Five patients presenting with ACS requiring an immediate PCI Percutaneous Coronary&#xD;
      Intervention will have blood samples drawn at time 0, immediately after intervention, 1, 3&#xD;
      and 6 hours. Troponin samples will be acquired and analyzed as per routine practice (time 0,&#xD;
      3, 6 hour) and (2) additional troponin samples will be collected (after reperfusion and 1&#xD;
      hour). The analytical costs of these (2) samples will be charged to the department of&#xD;
      Nephrology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty age ± 5years and sex matched control subjects without known cardiac disease will have&#xD;
      timed blood samples drawn at 0, 3 and 6 hours. These samples will be analyzed for troponin,&#xD;
      inosine and hypoxanthine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patient samples will serve as the control group. Control subjects will be recruited&#xD;
      from the Virginia Commonwealth University Health Systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the acute nature of the patients presenting with chest pain, a 10 ml sample of blood&#xD;
      will be drawn at the time of the first routine blood draw for clinical purposes and the&#xD;
      samples reserved until patient consent can be discussed. If patient consents to participate&#xD;
      the sample will be retained and added to other study samples. If declined the sample will be&#xD;
      discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxanthine and Inosine levels will be measured by LC/MS (mass spectrometry) methods.&#xD;
      Luminescence technology used will be utilizing Lumistar Optima Microplate Reader. Analysis of&#xD;
      samples will be completed in batches throughout the study.&#xD;
