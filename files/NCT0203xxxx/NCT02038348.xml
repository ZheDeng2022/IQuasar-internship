  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma incidence is increasing in most developed countries. At the metastatic stage, the&#xD;
      prognosis is usually poor. Major advances have been obtained over the last 3 years with the&#xD;
      development of therapies targeting the MAP kinases pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vemurafenib (zelborafÂ®) is approved in France since 2012 as first treatment of metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma carrying a B-RAF mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For growth, the tumor needs an adequate supply of nutrients to allow the synthesis of&#xD;
      macromolecules and a contribution in carbon elements to ensure the production of energy. The&#xD;
      nutrition demand is met through greater availability of nutrients via tumor angiogenesis and&#xD;
      through increased intracellular penetration of nutrients via specific upregulation of&#xD;
      transport systems and metabolic pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scanner is the imaging method most commonly used for the evaluation of therapeutic response.&#xD;
      Such a method gives a morphological indication but does not evaluate the metabolic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the development of functional imaging techniques and the advent of positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET), it is now possible to obtain an assessment of the metabolic activity of&#xD;
      tumors. The use of 18F-FDG to assess therapeutic responses to targeted therapies is fairly&#xD;
      recent. The advantage of this approach is well documented for GIST and non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer. In melanoma, the metabolic response to 18F-FDG is much faster than the response to&#xD;
      TAP scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-FDG tracer that targets glucose metabolism, is the most sensitive functional imaging in&#xD;
      melanoma, which has hindered the development of other tracers such as 18F-FDOPA and 18F-FLT.&#xD;
      The 18F-FDG TEP can thus be used in the initial staging and follow-up of the disease, a&#xD;
      situation in which it can replace the TAP scanner, additional brain imaging remaining&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of metabolic imaging to study the response to targeted therapies in melanoma has been&#xD;
      the subject of only one publications. There was a trend toward improved progression-free&#xD;
      survival in patients with high metabolic response at day J15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For melanoma, the diagnostic sensitivity of PET 18F-FDOPA is lower than that of 18F-FDG (64%&#xD;
      versus 95%). In contrast, the 18F-FDOPA tracer has the advantage of allowing a brain&#xD;
      assessment, which is critical in melanoma that gives frequent metastases in the central&#xD;
      nervous system. There has never been any evaluation of the metabolic response to targeted&#xD;
      therapies such as BRAF inhibitors PET with 18F-FDOPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a monocentric prospective preliminary study to explore&#xD;
      the potential usefulness of the metabolic PET imaging with 18F-FDOPA in the evaluation of&#xD;
      metabolic response of B-RAF mutated metastatic melanoma treated with vemurafenib.&#xD;
