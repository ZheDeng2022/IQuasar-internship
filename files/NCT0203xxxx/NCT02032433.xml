  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CTN-0051 assesses the comparative effectiveness of extended release injectable naltrexone&#xD;
      (XR-NTX, Vivitrol®), an opioid antagonist recently approved and indicated for the prevention&#xD;
      of relapse to opioid dependence, versus buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX, Suboxone®), a high&#xD;
      affinity partial agonist indicated for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence, as&#xD;
      pharmacotherapeutic aids to recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted in 8 NIDA Clinical Trials Network affiliated community based treatment&#xD;
      programs. Up to 600 eligible participants will be randomized to treatment with XR-NTX or&#xD;
      BUP-NX for 24 weeks (sufficient to include 350 participants who are randomized more than 72&#xD;
      hours after their last opioid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the study is to estimate the difference, if one exists, between XR-NTX&#xD;
      and BUP-NX in the distribution of the time to relapse (i.e.., loss of persistent abstinence)&#xD;
      during the 6-month trial. Secondary objectives are to: (1) compare outcome on XR-NTX versus&#xD;
      BUP-NX across a range of clinical safety and secondary efficacy domains, and (2) explore&#xD;
      demographic and, clinical, and genetic predictors of successful treatment and moderators of&#xD;
      differential effectiveness (i.e., what variables may help clinicians choose which of these&#xD;
      treatments is best for a given patient).), and (3) collect a limited dataset to permit&#xD;
      analyses of economic costs and benefits of the two treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For opioid-dependent patients in the U.S. and most of the rest of the world, detoxification&#xD;
      or detoxification followed by short term residential treatment, with the goal of achieving&#xD;
      long-term abstinence from opioid misuse is a mainstay of treatment. Nonetheless, the majority&#xD;
      of patients treated in this way will relapse to opioid misuse, leading to a costly and&#xD;
      ineffectual cycle of readmission for repeated detoxifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of CTN-0051 is to foster adoption of new relapse-prevention&#xD;
      pharmacotherapies in community-based treatment programs (CTPs) where these could have a&#xD;
      substantial public health impact. To this end CTN-0051 assesses the comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      of extended release injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX, Vivitrol®), an opioid antagonist recently&#xD;
      approved and indicated for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, versus&#xD;
      buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX, Suboxone®), a high affinity partial agonist indicated for&#xD;
      maintenance treatment of opioid dependence, as pharmacotherapeutic aids to recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted in 8 CTN-affiliated CTPs that provide or partner with detoxification&#xD;
      services (inpatient/residential) which have the capacity to maintain participants opioid-free&#xD;
      for approximately 3-7 days, have the capacity to provide medication-assisted therapy, and can&#xD;
      provide a minimum of one group or individual counseling session per week during the 24-week&#xD;
      treatment period. Up to 600 eligible participants will be randomized to treatment with XR-NTX&#xD;
      or BUP-NX for 24 weeks (sufficient to include 350 participants who are randomized more than&#xD;
      72 hours after their last opioid). To maximize generalizability, the point of randomization&#xD;
      is flexible, from shortly after program admission until just prior to program discharge. A&#xD;
      data analysis modification (assessment of whether the early vs. late randomizers have a&#xD;
      differential treatment effect and if so, time to relapse will be estimated for early and late&#xD;
      randomizers separately) will occur if differential treatment initiation is a problem for&#xD;
      cases randomized prior to completing detoxification (i.e., significantly fewer early&#xD;
      randomizers are able to complete detoxification and XR-NTX induction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the study is to estimate the difference, if one exists, between XR-NTX&#xD;
      and BUP-NX in the distribution of the time to relapse (i.e., loss of persistent abstinence)&#xD;
      during the 6-month trial. The primary outcome measure will be the time to the event, with the&#xD;
      event called relapse. Secondary objectives are to: (1) compare outcome on XR-NTX versus&#xD;
      BUP-NX across a range of clinical safety and secondary efficacy domains, and (2) explore&#xD;
      demographic and, clinical, and genetic predictors of successful treatment and moderators of&#xD;
      differential effectiveness (i.e., what variables may help clinicians choose which of these&#xD;
      treatments is best for a given patient), and (3) collect a limited dataset to permit analyses&#xD;
      of economic costs and benefits of the two treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toward the end of the 24-week treatment period, participants are referred for follow-up care&#xD;
      in the community (which could include pharmacotherapy if desired and available), and&#xD;
      follow-up outcomes are assessed at week 28 and week 36 after randomization. For participants&#xD;
      receiving BUP-NX, who do not wish to continue, or for whom community resources are not&#xD;
      available, the study provides a two-week BUP-NX taper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an ancillary genetics study we plan to study functional variants in three genes (OPRM1,&#xD;
      OPRK1 and PDYN), known to affect the dynamic response to opioid receptor ligands. These&#xD;
      variants will be evaluated in CTN-0051 for their contribution to treatment retention,&#xD;
      abstinence, and depression. Blood collection for DNA extraction will occur at the same time&#xD;
      that blood is collected for medical safety and liver function evaluation, precluding the need&#xD;
      for an additional needle-stick. Coded blood samples for the genetics studies will be sent to&#xD;
      the NIDA Center for Genetics Repository.&#xD;

    <description>Relapse occurs if the participant is using any non-protocol prescribed opioids regularly starting at day 21 post-randomization or thereafter. Operationally, relapse is defined as either: (a) four consecutive opioid use weeks, or (b) seven consecutive days of use by self-report. A use week is defined as any week during which a participant self-reports at least one day of use during that week, provides a urine sample positive for non-protocol opioids, or fails to provide a urine sample. Self-report of opioid (heroin or prescription opioids) and other substance use is ascertained at each weekly study visit using the Timeline Follow-Back for each day leading back to the previous visit. Urine is collected at each study visit and tested for opioids. A missed UDS counts as a use week.</description>

        <title>Time to Relapse (Intent to Treat Population)</title>
        <description>Relapse occurs if the participant is using any non-protocol prescribed opioids regularly starting at day 21 post-randomization or thereafter. Operationally, relapse is defined as either: (a) four consecutive opioid use weeks, or (b) seven consecutive days of use by self-report. A use week is defined as any week during which a participant self-reports at least one day of use during that week, provides a urine sample positive for non-protocol opioids, or fails to provide a urine sample. Self-report of opioid (heroin or prescription opioids) and other substance use is ascertained at each weekly study visit using the Timeline Follow-Back for each day leading back to the previous visit. Urine is collected at each study visit and tested for opioids. A missed UDS counts as a use week.</description>
