    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 clinical trial will evaluate MIV-150, a third generation non-nucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitor, co-formulated with a potentially potent agent, zinc acetate for the&#xD;
      prevention of HIV infection in women. This is the first in-human of PC-1005 (MIV-150/zinc&#xD;
      acetate in a carrageenan gel), the first study in which females will be exposed to MIV-150,&#xD;
      the first time MIV-150 will be administered topically, and the first time MIV-150 will be&#xD;
      administered intravaginally.&#xD;

      This study will begin with a safety run-in, which is an open label, single-arm safety run-in&#xD;
      with 5 women receiving PC-1005 once daily for 3 consecutive days. Safety and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      will take place after each dose. the participants from the run-in will not be eligible for&#xD;
      the main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study participants will be randomized 4:1 to the study gels: 24 randomized to&#xD;
      PC-1005 (active) and 6 randomized to HEC gel (placebo). The study product will be applied&#xD;
      vaginally once daily for 14 days with clinical and laboratory assessments at baseline&#xD;
      (enrollment) and after the 1st, 2nd, 8th, 9th, and 14th doses, and a safety follow-up visit 7&#xD;
      days after the 14th dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the run-in and main study will be requested to be sexually abstinent starting&#xD;
      immediately after the Screening Visit until study exit.&#xD;
