    <textblock>
      Allogeneic human umbilical cord tissue-derived stem cells injected intravenously (IV) once&#xD;
      per day for 7 days is a safe and will induce a therapeutic effect in multiple sclerosis (MS)&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will assess primarily safety and secondary efficacy endpoints of&#xD;
      allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) administered to 20 patients with&#xD;
      MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is freedom from treatment associated adverse events at&#xD;
      4,12 and 52 weeks post treatment. Secondary objective will be efficacy as assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, week 12 and 52 and will be quantified based on the following: Neurological&#xD;
      assessment of the MS functional composite assessment which comprises of Expanded Disability&#xD;
      Status Scale (EDSS), the expanded EDSS (Rating Neurologic Impairment in Multiple Sclerosis,&#xD;
      the Scripps neurological rating scale (NRS), paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT), the&#xD;
      nine-hole peg test, and 25-foot walking time. Short-form 36 (SF-36) quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire and gadolinium enhanced MRI scans of the brain and cervical spinal cord will&#xD;
      also be performed at the indicated time points.&#xD;
