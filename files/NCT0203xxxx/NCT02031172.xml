  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to to see if changes in visual reading function correlate with&#xD;
      changes in optical and retinal image quality. We hypothesize that changes and deterioration&#xD;
      in tear film quality and dynamics may have a negative effect on reading function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with or without dry eye syndrome may enroll.&#xD;

    <description>Measures tear film stability, and visual function will be taken before and after a sustained silent reading task. The reading task will take place over 30 minutes, and a comprehension assessment will be given after reading. After completion of the reading task, measures of corneal sensation and structural imaging will be performed. The results from each of 3 cohorts will be compared to ascertain the differences between those populations with and without dry eye.</description>

        We plan to recruit 50 subjects from 3 populations (dry eye, Sjogren's, and healthy&#xD;
        controls). Subjects will be recruited regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity; and&#xD;
        enrollment will based on specific criteria as described below.&#xD;
      </textblock>
    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        General inclusion criteria for all subjects will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ages 50 to 89 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capacity to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported literacy (i.e. a &quot;Yes&quot; answer to the question &quot;Have you learned how to&#xD;
             read?&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion criteria for the dry eye group will include both of the below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A previous diagnosis of dry eye syndrome by an eyecare specialist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular Surface Disease Index total scoring of 13 or above&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion criteria for the Sjögren's syndrome group will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - A previous diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome by an immunology specialist, per ACR criteria&#xD;
        22&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion criteria for normal control subjects will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No previous history of dry eye diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular Surface Disease Index total scoring of 12 or under&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total corneal and conjunctival staining score of 0&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A binocular vision below 20/25 (with habitual correction)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any ocular surgery within the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mental issues, illiteracy, or language problems which might possibly interfere with&#xD;
             reading ability&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of taking or current use of topical prescription anti-inflammatory eyedrops&#xD;
             (including, cyclosporine and steroids as well as any glaucoma eyedrops). Subjects who&#xD;
             are willing to discontinue their treatment for at least a period of 30 days can be&#xD;
             placed on a &quot;wash out period&quot; as per the discretion of the investigator and subject&#xD;
             safety, and be eligible at the end of this period, given all other criteria have been&#xD;
             met. Otherwise, subjects on these medications will be excluded.&#xD;
