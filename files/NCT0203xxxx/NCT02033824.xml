    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of dHACM in reducing scar tissue&#xD;
      formation in craniectomy patients as well as facilitating reoperation and repair.&#xD;
      Specifically this study compares craniectomy without dHACM application to craniectomy with&#xD;
      placement of dHACM between the galea and dura over dural suture line and/or exposed&#xD;
      parenchyma.&#xD;
