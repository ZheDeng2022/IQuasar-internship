    <measure>Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Year post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Scale (HHS) was developed to assess the results of hip surgery, and is intended to evaluate various hip disabilities and methods of treatment in adults. The original version was published 1969. The HHS is an outcome measure administered by a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or a physical therapist.&#xD;
The HHS is a measure of dysfunction so the higher the score, the better the outcome for the individual. The maximum score possible is 100. Results can be interpreted with the following: &lt;70 = poor result; 70-80 = fair, 80-90 = good, and 90-100 = excellent.</description>

    <measure>Oxford Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Hip Score (OHS) is a standard patient-reported outcome measure tool designed to assess function and pain in patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR). Each item has five possible responses. Responses go from 1 = least difficult to 5= most difficult. Item scores are summed to give a total score from anywhere between 12 and 60. The lower the score, the better the outcome.</description>

    <measure>Radiographic Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Radiolucencies (mm), Stability, Angle of Inclination (degree). The degree of osseous-fixation will be graded using the following system; 0-1mm radiolucencies will be classed as fixated; &gt;1-2mm radiolucencies will be classed as not fixated; &gt;2mm radiolucencies will be classed as unstable. If more than 50% of the 3 zones have radiolucencies of greater than 1mm, then the implant is considered not to be well fixed.&#xD;
The angle of Inclination is the angle between the plane of the acetabular cup and the transichial line.</description>
