&#xD;
          3. Subject having indications to undergo embolotherapy consistent with clinical and&#xD;
             pre-procedural angiographic assessment for spermatic vein origin varicocele&#xD;
             (unilateral and/or bilateral) or pelvic congestion syndrome (pelvic venous&#xD;
             incompetence).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is able and willing to comply with site standard medical follow-up, including&#xD;
             one month follow-up visit.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Co-morbid conditions that place the subject at an unacceptable surgical risk (e.g.,&#xD;
             severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatic failure, cardiac disease,&#xD;
             autoimmune disorders or conditions of severe immunosuppression).&#xD;

             would interfere with the endpoints of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject with previous pelvic surgical intervention or embolotherapy for varicocele or&#xD;
             ovarian varices that would interfere with the endpoints of this study, including but&#xD;
             not limited to, recurrent varicocele or ovarian varices.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any clinical evidence that the investigator feels would place the subject at increased&#xD;
             risk with the deployment of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject has planned concomitant procedure at the time of the embolization (e.g., coil&#xD;
             embolization, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject is participating in another study of a device, medication, biologic, or other&#xD;
             agent within 30 days or could, in the opinion of the investigator, impact the results&#xD;
             of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject has other medical, social or psychological problems that in the opinion of the&#xD;
