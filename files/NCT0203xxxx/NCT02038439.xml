  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Translation of new knowledge from research into evidence-informed health care is a shared&#xD;
      obligation of the clinical and the scientific communities. Unfortunately, studies of quality&#xD;
      of care continue to show that this goal is substantially unrealized. One main barrier is lack&#xD;
      of quick and easy identification, appraisal and synthesis of current best evidence.&#xD;
      Clinicians' information have 5 to 8 questions about individual patients per daily shift, but&#xD;
      face a large volume of 3000 articles published every day, accessible in many scattered&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address theses problems, McMaster's Health Information Research Unit (Hamilton, Ontario,&#xD;
      Canada) has developed and implemented &quot;McMaster Premium LiteratUre Service Federated Search&quot;&#xD;
      (MPFS), an online search engine that provides a unique 1-stop search and organized access to&#xD;
      current best evidence in daily practice. However additional barriers need to be overcome for&#xD;
      clinicians to actually search and use this evidence in their practice. Theses include&#xD;
      logistical barriers (time constraints, forgotten questions), as well as educational barriers&#xD;
      (eg, lack of awareness of the &quot;architecture&quot; of evidence, limited searching skills, and lack&#xD;
      of reference standards among peers for finding best evidence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized trial seeks to test 3 innovative online interventions among clinicians&#xD;
      registered to MPFS to overcome these barriers and increase the quantity and quality of&#xD;
      searching for current best evidence to answer clinical questions. These interventions build&#xD;
      on effective models for the teaching of clinical skills at the point of care, so that&#xD;
      clinicians are facilitated in using the search engine as a clinical tool, and perceive&#xD;
      evidence retrieval skills as true clinical skills.&#xD;

      1. Rationale &amp; Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           One main barrier to achieving evidence-informed care by clinicians is lack of quick and&#xD;
           easy identification, appraisal and synthesis of current best evidence. Clinicians'&#xD;
           information needs are considerable - but about 3000 articles are published in Medline&#xD;
           every day. Numerous evidence-based resources have been developed to filter and process&#xD;
           the evidence, but although increasingly used by clinicians, each offer a fragmented and&#xD;
           scattered view of information, and none provides comprehensive topic coverage or&#xD;
           satisfactory updating.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To address theses problems, McMaster's Health Information Research Unit (Hamilton,&#xD;
           Ontario, Canada) has developed and implemented &quot;McMaster Premium LiteratUre Service&#xD;
           Federated Search (MPFS)&quot;, an online search engine that provides a unique 1-stop search&#xD;
           and organized access to current best evidence in daily practice. MPFS provides both&#xD;
           alerts to users about new research in their chosen disciplines, and a novel federated&#xD;
           search function, with the particular feature of organizing information according to the&#xD;
           &quot;pyramid of evidence-based resources&quot;, with the most clinically applicable evidence at&#xD;
           the top. Thus MPFS simultaneously retrieves evidence from Studies (&quot;Medline&quot;, both&#xD;
           filtered and unfiltered, at the bottom), then Systematic reviews; Synopses of studies&#xD;
           and systematic reviews (selected for methodological rigor and clinical relevance), and,&#xD;
           at the top level, online widely used Summaries (e.g.&quot;Best Practice&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Combining features of the current best evidence-based resources is not enough to&#xD;
           increase access and use of current best evidence, as shown by the relatively low&#xD;
           utilization of searching features among the hundreds of clinicians currently registered&#xD;
           at McMaster University and using the alerting system. Additional well-known barriers&#xD;
           that need to be overcome include logistical barriers (time constraints, forgotten&#xD;
           questions, and simplicity of using one single albeit limited resource), as well as&#xD;
           educational barriers (eg, lack of awareness of the &quot;architecture&quot; of evidence and limits&#xD;
           of other single resources, lack of knowledge and experience of what federated searches&#xD;
           can offer, limited searching skills, and lack of reference standards among peers for&#xD;
           finding best evidence).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           This trial seeks to test 3 innovative online interventions among clinicians registered&#xD;
           to MPFS to overcome these barriers and increase the quantity and quality of searching&#xD;
           for current best evidence to answer clinical questions. These interventions build on&#xD;
           effective models for the teaching of clinical skills at the point of care, so that&#xD;
           clinicians are facilitated in using the search engine as a clinical tool, and perceive&#xD;
           evidence retrieval skills as true clinical skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Study design: Randomized Factorial Controlled Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Setting and Participants: The trial will be conducted among postgraduate and&#xD;
                faculty MD registered in MPFS and working in the teaching hospitals and clinics of&#xD;
                McMaster University (see eligibility criteria below)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Participating clinicians will be randomized to 3 online interventions (see&#xD;
                description below) in a factorial design (A x B x C), whose permutation results in&#xD;
                8 allocation arms (A+B+C, A+B, A+C, B+C, A, B, C, no intervention, see details&#xD;
                below)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Randomization: will be computer-generated, stratified training level (post-graduate&#xD;
                MD, faculty MD), and baseline frequency of searching for evidence on MPFS.&#xD;
                Registrants will be randomly allocated to each study arms. Allocation will be&#xD;
                concealed from research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Blinding and control group: Although participants cannot be blinded to the&#xD;
                interventions, they will not be told of the different features offered, and all&#xD;
                will receive usual searching features of MPFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Primary and secondary outcomes (see below).&#xD;
