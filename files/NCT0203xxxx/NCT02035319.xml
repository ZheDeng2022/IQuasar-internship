  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study investigators want to learn more about capillary malformations which&#xD;
      are also known as port wine stains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are asking children with capillary malformations (port wine stains) to be in&#xD;
      the research, because investigators do not have a good idea of what to expect from the&#xD;
      current treatments of these malformations. These malformations are treated with laser as&#xD;
      clinically indicated and there are no standardized methods to assess improvement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Capillary malformations, specifically port wine stains, occur in one of every 12,000 live&#xD;
      births (0.3% of newborns) with 90% on the face or neck. Pulsed dye laser therapy targeted at&#xD;
      hemoglobin (i.e., 585 nm Â± 5 nm) is commonly used to lessen the visual coloration and&#xD;
      increase skin lightness. Presently, the outcomes of laser treatment are difficult to predict,&#xD;
      in part due to the difficulty in quantifying the tissue changes with visual inspection&#xD;
      methods. Quantitative skin imaging methods are currently being applied to measure the&#xD;
      features and response to treatment for infantile hemangiomas. The current study proposes to&#xD;
      apply these methods in the treatment of capillary malformations, e.g., port wine stains. The&#xD;
      purpose is to determine (1) the effects of laser treatment on capillary malformations (using&#xD;
      quantitative skin imaging methods and standard clinical assessment and (2) the relationships&#xD;
      between the imaging outcomes immediately after treatment and after healing. In the&#xD;
      within-subject design we aim to measure color, temperature, blood concentration and tissue&#xD;
      mechanical properties for the capillary malformation relative to an un-involved site at&#xD;
      baseline (prior to treatment), immediately following laser surgery and over time. Imaging&#xD;
      outputs will be compared to the standard clinical evaluation in up to 100 patients from the&#xD;
      Hemangioma and Vascular Malformation Center (HVMC) at regular intervals to determine changes&#xD;
      over time. Skin sites will be imaged for color (size, erythema, blue color, lightness, excess&#xD;
      erythema, uniformity), thermography, blood concentration and tissue mechanical properties&#xD;
      (e.g., elasticity). Skin characteristics will be examined at baseline, prior to surgery,&#xD;
      immediately following laser treatment, just prior to discharge and at 2 and 4-6 weeks&#xD;
      following treatment. For subjects receiving multiple laser treatments, the procedures will be&#xD;
      repeated after each surgery. Enrollment will occur over 2 years. Patients will be evaluated&#xD;
      for a period of up to 6 months following the last surgery. We expect the research to provide&#xD;
      objective measures to clarify the effectiveness of laser treatment and permit effective&#xD;
      measurement of tumor response for therapeutic protocols.&#xD;
