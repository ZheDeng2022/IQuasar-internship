      The proposed project will investigate the effects of probiotics on anxiety and associated&#xD;
      psychological and physiological factors in humans. The therapeutic potential of probiotics&#xD;
      for reducing anxiety and other factors associated with a disrupted microbiome will be&#xD;
      assessed in a double-blind placebo-crossover design. Based on the research findings to date,&#xD;
      it is hypothesized that probiotics will reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms.&#xD;

      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human microbiome, also known as microflora, is comprised of the bacterial colonies of the&#xD;
      body. Although bacteria are commonly associated with illness, there are good bacteria known&#xD;
      as probiotic bacteria that grow naturally in the microbiome of the human gut. Probiotic&#xD;
      bacteria are live microorganisms and consist of approximately 400 different bacterial strains&#xD;
      that support life in their host organism. The gut microbiome, also known as intestinal flora,&#xD;
      plays a role in normal human development, digestion, body weight, nutrition, and immune&#xD;
      system regulation, in addition to influencing various neurological functions. It has been&#xD;
      found that environmental factors including antibiotics, illness, stress, and diet can alter&#xD;
      an individual's microbiome through their effects on probiotic bacteria situated in the gut&#xD;
      microflora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although probiotic bacteria grow naturally in the human gut, acquisition of the gut&#xD;
      microbiome varies in each individual depending on various factors, including birth method and&#xD;
      early diet. Research suggests that newborns' first exposure to bacteria and acquisition of&#xD;
      the first components of their microbiome takes place during birth. Infants acquire their&#xD;
      mothers' bacteria as they pass through the vaginal canal during childbirth. Research&#xD;
      indicates that, for this reason, children born through cesarean section have a less diverse&#xD;
      microbiome (Dominguez-Bello, Costello, Contreras, Magris, Hidalgo, Fierer, &amp; Knight, 2010).&#xD;
      Research also suggests that following birth, infants continue to acquire their gut microbiome&#xD;
      in the first two years of life under the influence of dietary nutrition. For example, in a&#xD;
      study of six breast-fed and six formula fed infants, those who consumed a specially enriched&#xD;
      formula that contained both prebiotics (substances that feed probiotics) and a variety of&#xD;
      probiotic bacteria had a much more diverse intestinal flora than those who received breast&#xD;
      milk (Harmsen, Wildeboer-Veloo, Raangs, Wagendorp, Klijn, Bindels, &amp; Welling, 2000). Please&#xD;
      note that this study does not negate the benefits of breast milk and was intended to assess&#xD;
      the effect of heightened prebiotic and probiotic concentrations in a baby formula that was&#xD;
      chemically similar to breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because probiotic bacteria are acquired naturally from environmental sources in addition to&#xD;
      growing normally in the human body, it is safe for humans to consume probiotics. Furthermore,&#xD;
      Health Canada has labeled probiotics a natural health product (NHP) safe for human&#xD;
      consumption. Common foods we eat each day contain probiotic bacteria that enrich our&#xD;
      intestinal flora. For example, yogurt and cheese contain probiotic bacteria. There has been a&#xD;
      recent upsurge in interest on probiotics amongst researchers as the positive effects of&#xD;
      probiotics on the gut microbiome and recognition of their great therapeutic potential for a&#xD;
      wide variety of conditions increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Microbiome and Physical Health&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that probiotic bacterial strains, such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli,&#xD;
      aid in the treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome and other gastrointestinal and bowel&#xD;
      diseases by inhibiting the colonization and growth of bacteria that cause disease. In&#xD;
      addition, the gut microbiome is believed to play an integral role in regulating healthy&#xD;
      immune system functioning. Immune system functioning is maintained by homeostatic&#xD;
      relationships with the microbiome, which in turn plays a role in the development of lymphoid&#xD;
      tissues and the immune system (Hooper, Littman, &amp; Macpherson, 2012). Imbalances in gut&#xD;
      microflora have been associated with impaired immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Microbiome and Mental Health&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbiome has been associated with a variety of mental health conditions. Researchers&#xD;
      have dubbed this connection &quot;the gut-brain axis&quot; (Forsythe, Sudo, Dinan, Taylor, &amp;&#xD;
      Bienenstock, 2010). Bacteria in the gut have been found to produce GABA and serotonin,&#xD;
      although the exact mechanism by which these gastrointestinally produced neurotransmitters&#xD;
      influence brain functioning is unknown at this time. However, disruptions in the microbiome&#xD;
      have been associated with autism, as well as with anxiety and depressive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imbalances in the intestinal flora as a result of early antibiotic use, for example, have&#xD;
      also been implicated in the development of autism. Probiotics have been shown to aid in the&#xD;
      treatment of autistic symptoms by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and inhibiting&#xD;
      the growth of harmful bacteria. Researchers have identified an overgrowth of certain strains&#xD;
      of Clostridia that produce propionic acid in the guts of autistic children. Propionic acid is&#xD;
      a neurotoxin that crosses the blood-brain barrier and could disrupt normal brain development&#xD;
      in early childhood (Parracho, Gibson, Knott, Bosscher, Kleerebezem, &amp; McCartney, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disruptions in the development of normal microflora have also been associated with&#xD;
      alterations in stress reactivity that continue into later life. For example, various&#xD;
      metabolic pathways, such as those involving bile acids and steroid hormone synthesizers, that&#xD;
      are necessary for bodily functions depend on a healthy microbiome (Antunes, Han, Ferreira,&#xD;
      Lolic, Borchers, &amp; Finlay, 2011). Research shows that antibiotic use early in life leads to a&#xD;
      reduction in intestinal flora and diversity and may be involved in causing a physiological&#xD;
      state of alert, akin to a trait known as &quot;anxiety sensitivity&quot;. Anxiety sensitivity refers to&#xD;
      a tendency in some individuals to monitor their physiological state continuously and&#xD;
      misinterpret normal fluctuations in homeostasis as life threatening events. In animal&#xD;
      studies, consumption of probiotics leads to reductions in anxiety-related behaviours as well&#xD;
      as alterations in the GABA receptors that mediate stress-related hormones (Bravo, Forsythe,&#xD;
      Chew, Escaravage, Savignac, Dinan, Bienenstock, &amp; Cryan, 2011). The beneficial effects of gut&#xD;
      microbiota on stress and anxiety have also been evidenced when comparing germ-free mice&#xD;
      (i.e., mice with no microbiome) to mice with rich intestinal microflora. Mice with rich&#xD;
      intestinal microflora show less stress reactivity than germ-free mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Proposal&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project will investigate the effects of probiotics on anxiety and associated&#xD;
      psychological and physiological factors in humans. The therapeutic potential of probiotics&#xD;
      for reducing anxiety and other factors associated with a disrupted microbiome will be&#xD;
      assessed in a double-blind placebo-crossover design. Based on the research findings to date,&#xD;
      it is hypothesized that probiotics will reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy-five male and female participants over the age of 18 years will be recruited through&#xD;
      advertisements posted in various locations around the Wolfville area, as well as local&#xD;
      newspapers and social media sites such as Facebook. Online advertisements including a link to&#xD;
      a website containing information about study eligibility and requirements&#xD;
      (http://www.probioticstudy.com) will be posted on the Facebook groups of various&#xD;
      organizations in Wolfville, including Inner Sun Yoga Center, Wolfville Farmer's Market, and&#xD;
      EOS Fine Foods community board, as well as in local newspapers such as the Grapevine and the&#xD;
      Advertiser (see Appendix A). Information brochures will be distributed to the Valley Regional&#xD;
      Hospital, Eastern Kings Memorial Health Centre, and Mud Creek Medical Co-op Ltd. for display&#xD;
      in their waiting rooms (see Appendix B). Advertisement posters will also be posted in the&#xD;
      Wolfville area (including the Acadia Athletic Complex community board, Wolfville Shopper's&#xD;
      Drug Mart, and Wolfville Post Office community board) with pull-tabs containing the website&#xD;
      URL for the study information page (see Appendix C). An all-staff email will also be sent to&#xD;
      Acadia University staff targeted at non-academic occupations for recruitment (see Appendix&#xD;
      D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because there is limited research on participants under the age of 18, participants must be&#xD;
      at least 18 years of age. Participants must also live within driving distance of Wolfville,&#xD;
      Nova Scotia, be able to come to Wolfville for appointments with the researchers, and have a&#xD;
      valid email address. Exclusionary criteria for participation include having an&#xD;
      academic-related occupation, including University/College professor or student (to avoid&#xD;
      cohort effects related to specific fluctuations in conditions associated with high stress&#xD;
      during the academic term); having HIV/AIDS; currently undergoing chemotherapy; having a&#xD;
      diagnosed serious metabolic, immune, or digestive problem, including cancer, Crone's disease&#xD;
      or ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, Addison's disease or other form of adrenal&#xD;
      insufficiency; currently using medication for anxiety; taking probiotic capsules; taking&#xD;
      antibiotics; or having any other serious medical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once potential participants have reviewed the information on the study website and indicated&#xD;
      that they wish to participate, they will be directed to an informed consent page. By checking&#xD;
      the box and clicking &quot;Submit&quot; on the online informed consent page, they will indicate their&#xD;
      consent to participate and will be directed to a demographic questionnaire (see Appendix E).&#xD;
      The questionnaire will contain questions about the participants' health, medical history, and&#xD;
      foods they consume. All data collected online during this study will be housed on a Canadian&#xD;
      server to avoid Patriot Act issues associated with data housed on U.S. servers. The&#xD;
      researcher will schedule appointments with participants who give online consent to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out over a 22-week period, during which the participants will&#xD;
      consume an oral probiotic for 10 weeks and a placebo (an inert substance with no therapeutic&#xD;
      effect) for 10 weeks, with a two-week washout period in between. Participants will receive&#xD;
      either the probiotic or the placebo for the first ten weeks and the other for the second 10&#xD;
      weeks. Neither the participant nor the researcher administering the probiotics and placebos&#xD;
      will be aware which one the participant is taking. Because this a double-blind design, only&#xD;
      the supervisor, Dr. Susan Potter, will be privy to the experimental condition of the&#xD;
      participants. The supervisor will randomly assign participants to either a placebo or&#xD;
      probiotic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probiotic used in this study will be Organic Probiotics 7 Strains 20 Billion per gram&#xD;
      purchased from Prescribed For Life. This is a natural organic probiotic powder including&#xD;
      Acidophilus, Bifidum, Casei, and Rhamnosus strains of probiotic bacteria, 400mg per capsule.&#xD;
      Placebo capsules will contain 400mg of rice flour. Each participant will receive two pill&#xD;
      bottles - one with 70 probiotic capsules for ten weeks and another with 70 placebo capsules&#xD;
      for ten weeks. These capsules are to be consumed orally, one capsule per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher and supervisor will schedule a meeting with each participant to provide&#xD;
      detailed instructions for the study and to obtain informed consent for each participant's&#xD;
      continuation in the study (see Appendix F and Appendix G). At the initial appointment, the&#xD;
      ten-week appointment, and the final twenty-week appointment, participants will complete the&#xD;
      Depression Anxiety and Stress scale (DASS) and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI).&#xD;
      Participants will complete these measures three times during the study period in order for&#xD;
      the researchers to measure change in anxiety and depression symptoms across the three time&#xD;
      points. At each of these meetings participants will also be given their bottle of either&#xD;
      probiotics capsules or placebo capsules to be taken over the 10-week period. At their&#xD;
      ten-week appointment, participants will also be given copies of the DASS and ASI to be&#xD;
      completed at the end of the study (see Appendix H). At the third and final appointment,&#xD;
      participants will bring in their completed questionnaires and be given the opportunity to ask&#xD;
      any questions they may have about the study, as well as complete a ballot for the prize&#xD;
      draws. If they wish to know during which phases they received the probiotic and placebo&#xD;
      capsules, they will be told that the information will be emailed to them once the study is&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by the researcher on the third and sixth day of each phase&#xD;
      (probiotic and placebo) via email to check in and answer any questions they may have (see&#xD;
      Appendix I). Participants will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire once every two&#xD;
      weeks during the study period, which should take no longer than 5 minutes to complete (see&#xD;
      Appendix J and Appendix K), to chart any changes in anxiety and/or physical health, as well&#xD;
      as to keep the lines of communication open should any questions arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete two consent forms, one online prior to the collection of&#xD;
      demographic and identifying information and one prior to commencing the probiotic phase of&#xD;
      the study (see Appendix E, and Appendix G, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deception and Debriefing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although not technically deception, participants will receive either a placebo or probiotic&#xD;
      for ten-week intervals in the study period but will not be told which of the two they are&#xD;
      receiving, although they will be informed that they will not be told. Upon completion of the&#xD;
      study, participants who wish to know will be told which of the two (probiotics or placebo)&#xD;
      they received during each ten-week period. Participants will also be given the opportunity to&#xD;
      have all of their questions answered by the researcher and those who wish to receive a copy&#xD;
      of the results will be sent them via email once the study is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are good bacteria that grow naturally in the human gut. To date, there are no&#xD;
      published risks associated with probiotic consumption. Nevertheless, participants will be&#xD;
      contacted twice during the first week of each phase (probiotic and placebo) to ensure they&#xD;
      are not experiencing any adverse side effects. In addition, participants will submit updates&#xD;
      on their physical and mental health every two weeks throughout the study in addition to being&#xD;
      encouraged to contact the researchers should they have any concerns during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that participants may be made more aware of any anxious or depressive symptoms&#xD;
      they are experiencing through participation in this research project and, as a result of&#xD;
      increased attending, may experience increases in their emotional distress. To address these&#xD;
      concerns, participants will be provided with specific contact information for mental health&#xD;
      service providers in the Wolfville area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although direct benefits to the participants are uncertain at this point, it is possible that&#xD;
      they may experience a reduction in anxiety and/or depressive symptoms, and it is quite likely&#xD;
      they will experience a reduction in any physiological bowel-related symptoms, as a result of&#xD;
      taking the probiotics. However, it will be impossible to determine if any improvements in&#xD;
      symptoms are attributable to the probiotic intervention until the study is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality will be maintained at all times. Once they are enrolled in the study, each&#xD;
      participant will be assigned a unique code number that will be used on all questionnaires and&#xD;
      other data. Participants' names will not appear in conjunction with any data except for the&#xD;
      initial online questionnaire. Once potential participants have been contacted about their&#xD;
      participation in the intervention phase of the study, the online questionnaire data will be&#xD;
      removed from the server and names will be replaced with code numbers. A master list of code&#xD;
      numbers and names will be kept in a password-protected file in a separate folder on the&#xD;
      researcher's password-protected computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Security: All paper questionnaires will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in a locked&#xD;
      office. All electronic data files will be stored on a password-protected computer. Because&#xD;
      this area of research is relatively new, data will be kept indefinitely as it may help to&#xD;
      guide future studies.&#xD;
