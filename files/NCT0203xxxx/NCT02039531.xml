      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) will improve the quality of life and&#xD;
      functional capacity of patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis, providing better&#xD;
      functional results than conventional treatment with viscosupplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPERATING ASSUMPTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the initial administration of three doses of PRGF interspersed every 15 days,&#xD;
      applied via intraarticular, patients will present an improvement in functional test (WOMAC&#xD;
      and Lequesne scales) of 15% or more after 6 and 12 months compared to the control group with&#xD;
      patients treated with hyaluronic acid.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the treatment with PRGF&#xD;
      in the osteoarthritis of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To show more effectiveness after 6 months of the treatment with PRGF, with an improvement&#xD;
      in the reference test (WOMAC and Lequesne) of 15 % or more compared to the treatment with&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effectiveness after 12 months of the treatment with PRGF compared to the&#xD;
           treatment with hyaluronic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effectiveness after 12 months of the two cycles re-treatment with PRGF&#xD;
           (second phase of the study), compared to the effect of a single cycle with PRGF (first&#xD;
           phase of the study ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantifying platelet growth factors blood concentration in patients treated with PRGF&#xD;
           and its correlation with the intraarticular effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY.STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, single-blind, clinical trial will be performed to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      2 different treatment strategies (PRGF and hyaluronic acid) in patients with knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into two homogeneous groups using a randomization procedure by&#xD;
      permuted blocks system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group (experimental) will receive the treatment with PRGF; one cycle of three&#xD;
      intraarticular doses every 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group, will receive viscosupplementation wih hyaluronic acid of high molecular&#xD;
      weight (DurolaneÂ®). Its administration is performed in a one cycle of a single intraarticular&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second phase :&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis of the main objective in the first phase at 6 months will be performed.&#xD;
      If the clinical data indicate that the PRGF is more effective than hyaluronic acid and no&#xD;
      serious adverse events were described, the investigators will carry out a second phase of&#xD;
      extension, exploratory, open label, non randomized, starting-up after 12 months of the finish&#xD;
      of the first phase (in order to wash out the effects of the treatment in the first phase).&#xD;
      Patients who were treated with hyaluronic acid in the first phase will be offered to be&#xD;
      treated with PRGF in two cycles of administration (the first one at the begining and the&#xD;
      second one after 6 months) in order to know whether a two-cycles-based-treatment improves the&#xD;
      results of a single-cycle-based-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY VARIABLES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the study the investigators will analyze different variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predicting Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade of chondropathy by classification of Kellgren and Lawrence scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  laterality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  employment status (Working, unemployed or retired)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  presence of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quantification of platelet blood concentration in all patients in the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Variables :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use specific tests to evaluate Osteoarthritis of the knee:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WOMAC scale (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity index of Lequesne in knee osteoarthritis. Both are tests internationally&#xD;
           validated for clinical and functional health assessment in patients with osteoarthritis&#xD;
           of the knee. All are translated into spanish and validated by the scientific community&#xD;
           for its use in clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and SF-363 Health Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study questionnaires will be measured after 3, 6 and 12 months in both&#xD;
      phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WOMAC questionnaire assesses pain intensity in 5 different situations, the joint&#xD;
      stiffness in 2 different situations and the functional capacity in 17 everyday situations.&#xD;
      Each item is scored from 0 ( &quot;no pain, or without stiffness or no difficulty&quot; ) to 4 ( &quot; Very&#xD;
      much &quot; ) . The total score ranges as follows : Pain 0-20 , stiffness 0-8 and Functional&#xD;
      Capacity 0-68 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity index of Lequesne for knee osteoarthritis quantifies the severity of disability&#xD;
      or severity of osteoarthritis. The pain is measured in 3 items, the maximum distance walked&#xD;
      and activities of daily living are measured in 4 situations. Scores ranges from 1-4 (mild&#xD;
      inability) to &gt;14 (where the failure is extremely serious).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SF -36 is a health questionnaire . It is used in medical research. It provides an&#xD;
      overview of the state of health of the person. Contains 36 questions addressing different&#xD;
      aspects of the daily life of the person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS .&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline patients before receiving the first infiltration, regardless of the study group,&#xD;
      must complete the tests described earlier. Then, at 3, 6 and 12 months the patients will&#xD;
      perform the same tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of variables : qualitative variables are summarized by their absolute and&#xD;
           relative frequencies. Quantitative variables by its mean and standard deviation, or&#xD;
           alternatively, by the median and interquartile range, in case they do not follow normal&#xD;
           distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of means between the two groups by Student t-test or , alternatively by the U&#xD;
           of Mann - Whitney, in case they do not follow normal distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative variables will be analyzed using the chi2 test and calculation of relative&#xD;
           risk ( RR ) with a 95% of confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Linear regression and correlation between the blood concentration of platelets in the&#xD;
           PRGF obtained and injected . These tests will also be conducted to correlate plasma&#xD;
           concentrations with these outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of statistical significance was set at P &lt; 0.05 .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The analysis is carried out by intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients must sign the informed consent before their inclusion. The study was approved by&#xD;
      the ethics committee of the Principe de Asturias University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are responsible to ensure the confidentiality of patient's data, and to act&#xD;
      according to the Spanish Law of Protection of Personal Data (LO 15/ 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY LIMITATIONS .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations of the study include the lack of control group treated with placebo. In this&#xD;
      study a placebo-controlled group is not ethically acceptable, because the patient must&#xD;
      undergo invasive procedures with associated risks and discomfort involved. Therefore, in our&#xD;
      case we will use as a control group the patients treated with hyaluronic acid, considered as&#xD;
      an alternative to surgical treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another bias that may occur is the loss of patients by different reasons. To prevent this&#xD;
      problem, we will contact every month with patients by telephone to remind them the&#xD;
      appointments at 3,6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase all patients that had completed the first phase in the control group will&#xD;
      have the possibility of treatment with two cycles with PRGF. Because it is considered to be&#xD;
      very unlikely to remain a residual effect of hyaluronic acid after 12 months of receiving the&#xD;
      first infiltration, homogeneity achieved by the randomization in the first phase is expected&#xD;
      to be maintained in the second phase. It is considered that 12 months is a relatively short&#xD;
      time interval in a longstanding chronic disease such as osteoarthritis of the knee. Just in&#xD;
      case, a comparative analysis of the baseline characteristics will be performed and adjusted&#xD;
      for differences that may be found. Finally, due to the sample size was estimated to detect a&#xD;
      difference between a one cycle treatment with PRGF and hyaluronic acid in the first phase, it&#xD;
      is possible that it could be insufficient for comparison in the second phase. Thus, the&#xD;
      second phase is considered as exploratory.&#xD;
