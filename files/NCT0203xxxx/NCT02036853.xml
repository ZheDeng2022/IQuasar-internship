  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to assess the safety and long-term efficacy of triheptanoin in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with Glut1 DS over a 5-year treatment period. Glut 1 is a protein that&#xD;
      helps transport glucose to the brain. Glucose is the brain's primary source of energy. Glut 1&#xD;
      DS prevents this protein from being effectively produced, causing deprivation of energy to&#xD;
      the neurons of the of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glut1 DS is a severely debilitating disease characterized by seizures, developmental delay&#xD;
      and movement disorder. There are currently no approved treatments specific to Glut1 DS.&#xD;
      Treatment generally includes medications for control of seizures. The use of a ketogenic diet&#xD;
      can be effective in controlling seizures when medications are ineffective or provide&#xD;
      insufficient control. However, the ketogenic diet may be very difficult for patients to&#xD;
      maintain for long periods of time, and there may be negative secondary long-term effects of&#xD;
      ketogenic diet.. Triheptanoin is metabolized to molecules that can provide an alternative&#xD;
      energy source to the brain, and appears to help in controlling seizures without many of the&#xD;
      difficulties of the ketogenic diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients may be those who have been diagnosed with GLUT1 DS, and have discontinued&#xD;
      or are not currently on ketogenic diet, or are able to tolerate triheptanoin if they have&#xD;
      been treated or are currently being treated with triheptanoin and do not qualify for any&#xD;
      other clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Triheptanoin is proposed for the treatment of seizures in glucose transporter type-1&#xD;
      deficiency syndrome (Glut1 DS). Glut1 DS is a rare disease with an estimated US prevalence of&#xD;
      ~3,300.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is an open-label study to assess the safety and long-term efficacy of&#xD;
      triheptanoin in patients with Glut1 DS over a 5-year treatment period. Eligible patients may&#xD;
      be those who are able to tolerate triheptanoin if they have been treated or are currently&#xD;
      being treated with triheptanoin and do not qualify for any other clinical trial. Subjects&#xD;
      previously treated with triheptanoin will continue to dose at approximately 35% of total&#xD;
      daily calories (~1-4g/kg/day, depending on age). Subjects who are naïve to triheptanoin will&#xD;
      begin a 2-week fixed titration schedule up until they have reached 35% of total daily&#xD;
      calories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of triheptanoin via adverse&#xD;
      event rates and laboratory values. The secondary objective is to evaluate the long-term&#xD;
      efficacy of triheptanoin as measured by the change in seizure frequency from historical&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;

If a subject has not reached the target of 35% of total daily calories, by the end of the 2-week fixed titration period, dose titration should continue until achieved or until the maximally tolerated dose has been established.</description>

The score in each region is rated 0 (no dystonia) to 4 (severe dystonia.) The minimum score is 0 and the maximum scale is 32 and is the sum of all of the regions measured.</description>

          <description>The PedsQL (Pediatric Quality of Life) was designed to measure perceived health-related quality of life in pediatric patients with chronic health conditions. The Generic Core scale includes assessment of physical, emotional, social, and school functioning. The summary scores are: Total Quality of Life Score, Physical Health Summary Score (avg of physical functioning), and Psychosocial Health Summary Score (avg of emotional, social, and school items). Items (5-point scale) are reversed scored and transformed to a 0-100 scale so higher scores are better. https://www.pedsql.org/about_pedsql.html</description>

        <description>A seizure diary was used to track date, type, number, and unusual presentation of seizures. Subjects were given a seizure diary at screening to record daily seizure activity for incremental periods of time.
