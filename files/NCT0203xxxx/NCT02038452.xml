  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a common condition in which a nerve (known as the median&#xD;
      nerve) is squeezed where it passes through the wrist. It can cause pain or aching, tingling&#xD;
      or numbness in the affected hand. It may disturb sleep, or affect ability to do day to day&#xD;
      things.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been several studies into the best treatment of patients with severe symptoms of&#xD;
      CTS who are referred to a hospital for treatment. However, little is known about the best&#xD;
      treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms who visit their GP but do not require&#xD;
      hospital treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will investigate whether a steroid injection is clinically effective in reducing&#xD;
      symptoms and improving function in the short term (6 weeks) compared to a night splint in&#xD;
      people consulting with mild to moderate CTS in primary care.We will study the effects of&#xD;
      these 2 treatments over 6 weeks and at 6 months. Subject to further funding, the Study will&#xD;
      also look at whether these 6 weeks of treatment are effective 1 year and 2 years later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place in up to 50 GP practices and hospital clinics across the UK.&#xD;
      Patients aged 18 and over who have been diagnosed with mild to moderate CTS which has been&#xD;
      present for at least 6 weeks will be eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The steroid is a drug called &quot;DepoMedrone.&quot; This drug is already widely used to treat CTS. In&#xD;
      this study, one injection will be given. The splint is made of elastic and has an aluminium&#xD;
      bar which sits on the palm of the hand. In this study, the splint will be worn at night for 6&#xD;
      weeks. Each participant will receive either a single steroid injection or a splint, and will&#xD;
      be asked to complete up to 5 questionnaires over 2 years.&#xD;
