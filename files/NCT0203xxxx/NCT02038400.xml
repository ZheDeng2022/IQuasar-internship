  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Otitis media are the consequence of bacterial infection. They are characterized by middle ear&#xD;
      inflammations with a collection of fluid behind the eardrum. The effusion stagnates in the&#xD;
      middle ear, can increase acute infection and induce tympanic membrane and inner ear damages.&#xD;
      Delay in language learning can be observed in affected children as well as hearing problems&#xD;
      e.g. constant hearing loss. The two main forms of chronic otitis are otitis media with&#xD;
      effusion (OME) and atelectasis with or without retraction pockets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, insertion of tympanic ventilation tubes (tympanostomy) is the most effective&#xD;
      treatment for otitis media with effusion that has failed to respond to conservative drug&#xD;
      treatments; and for delaying the progression of serious atelectasis. When a first tube did&#xD;
      not allow complete recovery, recurrence is then observed and insertion of new tube is needed.&#xD;
      The repeated tube insertions increase risks linked to general anesthesia and increase rate of&#xD;
      sequelae/complications, such as tympanic membrane perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinetube® is a CE-marked medical device, marketed in France and Europe since April 2002. This&#xD;
      device improves the neuronal control mechanism of the pharyngotympanic (Eustachian) tube,&#xD;
      regulating middle ear pressure. This could be an alternative for patients having recurrence&#xD;
      and needing repeated tube insertion, as studies had shown that Kinetube® improved the opening&#xD;
      of the Eustachian tube in patients with otitis media with effusion (OME) and atelectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These previous clinical studies have shown the feasibility of the use of Kinetube® in&#xD;
      clinical practice. A larger clinical study with a high level of evidence must be performed to&#xD;
      show therapeutic efficacy of the Kinetube® in chronic otitis compared to ventilation tube&#xD;
      insertion.&#xD;
