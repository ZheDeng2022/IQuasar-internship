    <textblock>
      ONC201 is a new potential drug that kills cancer cells but not normal cells in laboratory&#xD;
      studies. This clinical trial will be the first evaluation of ONC201 in humans and will enroll&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer. This trial includes a phase I portion that will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of ONC201 and the recommended dose for the phase II portion. The phase II portion will&#xD;
      evaluate the initial efficacy profile of ONC201 in select types of cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ONC201 (TIC10) is a first-in-class small molecule that inactivates the Ras effector target&#xD;
      kinases, Akt and ERK, selectively in tumor, but not normal, cells to safely trigger cancer&#xD;
      cell death. The dual inactivation of Akt and ERK by ONC201 results in broad-spectrum&#xD;
      cytotoxic activity that includes activation of TRAIL-mediated apoptotic and other downstream&#xD;
      antitumor effects to produce a potent antitumor response. The safety margin (ratio of&#xD;
      therapeutic dose to lowest dose with a mild adverse event) of ONC201 is at least 10-fold in&#xD;
      rats and dogs in GLP toxicology. The efficacy of ONC201 has been consistently demonstrated in&#xD;
      multiple in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo preclinical cancer models. Favorable attributes of&#xD;
      ONC201 observed in preclinical models include antitumor efficacy with infrequent&#xD;
      administration, broad-spectrum activity independent of mutations or tumor type, orally&#xD;
      active, high safety margins, synergistic activity with many approved therapies, highly&#xD;
      stable, highly water soluble, and ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. In the phase&#xD;
      I portion of the trial, the hypothesis is that ONC201 will exhibit an acceptable safety&#xD;
      profile in patients with advanced cancer. In the phase II portion of the trial, the&#xD;
      hypothesis is that ONC201 will show preliminary signs of efficacy in patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer as defined by endpoints that include progression-free survival, response rate,&#xD;
      biomarkers, and overall survival.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme, triple-negative&#xD;
             breast cancer, colorectal cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer patients with advanced&#xD;
             disease and limited therapeutic options.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for&#xD;
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. For&#xD;
             lymph nodes to be considered measurable, the short axis must be ≥15 mm when assessed&#xD;
             by CT scan. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest&#xD;
             diameter &lt;10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to &lt;15 mm short axis), are&#xD;
             considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites,&#xD;
             pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast&#xD;
             disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered&#xD;
             non-measurable. See Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients are eligible for enrollment if they have not had prior chemotherapy,&#xD;
             radiotherapy, anticancer therapy, or investigational agent within 28 days prior to the&#xD;
             first dose (Week 1, Day 1); 42 days weeks in the case of alkylating agents. Patients&#xD;
             are eligible for enrollment if they have had no surgery within 6 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             first dose. Any number of prior therapies is allowable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All adverse events Grade &gt; 1 related to prior therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy,&#xD;
             and/or surgery) must be resolved, except for alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%, see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Life expectancy of greater than 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤2.5 × upper limit of normal creatinine OR creatinine&#xD;
                  clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The effects of ONC201 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Tumor specimen (paraffin-embedded block or frozen tissue) from prior resection or&#xD;
             biopsy available that is sufficient to perform pharmacodynamic assays (&gt;3 slides for&#xD;
             IHC)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have received bevacizumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from the phase I portion of the&#xD;
             study. In the phase II portion, patients with known CNS metastases will be limited to&#xD;
             20% of the patient population to accrue proportionately. Patients with CNS metastases&#xD;
             must be stable after therapy for CNS metastases (such as surgery, radiotherapy or&#xD;
             stereotactic radiosurgery) for &gt; 3 month and must be off steroid treatment prior to&#xD;
             study enrollment and must have a life expectancy of 3 months or greater to be&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to ONC201 or its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ONC201 is novel agent with unknown&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with ONC201, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             ONC201.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a known HIV-positive test on combination antiretroviral therapy are&#xD;
             ineligible for the initial first-in-man trial because of the potential for&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with ONC201. In addition, these patients are at increased&#xD;
             risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate&#xD;
             studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
             when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with known history of cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
             tachyarrhythmias or bradycardia will be excluded. Patients receiving therapeutic&#xD;
             agents known to prolong QT interval will be excluded. Patients with history of CHF, or&#xD;
             MI or stroke in the last 3 months will be excluded. Patients with a history of&#xD;
             seizures will be excluded form the initial trial because ONC201 crosses the&#xD;
             blood-brain barrier and this may affect their anti-seizure therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Active drug use or alcoholism.&#xD;
