      Purpose: This is an open label, single-arm, single-center study of the addition of metformin&#xD;
      to standard levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LR-IUD) treatment of 30 evaluable&#xD;
      non-surgical patients with either complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH; n=15) or grade 1&#xD;
      endometrial adenocarcinoma (EC; n=15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:Women, over the age of 18 years, with biopsy-proven CAH/EC who are not&#xD;
      candidates for surgical management, and therefore are planned to start standard of care&#xD;
      treatment with the LR-IUD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): subjects will be given oral metformin therapy for 12 months, or until&#xD;
      disease progression occurs (whichever occurs first), in addition to LR-IUD treatment. Serial&#xD;
      endometrial biopsies will be performed, as per standard of care, to assess disease status.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To compare the rate of CR at 6 months in non-surgical grade 1 EC and CAH patients receiving&#xD;
      metformin + LR-IUD to 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to estimate the rate of CR at 6 months separately in grade 1 EC and CAH patients&#xD;
           receiving metformin + LR-IUD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to estimate the rate of CR at 12 months in non-surgical grade 1 EC and CAH patients&#xD;
           receiving metformin + LR-IUD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to document patient adherence to long-term (≥3 months) metformin administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe safety of metformin + LR-IUD treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore changes in cellular proliferation as measured by the marker, Ki-67, from&#xD;
           baseline to 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore association between the level of expression of the metformin transporter&#xD;
           proteins and key targets of the metformin/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling&#xD;
           pathway and CR status at 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform a comprehensive unbiased profiling of metabolites by analyzing the metabolic&#xD;
           &quot;fingerprints&quot; of the biofluids (i.e. serum and urine) and &quot;footprints&quot; of the tumor&#xD;
           tissue pre- and post- 6 months of metformin treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore association between metabolic factors and metformin concentration levels in&#xD;
           tumor tissue/blood/urine and CR at 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, single-arm, single-center study of the addition of metformin to&#xD;
      standard levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LR-IUD) treatment of 30 evaluable&#xD;
      non-surgical patients with either complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH; n=15) or grade 1&#xD;
      endometrial adenocarcinoma (EC; n=15). Women, over the age of 18 years, with biopsy-proven&#xD;
      CAH/EC who are not candidates for surgical management, and therefore are planned to start&#xD;
      standard of care treatment with the LR-IUD, will be given oral metformin therapy for 12&#xD;
      months, or until disease progression occurs (whichever occurs first), in addition to LR-IUD&#xD;
      treatment. Serial endometrial biopsies will be performed, as per standard of care, to assess&#xD;
      disease status. We hypothesize that the addition of metformin to standard LR-IUD treatment of&#xD;
      CAH and grade 1 EC will result in a complete response (CR) rate at 6 months that is&#xD;
      significantly higher than 50% in a population of non-surgical candidates. In addition, we&#xD;
      plan to estimate CR rate at 6 months in CAH and EC separately, and in the group as a whole at&#xD;
      12 months. We will also document the rate of patient adherence to long-term metformin&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
