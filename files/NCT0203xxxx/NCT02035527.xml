  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of sorafenib tosylate and&#xD;
      docetaxel when given together with cisplatin and to see how well they work in treating&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Sorafenib tosylate may also help cisplatin and docetaxel work better by&#xD;
      making tumor cells more sensitive to the drugs. Giving sorafenib tosylate, cisplatin, and&#xD;
      docetaxel may be an effective treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define progression-free survival of patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma treated with cisplatin/docetaxel/sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) (CDS) combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy. (Phase II) II. To determine the optimal doses of cisplatin/docetaxel/sorafenib&#xD;
      to be used in the phase II portion of the trial. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine overall survival, response rate, conduct biomarker studies, toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of sorafenib tosylate and docetaxel&#xD;
      followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 of course 0.&#xD;
      Beginning in course 1, patients receive sorafenib tosylate PO BID on days 1-21, docetaxel&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1, and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive sorafenib tosylate PO BID in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
