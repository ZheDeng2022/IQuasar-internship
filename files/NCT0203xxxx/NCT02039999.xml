  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite its commonplace use in respiratory medicine the mechanism whereby inhalation&#xD;
      challenge with a variety of mild acid aerosols produces a dose related and predictable cough&#xD;
      is unknown. In this proposal the investigators wish to use established cough challenge&#xD;
      methodology to explore the mechanism of action of agents provoking cough both in health and&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses to be tested include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intracellular changes in pH, rather than extracellular changes, are key in the&#xD;
           activation of TRP receptors, the main sensor for provoking cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ATP acting through P2X channels is the mechanism of increased nerve excitability&#xD;
           underlying cough hypersensitivity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously demonstrated that mild acids, such as citric, tartaric or&#xD;
      phosphoric acid produce a highly reliable cough challenge and that the sensitivity of these&#xD;
      are complex individual acids correlates within the population studied inferring a common&#xD;
      mechanism of action.In contrast there is no correlation with the other common cough challenge&#xD;
      methodology, capsaicin inferring that there are at least two different mechanisms for&#xD;
      producing cough with aerosols in man.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 10 years it has been established that capsaicin works by a specific irritant&#xD;
      receptor known as the TRPV1. A second receptor, TRPA1 has been recently discovered and we&#xD;
      were the first group to demonstrate that inhalation of agonists of this receptor in the form&#xD;
      of the extract of cinnamon (cinnamaldehyde) produces cough in man . TRPA1 is a very&#xD;
      attractive candidate for the main cough receptor since it is activated by many common&#xD;
      irritants, such as smoke, perfumes and other strong smells known to provoke coughing in&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have cloned the human TRP receptors and expressed them in cell lines. This&#xD;
      in vitro work has allowed us to investigate the molecular action of the TRP receptors.&#xD;
      Recently, the investigators and others have shown that weak acids can activate TRPA1, not as&#xD;
      previously thought by stimulating the external surface of the cells but by altering the&#xD;
      intracellular pH. This would explain why weak and not strong acids are better at producing&#xD;
      cough, since weaker acids (technically those with a higher pKa) exist in solution in a form&#xD;
      which is able to cross the cell membrane and render a change in the intracellular pH, which&#xD;
      in turn activates TRPA1 from inside the cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first study the investigators wish to the simply alter the pH of the nebulised&#xD;
      solution provoking cough by altering the balance of the salts in the solution, and then carry&#xD;
      out standard cough challenge protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second study the investigators wish to examine the effect of a number of known agonists&#xD;
      of TRPA1 which are commonly used in the perfumes and foodstuffs in order to understand the&#xD;
      rank order of potency of these compounds as tussive agents. This can then be compared to the&#xD;
      rank order of potency of the same compounds in causing intracellular pH change in in vitro&#xD;
      cell culture systems, in order to test the strength of the hypothesis over a variety of&#xD;
      different agonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, recent work has shown that blockade of a neuronal ion channel known as P2X3 can&#xD;
      dramatically reduce cough. P2X3 responds to the substance adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which&#xD;
      has previously been used as a cough challenge solution in man. If the hypothesis that the&#xD;
      cough hypersensitivity seen in patients is due to activation of P2X3 is correct then patients&#xD;
      will cough at much lower doses of ATP than normal volunteers. We wish to assess the value of&#xD;
      ATP, and the related substance AMP and adenosine in a cough challenge protocol. Studying the&#xD;
      cough produced by these naturally occurring compounds may allow us to distinguish patients&#xD;
      with cough hypersensitivity from those with cough due to other causes, and also lead to a&#xD;
      methodology important in future drug development&#xD;
&#xD;
      The greater understanding of the cough reflex which these studies would yield would have&#xD;
      important clinical applications pointing the way to novel therapeutic avenues, as well as&#xD;
      enhancing our fundamental understanding of the genesis of cough.&#xD;
