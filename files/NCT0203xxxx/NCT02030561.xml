      This study will determine the safety and efficacy of expanded activated autologous NK cells&#xD;
      administered after Trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive breast or gastric cancer. It&#xD;
      will also provide valuable insights of the role of NK cell infusions in adult solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, targeted immunotherapies have become part of the therapeutic arsenal in adult solid&#xD;
      tumors, and have shown promising activity in melanomas and prostate cancers. Trastuzumab is a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that targets HER2 and is used routinely in combination with chemotherapy&#xD;
      in HER2 over-expressing breast and gastric cancer. Trastuzumab is known to induce antibody&#xD;
      dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), among its various mechanisms for tumor cell kill. As&#xD;
      such, trastuzumab may suitably be combined with immunotherapy as a strategy to harness the&#xD;
      host's immune system against HER2-positive tumor cells.There is mounting evidence that&#xD;
      natural killer (NK) cells have powerful anti-cancer activity. In patients with leukemia&#xD;
      undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, several studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      NK-mediated anti-leukemic activity. Allogeneic NK cell infusions in patients with primary&#xD;
      refractory or multiple-relapsed leukemia have been shown to be well tolerated and void of&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) effects. In this study, we seek to enhance the antitumor&#xD;
      activity of a commonly used antibody to treat HER2+ breast and gastric cancer, trastuzumab,&#xD;
      administered in combination with infusion of activated and expanded autologous NK cells.This&#xD;
      is a lead-in phase I followed by a phase II study. Up to 9 patients will be enrolled in phase&#xD;
      I to test two different doses of NK cells to be infused into the patient. This will then be&#xD;
      followed by a phase II study where 20 patients will be enrolled. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      undergo apheresis about 9 days (up to 11 days) prior to cycle 1 therapy to harvest NK cells.&#xD;
      The collected NK cells will be expanded and activated ex vivo. On day 1 of cycle 1, the&#xD;
      patient will receive herceptin and subcutaneous IL2, followed by NK cell infusion on day 2 of&#xD;
      cycle 1. This will then be followed by 5 doses of s/c IL2 three times a week to keep the NK&#xD;
      cells activated in vivo. The patient will then receive three more cycles of herceptin (every&#xD;
      21 days). In patients who achieve objective tumor response after cycle 2 or cycle 4, a second&#xD;
      NK cell infusion along with s/c IL2 will be administered with cycle 4 or cycle 6 herceptin&#xD;
      respectively.This study will determine the safety and efficacy of this novel therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy in HER2 positive breast and gastric cancer. It will also provide valuable insights&#xD;
      of the role of NK cell infusions in adult solid tumors.&#xD;

From cycles 2-4, patient will receive trastuzumab monotherapy alone every 21 days, except for patients who achieve objective tumor response after 2 cycles of therapy, who will then receive an additional infusion of NK cells along with trastuzumab during cycle 4 therapy at the same dose and schedule as in cycle 1.&#xD;
Patients will be taken off study after cycle 4, unless the patient has objective tumor response after 4 cycles of therapy with only stable disease after cycle 2, in which case the patient will be given another 2 cycles of trastuzumab with an additional NK cell infusion during cycle 6 therapy at the same dose and schedule as in cycle 1.</description>
