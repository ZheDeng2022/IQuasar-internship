  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol dependency is the second most common psychiatric disorder and a major public health&#xD;
      concern. As addictive disorders and now thought to be chronic disorders for many patients&#xD;
      there is a need for the development of expanded treatment approaches. Because relapse is more&#xD;
      often the rule than the exception the importance of continuing care after an initial phase of&#xD;
      treatment is evident. Studies investigating telephone-based continuing care for patients with&#xD;
      alcohol dependence have shown to be an effective form of step-down treatment after a previous&#xD;
      stabilisation treatment program and provide extended recovery support. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that alcohol abstinent patients who received high-frequency&#xD;
      telephone-based or sms-based continuing care show significantly less relapses respectively&#xD;
      more abstinent days six and twelve months after in-patient treatment compared to patients who&#xD;
      receive low-frequency or no telephone-based continuing care.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol dependence is a major public health problem. Because of its relapsing nature of the&#xD;
      disorder, alcohol and also drug dependence are now thought to be chronic disorders for many&#xD;
      patients.Therefore, continuing care has become an important element in the treatment of&#xD;
      alcohol dependence. Continuing care is referred to as ongoing care after an initial phase of&#xD;
      intensive care and can be provided in different modalities and formats such as group&#xD;
      counseling, telephone-based counseling, individual therapy and more. However, many&#xD;
      substance-dependence patients do not attend any continuing care or abandon attending care to&#xD;
      early. To approach this problem more flexible continuing care protocols that abstain from the&#xD;
      traditional face-to-face counseling sessions have been developed to promote better adherence&#xD;
      an improve disease management over time. Studies on continuing care revealed mixed results&#xD;
      that depend on the duration of the intervention and the method of delivery services. Longer&#xD;
      planned intervention and active approaches that bring the intervention to the patients seem&#xD;
      to be more effective than traditional approaches in the management of addiction. For instance&#xD;
      studies investigating telephone-based continuing care for patients with alcohol dependence&#xD;
      have shown to be an effective form of step-dow treatment after a previous stabilisation&#xD;
      treatment program and provide extended recovery support. Results revealed that&#xD;
      telephone-based continuing care produced higher rates of abstinence than face-to-face&#xD;
      standard continuing care, especially patient with low to moderate risk scores benefited&#xD;
      therefrom. Furthermore, it is a feasible instrument to implement a low-budget follow-up&#xD;
      system in routine outcome monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators want to evaluate the effectiveness of a high- versus&#xD;
      low-frequency telephone-based and a short message-based continuing care provided for patients&#xD;
      who have achieved a 12 week in-patient treatment for alcohol dependence. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that telephone-based continuing care should help the patients to bridge the gap&#xD;
      of an intensive in-patient treatment to out-patient environment and working life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      320 patients will be recruited through the Clinic S端dhang (Bern) and the Forel Clinic&#xD;
      (Z端rich), both specialized clinics for treatment of alcohol dependency. Patients, age 18-65,&#xD;
      will have attended a 12-week in-patient treatment program for alcohol dependency.&#xD;
      Participants are divided in 4 groups (high-frequency-, low-frequency-, sms- and control-&#xD;
      group) by randomization. Patients of the high-frequency and sms group will be contacted 9&#xD;
      times during the first 6 months while the low-frequency group will be called 2 times and the&#xD;
      control group will not be contacted. All 4 groups are contacted after 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
      The telephone continuing care consists of several cognitive-behavioral therapy components and&#xD;
      includes monitoring of substance use status and progress towards identified goals,&#xD;
      identification of current and anticipated high risk situations as well as development and&#xD;
      rehearsal of improved coping behaviors. Each call lasts approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
