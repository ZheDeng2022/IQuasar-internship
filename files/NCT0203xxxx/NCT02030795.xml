  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of wire-guided Arndt® endobronchial blocker does not gain widespread acceptance&#xD;
      during video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) because it takes longer time to collapse the&#xD;
      operative lung especially in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD). The use&#xD;
      of a disconnection technique for deflation of Arndt® blocker had a comparable degree of lung&#xD;
      collapse with the use of double-lumen tubes. However, it carries a risk of blood or infected&#xD;
      secretions contaminating the dependent lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that the use bronchial suction of through a barrel part of a 1-mL insulin&#xD;
      syringe attached to the suction port of the bronchial blocker would be associated with&#xD;
      comparable time to optimum lung collapse with the disconnection technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ethical approval, 58 patients with spontaneous pneumothorax scheduled for elective VATS&#xD;
      using Arndt blocker® for lung separation will be included in this prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to deflate the blocker with either disconnecting the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube from the ventilator for 60 s. prior to inflation of the bronchial blocker&#xD;
      allowing both lungs to collapse, or attaching -20 cm H2O of suction to the suction port of&#xD;
      the blocker through the barrel part of a 1-mL insulin syringe (n = 29 for each group).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most Middle Eastern and British thoracic anesthesiologists (100% and 98%, respectively) are&#xD;
      using a double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) as the first-choice lung separation technique,&#xD;
      1-2 although the intubation with a single lumen tube (SLT) could be easier. However, the use&#xD;
      of a bronchial blocker has a special concern as it takes longer time to collapse the&#xD;
      operative lung,3 which precludes its widespread acceptance for video-assisted thoracoscopic&#xD;
      (VATS) procedures because of delayed insertion of the trocars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wire-guided Arndt® endobronchial blocker (Cook® Critical Care, Bloomington, IN) takes&#xD;
      longer time for lung collapse than the Univent® tube (approximately, 26 min vs. 19 min,&#xD;
      respectively; P&lt;0.006),3 that may be due to its narrower inner lumen (1.4 mm vs. 2.0 mm,&#xD;
      respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different techniques described to speed of lung collapse during the use of Arndt®&#xD;
      endobronchial blocker. These include the disconnecting of the SLT from the ventilator and&#xD;
      allowing both lungs to collapse before inflation of the bronchial blocker cuff, 4-5 or&#xD;
      bronchial suction either through the fiberoptic bronchoscope after deflation of the bronchial&#xD;
      cuff and cessation of ventilation before re-inflation of the bronchial cuff, or through a&#xD;
      barrel part of a 3-mL syringe attached to the suction port of the bronchial blocker.3 The use&#xD;
      of a modified disconnection technique for deflation of Arndt® endobronchial blocker had a&#xD;
      comparable degree of lung collapse with the use of DLT during VATS procedures in patients&#xD;
      presented with pneumothorax.5 However, compared with the bronchial suction, the disconnection&#xD;
      technique may carry a risk of blood or infected secretions contaminating the dependent lung.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, the comparison of the efficacy of disconnection and bronchial&#xD;
      suction techniques to facilitate the deflation of Arndt® blocker during thoracoscopic surgery&#xD;
      has not yet been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, standard monitors and state and response entropy (SE and RE, respectively)&#xD;
      based-depth of anaesthesia will be applied. The radial artery will be catheterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic technique is standardized in all studied patients. The experienced attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist (&gt;10 yrs.), who will give the anesthetic and places the Arndt® blocker will&#xD;
      not be blinded to group assignment and will not be involved in the collection of outcome&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After preoxygenation, anesthesia will be induced using propofol 1.5-3 mg/kg and&#xD;
      target-controlled infusion (TCI) of remifentanil at an effect-site concentration (Ce) of 4&#xD;
      ng/mL, to achieve the SE values below 50 and the difference between RE and SE below 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisatracurium (0.2 mg/kg) will be given to facilitate the tracheal intubation with a SLT,&#xD;
      size 8.0 mm for women and 8.5 mm for men. Then a 9.0 F, 78-cm Arndt® blocker will be advanced&#xD;
      through the blocker port of its multiport adapter and the wire loop will be coupled with a&#xD;
      pediatric fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) that has been introduced through the fiberoptic port.&#xD;
      The Arndt® blocker will be introduced to the targeted bronchus. The correct position of the&#xD;
      Arndt® blocker wil be confirmed with a FOB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be maintained with 0.7-1.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of&#xD;
      sevoflurane and remifentanil Ce of 2-4 ng/ml to maintain the SE values below 50, the&#xD;
      difference between RE and SE below 10 and the mean arterial blood pressure (MA) and heart&#xD;
      rate &lt;20% of baseline values. Cisatracurium increments will be used to maintain surgical&#xD;
      relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' two lungs (TLV) will be mechanically ventilated with fraction of inspired oxygen&#xD;
      (FiO2) of 0.4 in air, tidal volume (VT) of 8 mL/kg, inspiratory to expiratory (I: E) ratio of&#xD;
      1:2.5 and PEEP of 5 cm H2O, and respiratory rate will be adjusted to achieve a PaCO2 of 35-45&#xD;
      mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the positioning of the patient in the lateral decubitus position, the position of the&#xD;
      blocker will be reconfirmed, the blocker cuff will be inflated with a titrated amount of air&#xD;
      to create a seal under direct visualization of FOB and the wire loop will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgical procedures will be performed by the same surgeons who are blinded for the lung&#xD;
      collapse technique and who are absent from the operating room during placement of the BB and&#xD;
      deflation of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VATS procedure begins with the exploration of the pleural cavity using a 30° video&#xD;
      thoracoscopic camera through a 1.5 cm single skin incision with the use of 1-3 trocars which&#xD;
      enabled the thoracoscopic instruments to move the lung.&#xD;

    <description>The quality of lung collapse at 20 min intervals after one lung ventilation initiation according to a four-point ordinal scale,3, 8 ranging from 1 (extremely poor) to 4 (excellent). Extremely poor (Score 1) indicated no collapse; poor (Score 2) indicated that there is a partial collapse with interference with surgical exposure; good (Score 3) indicated that there is total collapse, but the lung still had residual air; and excellent (Score 4) indicated a complete collapse with perfect surgical exposure. The feasibility of this scale was investigated during six surgical procedures not included in the study.</description>
