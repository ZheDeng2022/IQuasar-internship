      Proof of principle study in order to determine if there is a difference in treatment effect&#xD;
      across the 3 study groups when treating lower extremity lymphoedema using a pneumatic&#xD;
      compression device.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, 3 arm, prospective, randomized, clinical trial to assess the&#xD;
      difference between 3 treatment options for achieving a measurable physiologic effect on lower&#xD;
      extremity lymphedema with pneumatic compression device. Each intervention arm will include 10&#xD;
      completed subjects for a total of 30 completed subjects.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Skin Tone</measure>
    <time_frame>Change baseline to final day (day 12 for Group A and day 5 for Groups B and C)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in skin tone (fibrosis) measured via tonometry. The tonometer is a mechanical device that gives an indication of the resistance of tissue to compression. It is used in lymphedema to give an estimate of the extent of pitting and fibrotic induration. Tonometry measures were collected at 5 anatomical locations. A negative value is associated with a clinically desirable decrease in tone.</description>

    <description>Changes in patient-determined symptoms* and change in affect the symptoms had on the subject. Measured via MYMOP (Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile) questionnaire. A low score indicates a good outcome. Scores range from 0 (as good as can be) to 6 (as bad as can be).&#xD;
*Recorded symptoms were: Gr A, 1st symptom: none, abdominal pain and discomfort, swelling, physical, and worrying about granddaughters Gr B, 1st symptom: arthritis, hayfever, look of fat foot, right hand area of neck and shoulder, stairs, and swelling Gr C, 1st symptom: none, energy during dancing and gardening, frustration of not going out on own, swelling, mild longstanding depression, and MPT joint at base of small toe Gr A, 2nd symptom: fatigue, heaviness of leg, mental, and pain under knee Gr B, 2nd symptom: narrowed choice of footwear, shower in bath, and swollen left foot Gr C, 2nd symptom: being tired and aching all over, and shoes and clothing</description>

    <time_frame>Change baseline to final day (day 12 for Group A and day 5 for Groups B and C)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in skin thickness measured by ultrasound. Ultrasound measures were collected at 5 anatomical locations. A negative value is associated with a clinically desirable reduction in skin thickness (a surrogate measure of oedema).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Local Tissue Water (LTW)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change baseline to final day (day 12 for Group A and day 5 for Groups B and C)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in local tissue water (LTW) within the skin measured by MoistureMeterD (MMD). MMD measures were collected at 5 anatomical locations using 2 probes: medium (M25) and large (L50).

        <description>Change in skin tone (fibrosis) measured via tonometry. The tonometer is a mechanical device that gives an indication of the resistance of tissue to compression. It is used in lymphedema to give an estimate of the extent of pitting and fibrotic induration. Tonometry measures were collected at 5 anatomical locations. A negative value is associated with a clinically desirable decrease in tone.</description>

          <description>Changes in patient-determined symptoms* and change in affect the symptoms had on the subject. Measured via MYMOP (Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile) questionnaire. A low score indicates a good outcome. Scores range from 0 (as good as can be) to 6 (as bad as can be).&#xD;
*Recorded symptoms were: Gr A, 1st symptom: none, abdominal pain and discomfort, swelling, physical, and worrying about granddaughters Gr B, 1st symptom: arthritis, hayfever, look of fat foot, right hand area of neck and shoulder, stairs, and swelling Gr C, 1st symptom: none, energy during dancing and gardening, frustration of not going out on own, swelling, mild longstanding depression, and MPT joint at base of small toe Gr A, 2nd symptom: fatigue, heaviness of leg, mental, and pain under knee Gr B, 2nd symptom: narrowed choice of footwear, shower in bath, and swollen left foot Gr C, 2nd symptom: being tired and aching all over, and shoes and clothing</description>
