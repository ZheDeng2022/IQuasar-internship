      The purpose of this study is to determine if Near-Infrared fluorescence imaging is an&#xD;
      effective approach to detect the colorectal tumoral tissues and peritoneal implants in&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the ability of NIR imaging using ICG to demonstrate (the gross tumoral mass&#xD;
      and/or) peritoneal metastatic &quot; implants &quot; in patients operated for peritoneal carcinomatosis&#xD;
      from colorectal carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of the histological distribution (in the vessels, in the extravascular spaces, in&#xD;
      specific cells) of IV injected ICG in the normal and pathological tissues (and, if any is&#xD;
      demonstrated per-operatively, a) in the nodes of these patients found fluorescent and removed&#xD;
      and/or b) at the level of the fluorescent foci observed at the level of the hepatic surfaces)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day before the operation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICG 0.125 mg/kg will be given as an iv injection the day before the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient will be operated, the surgeons will (under &quot;conventional&quot; video control)&#xD;
      search and establish as usual the presence (of &quot;gross&quot; tumoral mass and) of metastatic&#xD;
      deposits at the level of the peritoneal surfaces. NIR imaging will be acquired during these&#xD;
      manoeuvers and, if detected, fluorescent structures and/or foci will be anatomically defined&#xD;
      by the surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If (&quot;gross&quot; tumoral mass and/or) metastatic deposits are seen fluorescent, the operation will&#xD;
      be then continued as usual but each anatomical piece will be controlled &quot;ex vivo&quot; for its&#xD;
      fluorescent character or not. All fluorescent foci on these anatomical pieces will be&#xD;
      identified as such by a mark and/or by a &quot;suture&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If (&quot;gross&quot; tumoral mass and/or) metastatic deposits are not seen fluorescent, ICG 0.125&#xD;
      mg/kg will be given as an iv injection and the vascularization, income of the ICG in the&#xD;
      tumoral implants (judged by the surgeon the most representative of the patient's status) will&#xD;
      be dynamically studied using the PDE camera during the 10 minutes following the IV injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no hepatic metastases were pre-operatively documented, the surface of the liver will be&#xD;
      controlled and, if superficial fluorescent foci are observed, these will be biopsied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Laboratory of Pathology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumoral tissues as well as -if identified- the &quot;non identified as tumoral&quot; fluorescent&#xD;
      tissular foci will be processed as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the slides obtained will be analyzed using the near-infrared fluorescence microscope for&#xD;
      the presence or the absence of (detectable) ICG and the different ICG-positive compartments&#xD;
      (vascular spaces, interstitial spaces, normal and/or tumoral cells, macrophages,â€¦) will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
