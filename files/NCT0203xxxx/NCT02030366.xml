  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a common injury in combat, terrorist attacks and sports such&#xD;
      as football and hockey. Unnecessary delays in the diagnosis and treatment of brain damage in&#xD;
      patients who can benefit from evacuation procedures can lead to worse brain injury, worse&#xD;
      outcome and, sometimes, unnecessary death. However, there is no reliable and sensitive method&#xD;
      for diagnosis of TBI severity in the field. In this study we will examine the feasibility of&#xD;
      using this a multifocal chromatic pupillometer for monitoring TBI, by examining the pupillary&#xD;
      response to multifocal chromatic stimuli in intracranial pressure (ICP)-monitored severe TBI&#xD;
      patients. As control, normal subjects will be tested for pupillary responses using this&#xD;
      device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To examine the feasibility of using the multifocal chromatic pupillometer for monitoring TBI,&#xD;
      the pupillary response to multifocal chromatic stimuli will be assessed in 20 healthy&#xD;
      subjects and 20 ICP-monitored severe TBI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The portable pupillometer will be tested in 20 healthy volunteers. Their pupillary responses&#xD;
      will be measured 3 times/day for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pupillary response of 20 severe TBI patients will be evaluated as detailed below at the&#xD;
      following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At admittance to ICU, prior to insertion of ICP and CT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prior to CT scans that are routinely performed at day 3 and 7 post injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Routinely at the beginning of every medical personnel shift for 7 days (3 times a day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. With every change in ICP(more than 5 mmHg for more then 15 min) Data will be recorded&#xD;
           and analyzed.&#xD;
