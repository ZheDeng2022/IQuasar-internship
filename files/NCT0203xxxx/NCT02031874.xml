  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for complications of influenza infection,&#xD;
      including secondary pneumonia and are recommended for annual influenza vaccination. Thus, the&#xD;
      appearance of a novel subtype of influenza A virus designated as 2009 swine H1N1 virus has&#xD;
      added an extra layer of complexity in the immunization regimen in this population. In&#xD;
      general, susceptibility to swine H1N1 infection among young population is higher as young&#xD;
      adults and children completely lack protective titers. According to the Center for Disease&#xD;
      Control (CDC), 70 percent of people hospitalized with H1N1 have been &quot;high risk&quot; cases,&#xD;
      including persons 65 years of age or older, or people with compromised immune systems as&#xD;
      observed during HIV infection. This has prompted CDC to include HIV infected children to be&#xD;
      one of the five groups to be vaccinated with the new H1N1 vaccine (National Center for&#xD;
      Immunization). Currently no information exists about the nature of the immune response to the&#xD;
      vaccine against H1N1 swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) in HIV infected children. It is&#xD;
      unknown whether HIV impairs the immunogenicity of the vaccine predisposing this population to&#xD;
      infection with S-OIV. Thus, a pilot proposal is being undertaken to study the mechanism of&#xD;
      H1N1 vaccine protection in HIV infected children, by investigating the correlation of&#xD;
      infection status with seroresponse, duration of response and development of influenza-like&#xD;
      illness following vaccine. Additionally we will establish whether we can identify immune&#xD;
      signatures by characteristic gene expression patterns correlating with the vaccine&#xD;
      immunogenicity that can be predictive of efficacy for &quot;good&quot; and &quot;suboptimal&quot; vaccination&#xD;
      regimen. Data generated will be used to initiate a comprehensive study on the immunogenicity&#xD;
      of the influenza vaccines in HIV-infected children and youth, which is critically important&#xD;
      to address the health care needs of this vulnerable population.&#xD;

      Patients will be recruited from HIV-1 outpatient clinic at the time the novel H1N1 vaccine&#xD;
      becomes available. Demographic data will be collected after enrollment including HIV-1 viral&#xD;
      load (VL) and CD4 count from last visit, antiretroviral therapy, gender and age. Patients&#xD;
      will be asked to document adverse reactions observed during this study such as tenderness,&#xD;
      pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site as well as systemic adverse reactions such&#xD;
      as headache, malaise, and muscle aches. A subject will be withdrawn from the study if a&#xD;
      serious adverse reaction occurs such as allergic reaction to a vaccine component or&#xD;
      development with a progressive neurological disorder without definitive diagnosis.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed after the viral load and CD4 counts are resulted from&#xD;
      the day 30. The microneutralization assays and the titers will be analyzed post day 7 and 37.&#xD;
      If the cohort does not seem to generate adequate responses, the study will be discontinued&#xD;
      and no further samples collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since immunocompromised persons may have a diminished immune response to Influenza A (H1N1)&#xD;
      2009 Monovalent Vaccine, a higher antigen load will be used for this study as recommended by&#xD;
      the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and Centers for Disease Control&#xD;
      and Prevention. All of the patients will be given a 0.5 ml intramuscular doses of&#xD;
      A/California/7/2009 H1N1 strain inactivated vaccine in the deltoid muscle; all patients will&#xD;
      receive a second dose after 4 weeks. Each vaccine dose will contain 15 µg each of H1N1&#xD;
      monovalent antigen. Patients under the age of 9 will receive the second vaccine as standard&#xD;
      of care, while patients 9 and older will receive a second dose as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study designed to recruit 72 patients with CD4 counts of ≥200. Patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled on a first come first serve basis and will attempt to reach equal numbers in&#xD;
      gender. A dose (15 µg) of the vaccine will be administered at day 0 and 30. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected as in Table 1 (see Below). At each visit, the total maximum amount&#xD;
      collected will be 17.5 ml divided in three individual samples: The first sample will be 5 ml&#xD;
      for serum separation used in the detection of Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers and&#xD;
      micro-neutralization (MN) assays. The second sample will be 10 ml processed for viral load,&#xD;
      CD4 counts and ELISPOT functional B cell assays. The third sample will be 2.5 ml collected in&#xD;
      a Paxgene RNA tube for future microarray testing. Based on the HI titer and MN responses&#xD;
      obtained, the patients will be classified into three distinct subgroups: (a) high responders&#xD;
      with ≥ 4 fold titer increases compared to baseline, (b) moderate responders with ≥ 2 and &lt; 4&#xD;
      fold increases and (c) low responders with &lt; 2 fold increases. From these subgroups, up to 25&#xD;
      complete patient's samples from the high and low responders will be selected for microarray&#xD;
      studies. The microarray will compare readings from all visits. These preliminary data will&#xD;
      serve the basis for future humoral and innate immunity gene activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays will be performed on&#xD;
      blood samples collected as described in Table 1. Two individual samples will be collected in&#xD;
      each visit, one will be used for serum separation used in the detection of HI titers and the&#xD;
      second sample for viral load, CD4 counts, ELISPOT and Microarray testing. Based on the HI and&#xD;
      MN titer responses obtained, the patients will be classified into three distinct subgroups:&#xD;
      (a) high responders with ≥ 4 fold titer increases compared to baseline, (b) moderate&#xD;
      responders with ≥ 2 and &lt; 4 fold increases and (c) low responders with &lt; 2 fold increases.&#xD;
      From these subgroups, up to 25 complete samples from the high, moderate and low responders&#xD;
      will be selected for viral load and microarray studies.&#xD;
