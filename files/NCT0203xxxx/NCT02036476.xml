  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, phase 2 study to assess the feasibility of using&#xD;
      cabozantinib in recurrent/metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma patients that progressed after&#xD;
      platinum-based therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cabozantinib (XL184) is an inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and was approved&#xD;
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 29 November 2012 for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. It is commercially available&#xD;
      as COMETRIQ™ in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Pre Treatment Period, participants are consented and qualified (screened) for the&#xD;
      study. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days, during which time the participant will be taking the&#xD;
      study drug, cabozantinib, once daily. The participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary&#xD;
      for each treatment cycle. The diary will also include special instructions for taking the&#xD;
      study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Participants will be followed for 8 weeks after removal from study or until death,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first. Participants removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will&#xD;
      be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed Merkel Cell Carcinoma that is&#xD;
             metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative measures do not exist or&#xD;
             are no longer effective&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately&#xD;
             measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 20 mm with&#xD;
             conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan (see section 10 for the&#xD;
             evaluation of measureable disease). Tumors within a previously irradiated field will&#xD;
             be designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of&#xD;
             primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin or another organoplatinum compound.&#xD;
             Patients are also eligible if they received curative intent platinum-based therapy and&#xD;
             progressed within a year of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior MET inhibitor is allowed&#xD;
