      The growing evidence showed that the OSA is a heritable complex genetic disease where the&#xD;
      genetic basis contributed the development of OSA and its sequel. The phenotyping of OSA&#xD;
      include high level and intermediate level. The former indicates the AHI, and later includes&#xD;
      craniofacial morphology, ventilator control, obesity, and sleepiness vulnerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies tried to determine the association of candidate genes with OSA through&#xD;
      association studies. However, the results were conflicting. We identified 37 candidate genes&#xD;
      involved in six biologic pathways of OSA reported in previous literatures, including&#xD;
      oxidative phosphorylation, cell signaling, apoptosis, cellular adhesion and motility, cell&#xD;
      cycle, and cytokine/chemokine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the association between phenotype and genotype of OSA, we conducted this&#xD;
      cross-sectional study by recruiting the patients of moderate-severe OSA (index proband) and&#xD;
      their first and second-degree family members, and friends and their family members (control&#xD;
      family) and using candidate genes reported in the literature and whole genome SNP array for&#xD;
      genotype approach.&#xD;

      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized with recurrent collapse of upper airway during&#xD;
      sleep resulting in hypoxia and sleep fragmentation. Patients of OSA might have symptoms like&#xD;
      snoring, non-restorative sleep, witnessed apnea, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Currently,&#xD;
      polysomnography is the gold standard for diagnosing OSA and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is&#xD;
      the parameters to indicate the severity of OSA. However, AHI poorly correlated with clinical&#xD;
      severity of OSA, where the symptoms of patients with the identical AHI could vary from&#xD;
      minimal to striking. The sequels of OSA include cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders,&#xD;
      and neurocognitive dysfunctions. Till now, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the&#xD;
      standard treatment for OSA where it can effectively improve daytime sleepiness, blood&#xD;
      pressure, metabolic abnormalities, and quality of life, especially in patients with daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The growing evidence showed that the OSA is a heritable complex genetic disease where the&#xD;
      genetic basis contributed the development of OSA and its sequel. The phenotyping of OSA&#xD;
      include high level and intermediate level. The former indicates the AHI, and later includes&#xD;
      craniofacial morphology, ventilator control, obesity, and sleepiness vulnerability. Many&#xD;
      studies tried to determine the association of candidate genes with OSA through association&#xD;
      studies. However, the results were conflicting. To clarify the influence of genotyping on&#xD;
      phenotyping, we reported a Chinese family with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome&#xD;
      (CCHS) that had a clinical spectrum ranging from newborn fatality to adulthood. Genetic&#xD;
      analysis was used to confirm the presence of the PHOX2B expansion mutation. Moreover, to&#xD;
      clarify the association between ACE I/D polymorphisms and OSA, we undertook a meta-analysis&#xD;
      on all studies published in this area. It has not demonstrated an association between the ACE&#xD;
      I/D polymorphism and OSA susceptibility irrespective of ethnicity, population sample or the&#xD;
      presence/absence of co-morbid hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, a couple of studies tried to genome-wide profiled the candidate genes involved in&#xD;
      the biologic pathway of OSA. The whole genome scan identified chromosomes 2p Âèä19p and&#xD;
      chromosomes 8q was associated with AHI in Caucasian and African American, respectively, which&#xD;
      is independent of BMI. Also, the whole genome SNP array identified candidate genes associated&#xD;
      with OSA as C-reactive protein (C-RP) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)&#xD;
      in European Americans and rs9526240 within serotonin receptor 2a (HTR2A) in African&#xD;
      Americans. We identified 37 candidate genes involved in six biologic pathways of OSA&#xD;
      including oxidative phosphorylation, cell signaling, apoptosis, cellular adhesion and&#xD;
      motility, cell cycle, and cytokine/chemokine. Furthermore, three models were constructed to&#xD;
      predict the sequel and response to 4-week and 12-week CPAP treatment, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the presentations of OSA are different among races, hence database of Taiwanese&#xD;
      patients with OSA is urgently needed to clarify molecular mechanisms. Through recruiting the&#xD;
      patients of moderate-severe OSA (index proband) and their first and second-degree family&#xD;
      members, and friends and their family members (control family) and via candidate genes&#xD;
      reported in the literature and whole genome SNP array, this project aims to achieves&#xD;
      following goals (1) Investigating the phenotyping and familial aggregation of OSA (2)&#xD;
      Investigating the association of genotyping on phenotyping of OSA (3) Investigating the&#xD;
      candidate genes and the involved biologic pathways of OSA. The anticipated contributions of&#xD;
      the results include (1) Highlighting the promise of patient-tailored management (2)&#xD;
      Establishing an invaluable database of phenotyping and genotyping of OSA for future research&#xD;
      (3) Promoting production of biotechnology patent and business.&#xD;
