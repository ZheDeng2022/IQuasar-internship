  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of two 6-month behavioral interventions&#xD;
      for weight gain prevention (self-regulation plus activity monitoring or self-regulation)&#xD;
      among African American breast cancer survivors along with a delayed control group.&#xD;
      Participants will be 45 African American post-treatment breast cancer survivors. Intervention&#xD;
      content will be delivered online with one face-to-face individual meeting. Weight, clinical&#xD;
      and psychosocial measures will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that it is feasible to deliver the two weight gain prevention interventions among African&#xD;
      American breast cancer survivors, and participants in the two intervention groups will have a&#xD;
      lower magnitude of weight gain at 6-month follow-up relative to those in the delayed control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among African American women in the&#xD;
      United States, and in North Carolina (NC), African American women are more likely to die from&#xD;
      breast cancer compared to women of other races/ethnicities. Given this disparity and with&#xD;
      approximately 90,000 African American breast cancer survivors in NC, it is important to&#xD;
      identify modifiable factors that can help improve survival among this population. Behavioral&#xD;
      interventions that promote weight management among breast cancer survivors can help reduce&#xD;
      risks for prevalent comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and&#xD;
      potentially improve prognosis and survival. While lifestyle interventions have shown promise&#xD;
      in improving body weight in breast cancer survivors, none have focused on weight gain&#xD;
      prevention in African American breast cancer survivors, nor evaluated the use of frequent&#xD;
      self-weighing as a self-regulation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular self-weighing has been effectively used as an approach for weight maintenance that&#xD;
      helps individuals monitor daily weight fluctuations and make small changes in energy balance&#xD;
      behaviors. Given that the frequency of self-weighing among breast cancer survivors is&#xD;
      unknown, and the importance of self-regulation behaviors for weight maintenance is well&#xD;
      established, extending previous work to prevent weight gain among breast cancer survivors is&#xD;
      a critical next step for optimizing cancer outcomes. It is unknown whether self-weighing and&#xD;
      activity monitoring is a feasible strategy for breast cancer survivors to monitor weight&#xD;
      changes and regulate their energy balance. Thus, this three-arm, pilot randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial will evaluate two behavioral self-regulation interventions for weight gain prevention&#xD;
      (self-regulation or self-regulation plus activity monitoring) compared to a delayed control&#xD;
      group among 45 female African-American post-treatment breast cancer survivors. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: Self-regulation intervention with activity&#xD;
      monitoring (n=15); Self-regulation intervention (n=15); and Delayed control (n=15).&#xD;
