      The long-term objectives of this ancillary application are to characterize a subpopulation of&#xD;
      smokers with auto-reactive T cell response, to validate immunodiagnostic assays that could&#xD;
      detect emphysema, and to find molecular signatures for pathogenic T cell development in a&#xD;
      well-characterized cohort participating in SPIROMICS (UCSF center).&#xD;

      One of the major medical challenges facing us is that susceptibility to smoking-induced lung&#xD;
      diseases varies greatly and essentially precludes our ability to predict which smokers will&#xD;
      develop emphysema. Because the SPIROMICS study is designed to phenotype a large and&#xD;
      heterogeneous group of smokers, we have chosen this cohort to identify the subpopulation who&#xD;
      have auto-reactive T cells, as this may represent a contributing mechanism in the development&#xD;
      of emphysema, which may need alternative therapies, and may represent a group of patients who&#xD;
      will have progressive disease despite smoking cessation. In Aim 1, we will prospectively&#xD;
      determine the presence of auto-reactive T cell responses as determined by increased cytokine&#xD;
      release in 180 ever-smokers with and without emphysema; in Aim 2 we will focus on the&#xD;
      longitudinal aspect of the factors that could predispose development of auto-reactive T cells&#xD;
      in the population at risk. These studies form the prerequisite basis for developing&#xD;
      additional novel immune-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in human emphysema. The&#xD;
      short-term objectives outlined here are based on our preliminary data, and provide the&#xD;
      necessary platform that will be used to answer the following urgent questions: i) in a&#xD;
      distinct prospective cohort of ever smokers, can auto-reactive T cells predict the presence&#xD;
      of radiographic emphysema? ii) Can we identify unique and persistent transcriptional&#xD;
      signature(s) that are associated with autoimmune emphysema? The observational and&#xD;
      longitudinal design of SPIROMICS allows for detailed assessment of the association between&#xD;
      emphysema as the primary clinical endpoints and could validate the novel T cell specific&#xD;
      immunodiagnostic potential that has been developed in our laboratory. We propose to explore&#xD;
      the role of autoimmunity as a contributing mechanism in the development of emphysema with the&#xD;
      additional aim of bringing current technologies to bear on clinical and future diagnostic&#xD;
      tests. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have discovered specific autoreactive T cells in&#xD;
      ever-smokers with emphysema and there is growing evidence linking these particular effector&#xD;
      cells with the pathophysiology of smoking related lung disease. Our proposed studies are&#xD;
      important because they will provide new diagnostic and prognostic assays (e.g. gamma-6-Spot,&#xD;
      based on Th1 and Th17 cytokines) in ever-smokers who have, or are at risk of developing&#xD;
      emphysema.&#xD;
