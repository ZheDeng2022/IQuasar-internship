    <textblock>
      Feeding that circumvents the oral cavity drastically alters the infant's feeding experience&#xD;
      (pre, intra and post feeding) and may lead to oral feeding difficulty. It is estimated that&#xD;
      35 - 40% of infants exhibit oral feeding difficulty. Consequences include delayed oral&#xD;
      feeding, growth failure, and inadequate mother-infant interaction. Behaviors related to the&#xD;
      feeding experience include behavioral state transitions, orally directed behaviors, hunger&#xD;
      and satiation cues, and social interactive behaviors. It is unknown whether these early&#xD;
      behaviors differ for hospitalized infants who receive long term tube feedings when compared&#xD;
      with infants fed orally or whether alterations in these behaviors can be early indicators of&#xD;
      later oral feeding difficulty. Documentation of these missing or altered behaviors is needed&#xD;
      prior to the development and testing of interventions to prevent oral feeding difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 75 hospitalized infants with long term tube feedings, this research will: 1) describe the&#xD;
      range of early feeding behaviors encompassing the feeding experience; 2) identify the change&#xD;
      in early feeding behaviors throughout hospitalization; 3) compare the early feeding behaviors&#xD;
      of infants with and without oral feeding difficulty at 12 months corrected age (CA); and 4)&#xD;
      compare parent perception and provider assessment of feeding, for infants with and without&#xD;
      oral feeding difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will document infant behaviors surrounding the feeding experience during tube feedings&#xD;
      weekly during hospital stay. Throughout the first year of life, infant growth, parent&#xD;
      perception and clinician assessment of infant feeding and infant and maternal behavior during&#xD;
      feeding will be evaluated to document the occurrence of oral feeding difficulty, allowing for&#xD;
      a comparison with early in hospital feeding behaviors. To analyze for changes over time, we&#xD;
      will use Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) for repeated count (Poisson) and&#xD;
      frequency/categorical (logistic and multinomial logistic) outcomes (e.g., frequency of infant&#xD;
      behaviors). Understanding the constellation of these behaviors and when they begin, will&#xD;
      guide the development of interventions whose goal will be to alleviate the long term&#xD;
      consequences of oral feeding difficulty, inform clinical practice, and reduce cost.&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIMS: Feeding that circumvents the oral cavity drastically alters the infant's&#xD;
      feeding experience and may lead to oral feeding difficulty. It is estimated that 35 - 40% of&#xD;
      infants exhibit oral feeding difficulty and 34% of infants evaluated for oral feeding&#xD;
      difficulty develop oral feeding resistance during the first year of life. Behaviors&#xD;
      associated with oral feeding difficulty include: unclear infant behaviors signaling hunger or&#xD;
      satiation; the infant frequently interrupts the feeding, spitting or vomiting, or postural&#xD;
      changes during the feeding; infant irritability; increased or decreased length of feeding;&#xD;
      delayed acquisition of feeding skills, and disengagement during feeding. Oral feeding&#xD;
      resistance is more severe and includes persistent food refusal &gt;1 month, disruptive mealtime&#xD;
      behavior, rigid food preferences, gagging in anticipation of feeding, and/or vomiting and&#xD;
      failure to master feeding skills consistent with the child's developmental level. The&#xD;
      consequences of oral feeding difficulty involve: delayed oral feeding, growth failure,&#xD;
      delayed perceptual motor performance, and disengagement with the caregiver related to&#xD;
      feeding, which leads to less optimal patterns of parent-infant interaction. It is currently&#xD;
      unknown what the early indicators of oral feeding difficulty are or when they begin to&#xD;
      develop. The purpose of this research is to prospectively describe early feeding and social&#xD;
      interactive behaviors of tube fed infants prior to the later development of oral feeding&#xD;
      difficulty and retrospectively compare differences in these behaviors in infants who exhibit&#xD;
      oral feeding difficulty with infants not exhibiting these behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the first year of life, infant growth, parent perception of infant feeding,&#xD;
      clinician assessment of infant feeding skills, and infant and maternal behavior during&#xD;
      feeding will be evaluated to document the occurrence of oral feeding difficulty, allowing for&#xD;
      a comparison of these early in hospital feeding behaviors. The study aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Describe the range of early feeding behaviors (pre-feeding, intra feeding, and post)&#xD;
      and feeding progression in hospitalized infants who have long term exposure to naso-gastric,&#xD;
      oral-gastric and gastrostomy tube feedings. Feeding behaviors are measured as behavioral&#xD;
      states, orally directed behaviors, social interactive behaviors (engagement and disengagement&#xD;
      behaviors), hunger and satiation cues, sucking organization, and motor activity. Feeding&#xD;
      progression is measured as the daily change in the proportion of tube to oral intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Identify the change in early feeding behaviors throughout the infant's hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Compare the early feeding behaviors of infants with and without oral feeding&#xD;
      difficulty at 12 months corrected age (CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Compare parent perception and provider assessment of feeding, maternal sensitivity to&#xD;
      infant, response to distress, social-emotional and cognitive growth foster cues and infant&#xD;
      clarity of cues and responsivity to mother during feeding at hospital discharge and 2, 4, 6,&#xD;
      and 12 months CA for infants with and without oral feeding difficulty at 12 months CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: While most healthy infants establish the recurring cycle of&#xD;
      hunger, oral feeding, and satiation in association with transition of behavioral states,&#xD;
      orally directed behaviors, and social interaction, hospitalized infants often experience tube&#xD;
      or intravenous feeding for extended periods of time, which contributes to non-establishment&#xD;
      of hunger, feeding, and satiation patterns. Unlike normal healthy infants who experience the&#xD;
      pleasurable sensations of smell, taste, touch, and social interaction associated with oral&#xD;
      feeding, hospitalized infants often have aversive oral experiences related to intubation,&#xD;
      insertion of oral gastric tubes, and suctioning. Behaviors associated with oral feeding&#xD;
      difficulty include: unclear infant behaviors signaling hunger or satiation; the infant&#xD;
      frequently interrupts the feeding, frequent interruptions, spitting or vomiting, or postural&#xD;
      changes during the feeding; infant irritability; increased or decreased length of feeding;&#xD;
      delayed acquisition of feeding skills, and behavioral disengagement during feeding. Oral&#xD;
      feeding resistance is more severe and may include but is not limited to food refusal,&#xD;
      disruptive mealtime behavior, rigid food preferences, increased or decreased length of&#xD;
      feeding, altered patterns of mother-infant interaction, suboptimal growth, and failure to&#xD;
      master feeding skills consistent with the child's developmental level. The consequences&#xD;
      include: delayed oral feeding, and disengagement with the caregiver related to feeding (which&#xD;
      leads to parent/caregiver frustration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost of tube feeding averages $40,000 during the first year of life. The cost of&#xD;
      outpatient behavioral treatment ranges from $10,000 to $52,000 and readmission treatment&#xD;
      averages $ 330,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant Characteristics and Behaviors Related to Feeding and Oral Feeding Difficulty: The&#xD;
      feeding experience encompasses the infant's preparation for feeding (prefeeding period), as&#xD;
      well as the actual feeding (intra feeding) and post feeding periods. Feeding involves complex&#xD;
      anatomic structures, coordination of breathing, sucking and swallowing, reflex activity, a&#xD;
      constellation of behaviors, and social interaction. Several infant characteristics including&#xD;
      gestational age (GA), post menstrual age, birth weight, health status, and long term tube&#xD;
      feeding have been shown to influence oral feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity of research that identifies the constellation of behaviors prior to,&#xD;
      during and post feeding for infants during tube feedings. Additionally, interventions&#xD;
      currently in use for hospitalized infants experiencing feeding difficulties predominately&#xD;
      address the intra feeding period. Management of oral feeding difficulty for older&#xD;
      infants/children is intensive, yet also addresses the intra feeding period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Feeding Progression: Low level oral feeding skills and slow feeding progression are key&#xD;
      indicators of oral feeding difficulty. Lau and Smith categorized levels of oral feeding skill&#xD;
      that include fatigue and endurance. Infants with more alert behavioral states progressed more&#xD;
      quickly to complete oral feedings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of Mother-Infant Interaction: Feeding holds the central opportunity for the&#xD;
      development of long lasting patterns of mother infant interaction. Feeding is critically&#xD;
      important because it involves mother-infant interaction; is a primary factor that affects&#xD;
      growth; and is a major concern for both clinicians and parents during the transition to full&#xD;
      oral feeding and through discharge to home. When the infant is unable able to engage with the&#xD;
      mother during feedings, this difficulty leads to non-optimal mother-infant interaction and&#xD;
      the potential for altered infant development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Feeding Difficulty: Oral feeding difficulty is identified by both parents and&#xD;
      clinicians. Parent perception offers detailed information from the parent's perspective and&#xD;
      includes ease/difficulty of feeding the infant, the infant's behavioral cues surrounding the&#xD;
      feeding experience, how the parent sets up and begins the feedings, and the length of&#xD;
      feeding. Clinician assessment identifies the infant's oral feeding skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods Prospective design. Infant feeding behavior, feeding progression, and&#xD;
      growth will be evaluated weekly during hospital stay. Parent perception and clinician&#xD;
      assessment of oral feeding difficulty will be evaluated at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months corrected&#xD;
      age. Mother-infant interaction will be evaluated at hospital discharge and throughout the&#xD;
      first year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: We will enroll 75 infants from Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (CHW) who are&#xD;
      expected to receive a minimum of two weeks of non-oral formula/breast milk feedings during&#xD;
      hospitalization. Infants meeting the following criteria will be eligible for this study:&#xD;
      prior surgical treatment for gut, or chest surgery (non cardiac), or non-surgical infants who&#xD;
      will require a minimum of two weeks of non-oral formula/breast milk feedings. Infants may be&#xD;
      receiving oxygen therapy and intravenous therapy. Infants may have previously been treated&#xD;
      for sepsis, pneumonia, received intravenous only intake, or managed with assisted&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include those infants who are currently being treated for sepsis,&#xD;
      pneumonia, intravenous only intake, receiving assisted ventilation, have congenital anomalies&#xD;
      of the oral cavity, chromosomal abnormalities, or are not neurologically intact (e.g. hypoxic&#xD;
      ischemic encephalopathy or significant neurologic deficit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Procedures for Data Collection. Evaluation data are collected at enrollment,&#xD;
      weekly during hospitalization, at hospital discharge, and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months CA. At&#xD;
      enrollment, after informed consent is obtained, the in-hospital research nurse will conduct&#xD;
      the medical record review and obtain the infant demographics/risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The early feeding behaviors data will be obtained weekly. Infants will be video recorded for&#xD;
      90 minutes. The first 30 minutes will comprise the pre feeding time. Immediately following&#xD;
      the 30 minute pre feeding recording, the infant will be fed (approximately 20 - 30 minutes&#xD;
      for the feeding). After the feeding is complete, the video recording will be continued for an&#xD;
      additional 30 minutes. The early feeding behaviors data are assessed during the entire 90&#xD;
      minute data collection session. Infants will remain on their cardiac monitors during the&#xD;
      session. The video recorded data will be transferred from the video camera to the secure&#xD;
      (encrypted) server and saved. The video recordings will also be downloaded into the Mangold&#xD;
      system for coding. The feeding progression data will be collected from the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes assessed at hospital discharge. Within 24 hours of discharge, the final assessment&#xD;
      of early feeding behaviors will occur. In addition, sucking organization will be measured for&#xD;
      infants who are partially or fully oral fed at discharge. The medical record will be reviewed&#xD;
      for the hospital progression data (feeding progression, type of feeding the infant receives,&#xD;
      weight gain, length, head circumference, length of hospital stay). The oral feeding skills&#xD;
      and sucking organization data will be collected by a member of the research team.&#xD;
      Mother-infant interaction will be assessed during a feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes assessed after Infant Discharge at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months CA. Infant growth and&#xD;
      mother-Infant interaction during feeding and play will be assessed at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
      CA in the Pediatric Translational Research Unit. Difficulty with Oral Feeding during the&#xD;
      infant's first 12 months, will be identified through parent self report and clinician&#xD;
      assessment. Mother-infant interaction will be assessed during a feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan: Frequencies and 95% confidence intervals based on the appropriate&#xD;
      model for the variation will be calculated for the behavioral data and changes in the&#xD;
      behavior over time. The behavioral data will be converted to percents, counts and rates over&#xD;
      time (weeks) to evaluate change over time (maturation). Changes over time will be modeled as&#xD;
      linear, curvilinear or step functions with fractional polynomials. Analysis of changes over&#xD;
      time will use Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) for repeated count (Poisson) and&#xD;
      frequency/categorical (logistic and multinomial logistic). Where the outcome occurs only&#xD;
      once, such as feeding by tube at discharge, the corresponding Generalized Linear Model (GLM)&#xD;
      will be used for regression modeling; e.g. a Poisson GLM instead of Poisson GLMM, a logistic&#xD;
      GLM in place of a logistic GLMM, etc. (AIM 1 and AIM 3).&#xD;
