    <textblock>
      This study will combine an oral drug called DFMO with celecoxib (also oral) and two IV&#xD;
      chemotherapy medicines called cyclophosphamide and topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find the highest dose of DFMO that can be given with celecoxib, cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
           topotecan without causing severe side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out the side effects seen by giving DFMO at different dose levels with&#xD;
           celecoxib, cyclophosphamide and topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the levels of DFMO in the blood at different dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if your tumor gets smaller after treatment with DFMO, celecoxib,&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide and topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if specific gene changes in you or your tumor makes you more prone to side&#xD;
           effects or affects your tumor's response to the combination of DFMO, celecoxib,&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide and topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if the amount of normal chemicals in your body called polyamines go down in&#xD;
           response to DFMO, celecoxib, cyclophosphamide and topotecan, and whether you are more&#xD;
           likely to have a good response to the treatment if they do.&#xD;

    <description>The standard 3+3 design for dose escalation will be utilized. 3-6 patients will enroll at each of 4 dose levels, but enrollment to a dosing cohort will cease after observation of DLTs in 2 or more patients. A minimum of 2 to a maximum of 24 patients will be enrolled assuming all 4 dose levels require 6 patients before an MTD is determined. A total of 12 patients may be enrolled at the study defined MTD (including those used to define the MTD) to provide additional adverse event data for safety evaluation.</description>

    <description>Reconstituted DFMO powder by mouth for 14 days and celecoxib capsule by mouth daily in each cycle. Cyclophosphamide and Topotecan IV on days 8-12 in cycle 1 and days 1-5 of cycles 2-17. Patients may continue for up to 17 cycles as long as therapy is tolerated (no DLT) and disease progression does not occur (SD or better). *Cycle 1 will include a 7 day lead-in with DFMO and celecoxib to deplete tumor polyamines.</description>
