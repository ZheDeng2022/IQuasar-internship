      As specified in the VA Uniform Services Handbook, Family Psycho-Education (FPE) treatment&#xD;
      must be available to all Veterans with schizophrenia who could benefit, and their family&#xD;
      members. This includes those receiving care at Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs),&#xD;
      and at Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Centers (PRRCs), whether provided on site, by&#xD;
      referral, or by telemental health. However, less than 5% of VA medical centers offer FPE.&#xD;
      Clearly, a major challenge is to devise ways to deliver mental health treatments and services&#xD;
      to Veterans who need them in ways that meet their needs and preferences. The proposed project&#xD;
      will compare the use of a website to deliver FPE to that of in-person delivered FPE. The&#xD;
      findings could have profound implications for the VA's ability to improve the reach, use,&#xD;
      appeal, and effectiveness of FPE for Veterans with schizophrenia, by using an e-health model&#xD;
      that facilitates family involvement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the VA Family Psycho-Educational (FPE) is a component of the Uniform Services standard for&#xD;
      care of Veterans with schizophrenia and their family members. FPE includes single family&#xD;
      variants, e.g., Behavioral Family Therapy, which is provided to individual families (consumer&#xD;
      and family members); and multi-family variants, e.g., Multi-Family Group Psycho-Education&#xD;
      (MFG-stands for 'Multi-Family Group Psycho-Education'), which is provided to multiple&#xD;
      families (consumers and family members together) in a single treatment group. To promote the&#xD;
      availability of FPE to all Veterans who could benefit, the VA began national trainings of&#xD;
      clinicians in FPE. Despite this training, the proven effectiveness of FPE, and that it is the&#xD;
      standard for care, it is not widely available to Veterans, is underutilized even where&#xD;
      available, and can incur relatively high resistance from Veterans and families. Less than 5%&#xD;
      of VA Medical Centers provide FPE. Further, even where it is available, it reaches a&#xD;
      relatively small proportion of Veterans who could benefit. Barriers to receiving this&#xD;
      treatment include the lack of appropriately trained clinicians, the need for Veterans and&#xD;
      family members to travel to receive these services--this maybe a particularly important&#xD;
      hurdle for a treatment that meets bi-weekly for a minimum of nine months--the tendency to&#xD;
      avoid in-person treatment due to the stigma associated with seeking mental health treatment,&#xD;
      and the difficulty of providing treatments after hours or on weekends when families are more&#xD;
      likely be able to attend. It is important for the VA to have treatment delivery models that&#xD;
      maximize the likelihood that all Veterans in need will receive interventions such as FPE,&#xD;
      including Veterans residing in rural settings, and Veterans who avoid VA settings due to&#xD;
      stigma. E-health delivery of services has been a focus of the VA as a way to overcome these&#xD;
      barriers. Specialized web-based approaches have been studied and found to be successful for&#xD;
      people with schizophrenia, and their families, and can deliver content that is intensive and&#xD;
      engaging with reduced requirements for staff time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' previous work has developed a model and guidelines to design e-health&#xD;
      applications for persons with schizophrenia and others with cognitive impairments (e.g.,&#xD;
      Rotondi, VA Rehabilitation Research and Development D61804R), and developed a highly scalable&#xD;
      intervention termed Schizophrenia On-line Access to Resources (SOAR) (Rotondi, R01 MH63484).&#xD;
      SOAR incorporated FPE into a modernized model that: incorporates web-based delivery; provides&#xD;
      the ability of users to individualize commitment and services to meet varied preferences and&#xD;
      needs, in order to address prominent reasons for resistance to FPE; and is accessible from&#xD;
      homes and smart phones. SOAR was highly successful at reducing illness symptoms for persons&#xD;
      with schizophrenia and improving their and their family members' knowledge of the illness.&#xD;
      The Daily Support Website (DSW) was created as the next iteration of SOAR, with improvements&#xD;
      based on what was learned from the original trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to conduct: 1) a non-inferiority randomized trial of the Daily&#xD;
      Support Website (DSW) vs. in-person MFG vs. Treatment as usual (TAU) that compares the&#xD;
      achievement of a personal goal, changes in severity of positive and negative psychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms, and family psychological burden, during treatment and 3-months post-treatment 2)&#xD;
      exploratory secondary analyses to identify Veteran and family characteristics that are&#xD;
      associated with achievement of a personal goal, decreased levels of psychiatric symptoms and&#xD;
      caregiver burden; 3) exploratory qualitative analyses to inform a larger implementation of&#xD;
      the DSW by identifying barriers, facilitators, VA system requirements, etc. from clinicians&#xD;
      providing the treatments, their supervisors, and participants. If successful, the DSW could&#xD;
      substantially increase the options, availability, utilization, appeal, and effectiveness of&#xD;
      FPE for Veterans and their families, thereby improving Veteran well-being, recovery, and&#xD;
      Veteran and family quality of life.&#xD;
