  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant portion of avoidable healthcare expenditures has been attributed to preventable&#xD;
      hospital readmissions; thus, reducing hospital readmission rates has become a national&#xD;
      healthcare agenda item. Despite much study of this topic, efforts to date have not been&#xD;
      especially fruitful in either predicting which patients will require hospital readmission.&#xD;
      Preventing readmissions has been even more difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently examined a pharmacist intervention that assessed patients' medication literacy&#xD;
      and adherence at hospital admission. In this retrospective data, low medication adherence&#xD;
      levels were predictive of hospital readmission. There was a non-significant trend between low&#xD;
      medication literacy and increased hospital readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have now decided to prospectively study this intervention. Prospective study will allow&#xD;
      for several improvements on our prior work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We have consulted the literature to more carefully examine existing instruments to&#xD;
           measure medication adherence and literacy. Based on this review, and based on our prior&#xD;
           results, we have made adjustments to these instruments which should improve reliability,&#xD;
           validity, and granularity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In our retrospective work, our intervention of pharmacist counseling was not randomized.&#xD;
           Although there were large differences in readmission rates between the patients selected&#xD;
           to receive counseling and those who were not thought to require it, there may have been&#xD;
           unmeasured confounding variables. Randomizing this intervention will greatly enhance the&#xD;
           likelihood that we are comparing two similar groups of patients.&#xD;
