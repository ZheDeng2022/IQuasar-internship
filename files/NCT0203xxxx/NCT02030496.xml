      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractures of the distal radius are common and account for an estimated 17% of all fractures&#xD;
      diagnosed. Two-thirds of these fractures are displaced and require reduction. Although distal&#xD;
      radius fractures are considered to be relatively harmless, inadequate treatment may result in&#xD;
      impaired function of the wrist. The consequences of post-traumatic loss of function are&#xD;
      comprehensive, both on an individual and a social level, and have long been underestimated.&#xD;
      Despite the substantial implications, no evidence-based treatment method yet exists. Good&#xD;
      results have been described both in patients treated conservatively and surgically.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, 60% of all fractures redislocate after conservative treatment at which point&#xD;
      surgical reduction and fixation is the treatment of choice. Recently, the use of volar&#xD;
      locking plates has become more popular. This type of osteosynthesis employs a volar approach&#xD;
      to the wrist and provides immediate stable fixation of the reduced fracture. This stability&#xD;
      allows for early mobilisation and may therefore result in an improved regain of function. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to compare the functional outcome following surgical reduction and&#xD;
      fixation with a volar locking plate with the functional outcome following closed reduction&#xD;
      and plaster immobilisation at one year follow-up in patients with displaced extra-articular&#xD;
      distal radius fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single blinded randomised controlled trial will randomise between open reduction and&#xD;
      internal fixation with a volar locking plate (intervention group) and closed reduction&#xD;
      followed by plaster immobilisation (control group). The study population will consist of all&#xD;
      consecutive adult patients who are diagnosed with a displaced extra-articular distal radius&#xD;
      fracture which has been adequately reduced at the Emergency Department. The primary outcome&#xD;
      (functional outcome) will be assessed by means of the Disability Arm Shoulder Hand Score&#xD;
      (DASH). Since the treatment allocated involves a surgical procedure, randomisation status&#xD;
      will not be blinded. However, the researcher assessing the outcome at one year will be&#xD;
      unaware of the treatment allocation. In total, 90 patients will be included in this trial&#xD;
      which will be conducted in the Academic Medical Centre Amsterdam and its partners of the&#xD;
      regional trauma care network.&#xD;

    <description>the primary endpoint of this study is wrist function, pain and disability as measured with the DASH score. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire is a 30-item, self-report questionnaire designed to measure physical function and symptoms in patients with any or several musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks, three, six and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PRWE questionnaire is a 15-item questionnaire designed to measure wrist pain and disability in activities of daily living. The PRWE allows patients to rate their levels of wrist pain and disability from 0 to 10, and consists of three subscales: Pain, Function and Cosmetics.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks, three, six and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life assessed using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. The SF-36 is a validated multipurpose, short form health survey which contains 36 questions representing eight different health domains. These domains are combined into a mental and physical component scale. From each domain, scores ranging from 0 to 100 points are derived, with lower scores indicating poorer quality of life.</description>

PA radiographs with the shoulder in 90 degrees abduction, elbow in 90 degrees flexion and the wrist in neutral position; lateral X-rays with the shoulder in neutral position and elbow in 90 degrees flexion; and the lateral carporadial radiographs will be obtained by positioning the lower arm on a 20-25 degrees angled wedge.</description>

    <intervention_name>open reduction and internal fixation</intervention_name>
    <description>The surgery will be performed by a certified trauma surgeon. After the fracture site is exposed, the fracture will be reduced and provisionally fixed with K-Wires and reduction forceps. An appropriate volar locking plate which best suits the anatomy of the wrist and the fracture type will be selected. Screw placement and fracture reduction will be confirmed intra-operatively by radiographic images. No post-operative fixation will be applied and patients will be instructed to use the affected extremity in daily activities as pain allows. According to Dutch treatment standards, vitamin C 500 milligrams will be prescribed to all patients at initial presentation and for a duration of two months in order to prevent Complex Regional Pain Syndrome.</description>

    <description>Closed reduction will be performed according to the Robert-Jones method. This involves increasing the deformity first, then applying continuous traction and immobilising wrist and hand in the reduced position. Additional radiographs will be performed to verify the quality of the reduction. After this has been confirmed, the wrist will be immobilised according to Dutch guidelines: a splint for one week followed by a circular cast for another four weeks. According to Dutch treatment standards, vitamin C 500 milligrams will be prescribed to all patients at initial presentation and for a duration of two months in order to prevent Complex Regional Pain Syndrome.</description>
