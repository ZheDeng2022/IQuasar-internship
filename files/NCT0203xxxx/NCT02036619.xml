      The General hypothesis is that the IADPSG screening strategy for gestational diabetes (GDM)&#xD;
      will lead to an important increase in the work load and the prevalence of GDM in Belgium but&#xD;
      that this might not be cost effective concerning the prevention of adverse pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes. The risk to develop type 2 diabetes postpartum will probably be lower than for&#xD;
      women diagnosed with the two-step screening strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective multicentric cohort study, women will be universally screened for&#xD;
      pregestational diabetes and GDM at the first prenatal visit during the first trimester by&#xD;
      measuring the fasting plasma glucose. In the second trimester, women without diagnosis of&#xD;
      diabetes or GDM in the first trimester, will be universally screened for GDM using the 50g&#xD;
      glucose challenge test (GCT) and the 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with the IADPSG&#xD;
      criteria for GDM. Diagnosis of GDM will be based on the 75g OGTT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accurate data on the prevalence of gestational diabetes (GDM) are lacking in Belgium and the&#xD;
      current practice for screening for GDM varies across different centers. The discrepancy in&#xD;
      recommendations is due to the lack of data based on research in our population concerning the&#xD;
      best screening strategy for pregestational diabetes in early pregnancy and the lack of data&#xD;
      on the best screening strategy for GDM. A substantial number of centers in Belgium already&#xD;
      use the IADPSG screening strategy although not always a an universal screening strategy or&#xD;
      not always as an one-step screening strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The General hypothesis is that the IADPSG screening strategy will lead to an important&#xD;
      increase in the work load and the prevalence of GDM in Belgium but that this might not be&#xD;
      cost effective concerning the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The risk to develop&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes postpartum will probably be lower than for women diagnosed with the two-step&#xD;
      screening strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective cohort study, women will be universally screened for pregestational&#xD;
      diabetes and GDM at the first prenatal visit during the first trimester by measuring the&#xD;
      fasting plasma glucose. GDM will be defined as a fasting plasma glucose â‰¥100-125mg/dl. This&#xD;
      will allow to identify the most important risk factors for the development of GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second trimester, women will be universally screened for GDM using the 50g glucose&#xD;
      challenge test (GCT) and the 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)with the IADPSG criteria&#xD;
      for GDM. Compared to the IADPSG screening strategy used in normal routine, the 50g GCT will&#xD;
      be an extra test specific for the study. Diagnosis of GDM will be based on the 75g OGTT.&#xD;
      Participants and researchers will therefore be blinded for the result of the GCT. The results&#xD;
      of the GCT test will be used at the end of the study for research purposes only. The use of a&#xD;
      GCT as an universal screening tool in a two-step approach with the use of the 75g 2-hour OGTT&#xD;
      with the IADPSG criteria only if the GCT is abnormal, is not yet validated and will be&#xD;
      evaluated in the study, since this could be a practical solution. Differences in GDM&#xD;
      prevalence and pregnancy outcomes will be analyzed using different diagnostic criteria based&#xD;
      on the 75g OGTT: the Carpenter &amp; Coustan criteria, the IADPSG criteria, and threshold values&#xD;
      if diagnostic criteria would be based on an odds ratio of 2.0. The evaluation of different&#xD;
      screening strategies and different diagnostic criteria will allow to explore the most cost&#xD;
      effective methods for identifying women at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes and at high&#xD;
      risk for the development of type 2 diabetes after pregnancy. By using a multivariable risk&#xD;
      estimation model based on the most relevant clinical risk factors and biochemical measures&#xD;
      for GDM in our own population, the aim is to develop a simple and cost effective screening&#xD;
      algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also allow to evaluate the best short-term follow up strategy postpartum for&#xD;
      women with a previous history of GDM. Different screening tests will be used three months&#xD;
      postpartum: a fasting plasma glucose, Hba1c and 75g OGTT.&#xD;
