  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 2.2 million children under the age of 5 years die from diarrheal disease each&#xD;
      year. Most of the burden of diarrheal disease is thought to be preventable with improvements&#xD;
      in sanitation, water quality, and hygiene. Large scale interventions promoting these&#xD;
      behaviours have either not been rigorously tested or have not produced sufficient change to&#xD;
      warrant being rolled out at scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research into the determinants of hand washing behaviour has identified disgust and shame as&#xD;
      key motivators. Evidence supports the theory that disgust is a natural behavioural reaction&#xD;
      to objects carrying disease risk, thus it may act as a key motivator for other health related&#xD;
      behaviours such as water treatment. Whether this knowledge can be harnessed to increase the&#xD;
      efficacy of hand washing and safe water campaigns in Bangladesh or elsewhere has yet to be&#xD;
      rigorously tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will develop an intervention that utilizes disgust and shame eliciting&#xD;
      messages to promote hand washing with soap and point of use water treatment in low income&#xD;
      housing compounds of urban Dhaka. The investigators will test the efficacy of this&#xD;
      intervention against a more traditional public health intervention based on increasing&#xD;
      knowledge of health risks and germ transmission using a randomized controlled trial. The&#xD;
      study sample will be broken into the following four arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment &amp; Hand Washing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Disgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Disgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment &amp; Hand&#xD;
&#xD;
      This design will allow us to compare outcomes for hand washing and water treatment between&#xD;
      both standard public health interventions and disgust and shame based interventions as well&#xD;
      as test the overall efficacy of the program comparing with the control. Data will be&#xD;
      collected from all compounds at baseline, three month midline and at the six month endline&#xD;
      giving us the practical and analytical benefits of a longitudinal dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compounds will participate in interactive, educational safe water and/or hygiene promotion&#xD;
      meetings. For the Disgust and Shame group, these meetings will emphasize disgust and shame&#xD;
      related to unsafe water and/or hygiene practices, whereas the Standard group's meetings will&#xD;
      resemble a more typical public health intervention explaining the risks and methods of&#xD;
      contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first meeting, compounds will receive a one month free trial of the latest compound&#xD;
      based chlorine dispenser model to treat their drinking water. A randomly selected half will&#xD;
      also receive a one month free trial of the latest compound based handwashing station. At the&#xD;
      end of the month, there will be a sales meeting in which the investigators will measure&#xD;
      compound members' willingness to pay for the trialled products by giving them the opportunity&#xD;
      purchase and keep the hardware in a Becker-DeGroot-Marschek (BDM) style auction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In assessing the impact of the interventions, the investigators are primarily interested in&#xD;
      whether the prevalences of safe water and hygiene behaviours differ by treatment arm and over&#xD;
      time. The best measurements for approximating behaviour prevalence are physical observations&#xD;
      (presence of residual chlorine, hand cleanliness inspections), structured observation of&#xD;
      behaviour, rapid physical observations (physical state of hardware/drinking water),&#xD;
      self-report of water treatment and hand washing behaviour and willingness to pay for&#xD;
      necessary products. The investigators will also attempt to measure and track changes in&#xD;
      personal determinants of behaviour such as feelings of disgust and shame related to hand&#xD;
      washing and water treatment behaviours.&#xD;

      Study Design To rigorously test the main study hypotheses the investigators are using a&#xD;
      stratified, cluster randomized trial. Sample compounds will be divided into four strata based&#xD;
      on compound size and presence of gas and will then be randomly assigned to one of four study&#xD;
      arms . Thus the proportion of compounds in each arm will be the same within each stratum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strata&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gas &amp; Fewer than 8 households per compound&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gas &amp; 8 households per compound or more&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No Gas &amp; Fewer than 8 households per compound&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. No Gas &amp; 8 households per compound or more&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment &amp; Hand Washing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Disgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Disgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment &amp; Hand Washing&#xD;
&#xD;
           Via randomization, half of compounds will be assigned to standard treatment groups one&#xD;
           and two and half to disgust and shame groups three and four. Within these halves, one&#xD;
           third will receive water treatment only and two thirds will receive water treatment and&#xD;
           hand washing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization will allow us to infer causality when analyzing the differences in&#xD;
           outcomes and stratification will increase the statistical power of our inference.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Field Staff The investigators will have three field staff designations, Field Research&#xD;
           Assistants (FRAs), Field Intervention Specialists (FISs) and Field Assistants (FAs).&#xD;
           FRAs will be responsible for baseline, midline and endline data collection as well as&#xD;
           structured observation. FAs will be responsible for fee collection visits. FISs will be&#xD;
           responsible for all remaining visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Site Selection Based on the literature review and hypotheses to be tested, the&#xD;
           investigators determined that our study would be most feasible and would provide the&#xD;
           most benefit in poor housing compounds of Dhaka city. To identify specific sites where&#xD;
           the intervention would take place, the investigators created a list of feasibility&#xD;
           criteria (see appendix 2) and received recommendations from ICDDR,B Research&#xD;
           Investigators with experience in urban Dhaka. The investigators then sent two FRAs to&#xD;
           evaluate the recommended sites using the list. With their evaluation the investigators&#xD;
           selected six communities: Mohammedpur, Mirpur, Badda, Korail, Khilgaon and Bashabo.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Piloting Phase The first five of our specific aims, all involving development of new&#xD;
           techniques, are the subject of our piloting phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aims One and Two To develop our disgust and shame intervention for water treatment and&#xD;
           for water treatment and hand washing the investigators will refine a long list of&#xD;
           potential intervention script contents. Our Qualitative Research Investigator and&#xD;
           members of his/her team will field test and review all items from this list,&#xD;
           systematically changing, removing and adding items until the list has become a feasible&#xD;
           intervention script that is culturally appropriate and appears to be effective. The&#xD;
           Qualitative team will use focus group discussions and in depth interviews as primary&#xD;
           tools to assess field tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim Three To develop a group version of the Becker-DeGroot-Marsckek (BDM) auction our&#xD;
           staff Economist along with the Qualitative Research Investigator and a team of FRAs will&#xD;
           field test and review different variations of the auction to determine which is most&#xD;
           feasible and which appears to produce the most accurate measurement of true willingness&#xD;
           to pay in our communities. The Qualitative team will use focus group discussions and in&#xD;
           depth interviews as primary tools to assess field tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim Four To develop a survey instrument which allows us to measure behavioural&#xD;
           determinants of hand washing and water treatment, the investigators will perform&#xD;
           multiple pilots and revisions of our questionnaire on small sample groups similar to our&#xD;
           sample. Revisions will be made based on qualitative review of subjects' impressions and&#xD;
           a quantitative review of gathered data. In the quantitative review the investigators&#xD;
           will perform principal components analysis and factor analysis of data to refine scales&#xD;
           for behavioural determinants already defined and/or to investigate whether there are&#xD;
           other determinants worth measuring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim Five The investigators have a short list of new measurement ideas that the&#xD;
           investigators will field test and review prior to implementation. For more details on&#xD;
           this list, see the &quot;Data Collection&quot; section below.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 1: Sample Enrollment, Baseline Data Collection and Set-up of Promotion Meeting&#xD;
&#xD;
           Within the chosen field sites, FRAs will search for compounds which, match all the&#xD;
           essential criteria (see below), match at least 2 of the preferred criteria (see below)&#xD;
           and which are located at least 75 footsteps apart from each other. Our field team will&#xD;
           make several visits during the six months of the study to each of the enrolled&#xD;
           compounds. During each of these visits the investigators will conduct different&#xD;
           activities including a household survey, structured observation, and physical&#xD;
           observations. The investigators will ask for consent from all the compound members&#xD;
           verbally during a courtyard meeting, and ask the members to come to a consensus of who&#xD;
           can sign as the compound head or manager. In the written consent form all the study&#xD;
           activities have been described briefly to make it simple and easy to administer and&#xD;
           understand. For each specific activity the investigators will again ask for an&#xD;
           individual's verbal consent, which will serve as a reminder that individuals are still&#xD;
           willing to take part in the activity. Taking written consent for each activity during&#xD;
           each visit could make the visit even longer. Signing paper documents several times could&#xD;
           make the participants confused and concerned because most of them cannot t read or&#xD;
           write. For any household members who miss the first courtyard meeting, the investigators&#xD;
           will repeat all the information and process.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If they do not agree, then FRAs will move to the next suitable compound. If they agree&#xD;
           and sign the form, then FRAs will record stratification data and perform baseline data&#xD;
           collection which consists of two household questionnaires and six household physical&#xD;
           observation forms (see &quot;Data Collection&quot; below for more details on questionnaire and&#xD;
           physical observation). Later, FROs will use stratification data to determine the stratum&#xD;
           and randomly assign the treatment arm for each compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Household representatives who will participate in baseline data collection will be&#xD;
           randomly selected from the pool of compound members present at visit 1. To ensure random&#xD;
           selection, the FRA will first arbitrarily assign numbers to the households with members&#xD;
           present. He/she will then write the numbers on small plastic balls and drop the balls&#xD;
           into a cup. He/she will then shake the cup and pour out one ball. The number on the ball&#xD;
           corresponds to the first household to approach for data collection. The FRA will ask the&#xD;
           present members of the household who is responsible for collecting water. This person&#xD;
           will be asked to participate, if he/she declines, the FRA will pour another ball out of&#xD;
           the cup and repeat the procedure. These steps will be repeated until six consenting&#xD;
           compounds have been selected. The first two will be given the questionnaire and physical&#xD;
           observation form and the last four, only the physical observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Essential compound criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Between 3 and 15 House'holds&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Shared water source&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical space exists to hold a compound meeting here or nearby&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No other interventions going on at this time&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Population is all Bangali&#xD;
&#xD;
           Preferred criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Use of water source is visible to others&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Shared kitchen&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Shared toilets visible from common area Visit 2: First Meeting- Promotion and Free&#xD;
                Trial FISs will conduct a three hour integrated behaviour change/product promotion&#xD;
                program taking place in the compound or at a convenient meeting place nearby. The&#xD;
                content of the program, which will vary by treatment arm, will be developed during&#xD;
                piloting and is briefly described below under &quot;Meeting Content and Hardware&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the end of the program, compounds will be offered a one month free trial of the&#xD;
           hardware specific to their study arm (see &quot;Meeting Content and Hardware&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 3: Reminder Visit Roughly two weeks after the first meeting compounds will receive&#xD;
           a check-up and reminder visit. FISs will meet with available individuals in two smaller&#xD;
           groups. The FIS will reiterate messages from the first meeting and discuss understanding&#xD;
           and agreement with these messages in order to further understanding and reduce perceived&#xD;
           barriers to the new behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 4: Setup of Second Meeting and BDM Auction Coaching Roughly three weeks after the&#xD;
           first meeting, FISs will visit compounds to set up a time and date for the second&#xD;
           compound meeting and to prepare the compound members for the auction. FISs will meet&#xD;
           with groups of two to four prospective bidders for an hour each and will explain in&#xD;
           detail the process and hold multiple mock auctions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 5: Second Meeting- Promotion and Sales Roughly one month after the first meeting,&#xD;
           as the free trial is ending, FISs will return to treatment compounds to conduct the&#xD;
           promotion and sales meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The promotion segment will be a one and a half hour behaviour change/product promotion&#xD;
           program similar to the first meeting but containing fresh material.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the second one and a half hour segment of the meeting, FISs will measure compound&#xD;
           members' willingness to pay for the trialled products by giving them the opportunity&#xD;
           purchase and keep the hardware in a Becker-DeGroot-Marschek (BDM) style auction.&#xD;
           Compounds not willing to pay the offered price will be offered other options to keep the&#xD;
           hardware assuring that at least 75% of compounds keep the products until endline (more&#xD;
           details on this in Auction section below).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fee Collection Visits Every month for a year after the sales meeting, compounds will be&#xD;
           visited by an FA who will collect fees and take rapid observation data (detailed under&#xD;
           &quot;Data Collection&quot; below).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 6: Midline Data Collection Three months after baseline data collection, FRAs will&#xD;
           return to compounds to collect midline data which consists of two household&#xD;
           questionnaires and six household physical observation forms (see &quot;Data Collection&quot; below&#xD;
           for more details on questionnaire and physical observation). FRAs will attempt to use&#xD;
           the same households as before, but if they are not present after returning to the&#xD;
           compound for a second attempt, then FRAs will use the randomization strategy from the&#xD;
           first visit to select new households.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 7: Structured Observation Half way between midline and endline data collection a&#xD;
           separate team of FRAs will perform 5 hour structured observations of hand washing and&#xD;
           water treatment behaviour in a representative subgroup of our sample. More on this under&#xD;
           &quot;Data Collection&quot; below.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 8: Endline Data Collection Six months after baseline data collection, FRAs will&#xD;
           return to compounds to collect endline data which consists of two household&#xD;
           questionnaires and six household physical observation forms (see &quot;Data Collection&quot; below&#xD;
           for more details on questionnaire and physical observation). FRAs will attempt to use&#xD;
           the same households as before, but if they are not present after returning to the&#xD;
           compound for a second attempt, then FRAs will use the randomization strategy from the&#xD;
           first visit to select new households.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Meeting Content and Hardware:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hardware Water Treatment One wall mounted liquid chlorine dispenser One 40 liter&#xD;
           reservoir with tap Hand Washing One reused 1.5 liter water bottle to be filled with&#xD;
           soapy water (laundry detergent mixed with water)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Meeting Content&#xD;
&#xD;
           All compounds:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All will receive water treatment promotion interventions, whether standard or disgust&#xD;
           and shame based. Two thirds will be randomly selected to receive hand washing promotion&#xD;
           along with water treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standard Public Health Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The standard public health intervention meetings will be modeled after typical&#xD;
           pre-existing high quality water treatment and/or hand washing interventions. The content&#xD;
           will include explaining/demonstrating how germs can enter into our body via untreated&#xD;
           water and/or unwashed hands, how they can make us sick and lead to death, and how these&#xD;
           risks can be reduced by practicing safe water and/or hand hygiene behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Disgust and Shame Based Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The disgust and shame meetings will contain similar explanations/demonstrations of&#xD;
           contamination mechanisms and risk, but will place most emphasis on the presence of fecal&#xD;
           matter in or on contaminated objects. FIS' will use more vivid or harsh local terms&#xD;
           equivalent to &quot;crap&quot; or &quot;shit&quot; to try to elicit a stronger reaction from participants.&#xD;
           They will try to communicate the information that we sometimes unknowingly serve feces&#xD;
           to our family by not washing hands with soap or by not treating our drinking water. They&#xD;
           will emphasize how fecal matter can spread between people, especially neighbours, to try&#xD;
           to encourage people to care about others behaviours and what others think of their&#xD;
           behaviours. Pending piloting, the meetings will also contain promotion of positive&#xD;
           identities-being a good mother, a strong father or a good Muslim-to stand in contrast&#xD;
           with shameful and disgusting activities. The content and terms used will be determined&#xD;
           by qualitative investigation with community members.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Collection Questionnaire All compounds will be surveyed at baseline, a three month&#xD;
           midline and a six month endline. The questionnaire for each of these instances will be&#xD;
           largely the same excepting corrections made during implementation and small changes for&#xD;
           administering at different times. The questionnaire will measure self-reported usage,&#xD;
           reports of neighbours' usage, knowledge and practice pertaining to hand washing and safe&#xD;
           water, perceptions of risk and severity of diarrhoea, norms/ beliefs/ feelings/&#xD;
           reactions relating disgust and shame, social networking, and demographic information.&#xD;
           These measurements will allow us to study the differences in behaviour and of behavioral&#xD;
           determinants over time and between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Physical Observation One of each of the following is taken in 6 households per compound&#xD;
           each time the questionnaire is administered and also during the structured observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Chlorine residual testing of stored drinking water (not taken at baseline) Hand&#xD;
           cleanliness inspections of child (see scoring sheet in appendix 4) Hand washing&#xD;
           demonstration by mother The investigators will ask her to demonstrate how she washes her&#xD;
           hands after defecation. The investigators will evaluate her performance as outlined in&#xD;
           appendix 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Others the investigators may include pending piloting:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hand rinse water testing via H2S testing (see appendix 13 for previous principle and&#xD;
           interpretation) Other finger cleanliness checks Wiping fingers on a white material and&#xD;
           evaluating darkness Wiping fingers on oil blotter paper Drinking water quality testing&#xD;
           via H2S testing&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rapid Physical Observation Rapid observations will take place in all compound visits and&#xD;
           consist of identifying the location and usability/usage status of hand washing and water&#xD;
           treatment hardware.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Structured observation There will be one structured observation visit halfway between&#xD;
           the midline and endline data collection visit. FRAs will conduct 5 hour structured&#xD;
           observations of hand washing and water treatment behaviours in a sub-group of compounds&#xD;
           which is representative of our sample. Hand hygiene and water treatment behaviours will&#xD;
           be assessed using the score sheet in appendix 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Auction/Willingness to Pay After the courtyard meeting, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
           an experimental auction to elicit individual households willingness to pay (WTP)for a&#xD;
           monthly rent-to-own subscription to the chlorine dispenser and the reservoir. The&#xD;
           investigators will use Becker-DeGroot-Marschek (BDM) procedure to elicit WTP, whereby&#xD;
           participants bid against a predetermined randomly assigned price confidentially kept in&#xD;
           an envelope. The investigators will collect individual bids and list them to find the&#xD;
           lowest of these bids, which will then be compared with the price in the envelope. In&#xD;
           this auction, if the lowest of participants bid exceeds the preassigned price,&#xD;
           participants as a group win the auction but each pay the price in the envelope. The&#xD;
           investigators assume the mechanism is incentive compatible for participants to bid&#xD;
           truthfully as their bid does not affect the transaction price. The investigators aim to&#xD;
           keep the actual sales price very low so that most compounds have the opportunity to keep&#xD;
           the dispenser.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Payment data After the sales meeting the investigators will measure continued enrollment&#xD;
           and maintenance of the safe water (or safe water and hand-washing) station on a monthly&#xD;
           basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Qualitative Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           During implementation our qualitative team will regularly visit a representative&#xD;
           sub-group of our sample to gather data on how the intervention is going, how it is&#xD;
           perceived and to give us an idea of what needs to be changed in our meetings or our&#xD;
           survey. The standards the investigators are using to determine the frequency of&#xD;
           qualitative work are as follows: Roughly one in every five compounds will participate in&#xD;
           in-depth interviews and one in every 18 compounds will take place in focused group&#xD;
           discussions. These numbers may vary depending on data redundancy.&#xD;
