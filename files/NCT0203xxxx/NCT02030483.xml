  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with PD 0332991&#xD;
      (Palbociclib) in combination with lenalidomide will result will be both effectively inducing&#xD;
      myeloma plasma cell death as well maintaining a favorable side effect profile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is for men and women with multiple myeloma that has returned after&#xD;
      treatment (relapsed) or did not respond to prior treatment (refractory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 1 study of the addition of the PD 0332991 (Palbociclib) CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor&#xD;
      to lenalidomide / dexamethasone treatment in RRMM. The purpose of the study is to determine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the combination of PD 0332991, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (PLD) in&#xD;
      treating relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. PD 0332991 (Palbociclib) is an experimental&#xD;
      drug and is a pill taken by mouth. It works by blocking specific growth signals within cancer&#xD;
      cells. Lenalidomide (also called Revlimid) is approved for use with dexamethasone for people&#xD;
      with multiple myeloma who have received prior therapy. Study participants will receive&#xD;
      different doses of Palbociclib and lenalidomide depending on when they enroll in the study.&#xD;
      The study will help determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of the study&#xD;
      drugs. Treatment schedule (treatment cycles are 28 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palbociclib daily for Days 1-14 of each cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide daily for Days 8-21 (or Days 1-21, depending on dose level) of each cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each cycle. Participants will continue on study&#xD;
           treatment as long as they are responding to therapy and not experiencing unacceptable&#xD;
           side effects.&#xD;

    The company providing one of the study drugs withdrew its support due to low enrollment.&#xD;
