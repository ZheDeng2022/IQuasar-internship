  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various systems to measure intravesical and intrarectal pressure during urodynamic testing;&#xD;
      especially cystometry, exist. Water filled tube -systems are the most commonly used and&#xD;
      should be regarded as the contemporary standard. A water filled system is however sensitive&#xD;
      to tube and or patient movement artefacts and prone to erroneous calibration. Air charged&#xD;
      catheters are less sensitive to patient and especially tubing- movements, and calibrate&#xD;
      easier. However, in vitro tests have demonstrated that air charged catheters respond somewhat&#xD;
      slower and relatively damped, especially to rapid pressure changes as in (simulated)&#xD;
      coughing, in comparison with water filled systems. The clinical relevance of these&#xD;
      observations is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a study to compare the technical reliability and clinical applicability of the two&#xD;
      types of catheter systems for cystometry in a synchronous double catheter testing procedure&#xD;
      in a prospective group or patients scheduled for urodynamic investigation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study design: Patient cohort, acute experiment, mono -center synchronous double urodynamic&#xD;
      catheter technique study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adult female patients and male or female patients with spinal cord injury&#xD;
      or meningomyelocele unable to void, scheduled for urodynamic investigation on the basis of&#xD;
      contemporary standards and guidelines, because of signs and or symptoms of lower urinary&#xD;
      tract dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Synchronous double catheter urodynamic testing; Standard filling cystometry&#xD;
      with both air-charged ánd water filled catheter pairwise inserted, and connected to the&#xD;
      registry equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Difference of intravesical pressure increment maximum during&#xD;
      filling cystometry between the two systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis to test: The average difference as well as the average absolute difference&#xD;
      of maximum water pressure (standard system) and maximum air pressure (comparator) are both 0&#xD;
      (zero).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no per-protocol for follow up of the patients.&#xD;

    <description>to test the clinical feasibility (-mean absolute- pressure responses differences) of the air charged system, against the contemporary clinical standard.
