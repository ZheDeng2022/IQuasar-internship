      This clinical trial studies peripheral blood hemapoietic stem cell mobilization with the&#xD;
      combination of bortezomib and G-CSF (filgrastim) in multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate if addition of Bortezomib to the mobilization protocol will result with an&#xD;
      increase in the levels of circulating peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) by at least 2-fold&#xD;
      in blood and in the apheresis collections in up to 4-days collection protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess whether time to neutrophil engraftment is 12 days or less, the historical&#xD;
      value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To test for co-mobilization of lymphoma or myeloma cells by bortezomib and G-CSF using&#xD;
      real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients and by flow&#xD;
      cytometry (cluster of differentiation [CD]38+/CD138+ cell) for multiple myeloma (MM)&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effect of Bortezomib on the extent of mobilization of dendritic cells&#xD;
      subsets, plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)1 and pDC2 and DC1/DC2 ratio by flow cytometry.&#xD;
