  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nasal CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), is a technique of noninvasive&#xD;
      ventilation commonly used in neonatal intensive care units, and has recently been used in&#xD;
      association with nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation (NIPPV - intermittent Nasal&#xD;
      Positive Pressure Ventilation), which consists of the application of respiratory positive&#xD;
      pressure cycles during the application of nasal CPAP, resulting in high pharyngeal pressures.&#xD;
      The NIPPV has advantages over traditional CPAP, including the prevention of atelectasis,&#xD;
      improved respiratory mechanics and decreased work of breathing in premature infants. A&#xD;
      refinement of this technique is the use of positive pressure breaths associated with nasal&#xD;
      CPAP synchronously in relation to the newborn's inspiratory effort (SNIPPV - Synchronized&#xD;
      Nasal Positive Pressure Ventilation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synchronization allows that the cycles of inspiratory positive pressure provided by the&#xD;
      ventilator coincide with the inspiratory effort, increasing the system efficacy. The Neurally&#xD;
      Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is a mode of partial ventilatory support based on the use&#xD;
      of electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi) to control the mechanical ventilator. The&#xD;
      ventilatory assistance starts according to respiratory needs of the patient, its use in very&#xD;
      low birth weight infants showed an improvement in patient-ventilator interaction, even in the&#xD;
      presence of leak around the endotracheal tube. This prospective randomized, clinical trial&#xD;
      aims to evaluate, in preterm infants with gestational age lower than 34 weeks with&#xD;
      respiratory failure treated with noninvasive ventilatory support, the impact of SNIPPV with&#xD;
      neural adjustment (NAVA) on success ventilation and the need for endotracheal intubation when&#xD;
      compared to treatment with traditional CPAP.&#xD;

      Type and location of the study A prospective , randomized , open label clinical study will be&#xD;
      conducted at the Albert Einstein Jewish Hospital Neonatal ICU, after approval by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee and the Research Institute of Education and Research. To participate in the study&#xD;
      the parents or legal guardians must complete and sign the Statement of Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and formation of study groups Two study groups will be formed according to the&#xD;
      type of non- invasive ventilatory support: SNIPPV Group (synchronized nasal intermittent&#xD;
      positive pressure) and CPAP group (continuous positive airway pressure). The formation of&#xD;
      study groups will be by randomization through opaque envelopes containing in its interior the&#xD;
      type of treatment to be used. The envelopes will be opened at the initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria Will be included in study preterm infants with respiratory failure and&#xD;
      indication of noninvasive ventilatory support, characterized by clinical evidence of&#xD;
      respiratory failure requiring use of oxygen greater than or equal to a FiO2 0.25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria Will be excluded from the study infants that parents did not agree on&#xD;
      participation; diagnosed with major congenital anomalies; with necessity of chest drainage;&#xD;
      diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage grades III and IV according to the criteria of Papile et&#xD;
      al; persistence ductus arteriosus with hemodynamic consequences and diagnosis of severe&#xD;
      perinatal asphyxia - defined as less than 6 APGAR with 5 minutes of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of the primary variable and secondary variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data regarding to birth weight, gestational age, sex, Apgar scores (1 and 5&#xD;
      minutes), type of delivery, use of antenatal corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, multiple&#xD;
      births, maternal diseases will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main variable will be the need for endotracheal intubation. This will be defined as the&#xD;
      need to use the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) greater than 0.30 and 7 cmH2O or more of&#xD;
      CPAP pressure for maintaining a target oxygen saturation of 88-94 % for preterm infants with&#xD;
      gestational age less or equal to 27 6/7 weeks, or a FiO2 higher than 0.35 and 7 cmH2O or more&#xD;
      of CPAP pressure for maintaining a target oxygen saturation of 88-94 % for preterm infants&#xD;
      with gestational age higher or equal to 28 0/7 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary variables will be defined as the total time of nCPAP , the total time of oxygen&#xD;
      use; time for the indication of invasive mechanical ventilation, the incidence of&#xD;
      pneumothorax and the maximum values of FiO2 in noninvasive support, the average values of&#xD;
      CPAP pressure, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (defined as oxygen requirement at&#xD;
      36 weeks corrected gestational age), the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage and&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage grades III and IV according to Papile et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilatory strategies The equipment used for both ventilation modes will be the Servo i&#xD;
      (Maquet , Getinge Group , Solna , Sweden). The pressure initially applied will be CPAP 5&#xD;
      cmH2O in both groups and can be increased up to 7 cm H2O at the discretion of the attending&#xD;
      physician. The CPAP applied and FiO2 will be adjusted toward maintenance of oxygen saturation&#xD;
      target of 88-94 % .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and sample size. Comparisons between continuous variables will be&#xD;
      performed by &quot;t &quot; Student test . The Kruskal - Wallys be used for non-parametric data .&#xD;
      Categorical variables were compared using the chi -square or Fisher's exact test , as&#xD;
      appropriate. The level of significance adopted will be 0.05.&#xD;
