    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a novel method to assess&#xD;
      antiretroviral efficacy for protection against HIV-1 infection in vaginal and cervical tissue&#xD;
      biopsies.&#xD;

      Participants: Six premenopausal healthy volunteer women between 18-49 years of age with an&#xD;
      intact uterus and cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Subjects will be given a single dose of two oral antiretrovirals&#xD;
      (maraviroc 600mg/tenofovir 600 mg). Subjects will be monitored and assessed for adverse&#xD;
      events post-dose. Subjects will be sent home and asked to return in 24 hours. 24 hours&#xD;
      post-dose, two vaginal and two cervical biopsies will be obtained. These biopsies will then&#xD;
      be placed in an ex-vivo culture system and exposed to HIV. Viral RNA will be measured over&#xD;
      two days to determine whether the tissues were protected from infection. A final visit for&#xD;
      safety will be conducted 7-14 days post-enrollment.&#xD;

             physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12-lead ECG&#xD;
             and clinical laboratory tests)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must have an estimated calculated creatinine clearance (eCcr) of at least&#xD;
             80 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula where: eCcr (female) in mL/min = [(140 - age&#xD;

             first outpatient visit (at which time the women will be asked to remain abstinent&#xD;
