    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to generate an exploratory training set of data and to identify&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers (a measurable biological response that predicts something) of innate&#xD;
      and adaptive responses to immunisation of two vaccines utilizing different adjuvant&#xD;
      technology given according to approved schedules to healthy adult volunteers. The vaccines&#xD;
      are model agents selected as they match antigens but have discordant adjuvants, have a known&#xD;
      immunogenicity profile, assays are freely available to measure responses, and they are safe&#xD;
      to administer to healthy adults at the doses and schedules proposed. This study will strive&#xD;
      to correlate biomarker activity with observed immunological responses to vaccination and if&#xD;
      successful, these biomarkers could be used in early stage clinical trials to optimize&#xD;
      selection of vaccine candidates with a profile that will be most likely to be effective once&#xD;
      they are in generalized use.&#xD;

      they are in generalized use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 15 subjects per vaccine will be recruited to receive immunization with one of&#xD;
      two hepatitis B vaccines, Engerix B or Fendrix, representing exactly matched antigens&#xD;
      (hepatitis B surface antigen) but discordant adjuvant technologies. Following a screening&#xD;
      visit, subjects will be randomly allocated to receive three doses of a vaccine at 0, 1 and 2&#xD;
      months. Innate immune responses (cytokine levels and whole blood gene expression) after doses&#xD;
      #1 and #3 and adaptive immune responses (serum antibody and antigen specific cellular&#xD;
      responses) will be measured at various timepoints after immunisation on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is funded by ADITEC, which is a collaborative research programme that aims to&#xD;
      accelerate the development of novel and powerful immunisation technologies for the next&#xD;
      generation of human vaccines.&#xD;
