      The investigators aim to perform a prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of blind&#xD;
      corticosteroid injections to US-guided injections for the treatment of de Quervain's disease.&#xD;
      The results of the study will be used to validate current injection protocols or support the&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      De Quervain's disease is the stenosing tenosynovitis and tendinitis of the abductor pollicis&#xD;
      longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) tendons in the first dorsal compartment of&#xD;
      the wrist. While the prevalence of de Quervain's is not yet well-established, previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that women can be affected by the disease up to six times more frequently&#xD;
      than men. Conservative treatments include splinting and corticosteroid injections, but&#xD;
      surgery is an option when such therapy fails. There has been a previous study that compared&#xD;
      the improvement rates of patients treated with splinting alone, injection and splinting, and&#xD;
      injection alone, and found the rate of improvement to be 19%, 57%, 67%, respectively. This&#xD;
      confirmed the good results reported in previous studies and recommends corticosteroid&#xD;
      injection to clinicians as a reliable treatment for de Quervain's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A seminal study performed correlated the accuracy of corticosteroid injection with pain&#xD;
      relief by including X-ray dye in the injection. The results of the study suggested a strong&#xD;
      correlation between accurate injection of the first dorsal compartment and pain relief. Since&#xD;
      then, the use of ultrasonography (US) to guide steroid injection has been suggested as a&#xD;
      possible clinical practice, but little research has been done on the technique. A 2009 study&#xD;
      reported a 93.75% rate of significant pain relief after the use of US-guided injections, but&#xD;
      there was no control group with which to compare results. The current standard practice for&#xD;
      steroid injection in de Quervain's patients is a blind injection without imaging guidance. To&#xD;
      the investigators knowledge, no study has compared the accuracy and clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      blind injections to US-guided injections. The investigators hypothesize that the US-guided&#xD;
      injections will be and will result in greater pain relief for patients than blind injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is intended to be a prospective study. Patients will contact Dr.'s Grindel and Daley for&#xD;
      a standard clinical evaluation, which includes palpation of the first extensor compartment&#xD;
      and application of the Finkelstein test. Those diagnosed with de Quervain's disease and who&#xD;
      fit all inclusion criteria will receive a detailed verbal description of the study from one&#xD;
      of the doctors, who will then attain written, informed consent from willing participants.&#xD;
      Dr.'s Grindel or Daley will then administer either a blind or US-guided injection. The&#xD;
      patient will return for follow-up appointments at 6-8 weeks and 12-16 weeks and will undergo&#xD;
      another physical exam to determine pain relief. A phone call follow-up will also be placed&#xD;
      one year after the injection in order to determine long-term effectiveness. Once 20 study&#xD;
      subjects in each group (40 total) have been enrolled and completed treatment, the data will&#xD;
      undergo statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study poses minimal or no physical risk to study subjects, as the US-guided injection&#xD;
      should show better pain relief for patients than the current standard treatment (blind&#xD;
      injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the investigators aim to perform a prospective study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of blind corticosteroid injections to US-guided injections for the treatment of&#xD;
      de Quervain's disease. The results of the study will be used to validate current injection&#xD;
      protocols or support the incorporation of ultrasonography to treat the disease.&#xD;
