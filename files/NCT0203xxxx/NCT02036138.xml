  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The growing incidence of obesity and type2 DM globally is widely recognized as one of the&#xD;
      most challenging contemporary threats to public health. Uncontrolled diabetes leads to&#xD;
      macrovascular and microvascular complications, including myocardial infarction, stroke,&#xD;
      blindness, neuropathy, and renal failure in many patients. The current goal of medical&#xD;
      treatment is to halt disease progression by reducing hyperglycemia, hypertension,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, and other cardiovascular risk factors. Despite improvements in pharmacotherapy,&#xD;
      fewer than 50% of patients with moderate-to-severe type 2 diabetes actually achieve and&#xD;
      maintain therapeutic thresholds, particularly for glycemic control. Observational studies&#xD;
      have suggested that bariatric or metabolic surgery can rapidly improve glycemic control and&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors in severely obese patients with type 2 diabetes Few randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trials have compared bariatric surgery with intensive medical therapy,&#xD;
      particularly in moderately obese patients (defined as those having a BMI of 30 to 34.9) with&#xD;
      type2 DM. Accordingly, many unanswered questions remain regarding the relative efficacy of&#xD;
      bariatric surgery in patients with uncontrolled diabetes. This randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      prospective multicenter study was designed to compare intensive medical therapy with surgical&#xD;
      treatment (LRYGB or LSG) as a means of improving glycemic control in moderately obese&#xD;
      patients (BMI 30-34.9) with type- 2 DM.&#xD;
