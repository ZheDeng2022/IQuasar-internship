  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no treatment available to repair/reverse acquired sensorineural hearing&#xD;
      loss. Recent experiments using human umbilical cord blood treatment of a mouse and guinea pig&#xD;
      models have demonstrated hair cell re-growth following acquired sensorineural loss as well as&#xD;
      partial restoration of ABR. Autologous human umbilical cord blood therapy, which has been&#xD;
      used for over twenty years, has an excellent safety record. This study will determine if&#xD;
      autologous human umbilical cord blood infusion in children with hearing loss is safe and&#xD;
      feasible, improves inner ear function, audition, and language development. The patients&#xD;
      umbilical cord stem cells collected at birth and stored at Cord Blood Registry will be used&#xD;
      for infusion.&#xD;

    <description>To determine if autologous human umbilical cord blood (hUBC) infusion in children with hearing loss is safe and feasible. Infusion related toxicity as measured by:&#xD;
i. hemodynamic instability: An adverse event will be defined as a sustained (&gt; 10 minutes) &gt;20% decrease in MAP.&#xD;
ii. acute lung injury: Chest X-ray will be done at baseline and at 1 day post infusion to assess for polymorphonuclear infiltrates iii. hepatic injury/toxicity: Hepatic panel will be performed at baseline and 1 day post infusion. Injury is defined as acute elevation of the AST/ALT hepatic enzymes &gt; 900 U/dl in the first 24 hours post infusion iv. renal injury/insufficiency: CMP will be performed at baseline and 1 day after infusion v. exacerbation of neurological status: defined as a change in Glasgow Coma Scale, pupillary size/reactivity, motor/sensory evaluation of extremities, and seizure activity from infusion to discharge.</description>
