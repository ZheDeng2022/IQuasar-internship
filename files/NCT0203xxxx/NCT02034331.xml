  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) are at an increased risk for metabolic disorders,&#xD;
      including that of insulin resistance. As a result of neurological injury, they often have&#xD;
      impaired mechanisms that regulate blood vessel function below the level of injury. Insulin,&#xD;
      which facilitates the transport of glucose into muscle cells, is also capable of regulating&#xD;
      skin blood flow, with insulin resistance reducing perfusion. Although beyond the scope of&#xD;
      this proposal, the possibility exists that impaired microvascular skin blood flow responses&#xD;
      due to insulin may further predispose to ischemia of the skin at pressure points of bony&#xD;
      prominence. This perturbed cutaneous vascular response may place persons with SCI at risk for&#xD;
      the development and poor healing of pressure ulcers due to microvascular dysfunction&#xD;
      secondary to neurologic and metabolic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: To determine the association between systemic insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      insulin-mediated vasodilatation below the neurological level of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that individuals with systemic insulin sensitivity compared to those with&#xD;
      insulin resistance will have greater insulin-mediated vasodilatation and an associated&#xD;
      proportional increase in cutaneous blood perfusion. Thus, intact and appropriate&#xD;
      endothelial-mediated regulation by insulin will be operative despite sub-lesional&#xD;
      neurological impairment in insulin sensitive individuals with SCI. However, because of the&#xD;
      absence of the SNS-mediated insulin action on the microvasculature (i.e., insulin-mediated&#xD;
      sympathetic withdrawal), it is being hypothesized that the vasodilatory response to&#xD;
      iontophoresis with insulin in insulin sensitive subjects with SCI will be less than that&#xD;
      observed in neurologically intact controls with insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To compare peak microvascular perfusion responses to endothelial-dependent&#xD;
      vasodilatation by iontophoresis with acetylcholine to insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the peak blood perfusion responses to iontophoresis with insulin will be&#xD;
      comparable in magnitude to that of acetylcholine in individuals with greater systemic insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity. This will be in contrast to individuals with systemic insulin resistance who&#xD;
      will demonstrate a diminished response to iontophoresis with insulin when compared to that of&#xD;
      acetylcholine. Because of SNS impairment, the peak vasodilatory response observed to these&#xD;
      interventions will be lower in the group with SCI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous microvascular blood flow is regulated by multiple mechanisms, including that by&#xD;
      insulin and by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Insulin is the principal hormone&#xD;
      responsible for the disposal and storage of glucose in skeletal muscle, in part by the&#xD;
      re-direction of blood flow through the rhythmic dilatation or contraction of arterioles. In&#xD;
      insulin-sensitive individuals, this &quot;vasomotion&quot; is thought to involve the activation of the&#xD;
      vascular smooth muscle, with vasodilatation occurring through nitric oxide and&#xD;
      vasoconstriction through the SNS and endothelin-1. A tonic upregulation of SNS activity and&#xD;
      increased vasoconstrictor action of insulin may be a contributor to the development of&#xD;
      hypertension, decreased peripheral blood flow, and endothelial dysfunction in the general&#xD;
      population, especially in individuals with hyperinsulinemia and diabetes mellitus. In persons&#xD;
      with spinal cord injury (SCI), a disproportionately high prevalence of insulin resistance and&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus has been reported. We postulate that insulin resistance, in combination&#xD;
      with the added consequence of SNS impairment below the neurological level of injury,&#xD;
      contribute to hemodynamic dysregulation and a variety of medical complications, including&#xD;
      pressure ulcer formation and decreased wound healing. Recently, our group demonstrated that&#xD;
      the sub-lesional blood perfusion response to iontophoresis with insulin is blunted in&#xD;
      euinsulinemic persons with motor-complete SCI compared to demographics-matched&#xD;
      neurologically-intact control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm and extend our preliminary finding and to provide additional insight into its&#xD;
      implications, we propose to perform an open-label, non-randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group intervention, observational trial to determine the hemodynamic actions of&#xD;
      insulin in individuals with complete motor lower extremity paralysis due to SCI and either&#xD;
      systemic insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance. Subjects will participate in a screening&#xD;
      visit to determine their eligibility and insulin sensitivity (i.e., categorized as being&#xD;
      insulin-sensitive or insulin-resistant). Eligible individuals will return for participation&#xD;
      in our study to determine skin blood flow by iontophoresis with vasoactive agents or&#xD;
      application of heat to the extremities. Measurements will be performed simultaneously with&#xD;
      provocation (i.e., with either heat or insulin or acetylcholine iontophoresis) being&#xD;
      performed on the ipsilateral extremity and no provocative intervention (i.e., either no heat&#xD;
      or placebo iontophoresis) in parallel and simultaneously on the contralateral extremity. On a&#xD;
      separate visit, all subjects will repeat the iontophoresis with acetylcholine, which is the&#xD;
      gold-standard to induce endothelium-dependent vasodilatation of the microvasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening, subjects will participate in 2 study visits where the iontophoresis (i.e.,&#xD;
      placebo, insulin, and acetylcholine) and heat provocation will be performed one time on the&#xD;
      upper and one time on the lower extremity. Each study visit will take no more than 4 hours.&#xD;
      The expected enrollment time for a participant to complete the study should be no more than 3&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The respective outcomes from iontophoresis with insulin will be compared and correlated to&#xD;
      systemic insulin sensitivity (as determined by an intravenous glucose tolerance test with&#xD;
      insulin administration) (Primary Aim). The peak microvascular perfusion responses to&#xD;
      vasodilatation by iontophoresis with acetylcholine to that with insulin will be compared&#xD;
      (Secondary Aim). In participants with SCI, the findings from the neurologically intact upper&#xD;
      extremity will be compared to those of the neurologically impaired lower extremity (Tertiary&#xD;
      Aim). A group of neurologically-intact subjects who are matched for group assignment (i.e.,&#xD;
      insulin-sensitive or insulin resistant) will serve as age- and gender-matched controls to the&#xD;
      participants with SCI.&#xD;
