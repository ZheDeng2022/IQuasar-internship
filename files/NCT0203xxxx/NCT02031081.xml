  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of gastroparesis has been increasing among Canadians. Symptoms of discomfort&#xD;
      include early satiety, stomach pain, nausea and vomiting. In addition, because gastroparesis&#xD;
      slows digestion, it can lead to malnutrition and make controlling blood sugar even more&#xD;
      challenging for diabetics. Mild cases of gastroparesis can be helped with dietary and&#xD;
      lifestyle modifications but treatments for more severe symptoms are limited. There are&#xD;
      several drugs called pro-kinetics available in Canada though results vary among patients and&#xD;
      these often cause significant side effects. Recently, a drug called Prucalopride was approved&#xD;
      for use in Canada to treat constipation. It has pro-kinetic properties and has been shown to&#xD;
      cause few side effects. The investigators propose to test prucalopride as a treatment for&#xD;
      gastroparesis by recruiting 30 patients from the Calgary area who have gastroparesis. The&#xD;
      investigators will test the effects of this treatment by alternating 28 days of active&#xD;
      treatment with prucalopride with 28 days of treatment with a non active placebo adding a two&#xD;
      week break in between treatments. The order of the treatment will be randomized and neither&#xD;
      the patients nor the investigators will know whether they are receiving the active treatment&#xD;
      or the placebo until the study has been completely finished. The investigators will measure&#xD;
      the effects using questionnaires that assess patient symptoms such as nausea and pain as well&#xD;
      as quality of life during two gastric emptying tests and throughout the treatment periods.&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the active treatment will be evaluated by comparing the extent of the&#xD;
      change in symptoms before and after treatments and the difference in gastric emptying times&#xD;
      as compared to the placebo treatment. The investigators will also monitor and track all&#xD;
      possible side effects that patients experience during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with gastroparesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prucalopride 4 mg daily improves meal-related symptoms compared to placebo as defined by&#xD;
           the change in cumulative meal-related symptoms. (primary endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prucalopride 4 mg daily accelerates gastric emptying rate compared to placebo.&#xD;
           (secondary endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A correlation exists between the effect of prucalopride on gastric emptying rate and&#xD;
           symptom improvement.&#xD;
