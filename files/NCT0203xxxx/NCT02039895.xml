      Radiation therapy, Total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT), achieves a high response rate&#xD;
      and is an effective treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma affecting the superficial region.&#xD;
      One the most widely used TSEBT techniques consists of six dual fields initially developed at&#xD;
      Stanford University. However, deviations occur from the prescription dose up to 40% and the&#xD;
      surface dose inhomogeneity as much as 90% in body areas such as the perineum and eyelid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Helical tomotherapy (HT) has advantages in irradiating extended volumes with treatment length&#xD;
      of up to 160 cm, continuously in a helical pattern without the need for field junction. Using&#xD;
      HT, an image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy, to replace conventional TSEBT technique&#xD;
      to increase dose delivery and decrease toxicities possibly. Recently, we published the&#xD;
      possibility of helical irradiation of the total skin (HITS) by physical proving and showed&#xD;
      the clinical results of HITS successfully for a woman with T cell lymphoma failure by&#xD;
      chemotherapy, topic UV irradiation and local radiotherapy (RT) to overcome the surface dose&#xD;
      inhomogeneity by conventional RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, investigators will enroll the stage I-IV cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) of&#xD;
      International Society Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL)/U.S. Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium&#xD;
      (USCLC)/European Organization for Research &amp; Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), patients who are&#xD;
      candidates for TSEBT by recommendation of National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines&#xD;
      (Version 4.2011, Mycosis fungoid/Sezary syndrome) or who are refractory or not feasible to&#xD;
      the topic UV irradiation, Interferon alpha, psoralen plus ultraviolet A photochemotherapy,&#xD;
      and Accutane® (Isotretinoin) or chemotherapy to receive HITS to replace TSEBT. Additionally,&#xD;
      we will compare the advantages and disadvantages between the plan of HT and conventional RT&#xD;
      for TSEBT.&#xD;
