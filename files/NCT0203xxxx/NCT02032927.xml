  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is a common joint disorder in the elder population.The current treatment&#xD;
      options include both a non-pharmacological approach (physiokinesitherapy, diet) or if this&#xD;
      fails, a pharmacological approach that relies in the first instance on drugs such as&#xD;
      paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (including inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase).&#xD;
      However, the use of these drugs is limited, by the roof effect concerning analgesia, and by&#xD;
      the potential side effects. When pharmacological treatments with non-opioid medications fail,&#xD;
      and a moderate-to-severe pain reduces the quality of life of the patient, international&#xD;
      guidelines suggest the use of opioid drugs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The WHO analgesic ladder, even with its limitations, is widely used to guide the beginning of&#xD;
      opioid therapy in chronic pain. According to this approach the choice of drug is based on the&#xD;
      intensity of pain reported by the patient; belong to the first step acetaminophen and&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and if these drugs fail it is planned to&#xD;
      introduce a weak opioid (tramadol, codeine) alone or in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association codeine-paracetamol, one of the most widely used drug combinations in the&#xD;
      treatment of moderate pain from osteoarthritis, demonstrated analgesic efficacy superior only&#xD;
      to paracetamol in the short term; however, its use was less effective in the long term and&#xD;
      worsen by multiple side effects, especially gastrointestinal with results in poor adherence&#xD;
      to the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lately, the international guidelines on the treatment of chronic pain in cancer have&#xD;
      suggested the possibility of moving, in case of inadequate efficacy of paracetamol and / or&#xD;
      NSAIDs, directly to the third step, using a low dose of a strong opioid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The side effects associated with the use of opioids in the treatment of chronic pain, such as&#xD;
      itching, side effects of gastrointestinal and central nervous system effects (drowsiness,&#xD;
      giddiness), often necessitate dose reduction (thus compromising the analgesic effect), with&#xD;
      often resulting in discontinuation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent strategy to face the underlying cause of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is the&#xD;
      oral administration of an antagonist of opioid receptor that acts specifically and locally at&#xD;
      the level of the gastrointestinal tract. This prevents or minimizes gastrointestinal side&#xD;
      effects but does not affect the central analgesic effect of the opioid thank to the low&#xD;
      bioavailability of the antagonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent review on the effects of chronic pain on cognitive function of patients describes a&#xD;
      series of clinical evidence suggestive of a intellectual impairment predominantly associated&#xD;
      with a significant psychomotor slowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interesting corollary of the problematic pain-cognition is represented by the possible&#xD;
      neuropsychological side effect due to teh use of opioid drugs in the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the research becomes to determinate how much the analgesic relief, derived&#xD;
      from the assumption of opioid drugs, can lead to an improvement in cognitive function without&#xD;
      the possible side effects of the drugs themselves.&#xD;

    <time_frame>15 days from the enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>The number of patients has been estimated considering that, at 15 days of enrollment, a reduction of 30% of the WOMAC pain subscale, with a score at BFI &lt;50, the use of not more than one laxative drug or the absence of side effects such as to consider the need to discontinue therapy occurs in 80% of patients in Protocol B versus 50% of patients in Protocol A, with 73 patients per group will be able to highlight an odds ratio (OR) 2.65 with a power of 80% and an alpha error of 5% (2-tailed). The calculation was performed with nQuery 4 (Statistical Solutions, Cork, IRL).&#xD;
Considering a drop out rate of about 24% is numerosity you plan to enroll a total of 182 patients in order to obtain 146 patients valid.</description>
