  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if acquired (partial) Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane&#xD;
      Conductance Regulator (CFTR) deficiency contributes substantially to the pathogenic&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS), creating a localized environment that&#xD;
      impairs mucociliary clearance (MCC).&#xD;

      Nasal Potential Difference (NPD) measurements will be conducted on participants. The NPD&#xD;
      measurement, is a bioelectric assay of CFTR-dependent ion transport that has been used in a&#xD;
      variety of protocols designed to detect CFTR function. A 4-Step protocol will be utilized.&#xD;
      The nasal cavities will be perfused in a step-wise fashion with the following solutions: 1)&#xD;
      Ringer's solution, 2) Ringer's solution + amiloride 100μM, 3) Low-Cl--containing solution,&#xD;
      and 4) Low-Cl- + isoproterenol (10 µM). The potential difference will be monitored in nasal&#xD;
      epithelium in comparison to an agar filled reference butterfly electrode placed in the volar&#xD;
      aspect of the forearm, and connected via a calomel cell to a high impedance voltmeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following placement of the subcutaneous reference bridge, the nasal probe will be secured 1-3&#xD;
      cm within the inferior meatus and secured in position at the most polarizing position. Each&#xD;
      nare will then be sequentially perfused with Ringer solution. All nasal potential difference&#xD;
      tracings will be scored independently by a single reviewer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator and an internal committee comprised of Gregory Fleming James Associate&#xD;
      Scientists will oversee the safety of the study. Our internal committee is a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary group consisting of physician and subspecialists who, collectively, have&#xD;
      experience in treatment patients with cystic fibrosis and other airway disease in the conduct&#xD;
      of randomized clinical trials. The primary responsibility of this committee is to protect the&#xD;
      safety and welfare of subjects consenting to the investigator's procurement of remnant tissue&#xD;
      during endoscopic sinus procedure. Members are responsible for reviewing procedural conduct,&#xD;
      including acquisition of consents and materials, to protect patient well-being. An interim&#xD;
      data safety review will be conducted on a yearly basis. The committee will consist of at&#xD;
      least 3 members with clinical trials experience in airway diseases. During annual review,&#xD;
      issues relating to the safety and process for acquiring human tissues will be reviewed.&#xD;
      Summary reports from each annual meeting will be prepared and will address concerns about the&#xD;
      procurement of tissue or any other information deemed pertinent to the review.&#xD;

    <description>A &gt;-5 mV increase in total chloride secretion (change in NPD following nominal Cl- solution + amiloride + isoproterenol) is typically designated as evidence of measurable difference in CFTR function. Results of NPD measurements between CRS patients and healthy controls will be examined.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The patient eligibility criteria are designed to limit enrollment to healthy individuals&#xD;
        and patients who clearly have CRS based on Sinus and Allergy health partnership criteria,&#xD;
        but who are sufficiently well (both in terms of CRS and in terms of concomitant illness,&#xD;
        such as asthma) to safely participate in study procedures and provide interpretable&#xD;
        results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        a. Patients with CRS will be diagnosed according to Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership&#xD;
        symptom-based and objective criteria as follows: i. Duration of disease is qualified by&#xD;
        continuous symptoms (≥ 2 major factors or at least 1 major factor &amp; 2 minor symptoms; Table&#xD;
        2) for ≥ 12 consecutive weeks or ≥ 12 weeks of physical findings. ii. One of these signs of&#xD;
        inflammation must be present and identified in association with ongoing symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Discolored nasal drainage arising from the nasal passages, nasal polyps, or polypoid&#xD;
