  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common medical problems encountered in daily life; it&#xD;
      is related to disability and work absence and accounts for high economical costs in Western&#xD;
      societies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-back pain is a diverse group of mixed pain syndromes (neuropathic and nociceptive) with&#xD;
      different molecular pathologies at different structural levels displaying similar clinical&#xD;
      manifestations. Currently, there are limited biomarkers (mostly imaging) or clinical findings&#xD;
      that can be used objectively to help the physician in precise anatomic diagnosis leading to&#xD;
      the safest and most cost-effective treatment for the patient (reduction of direct and&#xD;
      indirect costs and improvement of treatment efficacy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this trial is to identify all &quot;omics biomarkers&quot; associated with&#xD;
      susceptibility to chronic/persistent LBP and its different pathophysiology.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective observational multinational clinical study, with a case control design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will compare &quot;omic biomarkers&quot; between patients with and without persistent&#xD;
      chronic low back pain (CLBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;OMIC&quot; biomarkers investigated will be genetics, glycomics and activomic. Genetics through&#xD;
      GWA studies has already obtained important results in pain research; however concerning low&#xD;
      back pain, there is not yet suitable genotype-phenotype correlations helpful to stratify&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycomics is an emerging field that has recently been identified as a priority for the next&#xD;
      decade by the US National Academies of Science. Many common complex diseases will be&#xD;
      associated with specific changes in glycan structures. In addition, common genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms influencing glycosylation and consequent differences in glycome composition&#xD;
      could be important diagnostic and prognostic markers. The first studies reporting protein&#xD;
      glycosylation in large human population samples have been recently published by partners in&#xD;
      the consortium. Reliable identification of valid associations between specific&#xD;
      glyco-phenotypes and predisposition for the development or progression of a specific disease&#xD;
      requires analysis of thousands of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activomics: combines data about enzymatic activity of numerous numerous post-translational&#xD;
      modification proteins in an integrated model which provides dynamic characterization of the&#xD;
      current state of an organism. In this project information about numerous proteases, kinases,&#xD;
      phosphatases and glycosidases will be collected and used to complement the existing phenotype&#xD;
      information.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective is to recognize genetic variants associated with persistent CLBP patients compared to patients without chronic/persistent pain. Through a Genetic Wide Association Study (GWAS) investigators will correlate genetic variants associated with persistent CLBP in a wide, international population of European ancestry.</description>

    <description>All &quot;omic&quot; data will be compared stratifying our population according to:&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Cases will be collected at each participating centre. Every effort will be made to&#xD;
        accumulate a well phenotyped cohort of patients with persistent CLBP, sub-grouped into 6&#xD;
        categories: discogenic pain, spinal stenosis (congenital or acquired), facet joint pain,&#xD;
        sacroiliac joint pain, low back pain with radicular pain (not predominant radicular pain)&#xD;
        and widespread low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Controls (patients without chronic/persistent pain as defined above) will be retrieved from&#xD;
        2 different sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Existing biobanks of healthy subjects which have collected information about&#xD;
        chronic/persistent back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects from the companion prospective study on acute LBP who will not have developed&#xD;
        CLBP.&#xD;
