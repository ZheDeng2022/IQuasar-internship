    <textblock>
      Hearing loss screening rates in for older persons in primary care clinics are very low even&#xD;
      though hearing loss is relatively common for older persons. When diagnosed with hearing loss&#xD;
      older persons are often reluctant to follow through. This study involves a prospective&#xD;
      controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of three primary care based protocols for older&#xD;
      adults â‰¥ 60 who screen positive for possible hearing loss in promoting subsequent access to&#xD;
      and use of hearing health care services. The protocols will compare: 1) screening only&#xD;
      (standard care control); 2) screening plus an illustrated educational brochure; and 3)&#xD;
      screening plus an in-person educational intervention and an illustrated educational brochure.&#xD;
      Screening will be done by primary care personnel. Participants will be tracked for 8 months&#xD;
      to assess outcomes.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent to which hearing health outcomes are&#xD;
      improved when patients are screened for hearing loss and provided an educational brochure or&#xD;
      screened and provided the brochure plus an educational segment emphasizing points in the&#xD;
      brochure versus a standard screening only protocol. These procedures are non-invasive.&#xD;
      Hearing loss screening is part of basic health evaluations for older persons, brochures are&#xD;
      commonly handed out for a variety of health conditions, and providing patient education is&#xD;
      common practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all sites our study research nurse will train clinic staff, contact patients who have&#xD;
      indicated they are interested in taking part, obtain informed consent, administer baseline&#xD;
      and follow-up questionnaires, and ensure that those completing the two follow-ups receive&#xD;
      their gift cards. No information from clinic medical records will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the extent to which hearing health outcomes are improved when patients are&#xD;
           screened for hearing loss and provided an educational brochure or screened and provided&#xD;
           the brochure plus an educational segment emphasizing points in the brochure versus a&#xD;
           standard screening only protocol..&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine hearing health outcomes by patient and clinic characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare any observed gains in outcomes against the estimated staff time to administer&#xD;
           either the brochure or the brochure plus the educational segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three primary outcomes involve comparing the differential impacts of adding an&#xD;
      illustrated educational brochure or adding both a brochure and a brief educational segment&#xD;
      over screening only. These three outcomes are whether the participant went to see a hearing&#xD;
      specialist for an evaluation, whether a hearing or other assistive listening device was&#xD;
      obtained if recommended, and whether the device if obtained was being used. Other outcomes&#xD;
      include the number of hours a day participants who received assistive devices actually wear&#xD;
      them, the number of changes participants have made to improve communication other than&#xD;
      obtaining an assistive device, and the extent to which their hearing related quality of life&#xD;
      improves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary care clinics taking part in our study already do some screening for hearing loss&#xD;
      but often screening is not perceived as leading to better outcomes. The clinics are&#xD;
      interested in the opportunity to participate in a project that will assess how effective&#xD;
      screening is when combined with additional educational material. All consenting and data&#xD;
      collection will be done by our study's Research Nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific procedures are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Older patients coming into the clinic for a medical appointment and who are not wearing&#xD;
           hearing aids will be screened by intake personnel (usually a medical assistant or office&#xD;
           nurse) for hearing loss using a direct question (&quot;Do you have any difficulty hearing?&quot;)&#xD;
           and a finger rub test (the finger rub protocol is attached). When either or both of&#xD;
           these tests indicate possible hearing loss, intake personnel will tell the patient that&#xD;
           their health care provider will be informed and then ask them if they are interested in&#xD;
           taking part in a study of hearing loss. Those who express an interest will be asked to&#xD;
           fill out contact information on a card for transmission to the study's Research Nurse.&#xD;
           They will also be given a flyer describing the study and two copies of the consent to&#xD;
           take with them to review and discuss with the study's research nurse. A stamped return&#xD;
           envelope will be included for mailing the signed consent after discussing the study with&#xD;
           the Research Nurse. The envelope will have the study address both on the front and in&#xD;
           the space for the return address in order to protect patient confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           One of three protocols will then occur for those indicating an interest in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For the first 28 patients the intake personnel will take no further action other&#xD;
                than to provide the screening results to the patient's health care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For the next 28 patients the intake personnel will hand them the brochure For the&#xD;
                last 28 patients the intake personnel will hand them the brochure and then ask if&#xD;
                it is all right with them if he/she goes over some points in the brochure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Training for the finger rub and what to do during the three protocols will be conducted&#xD;
           by the study's Research Nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The health care provider that the patient sees will follow his or her usual procedures&#xD;
           for handling a patient with possible hearing loss. This usually involves checking the&#xD;
           ears for wax buildup, further discussion about the possible extent of the loss, and&#xD;
           referral to a hearing specialist if warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The Research Nurse will come by the clinics regularly to pick up the contact cards and&#xD;
           respond to any questions that medical assistants or other clinic staff may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The Research Nurse will then contact potential participants to explain the study, review&#xD;
           the consent they took home, ask those still interested in taking part in the study to&#xD;
           sign one copy of the consent and place it in the provided envelope for mailing, and&#xD;
           administer the baseline questionnaire. She will explain that there will be two follow-up&#xD;
           contacts at 4 and 8 months. If participants can hear well enough to do the interviewing&#xD;
           over the telephone it will be used for all contact between the Research Nurse and&#xD;
           participants. The informed consent will include a self-addressed envelope for mailing&#xD;
           the signed copy to the Research Nurse. If participants do not feel they can hear well&#xD;
           enough to talk with the Research Nurse over the telephone, all consenting and&#xD;
           interviewing will be done at a place of their own choosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. At the end of the 8-month follow-up, participants from the first two protocol groups&#xD;
           will be given the same educational materials (brochure and/or verbal educational&#xD;
           protocol) by the study Research Nurse that they would have received had they been in the&#xD;
           third protocol group. Thus by the end of the study all participants will have received&#xD;
           the brochure and the educational intervention.&#xD;
