  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 40 healthy subjects at 2 sites, age 30-65 year old with Fitzpatrick-Elastosis score of&#xD;
      3-6 and mild to moderate age/sun-related facial pigmentation that wish to improve their&#xD;
      facial skin appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The SST will improve the appearance of the wrinkles/elastosis and/or pigmentation&#xD;
      by at least 1 on the FES scale or ≥50% in category scale at 3 months follow-ups in at least&#xD;
      50% of the study population.&#xD;
