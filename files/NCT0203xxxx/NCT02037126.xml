  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and estimate the efficacy of&#xD;
      psilocybin-facilitated treatment for cocaine use. We also will monitor the impact of&#xD;
      psilocybin-facilitated treatment on the use of other drugs and outcomes relevant to cocaine&#xD;
      involvement (e.g., criminal involvement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI assessment is a unique aspect of this study. As a potential biological mechanism of&#xD;
      psilocybin's effect includes changes in default mode network functional connectivity&#xD;
      (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012), we will determine if psilocybin's therapeutic effects are&#xD;
      mediated by such changes. Moreover, as Glx (a brain metabolite that reflects glutamate)&#xD;
      abnormalities have been shown to play a role in cocaine addiction, we will determine if&#xD;
      psilocybin impacts Glx in the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Individuals who are eligible to participate and provide informed consent will complete&#xD;
      baseline questionnaires and be randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to the Psilocybin&#xD;
      or Active Placebo group. The first MRI assessment will take place shortly thereafter using a&#xD;
      3T head-only Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy scanner (Magnetom Allegra, Siemens&#xD;
      medial Solutions, Malvern, PA), optimized for neuroimaging applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation sessions (see below) and the drug administration session will take place in a&#xD;
      room at the Clinical Research Unit designed to be as comfortable, aesthetically pleasing&#xD;
      (i.e., living-room like), and safe (e.g., no furniture with sharp corners or glass objects)&#xD;
      as possible, with a directly adjacent, private restroom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo four weekly preparation sessions of approximately 2 hours each.&#xD;
      The purpose of these sessions is to: 1) develop strong therapeutic alliance between the&#xD;
      participants and the guide (Dr. Hendricks) and secondary monitor (Dr. Cropsey); 2) establish&#xD;
      comfort and rapport between participants and the remainder of the research team; 3) discuss&#xD;
      participants' aspirations with regard to their drug administration experience (e.g., What do&#xD;
      participants hope to gain from their experience?); 4) discuss the treatment rationale and&#xD;
      putative mechanisms of action of psilocybin (e.g., insight and reorientation that boost&#xD;
      motivation to quit and abstinence self-efficacy, reduction of withdrawal/craving secondary to&#xD;
      mood improvement); 5) obtain a detailed personal history of the participant, with a focus on&#xD;
      those factors contributing to their current difficulties; 6) prepare participants for drug&#xD;
      administration, including a detailed account of all potential effects of the drug; 7) discuss&#xD;
      all aspects of the drug administration protocol (i.e., logistics and procedures), including&#xD;
      plans of action in the event that participants experience acute distress; and 8) administer&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral treatment for cocaine use. Any participant who demonstrates significant&#xD;
      anxiety, discomfort, or unease regarding drug administration at the conclusion of the four&#xD;
      preparation sessions will be provided up to two additional preparation sessions. If these&#xD;
      sessions are unsuccessful at mitigating the participant's anxiety, discomfort, or unease, the&#xD;
      participant will be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately one week after their final preparation session, participants will be instructed&#xD;
      to eat a low-fat breakfast prior to presenting for their drug administration session at 8:00&#xD;
      am, approximately 1 hour before drug administration. A urine sample will be collected to&#xD;
      verify drug-free status and participants will be encouraged to relax and reflect before drug&#xD;
      administration. The drug administration session will take place over the course of 8 hours.&#xD;
      The guide and secondary monitor will be present with participants throughout this session (at&#xD;
      least one individual will always be present with the participant, even during brief intervals&#xD;
      when the guide or monitor may be using the restroom). During this time, participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to lie down, use an eye mask to block external visual distraction, and use&#xD;
      headphones through which a supportive music program will be played. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to focus their attention on their inner experiences throughout the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any participant reporting significant distress will be provided reassurance verbally or&#xD;
      physically (e.g., with a supportive touch to the hand or shoulder). Although no contemporary&#xD;
      studies have reported the need for pharmacological intervention, in the event that&#xD;
      psychological distress is insufficiently managed with reassurance alone, medication will be&#xD;
      administered under the guidance of the study physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure will be assessed at regular intervals via automatic blood pressure monitor&#xD;
      (e.g., pre-administration, and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes&#xD;
      post-administration), and medication for the treatment of acute hypertension will be&#xD;
      administered should blood pressure exceed 190 systolic and 100 diastolic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions will be videotaped and reviewed to verify session procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven hours after drug administration, when the major drug effects have subsided,&#xD;
      participants will complete questionnaires assessing their experience. Participants will then&#xD;
      be released into the care of a friend or family member oriented to be emotionally supportive&#xD;
      of the participant (as arranged during preparation sessions) and instructed not to drive an&#xD;
      automobile or engage in any other potentially dangerous activity for the remainder of the&#xD;
      day. Participants will be provided with the guide's pager number should they feel the need&#xD;
      for support that evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 2 days after the drug administration session, participants will meet with the guide&#xD;
      for approximately 2 hours to discuss and reflect on their experience. The guide will assess&#xD;
      for potential adverse effects at this time. The second MRI session will take place shortly&#xD;
      thereafter. Participants will then meet with the guide once per week over the next 4 weeks&#xD;
      with an emphasis on integration of their medication session experience in the context of&#xD;
      achieving abstinence from cocaine; continued cognitive-behavioral treatment for cocaine use&#xD;
      will be provided during these follow-up meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term assessment visits will take place 3 and 6 months after the final follow-up meeting.&#xD;
      A battery of measures will be delivered at these times. At the conclusion of the 6-month&#xD;
      assessment meeting, participants will be debriefed.&#xD;
