      The purpose of this current prospective study is to assess the effects of body weight support&#xD;
      treadmill training (BWSTT) in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Training&#xD;
      intervention aim at improving: quality of life, walking capability, spasticity, functions in&#xD;
      every day life, bone mass density and related hematological factors. The examination&#xD;
      consisted of (1) neurological classification by ASIA standard neurological classification of&#xD;
      spinal cord injury working sheet, (2) spasticity evaluation of lower limbs by Modified&#xD;
      Ashworth Scale, (3) walking independence evaluation by Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury&#xD;
      II (WISCI II), (4) patient's quality of life perspective by World Health Quality of Life-&#xD;
      BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), (5) the functional status by 10-item Modified Barthel Index, (6) bone&#xD;
      mass density (BMD) by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan, (7) body tissue&#xD;
      consistency by full body DXA scan, (8) skeletal system health associated blood factors&#xD;
      (calcitonin, osteocalcin, 25 OH vitamin D, 1,25- (OH)2 vitamin D, ostase and parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone) by hematological tests. The results will be collected and evaluated using&#xD;
      statistical software (i.e. SPSS).&#xD;
