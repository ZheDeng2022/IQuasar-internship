  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DM-CHOC-PEN is a polychlorinated pyridine cholesteryl carbonate that has demonstrated&#xD;
      antineoplastic activities in patients with advanced cancers - melanoma, lung, breast and&#xD;
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) involving the CNS during a Phase I study. These findings&#xD;
      support the preclinical responses seen in mice bearing intracerebrally implanted human breast&#xD;
      and GBM tumor xenografts. Toxicity was acceptable - hyperbilirubinemia (in patients with&#xD;
      liver disease and/or liver metastasis). No hematological, renal, cardiovascular, behavioral&#xD;
      or cognitive impairment/neurotoxicities were noted during the Phase I human trial or in&#xD;
      previous pre-clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug is available for use as a soy bean oil/egg yolk lecithin/glycerin water emulsion;&#xD;
      the latter continues to be chemically and biologically stable and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced lung, breast and melanoma cancers spread to the CNS and primary CNS&#xD;
      malignancies will be eligible for enrollment and treatment, providing the required blood and&#xD;
      other eligibility requirements are met. The trial will be 2-tiered - patients with liver&#xD;
      involvement vs. non-liver involvement will be treated with different doses of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is open and patients are currently being enrolled and treated with the protocol.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DM-CHOC-PEN has been selected for Phase II intravenous studies in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with advanced malignancies with central nervous system measurable disease based on the&#xD;
      improved PFS and objective responses seen for patients treated during the Phase I DTI-021&#xD;
      trial and the manageable toxicities noted. Melanoma, breast and lung cancers involving the&#xD;
      CNS have responded to DM-CHOC-PEN in the Phase I study, thus the basis for the choice of&#xD;
      tumors to be treated in the Phase II trial. Currently, the opinion is that the drug is&#xD;
      penetrating the blood brain barrier (BBB) attached to rbcs and released intracerebrally in&#xD;
      tumor masses in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be carefully monitored, and if a cancer type has &gt;3 confirmed responders in&#xD;
      the first 18 evaluable patients (Stage -1 enrollment); accrual will be expanded for that&#xD;
      tumor type with a goal of 7/43 for achieving an 80% power at the 5% level of significance&#xD;
      (Stage-2 enrollment) with unacceptable response rate (P0) 0.1 and desirable response rate&#xD;
      (P1) 0.25. Thus, each arm will have a 2-stage design. This will allow resources to be&#xD;
      directed to the most promising areas - selection of 1 or 2 tumor types to develop via&#xD;
      additional trial studies. A desirable response rate is 25% or better. The above is for each&#xD;
      tumor type - lung, breast, melanoma and GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, for any tumor type or treatment sub-group, a response rate of &lt;15% or a rate of&#xD;
      &quot;possibly treatment-related Gr-3/4 toxicities&quot; of &gt;25% will be considered unacceptable and&#xD;
      enrollment in the respective tumor type category will be discontinued.&#xD;

             Human Investigation Review Committee. Patients must have CNS involvement - from a&#xD;
             malignancy. Lung cancer may be either small cell or non-small cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical co-morbidities - including&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females are excluded. Women of childbearing age, and their&#xD;
             sexual partners, must use an effective contraception program. Males who are having&#xD;
             sexual relations with women capable of child bearing must use the barrier birth&#xD;
             control while on the study and for 3- months after the last dose of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors are not eligible since it is not known&#xD;

    <limitations_and_caveats>The study was to evaluate the effects of DM-CHOC-PEN on brain tumor lesions. All patients had cancer involving the central or spinal NS; NSCLC responded best. However, most patients had cancer out side of the brain, which was the cause of death.</limitations_and_caveats>
