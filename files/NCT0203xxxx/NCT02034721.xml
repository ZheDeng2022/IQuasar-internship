    <textblock>
      Intense, eccentric resistance exercise causes muscle damage, soreness, inflammation, and a&#xD;
      loss of muscle function. Protein-amino acid supplementation before, during, and following&#xD;
      damaging resistance exercise may reduce muscle damage and accelerate recovery. This study&#xD;
      will determine if supplementation with Herbalife 24 Rebuild Strength (compared to placebo)&#xD;
      before, during, and after a 90-minute bout of eccentric exercise attenuates exercise-induced&#xD;
      muscle damage, inflammation, and delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS), speeds recovery of&#xD;
      muscle function, and maintains immune function in NASCAR pit crew athletes (Hendrick Motor&#xD;
      Sports).&#xD;

      Intense, eccentric resistance exercise produces high mechanical forces leading to muscle&#xD;
      damage, soreness, inflammation, and a loss of muscle function (J Sci Med Sport&#xD;
      2010;13:178-181). Limited evidence suggests that protein-amino acid supplementation before,&#xD;
      during, and following damaging resistance exercise reduces muscle damage and accelerates&#xD;
      recovery in resistance trained subjects (J Int Soc Sports Nutr 2012;9:20; Int J Sport Nutr&#xD;
      Exerc Metab 2010;20:236-44; Appl Physiol Nutr Metab 2008;33:483-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herbalife 24 Rebuild Strength is a protein-amino acid supplement recommended for use after&#xD;
      resistance exercise to help rebuild muscle, speed recovery, support immune function, and&#xD;
      promote muscle repair. (http://performancenutrition.herbalife.com/en/products/&#xD;
      rebuild-strength). A serving of Rebuild Strength (50.5 grams) contains 190 kilocalories, 24&#xD;
      grams of protein, 18 grams of carbohydrate, 1 gram of fat, and vitamins and minerals (C, E,&#xD;
      B1, B6, B12, pantothenic acid, calcium, iron, magnesium, chromium, sodium, potassium, all at&#xD;
      10% to 150% Daily Value levels). The 24 grams of protein per serving include whey and casein&#xD;
      proteins, L-glutamine (3,000 mg), and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) (4,000 mg). (See&#xD;
      nutrition label at the website).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To determine if supplementation with Herbalife 24 Rebuild Strength (compared to&#xD;
      placebo) before, during, and after a 90-minute bout of eccentric exercise can attenuate&#xD;
      exercise-induced muscle damage, inflammation, and delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS),&#xD;
      speed recovery of muscle function, and maintain innate immune function in NASCAR pit crew&#xD;
      athletes (Hendrick Motor Sports).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to Rebuild Strength or placebo supplements (double blind&#xD;
      administration in the same colored bottles, with the code held by Herbalife until the study&#xD;
      is completed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Sequence:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will come to the HMS training facility in an overnight fasted state (no food or&#xD;
           beverage other than water for the previous 8 hours) and provide a DOMS rating and a&#xD;
           blood sample. Height, weight, and percent body fat (skinfolds) will also be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rebuild Strength subjects will consume 2 scoops (50.5 grams of product with 24 grams&#xD;
           protein) in water 15-20 min prior to the 90-min eccentric exercise bout. Subjects in the&#xD;
           placebo group will consume 2 scoops of the same supplement but without protein or amino&#xD;
           acids (with carbohydrate added to keep energy intake the same between groups).&#xD;
           Supplements will be prepared by Herbalife and coded &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, with this double blind&#xD;
           code maintained until the study has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Muscle function testing will follow supplementation: vertical jump, kneeling medicine&#xD;
           ball toss, and the 30-second Wingate test (see description below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subjects will engage in 90-min eccentric exercise (see description below), with 1 scoop&#xD;
           of Rebuild Strength (12 grams protein) or placebo ingested after 45 min exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Immediately following exercise, subjects will ingest 2 scoops Rebuild Strength (24 grams&#xD;
           protein) or placebo, provide a DOMS rating and a blood sample, and then take the same&#xD;
           three muscle function tests. Total protein intake before, during, and immediately after&#xD;
           the 90-min eccentric exercise bout will be 60 grams. All subjects will refrain from any&#xD;
           food or beverage intake (except for water) for one hour after taking the final&#xD;
           supplement dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Subjects will return at 7 am in an overnight fasted state three days in a row after the&#xD;
           eccentric exercise bout, and will provide a DOMS rating and a blood sample followed by&#xD;
           ingestion of 2 scoops Rebuild Strength or placebo, and then the three muscle function&#xD;
           tests. Subjects will engage in normal training during the 3-day recovery period. The&#xD;
           blood samples will be analyzed for markers of muscle damage, inflammation, and immune&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eccentric Exercise Bout:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HMS pit crew members engage in eccentric exercise bouts on a regular basis, and are very&#xD;
      familiar with the exercises that will be utilized in this study to induce muscle damage and&#xD;
      soreness. The 90-minute eccentric exercise bout will consist of 17 different exercises:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hammer incline presses with eccentric focus (3 sets, 5 reps).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bench presses with resistance bands (3 sets, 20 seconds to fatigue).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Supine medicine ball (9.1 kg) explosive catch and throws (20 seconds, 3 sets).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Bent (90â—‹) arm hangs to fatigue (3 sets).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Eccentric lat pulls (8 reps, 3 sets).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Partner rowing eccentric pulls (8 reps per arm, 3 sets).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Eccentric triceps extensions (8 reps per arm, 3 sets).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Eccentric bicep curls (8 reps, 3 sets).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Explosive tuck jumps (20 seconds, 3 sets).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Eccentric back extensions (8 reps, 3 sets).&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Eccentric hamstring curls (8 reps, 3 sets).&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. 20 second sprints on inclined treadmills with no electrical power (3 sets).&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Split squats (15 reps each leg, 2 sets).&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Walk 0.40 km with dumbbells, with shoulder shrugs every three steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Isometric abdominal curl with medicine ball (9.1 kg) twisting side to side for 20&#xD;
           seconds (3 sets).&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. Abdominal crunches for 20 seconds (3 sets).&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. Plank position (elbows and toes) for 45 seconds (2 sets).&#xD;
