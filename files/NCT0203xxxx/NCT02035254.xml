      In this project, individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease who are looking to lose&#xD;
      weight or increase your level of activity, are offered access to an online lifestyle&#xD;
      management program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will use the website daily to improve their eating and exercise habits as well&#xD;
      as other aspects of healthy living. They will be asked to participate in online challenges to&#xD;
      motivate them to make lifestyle changes. Participants will meet with a health professional 3&#xD;
      times within the 6 month time period as well as receive monthly guidance and support by phone&#xD;
      or email for the website.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the control of cardiovascular risk factors is essential in the prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), significant treatment gaps exist. For instance, a recent study&#xD;
      of Canadian adults filling prescriptions for hypertension or dyslipidemia demonstrated that&#xD;
      the majority remained overweight and sedentary despite being at increased risk of developing&#xD;
      CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Canada, there is currently a shortage of primary care physicians. Furthermore, many&#xD;
      physicians have little training in helping their patients make healthy lifestyle changes such&#xD;
      as losing weight or exercising regularly. Non-medical health professionals such as nurses,&#xD;
      dieticians, psychologists, and kinesiologists are well trained in helping individuals modify&#xD;
      their behaviour. However, they often do not have access to the health records of their&#xD;
      patients or the clinical tools to translate healthy behaviours, such as increasing physical&#xD;
      activity, into meaningful health outcomes, such as a reduction in blood lipids, blood&#xD;
      glucose, blood pressure, or the future risk of CVD. A web-based e health program could offer&#xD;
      a potential solution to fill the gap and support non-medical health professionals to become&#xD;
      more effective at cardiovascular prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MyHealthCheckUp online wellness program has been designed by a multidisciplinary team to&#xD;
      improve the health of individuals at minimal cost using a web-based approach. The program's&#xD;
      scientifically validated disease models have been proven to be effective in clinical&#xD;
      interventions to improve the health of individuals with active health issues, such as high&#xD;
      cholesterol, hypertension, and obesity, as well as low-risk individuals who want to reduce&#xD;
      their risk of future problems [2, 3]. The website also features educational modules and&#xD;
      physical activity, weight loss, stress management, and sleep hygiene challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The educational modules cover topics such as blood pressure management, smoking cessation,&#xD;
      stress management, and weight loss. The physical activity challenge is designed to optimize&#xD;
      health and wellness by promoting walking and other physical activity. As individuals or&#xD;
      teams, participants track their physical activity online, and compete against each other or&#xD;
      an avatar using a virtual route. The weight loss challenge is designed to promote healthy&#xD;
      weight management through food and physical activity tracking as well as online information&#xD;
      regarding lifestyle modification. The stress and sleep challenges are designed to help manage&#xD;
      stress and improve sleep duration and quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a web-based e-health intervention,&#xD;
      used by non-medical health professionals, to improve the management of cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors including hypertension, dyslipidemia, cigarette smoking, excess body weight,&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle, as well as sleep and stress problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be sent to a website where they will determine if they meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. If a subject meets the eligibility criteria, they will be assigned to be further&#xD;
      evaluated at the McGill Comprehensive Health Improvement Program (CHIP) by one of the&#xD;
      following health professionals: a nurse, dietician, kinesiologist, or psychologist (25&#xD;
      subjects assigned to each health professional). Half of the participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to start the intervention immediately (intervention group) and the other half will&#xD;
      start the intervention after the 3-month assessment (wait-list control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Visit (approximately 45 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial visit with the health professional, informed consent will be obtained and the&#xD;
      following information will be collected: demographics, medical history and concomitant&#xD;
      medication, height, weight, waist circumference, sitting blood pressure, and cholesterol and&#xD;
      glucose blood tests Participants will also complete the following questionnaires: The&#xD;
      Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, Insomnia Severity Index,&#xD;
      and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wait-List Control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants who have been randomly assigned to the wait-list control group will be given&#xD;
      general documentation regarding healthy eating and physical activity from Health Canada&#xD;
      (usual care) during the initial visit with the health professional. After a waiting period of&#xD;
      3 months, these participants will undergo a re-evaluation with their health professional and&#xD;
      will then start the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention using the e-health Website&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be given a unique temporary user name and password to access the&#xD;
      MyHealthCheckUp website which is designed to assess and manage cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
      They will also be provided with a pedometer for tracking daily steps. The health&#xD;
      professionals will provide an overview of the website and discuss with the participants their&#xD;
      specific goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing on to the site, participants will have the opportunity to complete disease&#xD;
      specific health risk assessments. Participants will have access to educational modules with&#xD;
      information relevant to a better understanding of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes&#xD;
      and the impact of lifestyle changes. Participants will also be enrolled in one of two&#xD;
      lifestyle management challenges designed to motivate the user to engage in regular exercise&#xD;
      or lose weight. Other challenges will be available after one of these initial challenges has&#xD;
      been completed. The challenges provide education and tracking tools to facilitate the&#xD;
      participant's monitoring of their own progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be scheduled for follow-up visits at CHIP at 3 and 6 months to have&#xD;
      their cardiovascular risk factors re-assessed which includes blood tests and anthropometric&#xD;
      information as evaluated in the initial session. The psychosocial measures (stress, sleep and&#xD;
      depressed mood) will also be re-administered at the 3 and 6 month follow-up. All intervention&#xD;
      subjects will also be contacted by their study health professional at months 1, 2, 4, and 5&#xD;
      either by phone or email (participant's preference) to discuss progress, barriers, and answer&#xD;
      any questions. Wait control subjects will not be contacted by their health professional&#xD;
      during the 3 month wait period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Evaluation of the e-health Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two focus groups, each with 10-12 patients, will be held following the intervention phase of&#xD;
      this study. These focus group discussions will be facilitated to elicit in-depth feedback&#xD;
      from users related to the website's acceptability and usability and to identify barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to using e-health approaches to modify lifestyle behaviours. The focus groups&#xD;
      will be conducted by a trained moderator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A brief patient satisfaction questionnaire will be done at the end of the study to&#xD;
      qualitatively assess their satisfaction of the MyHealthCheckUp website.&#xD;
