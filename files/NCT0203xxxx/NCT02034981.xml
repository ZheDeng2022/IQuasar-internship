  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a biology driven, trans-tumoral, multicentric phase II trial assessing the efficacy&#xD;
      and the safety of the targeted agent crizotinib as a monotherapy in 23 cohorts of patients&#xD;
      with identified activating molecular alterations in the crizotinib target genes. A cohort is&#xD;
      defined by a pathology and a crizotinib-target alteration (eg gastric cancer with MET&#xD;
      amplification).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each cohort a two-stage design will be implemented. In the situation where expected&#xD;
      accrual allows for a sufficient number of patients to be accrued, the alpha and beta errors&#xD;
      will be fixed at 10%. However, in very rare diseases, such as inflammatory myofibroblastic&#xD;
      tumor (IMT), neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), it is anticipated that&#xD;
      the target number may not be achievable in a reasonable timeframe; for these cohorts, the&#xD;
      alpha and beta errors will be fixed at 15%. Consequently three different statistical designs&#xD;
      will be a priori considered according to the expected response rate and incidence.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The efficacy of crizotinib as a single agent across diverse type of tumors guided by the presence of identified activating molecular alterations in the crizotinib target genes, per cohort, per pathology, and per target.</measure>
    <time_frame>Determined after 8 weeks (2 cycles) of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Anti-tumor activity of crizotinib, as the primary objective of the trial, will be carried out by the determination of the objective response assessed in each cohort defined by a pathology associated with a crizotinib target alteration.&#xD;
The objective response is defined as either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
The objective response after 2 cycles (8 weeks) will be reported to define a success in the 2-stage design.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The safety profile of crizotinib.</measure>
    <time_frame>Safety profile will be assessed during the whole treatment period (6 months expected in average) followed by a 2-year post-treatment follow-up period, and reported during the visits scheduled by the study flow chart</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicities will be assessed by clinical and paraclinical examinations at every scheduled visit during the whole treatment period and the post-treatment follow-up period (around 2.5 years) This study will use the International Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, for adverse event reporting.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease control rate</measure>
    <time_frame>After 8 weeks (2 cycles) and 16 weeks (4 cycles) of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Disease Control Rate will be the percentage of patients with a CR, PR or Stable Disease (SD) according to RECIST at the end of cycle 2 (8 weeks) and at the end of cycle 4 (16 weeks) in the group of patients evaluable for response</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>response duration</measure>
    <time_frame>interval between the objective response (CR or PR) and time of progression, recurrence or death</time_frame>
    <description>Response duration will be the time interval between the date that the criteria of CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) are met for the first time and the first date of documented re-appearance of the disease (recurrence, progression or death). If neither event has been observed, then the patient is censored at the date of the last follow up examination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>from registration until time of disease progression or death</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival will be the time interval between the date of registration and the day of first documented sign of disease progression (first day when RECIST criteria of progression are met) or day of death whatever the cause (events). If neither event has been observed, then the patient is censored at the date of the last follow up examination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>from registration until date of death</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival will be the time interval between the date of registration and the date of death, whatever the cause of death. Patients still alive at follow-up are censored at the date of last follow up.</description>
