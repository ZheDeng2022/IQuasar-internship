    <textblock>
      Patients interested in bariatric surgery would contact Dr. Marema or Dr. Koppman. Dr. Marema&#xD;
      and Dr. Koppman will determine, if patients qualify for bariatric surgery. Patients will&#xD;
      undergo a thorough preoperative workup. After optimization of all medical conditions patients&#xD;
      would be scheduled for bariatric surgery. This is our current clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the investigators would determine if a patient would qualify for the study. Then one&#xD;
      of the investigators would approach the patients and explain the study in detail. Patients&#xD;
      would be able to give informed consent or refuse to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients refusing to participate in the study will need to sign a consent that data will be&#xD;
      collect for internal quality control (IRB approval on file). The patients would be scheduled&#xD;
      for bariatric surgery and be treated per our current clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients would undergo a similar anesthetic. At the end of the procedure, before the NMBA&#xD;
      reversal agent is given, the patients would be randomized to either the control or study&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative Anesthestic Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sedative medication, typically midazolam 2-4mg iv. An infusion of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine will be started. Patients younger than 65 years will receive a loading dose&#xD;
      of 1mcg/kg over 10 minutes. In patients older than 65 years 0.5 mcg/kg will be given as a&#xD;
      loading dose. After administration of the loading dose an infusion will be continued&#xD;
      throughout the duration of the surgery at a dose of 0.1-1mcg/kg/h. The infusion will be&#xD;
      discontinued at the end of surgery. General anesthesia will be induced with a single dose of&#xD;
      Lidocaine and Propofol with either Succinylcholine or Rocuronium given to provide intubating&#xD;
      conditions. The patient's trachea will be intubated and mechanical ventilation started.&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be maintained with an infusion of dexmedetomidine and propofol and&#xD;
      titrated to the desired level of anesthesia. Ketamine will be administered as an adjunctive&#xD;
      analgesic at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Neuromuscular blockade appropriate for surgical conditions&#xD;
      will be provided by either the long acting neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA), Rocuronium&#xD;
      or Vecuronium, at the anesthesia providers discretion. At the conclusion of the operation the&#xD;
      degree of NMB/paralysis will be assessed and a NMBA reversal administered (see detailed&#xD;
      description below). Patients will be extubated after the end of surgery and transported to&#xD;
      the PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of Neuro-Muscular Block (NMB or paralysis):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A signal is send from the brain to the muscle via an electrical impulse through a nerve.&#xD;
      Electrical impulses can be applied externally to provoke muscle contraction. This technique&#xD;
      is used to monitor the degree of paralysis induced by administration of NMBA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NMBAs interrupt impulses or signals from the nerve to the muscle. External stimulation also&#xD;
      does NOT lead to a muscle contraction in a paralyzed patient. Once the body metabolizes the&#xD;
      NMBA the signal can travel again from the nerve to the muscle and provoke a muscle twitch.&#xD;
      This recovery is gradual meaning that the initial twitches are weak and gradually get&#xD;
      stronger. Also muscle fatigue faster with NMBA present (fade). This means that with similar,&#xD;
      repetitive stimulation the twitch gets weaker. In anesthesia these attributes are examined to&#xD;
      determine the degree of muscle relaxation and, or if at all, a dose of NMBA reversal can be&#xD;
      given and what the appropriate dose should be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two different ways of monitoring NMB: qualitative and quantitative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative (current management) - Control Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The paralysis can be monitored tactile (feeling) or visual (seeing) to determine the twitch&#xD;
      strength and the fade of repetitive stimulation. This determines the dose of reversal. After&#xD;
      the reversal is given the anesthesia provider waits further to determine that the twitches&#xD;
      are strong and there is no more fade. Then the patient will be extubated and transported to&#xD;
      the PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative (proposed management) - Study Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The paralysis would be monitored with a sensor (acceleromyography - AMG) that measures the&#xD;
      twitch-strength after the ulnar nerve was stimulated (detailed explanation below). This&#xD;
      objective data allows the anesthesia provider to titrate the NMBA reversal to best effect to&#xD;
      assure adequate return to full muscle strength. Then the patient will be extubated and&#xD;
      transported to the PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMG:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technical term for the way of assessing the muscle contraction is called&#xD;
      acceleromyography (AMG). AMG relies on 2 stimulating electrodes usually placed along the&#xD;
      ulnar nerve at the wrist and a sensor that is placed in the groove between the thumb and the&#xD;
      index finger; the sensor detects the acceleration of movement (bending) that is produced by&#xD;
      the thumb in response to electrical stimulation of the ulnar nerve (TOF-WatchÂ® SX Monitor).&#xD;
      When the thumb contracts and accelerates the piezoelectric sensor, the degree of movement is&#xD;
      sensed, and it is converted into electrical signals that are proportional to the force of&#xD;
      thumb contraction. AMG can yield signals that can be measured and that can give an indication&#xD;
      of the degree of neuromuscular block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized at the time when NMB can be reversed. Depending on the result the&#xD;
      patient will be in the study or control group. Randomization will be done by a statistical&#xD;
      software called R or an online web program called random.org.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      reduction from risk of a respiratory event in the postoperative period from 30% to 17.5% with&#xD;
      an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.8 allocation approximately even in both groups (n1=n2)&#xD;
      total sample size n=362, critical z=1.96, calculated by G Power 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      primary Intention to treat analysis to reflect clinical reality, secondary analysis as per&#xD;
      protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of RE, adapted from Ziemann-Gimmel et. al. f1000research 2012 and Murphy et. al.&#xD;
      Anesth Analg 2010;107(1):130-7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Changes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization occurs as described above at the time when the anesthesia provider feels&#xD;
      &quot;comfortable&quot; based on the qualitative measurement of the TOF. If patient is randomized to&#xD;
      the intervention group (quantitative measurement) reversal will be given based on the AMG&#xD;
      (TOF Watch).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change to the protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If 30 minutes after the above time point no adequate AMG measurement is obtained&#xD;
           reversal will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If after administration of reversal 30 minutes have elapsed and the AMG is less than 90%&#xD;
           patients will be emerged from anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. administration of reversal in the intervention group will occur only after at least 4&#xD;
           twitches are measured consistently with the AMG. The previous suggested time-point&#xD;
           suggested by the review article by Brull and Murphy where it can be given after 3&#xD;
           twitches seems to be to early and patients may not regain a TOF greater than 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dealing with missing TOF data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients were randomized they will be analyzed in the according group (ITT). linear&#xD;
      regression after log transformation will be done with the existing traces. There will be a&#xD;
      best-/worst case scenario for sensitivity analysis. Missing values will be randomly sample&#xD;
      and five scenarios will be analyzed to determine any impact (sensitivity analysis).&#xD;
      (Imputation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also the best/worst case scenario will be analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      best case: patients regain a TOF of 100% worst case: TOF is reduced by 5% from last&#xD;
      measurement - it is physiologically unlikely that the TOF will be reduced to a greater extend&#xD;
      over time.&#xD;
