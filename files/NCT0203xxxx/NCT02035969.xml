      This project aims to assess the effect of group peer support to children with HIV in relation&#xD;
      to adherence, virological treatment failure as well as physical development. A randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) will be used where HIV+ children on antiretroviral treatment (ARV) and&#xD;
      their caretakers are randomized into either enhanced treatment support (ETS) through peer&#xD;
      supporters or the conventional treatment (CT) according to the guidelines of The National&#xD;
      AIDS Control Program. The treatment strategies will be assessed and compared in relation to&#xD;
      virological treatment failure as primary endpoint, immunological and clinical (AIDS events&#xD;
      and mortality) as secondary endpoints as well as treatment adherence and physical&#xD;
      development. The results from this project will lead to an increased knowledge in relation to&#xD;
      the impact of enhanced treatment support on adherence, virological suppression and resistance&#xD;
      development for children with HIV and have an impact on HIV treatment policies and guidelines&#xD;
      for Pediatric HIV in low-income settings globally.&#xD;

      Main Aim To study the impact of peer support to children with HIV on antiretroviral treatment&#xD;
      (ART) in relation to adherence, virological treatment failure, HIV drug resistance&#xD;
      development as well as physical development using a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design&#xD;
      comparing enhanced treatment support (ETS) and conventional treatment (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the rate and risk factors for virological treatment failure among children on&#xD;
           ART for more than 6 months using HIV viral load in blood in relation to clinical and&#xD;
           socioeconomic indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To recruit 520 HIV+ children 0-12 years of age on ART and randomize to either enhanced&#xD;
           treatment support (ETS) or conventional treatment (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To monitor ART adherence, CD4+ T-cell count, HIV viral load, clinical status, physical&#xD;
           and cognitive development AIDS-associated events and/or mortality during every 6 months&#xD;
           during a 36 months follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the effect of ETS compared to CT with respect to the primary endpoint,&#xD;
           virological treatment failure and specific ART mutations as well as the secondary&#xD;
           endpoints, immunological failure, ART adherence, physical and cognitive development, and&#xD;
           mortality and/or AIDS events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To conduct a cost effectiveness assessment comparing ETS and CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi center study that includes the National Pediatric Hospital in Hanoi and the&#xD;
      two major pediatric hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City. A study population of 520 HIV+ children&#xD;
      receiving ARTs will be recruited from these hospitals. The reason for selecting children on&#xD;
      ART is to see if treatment support can be initiated successfully after initiation of ART.&#xD;
      Each HIV+ patient is examined according to WHO guidelines. HIV+ children will receive a&#xD;
      complete physical examination including clinical staging of HIV infection, opportunistic&#xD;
      infections and evidence of tuberculosis. Laboratory testing will include full blood count,&#xD;
      CD4+ T-cell count (for children under five years of age CD4 %), viral load using ExaVirR&#xD;
      viral load and liver enzymes. If indicated (e.g. prolonged cough and/or fever) chest X-ray,&#xD;
      sputum microscopy for AFB will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opportunistic infections in HIV+ patients will be treated according to national guidelines.&#xD;
      HIV+ children and their caregivers receive counselling and clinical follow ups. Tuberculosis&#xD;
      (TB) will be managed in collaboration with the National Tuberculosis Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria's are described below. The patients recruited will be&#xD;
      stratified according to age, sex and identified risk factor, then they will be randomised&#xD;
      into two different treatment strategies a) Enhanced treatment support (ETS) strategy&#xD;
      (described below) and Conventional treatment (CT). The patients treated under the two&#xD;
      strategies will be compared with respect to: (i) virological treatment failure, (ii)&#xD;
      patient's adherence to treatment strategy, (iii) physical development, and (iv) mortality and&#xD;
      AIDS event. First drug regimen for all patients includes stavudine or AZT, lamivudine,&#xD;
      nevirapine or efavirens. All procedures, treatment, and follow up for adverse effects are&#xD;
      done according to national guidelines. The health care workers are trained in regular&#xD;
      monitoring of patients and implementation of optimal treatment strategy. All procedures and&#xD;
      treatment will follow the national guidelines. Follow up visits including physical&#xD;
      examinations, adherence evaluation and laboratory tests will be done every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tests will include full blood count and liver enzymes as well as other indicated tests.&#xD;
      Viral load and CD4+ T-cell count will be monitored every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients needed for each arm of the experiment was estimated assuming an&#xD;
      absolute 2-year risk of treatment failure of 15% in the control arm. Assuming proportional&#xD;
      hazards there is an absolute 2-year risk of failure in the peer-support group of 7%.&#xD;
      Requiring a power of 80% and a significance level of 5% approximately 480 patients are&#xD;
      required. In order to account for some losses to follow-up and deviations from our&#xD;
      assumptions, we will recruit a total of 260 patients into each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ETC strategy caretakers and children with HIV on ART will be supported to achieve&#xD;
      better adherence through peer support groups at the beginning of treatment and phone&#xD;
      follow-up later, with an option for home visits or to return to support groups later if&#xD;
      necessary. The activities will be organized by peer supporters, caregivers of HIV-infected&#xD;
      children selected by peers, who will undergo a series of training, including medication&#xD;
      adherence and counselling skills. They will ideally be assigned to patients living in the&#xD;
      same community or in proximity to patients in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer group meetings with 7-10 caretakers and children will be organized monthly according to&#xD;
      age groups, e.g. 0-3 years, 4-6 years, 7-12 years, and location. In these meetings caretakers&#xD;
      will discuss problems related to adherence and receive new information from peer supporters.&#xD;
      Simultaneously, children above 3 years of age will receive age relevant information about&#xD;
      their disease and treatment from another supporter as well as do games and play to enhance&#xD;
      group bounds. The supporters will also have weekly telephone contact with the caretakers, if&#xD;
      needed more, to assess the condition of the child. To those who cannot make a particular&#xD;
      meeting or answer the phone home visits (if consent is given) are made. Follow up phone calls&#xD;
      will be made to those whom the case manager identifies to need more support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As children differ very much depending on age the intervention will be adjusted to each age&#xD;
      group in order to provide the best possible support according to standardized procedures that&#xD;
      can be replicated. For children with poor adherence individual support to caretakers and&#xD;
      patients will be arranged where the condition of the child and reason for poor adherence is&#xD;
      assessed, in case of complications the peer supporter will provide advice and if needed refer&#xD;
      the child for medical checkup. In CT control group the treatment will be supported according&#xD;
      to the treatment guidelines. Both groups will receive treatment counseling and be followed&#xD;
      through regular clinical check-up, the drugs will be provided in a pre-packed dosage form for&#xD;
      easy remembering and counting of the pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are followed for 36 months and monitored each six months through viral load in&#xD;
      plasma using ExaVir Load®, CD4+ T-cell count, adherence, clinical examination including&#xD;
      physical development. Viral load will be assessed using a new ELISA based technique ExaVir&#xD;
      Load® that detects HIV reverse transcriptase down to 1 fg/ml blood-plasma corresponding to&#xD;
      200 HIV RNA copies/ml. Adherence will be assessed every three months using questionnaires&#xD;
      designed specifically for age groups. For infants and young children the Pediatric&#xD;
      International Adherence Questionnaire (PIAQ) may be used, and for older children the Adult&#xD;
      AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Adherence Instruments will be used. The questionnaire&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted by health personnel at the Out Patient Clinics for Pediatric&#xD;
      HIV. Adherence will also be measured by pill count, where the patients bring their remaining&#xD;
      drugs back to the clinic at follow-up, enabling calculation of the proportion of drugs&#xD;
      remaining out of the total amount of prescribed drugs as well as through pharmacy records if&#xD;
      the patients have collected the drugs accurately. Assessment of side effects will be done&#xD;
      according to WHO suggested monitoring and management of ARV drugs together with the clinical&#xD;
      examination each three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be virological treatment failure defined as a viral load&#xD;
      corresponding to 1000 copies/ml. This could also be expressed as loss of virological response&#xD;
      taking death and Loss of Follow Up into account. The secondary endpoints immunological&#xD;
      treatment failure (no rise in CD4+ T-cell count at 1 year or decrease with 50% compared to&#xD;
      the highest value or CD4+ T-cell count below 100), clinical treatment failure as defined by a&#xD;
      new AIDS-defining illness or death due to HIV/AIDS (including TB and opportunistic infection)&#xD;
      after starting treatment, and physiological development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costing of the two different strategies will be carried out by collecting monetary data of&#xD;
      expense for drugs, test, allowance and other expenses from perspective of the HIV/AIDS&#xD;
      treatment provider during ART. The investigators follow the basic principles of&#xD;
      activity-based costing by identifying all activites necessary to provide the ETS and CT and&#xD;
      then calculate the costs of carrying out each activity. Costs for each activity comprise&#xD;
      recurrent and capital costs, direct and indirect costs. Recurrent costs are the routine costs&#xD;
      of resources that are consumed within a year, i.e., non-capital items such as labor and&#xD;
      medical supplies. Capital costs represent the annual portion of the cost of durable HIV Sida&#xD;
      DOTARV assets. Effectiveness will be measured by percentages of patients with virological&#xD;
      treatment failure defined as Viral Load &gt;400 copise/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis mainly consists in the comparison between the two groups with&#xD;
      respect to the defined primary and secondary endpoints in relation to the semi-quantitative&#xD;
      assessments of adherence. Standard statistical methods will be used. Hazard/Survival analysis&#xD;
      will be conducted including death/loss of follow up as 'failure' in the analysis. Intention&#xD;
      to treat will be used for analysis. Regression models with outcome as the dependent variable&#xD;
      and a group indicator together with patient characteristics as independent variables will be&#xD;
      the main approach. For binary outcomes, logistic regression will be used. Attention has to be&#xD;
      paid to the particular, often skewed, distributions of variables like CD4+ T-cell counts and&#xD;
      viral load. Transformations or the use of non-parametric approaches are likely to be&#xD;
      necessary if such measures are not dichotomized and used in linear regression. The&#xD;
      correlation between drug resistance and adherence will be statistically analyzed in order to&#xD;
      study whether the basic mechanisms of selective drug pressure result in a concave or&#xD;
      bell-shaped resistance - adherence relationship, for these drugs during ETS or CT in a&#xD;
      low-income setting. The odds ratios of having or not baseline drug resistance mutations as&#xD;
      detected by population and deep (single allele PCR) sequencing on drug resistance development&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes during treatment independent of treatment adherence will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Stratified analysis will be conducted comparing the outcomes among the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will strictly comply with widely recognized international texts and codes&#xD;
      of practice including the Helsinki agreement. In this project one patient cohort will receive&#xD;
      ETS and the other CT. However both groups will be encouraged to proceed regularly with their&#xD;
      drug treatment and to present difficulties that they may encounter in doing so. For the&#xD;
      project period, the project will meet the costs of ART for the cohorts. Patients' biological&#xD;
      samples will be collected and used only after written consent from the children's caretaker.&#xD;
      All specimens will be coded to protect the identity of patients and to ensure&#xD;
      confidentiality. Patients will be recruited in a consecutive manner without regard to race or&#xD;
      other exclusion considerations. Confidentiality will be assured by using codes for patient&#xD;
      identification, and confidentially laws will be strictly observed when processing human&#xD;
      clinical information. No patient identifying information will be published or available after&#xD;
      the requisite clinical data has been collected, and consent will be obtained for the use of&#xD;
      all data and tissues. Data will be accessible only to members and coordinators of the tissue&#xD;
      procurement facility and research team, under approved guidelines.&#xD;
