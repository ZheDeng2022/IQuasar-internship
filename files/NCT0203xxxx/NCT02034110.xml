  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study of oral Dabrafenib in&#xD;
      combination with oral Trametinib in subjects with rare cancers including anaplastic thyroid&#xD;
      cancer, biliary tract cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, non-seminomatous germ cell&#xD;
      tumor/non-geminomatous germ cell tumor, hairy cell leukemia, World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      Grade 1 or 2 glioma, WHO Grade 3 or 4 (high-grade) glioma, multiple myeloma, and&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma of the small intestine, with BRAF V600E positive-mutations. This study is&#xD;
      designed to determine the overall response rate (ORR) of oral Dabrafenib in combination with&#xD;
      oral Trametinib in subjects with rare BRAF V600E mutated cancers. Subjects will need to have&#xD;
      a fresh or frozen tumor tissue sample provided to confirm the BRAF V600E mutation status.&#xD;
      Only subjects with histologically confirmed advanced disease and no available standard&#xD;
      treatment options will be eligible for enrollment. Subjects will undergo screening&#xD;
      assessments within 14 days (up to 35 days for ophthalmology exam, echocardiogram or disease&#xD;
      assessments) prior to the start of treatment to determine their eligibility for enrollment in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
