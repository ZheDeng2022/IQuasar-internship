      To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple doses&#xD;

      This is a 3-part study to be conducted at a single study center. Part 1 is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose study. During the course of Part 1, each&#xD;
      subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment phase and a&#xD;
      follow up visit. There will be a total of 4 cohorts, each of which consists of a different&#xD;
      dose level and/or dosing duration, with 8 or 9 subjects per cohort. In each cohort, 6&#xD;
      subjects will receive a dose of CC-220 and the remaining subjects will receive placebo&#xD;
      depending on the randomization schedule. In 2 of the cohorts, study drug will be administered&#xD;
      once daily for a total of 14 days. In the other 2 cohorts, study drug will be administered&#xD;
      once daily for 28 days. In one of the 28-day dosing cohorts, 2 vaccinations (tetanus toxoid&#xD;
      adsorbed and pneumococcal vaccinations) will also be administered on Day 14 of the 28-day&#xD;
      dosing period to help characterize the effect of CC-220 on antibody responses. Part 2 is a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to explore the effects of&#xD;
      an alternative dosing schedule on the pharmacodynamics of CC-220. During the course of Part&#xD;
      2, each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment phase&#xD;
      and a follow up visit. There will be a total of 2 cohorts, each of which consists of a&#xD;
      different dose level, with 9 subjects per cohort. In each cohort, 6 subjects will receive a&#xD;
      dose of CC-220 and 3 subjects will receive placebo depending on the randomization schedule.&#xD;
      The dosing frequency will be either once every 3 days for 14 days or once every 7 days for 28&#xD;
      days. Part 3 is a randomized, open-label, two-period, two-way crossover study to evaluate the&#xD;
      relative bioavailability of one CC-220 formulated capsule, relative to two reference&#xD;
      capsules, following a single oral dose of CC-220. During the course of Part 3, each subject&#xD;
      will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment phase consisting of 2&#xD;
      periods, and a follow up visit. There will be one cohort consisting of a total of 12&#xD;
      subjects. In each study period, approximately 6 subjects will receive a single dose of CC-220&#xD;
      as one formulated capsule (test product) and approximately 6 subjects will receive a single&#xD;
      dose of CC-220 as two reference capsules (reference product).&#xD;
