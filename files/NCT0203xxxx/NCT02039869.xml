    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if people who have non-erosive reflux disease (NERD)&#xD;
      have changes the investigators can see with a microscope (called confocal endomicroscopy)&#xD;
      that is used during endoscopy (a camera scope evaluation of the inside of your stomach and&#xD;
      swallowing tube). Traditionally the investigators have used trials of acid blocking&#xD;
      medications (PPIs), endoscopy and measurements of acid in the swallowing tube (the esophagus)&#xD;
      to determine if the investigators think acid is causing troublesome symptoms. The medical&#xD;
      community believes that these symptoms are due to increased spaces between the cells that&#xD;
      make up the swallowing tube. The investigators can directly see those spaces with a new&#xD;
      microscope that the investigators can pass through the camera scope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to take one of two medications omeprazole and sucralfate (both&#xD;
      approved medications for stomach symptoms) to treat their symptoms and record how well the&#xD;
      treatment works. The investigators then will look to see if the microscope can predict which&#xD;
      medication will work best for patients in the future. The investigators also plan to measure&#xD;
      the acid levels in your swallowing tube and do a camera evaluation of your swallowing tube&#xD;
      and stomach as this is standard for patients with your symptoms. The investigators will&#xD;
      compare the results of those studies to the microscope findings.&#xD;

      Study entry criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to collaborate with three centers to ensure the data derived from this&#xD;
      study is generalizable to academic centers as a whole and also to expedite patient&#xD;
      recruitment. The centers that will participate are Virginia Commonwealth University, Ochsner&#xD;
      Health System and the Medical University of South Carolina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over the age of 18 presenting to clinic with symptoms typical for reflux disease&#xD;
      will be screened to determine if they wish to participate in the study. The site principal&#xD;
      investigator will directly contact potential patients to see if they wish to participate. If&#xD;
      they elect to participate they will be provided a copy of the informed consent 24 hours&#xD;
      before their first contact with study personnel to allow time to review and determine if the&#xD;
      wish to participate. All participants will sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who wish to enter into the study and have signed an informed consent will complete a&#xD;
      reflux disease questionnaire (RDQ). This questionnaire consists of 12 items assessing various&#xD;
      aspects of reflux disease. A score of more than 12 will be required for study entry.&#xD;
      Individual with a score less than 12 will not participate further in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) not responsive to&#xD;
      proton pump inhibitors (PPI) is confirmatory testing with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to&#xD;
      evaluate for erosive esophagitis (EE) and testing for acid exposure to the lower esophagus&#xD;
      with pH testing. For the purpose of this study the investigators will perform pH testing off&#xD;
      acid suppressing medication. This is a standard test for determining if the patient has acid&#xD;
      exposure to the esophagus. Typically patients are placed on twice daily (BID) PPI or&#xD;
      sucralfate if testing reveals significant acid exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erosive esophagitis will be differentiated from NERD by endoscopic findings aided by FICE (or&#xD;
      NBI/iScan) and magnification techniques that the investigators standardly employ in clinical&#xD;
      practice. Patients that are found to have EE will not participate further in the study and&#xD;
      will be treated appropriately for their illness with increased acid suppression. Patients&#xD;
      without EE at the time of endoscopy will be enrolled for study as presumed cases of NERD&#xD;
      refractory to PPI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After endoscopic confirmation of NERD, the probe based confocal endomicroscopy catheter will&#xD;
      be inserted (CellVisio). The probe will be placed 5cm above the gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      (GEJ) defined as the top of gastric folds. Subsequently, 2.5cc of 10% fluorescein will be&#xD;
      injected. The investigators will initiate a video recording of the microscopic images that is&#xD;
      to start with the injection of the fluorescein and continue this video for 3 minutes. This&#xD;
      video will be reviewed at a later time by 2 blinded endoscopists trained in confocal&#xD;
      endomicroscopy interpretation. The goal is to see if the time to seeing fluorescein in the&#xD;
      intracellular spaces correlates to response to therapy. The investigators will record time to&#xD;
      first visualization of intrapapillary loops intracellular gaps, the time between&#xD;
      visualization of intrapapillary loops and visualization of intracellular gaps in the entirety&#xD;
      of the space between the loops. The investigators will also measurement of the general&#xD;
      overall appearance. Having the recording of the microscopic images will allow a centralized&#xD;
      reading time to each event and more accurate timing as the video can be stopped and reviewed&#xD;
      in slow motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators then will perform endomicroscopic assessment in four quadrants at 2cm, 5cm&#xD;
      and 10cm above the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). This will represent a single image&#xD;
      acquisition video at each measurement with 4 separate views included. Computer analysis of&#xD;
      the microscopic images will determine the average cell to cell junction distance, number of&#xD;
      intrapapillary capillary loops, size of those intrapapillary capillary loops and overall&#xD;
      saturation with fluorescein. Biopsies of the esophagus corresponding to the endomicroscopy&#xD;
      sites will be collected for microscopic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following endoscopy all patients will receive a 48h Bravo capsule or 24h impedance pH probe&#xD;
      to quantitate acid and non-acid reflux events (if 24h probe used) . Standard calibration and&#xD;
      insertion techniques provided by the manufacturer will be used. Standard symptom event&#xD;
      recording for heartburn, regurgitation and non-cardiac chest pain will be used for the&#xD;
      duration of the pH and impedance monitoring. A blinded investigator will interpret impedance&#xD;
      and pH recording. The primary outcome will be the average Demeester Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For histopathology the specimen will be fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin and&#xD;
      sectioned per standard clinical protocols. An expert pathologist will review pathology&#xD;
      specimen for histological changes, specifically elongation of papillae, proliferation of&#xD;
      basal cells, eosinophilic infiltration and dilated intercellular spaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following their endoscopic evaluation, all patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive either twice daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy for 8 weeks or sucralfate&#xD;
      slurry 1g four times a day for 8 weeks. The patients will not be blinded to the treatment&#xD;
      they receive. The patients will be contacted by phone to assess the symptoms, medication&#xD;
      compliance and tolerance and to complete a RDQ and SF-36 at week 4. They will be seen in&#xD;
      clinic 8 weeks as a follow-up visit and study wrap up. The 8 week visit is standard of care&#xD;
      as that is how long the investigators typically follow patients with reflux symptoms. The&#xD;
      investigators will also assess disease activity with a RDQ and SF-36 at this visit as well.&#xD;
      Patients without adequate response to the medication will be offered cross over to the&#xD;
      alternative medication with a 4 week phone assessment and 8 week clinic visit as described&#xD;
      above. The investigators plan to enroll 40 patients at each site (total of 120 patients) and&#xD;
      plan an interim analysis after the first 30 patients complete the protocol.&#xD;
