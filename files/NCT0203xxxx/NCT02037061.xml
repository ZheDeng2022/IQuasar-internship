    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to determine if intraoperative local analgesia&#xD;
      administered at the level of the sacrospinous ligament can lessen the gluteal pain felt by&#xD;
      patients postoperatively after SSL colpopexy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Local analgesia administered at the level of the sacrospinous ligament can lessen&#xD;
      the gluteal pain felt by patients postoperatively after SSL colpopexy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind clinical trial. Potential subjects will be identified by&#xD;
      members of the Center for Urogynecology and Pelvic Reconstructive Surgery at the Cleveland&#xD;
      Clinic main campus. Eligible patients that agree to participate will be provided written&#xD;
      informed consent administered by the collaborators listed on the IRB at the Cleveland Clinic&#xD;
      main campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be predetermined by their surgeon to undergo sacrospinous ligament&#xD;
      colpopexy for management of vaginal apex prolapse after hysterectomy. The participants will&#xD;
      then be randomized to one of two groups: &quot;local analgesia injection&quot; or &quot;normal saline&#xD;
      injection&quot; according to a computer-generated randomization schedule with random block sizes&#xD;
      with the use of the SAS statistical software package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Randomization&#xD;
      will be done by a nurse coordinator who will not be involved in participant recruitment or&#xD;
      injection at the time of surgery. All patients and providers will be blinded to their&#xD;
      assignment. The assignment will be kept in an envelope which will be given to the pharmacy&#xD;
      the day of the patient's scheduled procedure. The pharmacy will then dispense the correct&#xD;
      intervention based on the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to a standardized evaluation including the history and physical examination,&#xD;
      patients will be asked to complete a functional assessment questionnaire as well as a&#xD;
      surgical pain scale at the preoperative visit. Prior to discharge from the hospital, patients&#xD;
      will be provided with an envelope with pre-labeled questionnaires to bring home with them.&#xD;
      Prior to discharge, they will be asked to complete the surgical pain scale only. Subjects&#xD;
      will then be called the day after discharge, at week 1, week 2, week 4 and week 6 after the&#xD;
      procedure and will be reminded to complete the appropriate questionnaires/forms that were&#xD;
      provided to them. They will bring in these forms to their 6-week postoperative visit. All&#xD;
      questionnaires will be self-administered. Completion of these questionnaires is the only&#xD;
      additional assessment that is specific to participation in this study and is not usually&#xD;
      included as part of the standard care of sacrospinous ligament colpopexy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sacrospinous ligament colpopexy will be performed in a standard fashion. The approach is done&#xD;
      by either entering the vagina along the anterior or posterior wall or at the apex. Approach&#xD;
      and side of the suspension will be based on surgeon's preference. Prior to entry, the apex of&#xD;
      the vaginal vault is first identified by visualizing the old hysterectomy scar. Allis clamps&#xD;
      are used to demarcate the new vaginal apex and to ensure that this apex will suspend&#xD;
      adequately to the sacrospinous ligament, which is identified transvaginally by palpation of&#xD;
      the ischial spine. Once vaginal entry is made, sharp and blunt dissection are performed down&#xD;
      to the pararectal space on one or both sides. Identification of the ischial spine confirms&#xD;
      the position of the coccygeus-sacrospinous ligament complex. Once the complex is freed of any&#xD;
      overlying areolar tissue, a Briesky Navratil retractor is placed to retract the rectum away&#xD;
      from the site of suture placement and to help with visualization of the ligament complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CapioTM device is then used to place the suspension sutures. 3 sutures are placed: 2&#xD;
      delayed-absorbable (0 PDS) and 1 permanent (0 prolene). All sutures are placed one and a half&#xD;
      to two fingerbreadths (2-3cm) medial to the ischial spine in a sequential fashion. After&#xD;
      placement, a rectal exam is done to ensure that no sutures have been placed through the&#xD;
      rectum and the coccygeus-sacrospinous ligament complex is visualized carefully to ensure that&#xD;
      the surgical site is hemostatic. The absorbable-delayed suspension sutures are placed through&#xD;
      the vaginal epithelium at the level of the neoapex and all permanent sutures are placed&#xD;
      through the subepithelial tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection of the sacrospinous ligament will be performed prior to tying down the suspension&#xD;
      sutures according to the group the patient is randomized to. A pudendal nerve block kit&#xD;
      needle and syringe will be used to administer the injection. The spacer will be removed,&#xD;
      allowing the needle point to enter the ligament 10mm in depth with each injection. The&#xD;
      injection will be placed in 3 locations (~3mL in each injection for a total of 10mL) along&#xD;
      the center of the sacropinous ligament under each previously placed suture. Proper injection&#xD;
      technique will be performed with each injection (e.g. there will be confirmation of&#xD;
      extravascular placement of the needle tip prior to each injection). One of two injections&#xD;
      (bupivacaine vs. normal saline) delivered by the pharmacy will be administered depending upon&#xD;
      the group to which the patient has been randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative data will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient age, race, vaginal parity, menopausal sate, tobacco use, BMI, prior prolapse&#xD;
           surgery, preoperative prolapse stage (see Appendix for demographic data sheet)&#xD;

      All paper forms used for data collection will be kept in a research cabinet dedicated to this&#xD;
      project which will be locked at all times, in a locked office at the Cleveland Clinic. All&#xD;
      forms will contain de-identified information - identification numbers will correspond to the&#xD;
      subjects listed in the master excel file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study data will be transferred and managed electronically using REDCap (Research&#xD;
      Electronic Data Capture). Each subject will be entered into REDCap using the assigned&#xD;
      identification number from the master excel file. REDCap is a secure, web-based application&#xD;
      designed to support data capture for research studies, providing user-friendly web-based case&#xD;
      report forms, real-time data entry validation, audit trials, and a de-identified data export&#xD;
      mechanism to common statistical packages. They system was developed by a multi-institutional&#xD;
      consortium which was initiated at Vanderbilt University and includes the Cleveland Clinic.&#xD;
      The database is hosted at the Cleveland Clinic Research Datacenter in the JJN basement and is&#xD;
      managed by the Quantitative Health Sciences Department. The system is protected by a login&#xD;
      and Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) encryption. Data collection is customized for each study as&#xD;
      based on a study-specific data dictionary defined by the research team with guidance from the&#xD;
      REDCap administrator in Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic&#xD;
