  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You have been asked to consider participating in the study because you have a cancer of the&#xD;
      prostate, which is to be treated with external beam radiation. You have chosen or felt not to&#xD;
      be a good candidate for just watching your cancer. As your doctor has informed you, this&#xD;
      involves delivering small amounts of radiation daily over several weeks. Normally, a small&#xD;
      field directed to the prostate gland is given for 7.5 - 8 weeks. In total, 39 days of&#xD;
      radiation are delivered. There is now growing evidence that prostate cancer cells may be&#xD;
      killed more effectively if higher doses of radiation are delivered everyday (known as&#xD;
      hypofractionation). However, the downside to such a strategy is the potential to cause more&#xD;
      side effects because normal organs (such as the rectum and bladder) are also exposed to the&#xD;
      higher doses. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a high-precision technique which&#xD;
      has the ability to deliver radiation in a more focused manor, meaning that the radiation dose&#xD;
      can be &quot;sculpted&quot; to the prostate gland, while minimizing the amount of radiation to the&#xD;
      bladder and rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A certain amount of movement of the prostate normally occurs within the body. To make sure&#xD;
      that the prostate will not be missed, a margin of tissue around the prostate also needs to be&#xD;
      treated. Although a wide margin will ensure that the prostate is included, it will also cause&#xD;
      more normal tissue to receive high doses of radiation. This, in turn, would result in more&#xD;
      side effects. To reduce the margin needed around the prostate, and side effects, tiny gold&#xD;
      seeds measuring 3.0 x 1.2mm will be inserted into the prostate which can be seen using a&#xD;
      special type of X-Ray camera called a portal imager during treatment. This will allow for&#xD;
      targeting of the prostate gland more precisely so that a significantly smaller margin of&#xD;
      normal tissue will need to be treated. By using gold seeds in conjunction with SABR, there is&#xD;
      the potential to safely deliver a more intensive dose of radiation to the prostate gland&#xD;
      without increasing the amount of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other studies where shorter and more intense courses of radiation have been given using&#xD;
      similar high-precision techniques, the side effects of treatment have indeed been no worse&#xD;
      than the usual techniques. Over the last 7 years, Sunnybrook researchers have treated over&#xD;
      three hundred prostate cancer patients on various research protocols with SABR. In those&#xD;
      protocols, patients received 5 SBRT treatments over 29 days and this is currently being&#xD;
      compared to 5 SBRT treatments over 11 days in an ongoing randomized study. In the United&#xD;
      States, several groups have investigated the 5 SBRT approach in 11 days or less and early&#xD;
      findings suggest a good tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is being done to determine the side effects, quality of life and efficacy of&#xD;
      2-fraction adaptive SBRT technique (2STAR) in the treatment of low and intermediate risk&#xD;
      prostate cancer. All participants will receive the same dose and fractionation scheme.&#xD;
