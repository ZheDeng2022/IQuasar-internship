  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II trial to determine safety, clinical efficacy and feasibility of a&#xD;
      gene-modified WT1 TCR therapy in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukaemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's white blood cells (T cells) will be modified by transferring a gene which enables&#xD;
      them to make a new T cell receptor (TCR) that can recognize fragments of a protein called WT1&#xD;
      (Wilms' tumour 1) which is present at abnormally high levels on the surface of&#xD;
      myelodysplastic and leukaemic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, approximately 25 participants with an Human Leukocyte Antigen A2 (HLA-A*0201)&#xD;
      tissue type who have failed to achieve or maintain an IWG defined response following&#xD;
      hypomethylating agent therapy will be recruited.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II trial to determine safety, clinical efficacy and feasibility of a&#xD;
      gene-modified WT1 TCR therapy. Following provision of informed consent, each subject will&#xD;
      undergo screening assessments, including HLA-A*0201 screening (if not already documented) and&#xD;
      a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy (BMA) to determine subject eligibility for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo leukapheresis within 14 days of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once successful manufacture of the WT1 TCR-transduced T cells has been confirmed by the&#xD;
      Sponsor, each subject will be administered a lymphodepletive conditioning regimen for five&#xD;
      days consisting of fludarabine x 5 days 30mg/m2 intravenous (i.v.) and methylprednisolone x 1&#xD;
      day 500 mg i.v. Upon completion of the conditioning regimen, subjects will receive an&#xD;
      infusion of WT1 TCR-transduced T cells of ≤2 x 107/kg, followed by daily IL-2 subcutaneous&#xD;
      injections (1 x 106 units/m2 subcutaneous (s.c.) od) for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an IWG response has not been reported (one or more criteria met) at 3 months post-infusion&#xD;
      then, if agreed by both the Investigator and Sponsor, the subject will be offered to have a&#xD;
      repeat infusion of WT1 TCR-transduced T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following infusion, subjects will enter an intensive period of out-patient follow-up to&#xD;
      observe them for any acute complications and toxicities. Subjects will then be followed&#xD;
      monthly in the clinic for the first 6 months for routine safety and clinical evaluations,&#xD;
      including disease response evaluations. All subjects will be followed-up for a minimum of 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
