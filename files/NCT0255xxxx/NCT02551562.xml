  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      20 female subjects, between the ages of 25 and 60, who request a full facial rejuvenation&#xD;
      treatment, meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, and have signed a&#xD;
      written informed consent, will be enrolled. Subjects will be divided randomly into two&#xD;
      treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group A: subjects will use a basic skin care regime following a full facial rejuvenation&#xD;
           with hyaluronic acid soft-tissue filler and botulinum neurotoxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group B: subjects will use the Nu-Derm® system following a full facial rejuvenation with&#xD;
           hyaluronic acid soft-tissue filler and botulinum neurotoxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 5 visits: Baseline/Screening Assessments (Visit 1), Treatment (Visit&#xD;
      2), Two-Week Evaluation (Visit 3), Six-Week Evaluation (Visit 4), and Twelve-Week Evaluation&#xD;
      (Visit 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the subjects' quality of skin will be determined by the PI's assessment of skin&#xD;
      tone (dyschromia), elasticity (firmness), texture (smoothness), radiance, and wrinkling as&#xD;
      well as the global aesthetic improvement at 6 and 12 weeks following neurotoxin and&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid treatments. The PI will be blind to the group assignment of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' satisfaction with treatments and their quality of skin will be determined through a&#xD;
      self-evaluation at 6 and 12 weeks following neurotoxin and hyaluronic acid treatments. The&#xD;
      impact of treatments on subjects' state self-esteem will also be assessed at 6 and 12 weeks&#xD;
      following the treatments.&#xD;
