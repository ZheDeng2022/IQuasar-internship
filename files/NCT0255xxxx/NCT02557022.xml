  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A low glycemic index (GI) diet has been associated with improved glycemic control in type 2&#xD;
      diabetes patients and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Low glycemic load (GL)&#xD;
      diets have been associated in cohort studies with a reduction in both diabetes incidence and&#xD;
      CVD events, especially in overweight individuals, and have been recommended by the Canadian,&#xD;
      American and European diabetes associations. Life style modification trials have shown that&#xD;
      reducing body weight in overweight or obese individuals improves obesity-related risk&#xD;
      factors. The process of a systematic review combines the results from many studies in order&#xD;
      to arrive at a pooled weighted average of the true effect. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the highest quality evidence from randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials to assess the effect of low GI/GL diets on body weight change. The results&#xD;
      of this synthesis will inform clinical practice guidelines and lead to better health outcomes&#xD;
      through informing healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and&#xD;
      guiding future research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background: Obesity and overweight have been identified as a risk factor for developing type&#xD;
      2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, CVD and certain cancers. Nutrition therapy is the&#xD;
      first line treatment for prevention of these health conditions and as a key component during&#xD;
      their initial and long term management. Diets based on low GI foods and low GL have been&#xD;
      associated with risk reduction of type 2 diabetes and CVD. Current clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines suggest the replacement of high GI foods for low GI foods based on the improvement&#xD;
      on glycemic control and CVD risk factors. However, there is no enough evidence to support the&#xD;
      association between low GI/GL diets on body weight reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for a review: The lack of high quality data in this area to support clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines represents an urgent call for stronger evidence. The use of meta-analyses of&#xD;
      controlled feeding trials remains the &quot;Goal Standard&quot; of evidence for nutrition guidelines&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To provide evidence-based guidance for public health policy, health claims, and&#xD;
      nutrition guidelines relating to low GI/GL diets, we will conduct a systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis of controlled feeding trials to assess the effect of a low GI/GL diet on body&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The planning and conduct of the proposed meta-analyses will follow the Cochrane&#xD;
      handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The reporting will follow the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be&#xD;
      searched using appropriate search terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: Intervention trials that investigate the effect of a low GI/GL diet on body&#xD;
      weight in humans will be included. Studies that are less than 12 weeks diet duration, do not&#xD;
      have a control group, include pregnant women, breast feeding women or children, or do not&#xD;
      report body weight data will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Two independent investigators will extract information about study design,&#xD;
      sample size, subject characteristics, GI/GL diet, follow-up, and the composition of the&#xD;
      background diets. Mean Â± SEM values will be extracted for all outcomes. Standard computations&#xD;
      and imputations will be used to derive missing data. Risk of bias will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: The primary outcome will be body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Pooled analysis will be conducted using the Generic Inverse Variance method&#xD;
      with random effects models stratified by metabolic phenotype (normal weight,&#xD;
      overweight/obese, metabolic syndrome criteria, diabetes, etc.). Random-effects models will be&#xD;
      used even in the absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they&#xD;
      yield more conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity.&#xD;
      Paired analyses will be applied to all crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be tested by the&#xD;
      Cochran Q statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic. Sources of heterogeneity will be&#xD;
      explored by sensitivity and subgroup analyses. A priori subgroup analyses will include GI/GL&#xD;
      (absolute level, within-treatment change, and between-treatment change), comparator (high GI&#xD;
      diet, other), duration of follow-up, saturated fat intake (absolute level, within-treatment&#xD;
      change, and between-treatment change), dietary fibre intake (absolute level, within-treatment&#xD;
      change, and between-treatment change), total carbohydrate intake (absolute level,&#xD;
      within-treatment change, and between-treatment change), design (crossover, parallel), risk of&#xD;
      bias, and median baseline body weight. Meta-regression analyses will assess the significance&#xD;
      of categorical and continuous subgroups analyses. Publication bias will be investigated by&#xD;
      the inspection of funnel plots and application of the Egger and Begg tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence Assessment: The strength of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: Results will be disseminated through traditional means such as&#xD;
      interactive presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and&#xD;
      publication in high impact factor journals. Innovative means such as webcasts with e-mail&#xD;
      feedback mechanisms will also be used. Knowledge Users will act as knowledge brokers&#xD;
      networking among opinion leaders and different adopter groups to increase awareness at each&#xD;
      stage. Four Knowledge Users will also participate directly as members of nutrition guidelines&#xD;
      committees. Target adopters will include the clinical practice, public health, industry,&#xD;
      research communities, and patient groups. Feedback will be incorporated and used to guide&#xD;
      analyses and improve key messages at each stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary findings: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of&#xD;
      dietary pulses on glycemic control in 41 controlled feeding trials. We found that pulses&#xD;
      alone or in low GI or high-fibre diets improved markers of glycemic control. Although the&#xD;
      improvement was clinically significant, it came at the expense of substantial inter-study&#xD;
      heterogeneity. We also conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohorts&#xD;
      on the associations of GI and GL with coronary heart disease events. We found that high GI&#xD;
      and GL diets were significantly associated with coronary heart disease events in women but&#xD;
      not in men. Knowledge translation from these projects has already begun. These data have&#xD;
      provided a rationale for a large trial of the effect of a low GI diet in type 2 diabetes to&#xD;
      address some of the identified sources of heterogeneity, as well as the rationale for a trial&#xD;
      of the effect of lowering the GL with canola oil on glycemic control and cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors. These data were also used in the development of the 2013 CDA Clinical Practice&#xD;
      Guidelines (CPG) for Nutrition Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the effects&#xD;
      of a low GI/GL diet on body weight, strengthening the evidence-base for dietary&#xD;
      recommendations and health claims. It will improve health outcomes through informing&#xD;
      healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
