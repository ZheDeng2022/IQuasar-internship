  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV was once a fatal diagnosis, but due to treatment advances it is no longer a death&#xD;
      sentence. Today, HIV-infected adults face a new challenge to their health; they are&#xD;
      developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) earlier and more frequently than those not&#xD;
      HIV-infected. Reasons for this include toxic effects of HIV medications and activation of the&#xD;
      immune system. Preventing cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected adults will help them live&#xD;
      healthier lives; however, there is a lack evidence to help us to achieve this goal. Exercise&#xD;
      prevents cardiovascular disease, but it is often not addressed in HIV care, due, in part, to&#xD;
      a lack of practical interventions targeting this population. This study will address this&#xD;
      problem by testing an intervention to improve and maintain exercise in HIV-infected adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the impact of an innovative and sustainable intervention, adapted to&#xD;
      the unique medical and psychosocial needs of HIV-infected adults, called SystemCHANGE-HIV. It&#xD;
      consists of six sessions to help redesign an individual's environment and routines to&#xD;
      increase exercise.This is a randomized trial in which half of the subjects will participate&#xD;
      in the intervention and half will participate in a control condition. Measures include&#xD;
      assessments of exercise, fitness, and the markers of cardiovascular health before and after&#xD;
      the intervention to see if, and how, they changed.&#xD;

      Emerging evidence suggests that HIV infection is associated with a 1.5-2-fold higher risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. This may be due, in part, to an increase in cardiometabolic risk&#xD;
      factors related to the toxic effects of HIV medications, immune activation, and chronic&#xD;
      inflammation. Interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease, accounting for the unique&#xD;
      medical and psychosocial needs of HIV-infected adults, are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise has been shown to improve cardiometabolic risk and decrease cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      It has further been shown to improve cardiometabolic risk factors in some groups of&#xD;
      HIV-infected adults in brief and intensely supervised trials. However, how to sustain&#xD;
      exercise in this population with practical and scalable interventions that can be implemented&#xD;
      in the home setting (i.e., free-living exercise) is unknown. The purpose of this is to test a&#xD;
      novel, evidence-based intervention, SystemCHANGE-HIV, which holds promise for improving&#xD;
      exercise in HIV-infected adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SystemCHANGE-HIV is a new behavior-change program that is based on a systems re-design model,&#xD;
      in which the individual's daily routines are composed of a set of habits (behaviors) that can&#xD;
      be changed. The intervention engages participants in a series of self-designed experiments to&#xD;
      test ways to change their behaviors. The program involves six weekly group sessions to teach&#xD;
      behavior-changing and exercise-improvement strategies, followed by monthly telephone booster&#xD;
      sessions to encourage maintenance of beneficial effects. SystemCHANGE has significantly&#xD;
      improved exercise adherence and cardiovascular risk factors in HIV-uninfected adults. The&#xD;
      specific aims of our study are to (1) evaluate the 3-month and 6-month effects of&#xD;
      SystemCHANGE-HIV on the amount and intensity of free-living exercise, and (2) describe the&#xD;
      impact of SystemCHANGE-HIV on fitness (VO2 max) and cardiometabolic health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish these aims, this is a longitudinal, randomized controlled trial (n=105)&#xD;
      comparing the effects SystemCHANGE-HIV to those of an attention-control condition. The&#xD;
      outcomes will be assessed for efficacy using biological and behavioral evaluations including:&#xD;
      actigraphy, fitness assessments, and clinical laboratory assessments.&#xD;
