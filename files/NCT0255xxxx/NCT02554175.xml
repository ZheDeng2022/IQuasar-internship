      The aim of this study was to determine the target propofol concentration needed to provide&#xD;
      adequate hypnosis for induction and tracheal intubation for Schnider model using total body&#xD;
      weight (TBW) in parturients. In addition, investigators wanted to define the hemodynamic&#xD;
      adverse effects associated with these propofol target concentrations.&#xD;

      The temperature was maintained at 22˚ C in the operating room. Patients were placed supine&#xD;
      with 15°left lateral tilt achieved using a wedge under the right buttock. Electrocardiograph&#xD;
      (ECG), pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored by one&#xD;
      anesthesiologist (S/5 Anesthesia Monitor, GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland), and Bispectral&#xD;
      Index (BIS) values (A2000 BIS® XP monitor, version 3.2; Aspect Medical Systems Inc., Newton,&#xD;
      MA) were obtained and recorded. The BIS smoothing time period was set at 15 seconds. The mean&#xD;
      values of the above-mentioned parameters were recorded at 3-min intervals for three&#xD;
      consecutive times to determine baseline values. Peripheral vein catheterization on the right&#xD;
      hand was then performed but no prehydration was given. A fixed volume of 500 mL hydroxyethyl&#xD;
      starch solution was infused at the rate of 0.2 ml.kg-1.min-1, then Lactated Ringer's solution&#xD;
      was infused at the same rate until the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a computer-generated random-number sequence, patients were allocated to 1 of 6 groups&#xD;
      of predefined propofol target Ce for induction, namely, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5 µg.mL-1.&#xD;
      General anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 3 µg.kg-1. Propofol was administered by the TCI&#xD;
      device to achieve the predetermined target propofol Ce. Loss of consciousness was defined by&#xD;
      the disappearance of the eyelash reflex that was assessed every 5 seconds after patients&#xD;
      spontaneously closed their eyes. After loss of consciousness, succinylcholine 1.5 mg.kg-1 was&#xD;
      administered and tracheal intubation was performed 1 minutes later only if the BIS value was&#xD;
      &lt;60 and target propofol Ce had been reached. After intubation, patients were connected to&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation adjusted to obtain an end-tidal CO2 of 30 to 35 mm Hg and the propofol&#xD;
      target concentration was reduced to 3µg.mL-1. Anesthesiologists performing loss of&#xD;
      consciousness assessment and intubation were blinded to the target propofol Ce. SpO2, SBP,&#xD;
      DBP, MAP and HR were recorded once a minute for 10 min until 5 minutes after tracheal&#xD;
      intubation when the study finished.&#xD;
