      This randomized pilot early phase I trial studies how well cholecalciferol works in treating&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia with low&#xD;
      levels of vitamin D (vitamin D deficiency). Cholecalciferol may increase levels of vitamin D&#xD;
      and improve survival in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia&#xD;
      receiving standard of care chemotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the 3 year progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time from the time of&#xD;
      study entry of watch and wait or newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) until relapse, progression, or death from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate changes in the levels of serum vitamin D levels during therapy with daily oral&#xD;
      vitamin D supplementation (cholecalciferol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the overall survival (OS), defined as time from the time of study entry of&#xD;
      watch and wait patients or newly diagnosed NHL or CLL until death from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients with low levels of vitamin D are randomized to 1 of 2 arms and patients&#xD;
      with normal levels are assigned to Arm III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive high-dose cholecalciferol orally (PO) daily for 3 years in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive low-dose cholecalciferol PO daily for 3 years in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients receive no intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The 3-year progression-free survival will be presented using Kaplan-Meier curves and will be presented for the normal serum vitamin D control group and the low and high dose randomized groups. Each randomized group (low and high dose) will be compared to a historical fixed expected 3-year progression-free survival of 45% using a one-sample logrank test following the method of Woolson (1981).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Will be described for the low dose and high dose groups and compared between groups using a Chi-square. The frequency of occurrence of overall toxicity, categorized by toxicity grades, will be described for the low dose and high dose groups and compared between groups using a Chi-square.</description>

    <description>The 3-year overall survival will be presented using Kaplan-Meier curves and will be presented for the normal serum vitamin D control group and the low and high dose randomized groups. Each randomized group (low and high dose) will be compared to a historical fixed expected 3-year overall survival of 80% using a one-sample logrank test following the method of Woolson (1981).</description>
