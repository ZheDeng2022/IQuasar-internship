      The goal of this study is to explore the effects of FeatForward on physical activity and&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic risk factors. The study will be implemented as a 2-arm randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) comparing the effects of FeatForward in patients assigned to use the application&#xD;
      versus a control group who will not use the app over a 6-month follow-up period. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that subjects using FeatForward will be more physically active and&#xD;
      will achieve greater improvements in their cardio-metabolic risk (CMR) factors than a usual&#xD;
      care control group that will not use the app over a 6-month period.&#xD;

      TextToMove (TTM) was a dynamic text messaging program which the investigators developed in&#xD;
      2012 with the goals of increasing physical activity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (T2DM), improving self-management of the disease, and lowering HbA1c levels. TTM has since&#xD;
      been evaluated in a PHRC-approved randomized controlled trial. In our current proposed study,&#xD;
      the investigators plan to convert TTM into a mobile application for smartphone use, with&#xD;
      increased and improved functionality and with the potential for easy translation to&#xD;
      additional use cases. The investigators used feedback gathered from users and observations&#xD;
      from the previous trial to shape the development plan for this second iteration, aptly named&#xD;
      &quot;FeatForward.&quot; The FeatForward app will be hyper-personalized to users and to respond&#xD;
      specifically to individual users' behavior patterns so that the application feels like an&#xD;
      intelligent health coach partnering with users to achieve better health outcomes. What&#xD;
      defines FeatForward from TTM are additional features, including the incorporation of machine&#xD;
      learning components for the messaging algorithm, tailoring of message frequency based on&#xD;
      users' activity levels, integration of patient data into the electronic medical records&#xD;
      through the Remote Monitoring Data Repository, inputs to improve the generalizability of&#xD;
      feedback regarding health metrics (e.g., weight, blood glucose), as well as a community&#xD;
      feature to enable interactions with other similar patients and a comprehensive educational&#xD;
      library.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FeatForward's primary goal is to help users increase their level of physical activity.&#xD;
      Physical inactivity has been identified as one of the leading risk factors contributing to&#xD;
      the rising rates of chronic diseases. And despite being the most common cardio-metabolic risk&#xD;
      (CMR) factor, it also happens to be the easiest to target. Current estimates suggest that&#xD;
      over half (52%) of adults in the United States do not meet the recommended physical activity&#xD;
      levels. A number of studies to date have demonstrated the dose-response protective effect of&#xD;
      increasing physical activity on the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that FeatForward will help users to increase their&#xD;
      physical activity levels and also lead to improvements in cardio-metabolic risk factors&#xD;
      compared to usual care controls that will not use the intervention.&#xD;
