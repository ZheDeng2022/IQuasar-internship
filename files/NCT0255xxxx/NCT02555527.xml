      To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis for the routine use of contrast in rest&#xD;
      echocardiography in patients with dilated or ischemic cardiomyopathy from the United States&#xD;
      healthcare system, provider and payer perspectives.&#xD;

      Decision analysis techniques will be utilized to construct and estimate a model for the&#xD;
      diagnosis, treatment, outcomes and costs among patients with dilated or ischemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy referred for clinically indicated rest transthoracic echocardiography. We will&#xD;
      first perform a systematic review of the literature regarding the use of contrast&#xD;
      echocardiography for detection of LV thrombus, in order to ensure that model design&#xD;
      accurately reflects clinical practice and current outcomes. Patients will begin the model in&#xD;
      a state of dilated or ischemic cardiomyopathy with possible LV thrombus, and will progress&#xD;
      through the model's various health states based on event probabilities that will be&#xD;
      influenced by whether the patient received contrast during their initial echocardiogram. The&#xD;
      probability of events occurring (e.g., stroke, bleeding complication, death) will be&#xD;
      estimated using data from the literature and the DEDUCE database. The cost of inpatient,&#xD;
      outpatient, and extended care for health states will be derived from available sources,&#xD;
      including Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data, National Nursing Home Survey data, and&#xD;
      published literature. Appropriate statistical methods, including inverse probability weighted&#xD;
      partitioned estimators, will be used to correctly impute long-term resource utilization,&#xD;
      given that the data include patients who are censored due to loss to follow-up. Quality of&#xD;
      life adjustment factors for health states will be drawn from the literature. For temporary&#xD;
      event states such as bleeding, a utility decrement will be subtracted from the baseline&#xD;
      utility value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The model will have a long-term horizon, and model outcomes will include long-term costs as&#xD;
      well as QALYs. There will be a number of scenario analyses to evaluate alternative modeling&#xD;
      assumptions. For example, we will simulate the selective use of contrast in only those&#xD;
      patients with a technically inadequate study versus the routine use of contrast in the&#xD;
      primary analysis. We will also evaluate cost-effectiveness from alternative perspectives&#xD;
      (U.S. health care system; provider; payer), under various reimbursement schemes of interest&#xD;
      (e.g., fee-for-service; accountable care organization setting) and assuming short term time&#xD;
      horizons (e.g., index episode of care through 90 days after testing; three year horizon). We&#xD;
      will also test the model's robustness through a series of sensitivity analyses. These will&#xD;
      include univariate (one-way) sensitivity analyses in which we will assess the model's&#xD;
      robustness to alternative values of each input parameter individually. Examples of parameters&#xD;
      for which sensitivity analyses will be conducted include costs, thrombus incidence, and event&#xD;
      rates. In addition to univariate sensitivity analyses, we will also perform probabilistic&#xD;
      (many-way) sensitivity analyses in which we use Monte Carlo methods to assess the model's&#xD;
      global stability. Cost-effectiveness acceptability frontiers will be generated to illustrate&#xD;
      model sensitivity. All modeling will be performed in a manner consistent with current&#xD;
      International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Good Research Practices&#xD;
      guidance. In order to incorporate variability in willingness-to-pay thresholds in United&#xD;
      States payers, we will report our results across a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds&#xD;
      from $50,000 - $200,000 per QALY, with $100,000 per QALY pre-specified as the primary&#xD;
      threshold.&#xD;
