  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced cancer patients have a poor quality of life and a high rate of unplanned hospital&#xD;
      admissions. Palliative care has been shown to improve patient outcomes such as quality of&#xD;
      life and symptom burden. Our long-term aim is to study the effect of Supportive and&#xD;
      Palliative Care Review Kit (SPaRK) - a novel model of early palliative care in the acute&#xD;
      hospital inpatient setting. To this end, we propose a pilot study that will provide the&#xD;
      necessary information for the planning of a subsequent larger scale Phase III trial of SPaRK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this pilot study are: 1) to estimate the recruitment rate and ability of&#xD;
      advanced cancer patients to complete the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General&#xD;
      (FACT-G) questionnaire, which measures health-related quality of life (QOL) in the four&#xD;
      domains of physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, and&#xD;
      functional well-being, 2) to obtain a tentative estimate of the effect size of the SPaRK&#xD;
      model of care on change in patient QOL over 6 days, 3) to explore the responsiveness to&#xD;
      change of FACT-G over 3 days and 4) to explore views of healthcare professionals and&#xD;
      stakeholders on SPaRK as a model of integrated palliative care and oncology care service&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the short term, the results from this study will be used to plan a larger scale Phase III&#xD;
      study of SPaRK. In the long term, a resource-efficient and effective model of care needs to&#xD;
      be developed for the aging population and rising palliative care needs of patients. If&#xD;
      successful, this pilot study will lead on to the testing of SPaRK, which does not rely wholly&#xD;
      on specialist palliative care manpower, but involves both specialists and non-specialists&#xD;
      working together to provide palliative care, and hence can be feasibly scaled up across&#xD;
      institutions and extended to non-cancer patients.&#xD;

      Specific Aims ==========&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study of the Supportive and Palliative care Review Kit (SPaRK) model of care,&#xD;
      which is integrated palliative care and oncology care for advanced cancer patients, and will&#xD;
      be focused on improving outcomes in lung cancer patients in the acute hospital inpatient&#xD;
      setting. The current usual care will be provided in the first 3-month period from 1 October&#xD;
      to 31 December 2015, and the novel SPaRK model of care will be piloted in the latter 3-month&#xD;
      period from 1 January to 31 March 2016. The overall aim of this pilot study is to facilitate&#xD;
      the planning of an upcoming phase III trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 1: To estimate the recruitment rate and data completion rate of the FACT-G&#xD;
      instrument We will estimate the recruitment rate and data completion rate for FACT-G, which&#xD;
      will demonstrate the feasibility and help in the planning of the future Phase III trial. The&#xD;
      measurement properties of FACT-G will be detailed later in the 'Methods' section of this&#xD;
      proposal. The FACT-G questionnaire will be administered at up to four time points - day 1, 4&#xD;
      and 7 of hospital admission and day of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 2: To obtain tentative estimate the effect size of SPaRK on change in FACT-G&#xD;
      from day 1 to day 7 of hospital admission The control group will be hospital admissions that&#xD;
      are managed under the current model of care. The intervention group will be hospital&#xD;
      admissions that are managed under the new SPaRK model of care. We hypothesize that the SPaRK&#xD;
      model of care will result in a greater improvement in FACT-G score from day 1 to day 7 of&#xD;
      hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 3: To explore the responsiveness to change of FACT-G from day 1 to day 4 of&#xD;
      hospital admission Within the three-day period from day 1 to day 4 of hospital admission, we&#xD;
      expect the acute problems that prompted the admission to be addressed. The patient's 'phase&#xD;
      of illness' will be recorded by the primary medical oncology physician on day 1 and day 4 as&#xD;
      part of the study protocol. For patients who change from an 'unstable phase' on day 1 to&#xD;
      'stable phase' on day 4, we will estimate the responsiveness to change of FACT-G score in&#xD;
      terms of association with this change. Even though FACT-G uses a recall period of seven days,&#xD;
      we hypothesize that FACT-G score will nonetheless increase among patients who change from an&#xD;
      'unstable phase' to 'stable phase' over the shorter time period of three days from day 1 to&#xD;
      day 4 of hospital admission while there is no change in FACT-G score among patients who&#xD;
      remained in the 'unstable phase. This would be useful for measuring outcomes in patients who&#xD;
      are discharged before day 7 of hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: To explore the views of healthcare professionals regarding SPaRK as a model&#xD;
      of integrated palliative care and oncology care service delivery Semi-structured interviews&#xD;
      will be conducted among a purposive sample of healthcare professionals, management and key&#xD;
      decision makers involved in the pilot study. We will explore their views on how integrated&#xD;
      palliative care and oncology care can be delivered in the acute hospital inpatient setting,&#xD;
      and whether SPaRK is an acceptable model for providing this care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      =======&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting This study will be conducted in Singapore General Hospital (SGH), which is a&#xD;
      1,597-bedded acute hospital with more than 78,000 admissions per year. About 5,000 hospital&#xD;
      admissions per year are under DMO, out of which about 70% are unplanned admissions for&#xD;
      advanced cancer patients, with a mean length of hospital stay of 7.2 days. These inpatients&#xD;
      are cared for by one of four Division of Medical Oncology (DMO) teams broadly organized by&#xD;
      tumor site -gastrointestinal (GI), lung, breast and lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current model of service, if the inpatient DMO team decides that a patient would&#xD;
      benefit from palliative care input, they would request for a review from the Division of&#xD;
      Palliative Medicine (DPM) team. The DPM team will provide palliative care (PC) by reviewing&#xD;
      the patients and making suggestions for patient management, but the patient remains under the&#xD;
      care of DMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a cluster-controlled study with 1 control cluster and 1 intervention&#xD;
      cluster, with patient admission episodes as units of inference. The control cluster will&#xD;
      comprise patient admission episodes occurring during the 3-month control period (1 October to&#xD;
      31 December 2015) when the current model of care is in place; the intervention cluster will&#xD;
      comprise patient admission episodes during the subsequent 3-month intervention period (1&#xD;
      January to 31 March 2016) when the SPaRK model of care is in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients This pilot study will only be conducted in the DMO lung team as their cohort&#xD;
      of patients has the highest percentage of our target population - advanced cancer patients&#xD;
      (86.0%) with unplanned hospital admissions (84.6%). Furthermore, the patients under the DMO&#xD;
      lung team also have the highest unplanned readmission rate (11.8% within 7 days, 35.3% within&#xD;
      30 days), which is a surrogate marker for unresolved palliative care problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All advanced cancer patients who have an unplanned admission under the lung team during a&#xD;
      6-month period from 1 October 2015 to 31 March 2016 will be included. In the first 3-month&#xD;
      period from 1 October to 31 December 2015, current usual care will be provided and baseline&#xD;
      data collected. The novel SPaRK model of care will be piloted in the latter 3-month period&#xD;
      from 1 January 2016 to 31 March 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  21 years old and above&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Has an unplanned admission to SGH under the care of the inpatient DMO Lung team&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Has a cancer diagnosis of stage 4 solid tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Has capacity to give written informed consent to participate in the study (for patients&#xD;
           who complete the patient questionnaires)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria - Unable to complete self-administration of the FACT-G questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPaRK intervention The SPaRK intervention will be piloted in the DMO lung team for latter&#xD;
      3-month period (1 Jan to 31 Mar 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All advanced cancer patients who have an unplanned admission in the SPaRK model of care will&#xD;
      receive palliative care, which will be provided by the DMO team in conjunction with a&#xD;
      palliative care advanced practice nurse (APN) and a part-time specialist palliative care (PC)&#xD;
      physician who will be integrated members of the DMO team (the DPM/DMO SPaRK team. It is&#xD;
      envisaged that PC physician will spend an average of 2 hours per weekday discussing cases&#xD;
      with the APN, reviewing selected cases in person and participating in a weekly team meeting&#xD;
      with the medical oncology team where the inpatient list is discussed. In the current model of&#xD;
      care, patients referred to DPM for PC are also discussed in a weekly team meeting to&#xD;
      establish their plan of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The components of palliative care (PC) that is provided in the control group by the DPM team&#xD;
      and in the intervention group by the DPM/DMO SPaRK team will include assessments of physical&#xD;
      symptoms, functional status, psychosocial issues and spiritual issues, followed by the&#xD;
      formulation of a problem list and establishment of a care plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any patient has complex palliative care needs that cannot be met by the SPaRK team, then&#xD;
      either the DMO consultant, palliative care APN or palliative care physician will trigger a&#xD;
      formal referral to the DPM team for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and instruments Patients will complete the FACT-G questionnaire (Available&#xD;
      English, Chinese [simplified], Malay and Tamil validated translations will be used). The&#xD;
      doctor in charge will complete the 'phase of illness' and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
      (ECOG) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be using FACT-G to measure the primary outcome of patient's health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL) as it is an established instrument that has been well-validated both&#xD;
      internationally and locally for patients with many kinds of cancer. It has a low level of&#xD;
      noise, as evidenced by reliability measures consistently shown to be between 0.8 and 0.95,&#xD;
      which is suitable for comparison between groups. 21, 22, 24 As compared to some popular&#xD;
      alternatives in cancer QoL research, FACT-G has been shown to be more sensitive in detecting&#xD;
      differences between groups. It covers four QOL domains: physical well-being (7 items),&#xD;
      social/family well-being (7 items), emotional well-being (6 items) and functional well-being&#xD;
      (7 items), and each item has response choices in a 5-point Likert-type scale. We will adopt&#xD;
      the official scoring method, which is part of the validated instrument that has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to have good measurement properties as aforementioned. Response scores on&#xD;
      negatively phrased questions are reversed so that higher scores always mean better QOL. The&#xD;
      domain score will be obtained by summing individual item scores within the domain, subject to&#xD;
      imputation for item non-response by the &quot;half-rule&quot;, i.e. missing item score replaced by&#xD;
      average of other scores in the subscale if more than 50% of the items in the same subscale&#xD;
      were answered. It has been shown that the half-rule is very robust and that very few&#xD;
      Singaporean cancer patients who participated in FACT-G assessment had item non-response not&#xD;
      imputable by the half-rule. The total FACT-G score is the sum of the four domain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FACT-G questionnaire will be administered at four time points: T1 - day 1 of hospital&#xD;
      admission; T2 - day 4 of hospital admission (if patient has not been discharged); T3 - day 7&#xD;
      of hospital admission (if patient has not been discharged); T4 - day of discharge. The&#xD;
      standard administration method of FACT-G is self-report. Hence self-administration is the&#xD;
      chosen mode of questionnaire completion. As there is some evidence that FACT-G is not&#xD;
      equivalent between self-administration and interviewer-administration, we will not be using&#xD;
      interviewer-administration in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all time points, the patient's 'phase of illness' will also be recorded. The standard&#xD;
      definitions of the five phases are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - Stable: patient problems and symptoms are adequately controlled. Phase 2 -&#xD;
      Unstable: an urgent change in the plan of care or emergency treatment is required because the&#xD;
      patient experiences a new problem that was not anticipated in the existing plan, or care&#xD;
      and/or the patient experiences a rapid increase in the severity of a current problem, and/or&#xD;
      family/carers circumstances change suddenly impacting on patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 - Deteriorating: the care plan is addressing anticipated needs but requires periodic&#xD;
      review because there is a gradual worsening of an existing problem or there is a new but&#xD;
      anticipated problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4 - Terminal: death likely within days. Phase 5 - Bereavement: patient has died.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'phase of illness' will be used to determine responsiveness to change of FACT-G,&#xD;
      specifically for patients who change from an 'unstable phase' to 'stable phase'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following demographic data and background information will also be collected: age,&#xD;
      gender, ethnicity, primary cancer diagnosis, stage of cancer and Eastern Cooperative Oncology&#xD;
      Group (ECOG) performance status score. The ECOG score is a set of standard criteria for&#xD;
      measuring how the disease impacts a patient's daily living abilities and describes a&#xD;
      patient's level of functioning in terms of their ability to care for themself, daily&#xD;
      activity, and physical ability (walking, working, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data for each patient will be obtained from the computer system:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discharge destination (e.g. home, nursing home, inpatient hospice)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Referral to DPM during the admission and date of referral to DPM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of a plan for follow up by community palliative care services upon&#xD;
           discharge from hospital (including outpatient palliative care clinic, home hospice, day&#xD;
           hospice and inpatient hospice)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The occurrence of another unplanned hospital admission within 7 days and 30 days after&#xD;
           being discharged from hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      These outcomes reflect the usage of acute hospital and community palliative care resources&#xD;
      and will be used to decide if any of these outcomes would be suitable for further study in&#xD;
      the future Phase III trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and sample size planning Recruitment rate and data completion rate for FACT-G&#xD;
      It is estimated that there will be 95 eligible patient admissions per month (based on data&#xD;
      from May 2013-June 2014), and thus approximately 280 patient admissions in the 3-month&#xD;
      control period and 280 patient admissions in the 3-month intervention period, totally 560&#xD;
      eligible patient admissions. We assume that, on average, one patient may have about 1.5&#xD;
      admissions during the study period, and that the intra-class correlation coefficient between&#xD;
      outcomes measured at two admissions is about 0.5. This implies a design effect of about 1.25&#xD;
      and this is taken into account in the sample size planning to allow for clustering of data&#xD;
      within the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will update the percentage of eligible patient admissions, recruitment rate and&#xD;
      data completion rate for the measured outcomes. A total of 560 eligible admissions in six&#xD;
      months (effective sample size 450 after discounting for design effect) will allow us to more&#xD;
      accurately estimate of the consent cum data completion rate with 95% confidence interval of&#xD;
      approximately +/- 4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect size of SPaRK on change in FACT-G from day 1 to day 7 of hospital admission (T1 to T3)&#xD;
      Assuming about 25% consent cum data completion rate for FACT-G at T1 (day 1 of hospital&#xD;
      admission) and T3 (day 7 of hospital admission), we would have approximately 75 patient&#xD;
      admissions each in the control group and intervention group (total 150 patient admissions)&#xD;
      with complete FACT-G at both time points. This sample size would provide about 80% power at a&#xD;
      20% 1-sided Type 1 error rate to detect an effect size of 0.3 (PASS 13 software).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responsiveness to change of FACT-G from day 1 to day 4 of hospital admission (T1 to T2)&#xD;
      Sensitivity to change tests the ability of an instrument to detect important changes over&#xD;
      time in the concept being measured. For patients who change from the 'unstable phase' at T1&#xD;
      (day 1 of hospital admission) to the 'stable phase' at T2 (day 4 of hospital admission), we&#xD;
      will estimate the sensitivity to change of FACT-G scores between T1 and T2. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that FACT-G scores will improve for patients whose phase of illness changes from 'unstable&#xD;
      phase' at T1 to 'stable phase' at T2 while there will be no significant change in FACT-G&#xD;
      score among patients who remain in the 'unstable phase' in the same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Views of healthcare professionals regarding SPaRK as a model of integrated palliative care&#xD;
      and oncology care service delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare professionals involved in this pilot study will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      one-to-one interviews. Purposive sampling will be used. Heads of department from the DMO, DPM&#xD;
      and the nursing division will also be included. The format of the interviews will be&#xD;
      semi-structured, where participants will be asked to discuss their responses to the following&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) How do you think integrated palliative care and oncology care should be delivered in the&#xD;
      acute hospital inpatient setting? ii) What do you think of the SPaRK model as a possible way&#xD;
      of delivering integrated palliative care and oncology care to advanced cancer patients? iii)&#xD;
      How can the SPaRK model be modified to improve its effectiveness in providing integrated&#xD;
      palliative care and oncology care? iv) What do you perceive to be the role of the palliative&#xD;
      care nurse and palliative care doctor in the oncology team? v) Do you think the SPaRK model&#xD;
      should be implemented and why?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will be audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Written notes will also be taken&#xD;
      during the interview. Interview transcripts will be analyzed using framework analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      ========= This is a pilot study of the SPaRK - a novel model of integrated palliative care&#xD;
      and oncology care for advanced cancer patients who have an unplanned hospital admission. The&#xD;
      overall aim of this pilot study is to establish the feasibility of a larger-scale Phase III&#xD;
      trial of SPaRK. If successful, this pilot study will help design and plan the subsequent&#xD;
      phase III trial, which will test a potentially viable as well as effective way of providing&#xD;
      early palliative care for advanced cancer patients in the acute hospital inpatient setting.&#xD;
