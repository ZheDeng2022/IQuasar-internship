      ASIT naïve patients sensitized to grass pollens will be recruited for the study. All of them&#xD;
      will be instructed to treat bothersome in-season symptoms when they appear (on as needed, pro&#xD;
      re nata basis) with rescue medication. They will be given 5 different options and will be&#xD;
      informed about the effects of each of them in order to make their optimal choice for&#xD;
      different symptoms and their combination: local decongestant (xylomethazoline, when&#xD;
      congestion is leading), local antihistamine (azelastine, when itching, sneezing and rhinorhea&#xD;
      a predominant), nasal corticosteroid (momethasone, when all nasal symptoms are pressing and&#xD;
      no adequate relief is obtained form the other 2 local treatments), oral antihistamine&#xD;
      (bilastine, when itching and sneezing persist despite the local treatments) and oral&#xD;
      corticosteroid (prednisolone, when any or all symptoms become unbearable despite the other&#xD;
      suggested treatments). Patients who are reluctant to use immunotherapy or who are too late to&#xD;
      initiate it will be randomized to be treated with the listed medications on as needed basis,&#xD;
      the nasally applied formulations will be followed by either HPMC to prolong and enhance their&#xD;
      effect (Group HPMC) or placebo (lactose powder) (Group Placebo) to serve as control. Patients&#xD;
      indicated and willing to carry out ASIT will be treated according to the standard protocol&#xD;
      with grass allergens sublingually (Staloral #688) and will receive rescue medication (Group&#xD;
      Immunotherapy).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale. Assessment and follow up of specifically sensitized subjects with allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis during the pollen season is traditionally based on symptom scores. Accounting for&#xD;
      the use of rescue medication on top of symptom scores provides another dimension to the&#xD;
      overall clinical characterization of the patients. Thus, using &quot;combined symptom and&#xD;
      medication scores&quot; (CSMS) allows thorough characterization of the disease course. Guidelines&#xD;
      recommend that CSMS are used for assessment of the effect of allergen specific immunotherapy&#xD;
      in subjects with allergic rhinitis. Different allergic rhinitis management strategies can be&#xD;
      evaluated and compared by means of CSMS. In the update of the ARIA guidelines of 2010, 24&#xD;
      recommendations have been made in relation to pharmacologic treatment. Special position paper&#xD;
      has been devoted to severe chronic upper airway disease (SCUAD), the treatment for which has&#xD;
      been earmarked as unmet need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, a standardized and universally recognized rescue treatment strategy does not&#xD;
      exist. The most common approach for handling nasal complaints in real life consists in using&#xD;
      rescue medication for symptoms whenever they appear. This is certainly the case when symptoms&#xD;
      appear for the first time ever, or when patients do not want to resort to allergen specific&#xD;
      immunotherapy (ASIT) and / or regular oral antihistamine treatment for financial reasons or&#xD;
      personal beliefs. Under these circumstances, a long list of pharmacological choices for local&#xD;
      or systemic application is possible including antihistamines, corticosteroids, leukotriene&#xD;
      antagonists, cromones and antimuscarinic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formulations for local application in the nose appeal to patients with their ease of use and&#xD;
      immediate relief. They comprise a variety of generic drugs: decongestants, antihistamines,&#xD;
      corticosteroids and antimuscarinics. The fact that they are not ingested makes them first&#xD;
      choice for people reluctant to take oral medications. In many cases it is possible to control&#xD;
      the symptoms of allergic rhinitis with these formulations used per se or as adjunct rescue&#xD;
      medication in the course of ASIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question stays whether the effectiveness of nasally applied drugs can further be&#xD;
      improved. Despite the good rationale for their mechanism of action, their efficacy is&#xD;
      diminished by the cleaning mechanisms of the nose, rhinorrhea in particular. Slowing down of&#xD;
      the clearance of the nasal mucosa and prolonging the contact time with the nasal mucosa would&#xD;
      enhance their pharmaceutical effects. The investigators have demonstrated by objectively&#xD;
      measuring nasal flow rates that &quot;sealing&quot; in place locally applied oxymetazoline in subjects&#xD;
      with persistent allergic rhinitis by means of commercially available&#xD;
      hydroxyl-propyl-methyl-cellulose (HPMC) significantly enhances the resulting decongestion and&#xD;
      that this effect is augmented over a time span of 2 weeks without noticeable tachyphylaxis or&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators set the aim to investigate whether this beneficial effect of HPMC&#xD;
      translates into clinical benefits in a real life clinical trial for other available drug&#xD;
      preparations for nasal delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. ASIT naïve patients sensitized to grass pollens will be recruited for the&#xD;
      study. All of the patients will be instructed to treat bothersome in-season symptoms when&#xD;
      they appear (on as needed, pro re nata basis) with rescue medication. The patients will be&#xD;
      given 5 different options and will be informed about the effects of each of them in order to&#xD;
      make their optimal choice for different symptoms and their combination: local decongestant&#xD;
      (xylomethazoline, when congestion is leading), local antihistamine (azelastine, when itching,&#xD;
      sneezing and rhinorhea a predominant), nasal corticosteroid (momethasone, when all nasal&#xD;
      symptoms are pressing and no adequate relief is obtained form the other 2 local treatments),&#xD;
      oral antihistamine (bilastine, when itching and sneezing persist despite the local&#xD;
      treatments) and oral corticosteroid (prednisolone, when any or all symptoms become unbearable&#xD;
      despite the other suggested treatments). Patients who are reluctant to use immunotherapy or&#xD;
      who are too late to initiate it will be randomized to be treated with the listed medications&#xD;
      on as needed basis, the nasally applied formulations will be followed by either HPMC to&#xD;
      prolong and enhance their effect (Group HPMC) or placebo (lactose powder) (Group Placebo) to&#xD;
      serve as control. Patients indicated and willing to carry out ASIT will be treated according&#xD;
      to the standard protocol with grass allergens sublingually (Staloral #688) and will receive&#xD;
      rescue medication (Group Immunotherapy).&#xD;
