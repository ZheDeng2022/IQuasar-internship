      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have signed and dated an IRB approved written informed consent in&#xD;
             accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be obtained before&#xD;
             the performance of any protocol related procedures that are not part of normal subject&#xD;
             care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule,&#xD;
             laboratory tests, tumor biopsies, and other requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pathologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic disease per the treating&#xD;
             institution's standard of care of the following tumor types&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects with histologically confirmed locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
             melanoma who meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Subjects have received any number of prior lines of therapy or may be treatment&#xD;
             naïve ii. If the subject has been treated with a prior line of therapy, they must have&#xD;
             had disease progression or be refractory to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             b. Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally&#xD;
             advanced/unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (including mixed histologies&#xD;
             of urothelial carcinoma with elements of other subtypes) of the renal pelvis, ureter,&#xD;
             bladder or urethra (referred to broadly in this protocol as &quot;bladder cancer&quot;) who meet&#xD;
             the following criteria: i. Subjects must have disease progression or refractory&#xD;
             disease after their prior line of therapy. Subjects must have had at least 1 platinum&#xD;
             based chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced&#xD;
             unresectable disease. Subjects may have received any number of prior lines of therapy&#xD;
             OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii. Subjects with disease recurrence within 1 year of a platinum based neoadjuvant or&#xD;
             adjuvant therapy for bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             iii. The subject actively refuses chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic or&#xD;
             locally advanced disease considered as standard treatment for this disease stage (i.e.&#xD;
             a patient who has relapsed &gt;1 year after treatment with neoadjuvant or adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy), despite being informed by the investigator about the treatment options.&#xD;
             The subject's refusal must be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must have measurable disease by CT scans or MRI per RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
             Radiographic tumor assessment must be performed within 28 days prior to first dose of&#xD;
             study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects must consent to allow for the acquisition of tumor sample prior to starting&#xD;
             treatment on study (in most cases patients will require a tumor biopsy). This biopsy&#xD;
             site may be the only site of measurable disease if the site is &gt; 2 cm. The biopsy site&#xD;
             must, in the opinion of the investigator, be likely to yield acceptable tumor sample&#xD;
             for core biopsies as described in Appendix 4. It is also acceptable if tumor sample is&#xD;
             obtained by excision biopsy or during surgery (i.e. if procedure was previously&#xD;
             planned), provided the tumor sample can be processed as described in Appendix 4. In&#xD;
             the case that a patient had a tumor sample acquired prior to consenting to the study&#xD;
             and this tumor sample is acceptable for processing as described in Appendix 4 (i.e.&#xD;
             frozen sample stored) and the tumor sample was acquired within 60 days of starting&#xD;
             treatment, this is acceptable and a new biopsy will not be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Willingness to adhere to the study visit schedule and prohibitions as specified in&#xD;
             this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Expected survival of at least 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. At the time of day 1 of the study, patients must have completed chemotherapy, targeted&#xD;
             therapy, investigational therapy, other immunotherapy, radiation therapy or major&#xD;
             surgery (requiring general anesthesia) at least 28 days before administration of the&#xD;
             first dose of nivolumab. Patients undergoing minor surgical procedures and biopsies&#xD;
             that do not require general anesthesia may begin receiving study therapy if&#xD;
             sufficiently recovered as determined by the treating investigator. Patients may have&#xD;
             received prior focal radiotherapy for palliation of an isolated site of disease, which&#xD;
             must be completed at least 14 days prior to day 1 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Palliative (limited-field) radiation therapy is permitted during treatment with study&#xD;
             drug (s), if all of the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The lesion being considered for palliative radiation is not a target lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Radiation treatment is administered 12 weeks or greater after their first dose of&#xD;
                  study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. All baseline laboratory requirements will be assessed and should be obtained within 14&#xD;
             days of the first dose of study drug. Screening laboratory values must meet the&#xD;
             following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        White blood cells (WBCs) ≥ 2000/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Neutrophils ≥ 1000/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Platelets ≥ 100 x 103/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN (or glomerular filtration rate ≥ 40mL/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert's syndrome who must have total&#xD;
        bilirubin ≤ 3.0mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Must have no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after treatment is&#xD;
                  complete and within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Must have no requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids&#xD;
                  (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug&#xD;
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy or&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;&#xD;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14&#xD;
             days of first dose of study drug. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement&#xD;
             steroid doses are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who have received prior therapy with any T cell co-stimulation or checkpoint&#xD;
             pathways such as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4, anti-CD137; or other&#xD;
