  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a serious disease with a dismal prognosis when left untreated.&#xD;
      Advances in medical therapy have improved survival according to recent registries and&#xD;
      systematic reviews, but are associated with high healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier studies in Heidelberg, Germany showed good evidence for the effect of exercise&#xD;
      training on improving exercise performance, quality of life and pulmonary hemodynamics in&#xD;
      patients with pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the present project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to investigate the quality of the implementation of a standardized 3 week in-hospital&#xD;
           exercise training program on markers of outcome and disease severity in PH-patients in&#xD;
           Switzerland immediately after training and after 3 and 12 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to look whether training with hyperoxia vs. standard care might be more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre, randomized parallel-group trial where the intervention rehabilitation&#xD;
      is delayed in one group so that they can serve as standard care controls for the others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a nested single-centre randomized-controlled trial patent will additionally be randomized&#xD;
      to receive either usual rehabilitation (UR) or rehabilitation with standardized supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen therapy (SSOT) during nights and ergometer training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a PH specific rehabilitation program during 3 weeks followed by an&#xD;
      instructed home-based training program for 12 weeks. Patients who are not already under&#xD;
      long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) due to daytime hypoxemia will additionally be randomized to&#xD;
      receive standardized supplemental oxygen therapy (SSOT) during training and nights upon&#xD;
      written informed consent.&#xD;
