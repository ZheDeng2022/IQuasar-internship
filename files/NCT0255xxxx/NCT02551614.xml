  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study to further develop an imaging platform for the assessment of&#xD;
      whole lung neutrophil retention. The primary objective of the study is to quantify and&#xD;
      compare neutrophil retention in the lungs of lipopolysaccharide-challenged healthy subjects,&#xD;
      saline-challenged healthy subjects and subjects with stable COPD. There will be two treatment&#xD;
      groups, one with healthy subjects and the other with subjects with stable COPD. The total&#xD;
      duration of this study for healthy subjects will be approximately 1 week, in addition to the&#xD;
      screening window of 28 days. The total duration of this study for subjects with COPD will be&#xD;
      approximately 1 week for those that complete Visit 1 only, and approximately 2 weeks for&#xD;
      those subjects with COPD that return to the unit for Visit 2 7-10 days later, in addition to&#xD;
      the screening window of 28 days.&#xD;
