      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of lamotrigine in the treatment of&#xD;
      ketamine dependence in a double-blind, placebo controlled design.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine is an anesthetic derivative of phencyclidine (PCP; 'Angel dust') with dissociative,&#xD;
      analgesic and psychedelic properties. Recreational use of ketamine was first documented on&#xD;
      the west coast of the United States in the early 1970s. Ketamine is frequently described as a&#xD;
      &quot;unique drug&quot; because it shows hypnotic (sleep producing), analgesic (pain relieving) and&#xD;
      amnesic (short-term memory loss) effects; no other drug used in clinical practice combines&#xD;
      these three important features at the same time. Ketamine produces an anaesthetic state,&#xD;
      which has been termed &quot;dissociative anaesthesia&quot;, characterized by analgesia and changes in&#xD;
      vigilance and perception, but it is not a sedative or hypnotic. It appears that ketamine&#xD;
      selectively interrupts the thalamocortical system. Ketamine has some anxiolytic- and&#xD;
      antidepressant-like properties in sub-anesthetic doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanism of ketamine addiction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existence of binding sites for PCP and ketamine were first identified in 1979. Earlier&#xD;
      reports indicate that ketamine essentially blocks the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of&#xD;
      glutamate receptors. The antagonism of NMDA receptor is responsible for its specific&#xD;
      properties including psychedelic, anesthetic, analgesic, anxiolytic, antidepressant, hypnotic&#xD;
      effects and cognitive impairment. In fact, ketamine also binds to non-NMDA glutamate&#xD;
      receptors and involves glutamate-independent mechanisms associated with nicotinic and&#xD;
      muscarinic cholinergic, monoaminergic and opioid receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no specific pharmacological treatment model for ketamine dependence.&#xD;
      Continuous urine screen plus medications for psychiatric symptoms treatment revealed fair&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug: Lamotrigine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant drug used in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder.&#xD;
      Besides it's sodium channels blocking effect as an antiepileptic drugs, lamotrigine also&#xD;
      inhibits the release of glutamate through modulation of high voltage-activated calcium&#xD;
      currents and sodium channels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Patients with ketamine use disorder seeking treatment at Taipei City Hospital and&#xD;
      Psychiatric Center will be invited to participate this clinical trial. Treatment and&#xD;
      assessment Schedule After informed consent signature with explanations about the procedure of&#xD;
      this study, the initiation includes collecting drug use history and medical history,&#xD;
      conducting a physical examination, and performing clinical laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will last for 12 weeks and patients will be monitored at week 0, week 1,&#xD;
      week 2, week 4, week 8, and week 12 for 6 times. Urinary toxicology and visual analogue&#xD;
      scales will be checked at each visit and laboratory chemistry at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study subjects will be randomly assigned by computer-generated numbers either to the&#xD;
      lamotrigine or placebo group in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage of trial medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial medication and placebo will be sponsored by Lotus pharmaceutical, Taiwan. It is an&#xD;
      extended release tablet form of lamotrigine or identical placebo. The preparation of double&#xD;
      procedure will be handled by the Department of Pharmacy of Taipei City Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a subject enters the treatment phase (after randomization) the dosage of study&#xD;
      medication will be 25 mg/before bed (or one half placebo tablet at night) for 7 days. On day&#xD;
      8 (visit 2 or the beginning of week 2), the dosage will be increased, as tolerated, to 50&#xD;
      mg/day for another week. After then, the dosage will be increased to 100 mg/day (QD and HS)&#xD;
      for 2 weeks. After 4 weeks, the dosage may be kept or increased, as judged by investigator,&#xD;
      at the range of 100mg to 200mg /day to the end of 12 weeks. The dosage may be decreased at&#xD;
      any time because of side effects, but not less than 100 mg. If the patient prefers, he or she&#xD;
      may take all of his or her daily dose of medication in the morning or evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enroll period will be 2 years and total study duration will be 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant and prohibited medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      During study period, patients can take their original medications for systemic disorder. Due&#xD;
      to patients with drug abuse usually have depressed mood, emotional disturbance or sleep&#xD;
      problems during withdrawal period, benzodiazepines, or short acting novel hypnotics such as&#xD;
      zolpidem or zaleplon can be used for ethical consideration. For those patient treated with&#xD;
      antipsychotics due to drug-induced psychosis, the patients can be enrolled only when the&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms remitted and lowest dose of antipsychotic can be used during the trial&#xD;
      period. The prohibited medications include medications which have drug-drug interaction such&#xD;
      as carbamazepine, phenytoin barbiturates, rifampicin, chlordiazepoxide and oral&#xD;
      hypoglycaemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the results from urinary drug screen of ketamine, and other&#xD;
      substances including amphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, morphine and cannabis, which&#xD;
      will be carried out at the baseline and during each visit of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective visual analogue scales of craving by patient and subjective clinical global&#xD;
      impression of severity will be the second endpoint. The Brief Addiction Severity Index of&#xD;
      ketamine use will also be analyzed.&#xD;
