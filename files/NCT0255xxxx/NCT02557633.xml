  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that the effectiveness of allergy immunotherapy to control&#xD;
      symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis is related to the cumulative dose of allergen or allergoid&#xD;
      administered during a single regimen of subcutaneous (SC) injections or of sublingual&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two new cumulative doses of the Grass MATA MPL 10200 and 18200 SU (Standardized Units) are&#xD;
      being developed to compare with the current dose of 5100 SU. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the tolerability and safety of these two new cumulative dose regimens of Grass MATA&#xD;
      MPL compared with placebo in patients with seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (SAR) due to&#xD;
      grass pollen, to enable selection of the best dose to go into a larger scale study to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of the higher cumulative doses.&#xD;

      Structure: Single center, parallel group, single-blind, randomized study There will be three&#xD;
      treatment groups, two groups receiving a different, cumulative dose of Grass MATA MPL and the&#xD;
      third group receiving placebo only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: The duration of the study from screening to final visit after treatment is expected&#xD;
      to be approximately 7 weeks. There will be a telephone follow up at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      after treatment.&#xD;
