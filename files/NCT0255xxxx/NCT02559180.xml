    <textblock>
      This study is an investigator initiated interventional study for subjects with diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema that have been previously treated with bevacizumab or ranibizumab. Intravitreal&#xD;
      aflibercept 2mg will be given until OCT (ocular coherence tomography) demonstrates an absence&#xD;
      of fluid. Continued intravitreal aflibercept 2mg will then take place every 2 months for a&#xD;
      total of 24 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an interventional, single arm, investigator initiated study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      given 2 mg (0.05 mL or 50 microliters) of IAI injection administered monthly until OCT&#xD;
      demonstrates no evidence of fluid as defined by the protocol, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL) once&#xD;
      every 2 months. Each subject will be evaluated for 24 months. Thus, the study duration will&#xD;
      be 24 months plus the recruitment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for safety, efficacy as measured by SDOCT and best corrected&#xD;
      visual acuity (BCVA) using the Electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study&#xD;
      (E-ETDRS) protocol. In additional, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and OCT&#xD;
      angiography will be performed at baseline, month 6, month 12 and at the final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one eye per subject may be enrolled in the study. If a subject's fellow (non-study) eye&#xD;
      requires treatment for at study entry, or during the subject's participation in the study,&#xD;
      the fellow eye can receive IAI injection for DME.&#xD;
