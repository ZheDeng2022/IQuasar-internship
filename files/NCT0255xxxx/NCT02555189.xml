  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This partially randomized phase IB/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of&#xD;
      ribociclib when given with enzalutamide and to see how well they work compared to&#xD;
      enzalutamide alone in treating patients with prostate cancer that does not respond to&#xD;
      treatment with hormones (hormone resistant), has spread from the primary site (place where it&#xD;
      started) to other places in the body (metastatic), is chemotherapy naïve, and retains&#xD;
      retinoblastoma expression. Testosterone can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells.&#xD;
      Hormone therapy using enzalutamide may fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of&#xD;
      testosterone by the tumor cells. Ribociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether enzalutamide works&#xD;
      better when given with or without ribociclib in treating patients with prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of ribociclib in combination with 160 mg of&#xD;
      enzalutamide. (Phase Ib)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine efficacy with respect to the proportion of subjects that achieve a &gt;= 50%&#xD;
      reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at 12 weeks. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. PSA progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Radiographic progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the expression of retinoblastoma (RB) in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and&#xD;
      tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate other mechanisms of castrate resistance (such as androgen receptor&#xD;
      [AR]-variant [v]7) in tumor tissue and CTCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore resistance mechanisms of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 inhibitors in tumor&#xD;
      samples in patients that progress on enzalutamide and ribociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Explore the use/correlation of circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)/exosomes in&#xD;
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients treated with enzalutamide with and without&#xD;
      ribociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Androgen profiles and correlation to clinical outcomes. VI. Development of model explant&#xD;
      systems to correlate with the clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ribociclib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE Ib: Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and&#xD;
      ribociclib PO QD on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive enzalutamide PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive enzalutamide PO QD on days 1-28 and ribociclib PO QD on days 1-21.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 24 months.&#xD;
