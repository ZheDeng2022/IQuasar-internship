    <measure>Percentage of Correctly Identified Pre-treatment Photos by a Panel of Blinded Independent Reviewers</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the treated vs. untreated areas will be assessed by observation of changes in surface contour and/or fat volume by an independent photo review of pre-treatment and post-treatment images of the treated areas. Reviewers will be practicing dermatologists or plastic surgeons. All reviewers will be blinded to post-treatment vs. baseline untreated area. The order in which images will be presented will be randomized; for each subject placement of the baseline, pre-treatment image will be randomized for each pair of subject images. Reviewers will be asked to select the baseline photos for each subject photo series and record selections on a data collection form. Success will be defined as at least 70% correct identification of the pre-treatment images for flanks treated with each treatment parameter by at least 2 of 3 reviewers.</description>

    <measure>Safety of the Zeltiq CoolSculpting System Using the CoolCore Applicator With and Without the Crown Cooling Insert</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment through the 12 week post-treatment follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The safety endpoint is the number of unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE) as well as the number of device and/or procedure-related adverse events. Adverse events are collected from the time of enrollment through the 12 week final follow-up visit.</description>

    <measure>Subject Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subject satisfaction as assessed by questionnaire administered at 12 weeks post-treatment. The questionnaire will consist of a 5-point Likert scale with the following selections options: 1) very unsatisfied; 2) somewhat unsatisfied; 3) neither satisfied nor unsatisfied; 4) somewhat satisfied; 5) very satisfied. jIn addition, free-text fields provided options for subjects responses.</description>

    <description>This is a split body study in which all subjects will receive bilateral flank treatment with CoolSculpting. The investigator will determine one flank for treatment using the CoolCore applicator without an accessory for a duration of 60 minutes at a protocol-defined temperature. The contralateral flank will be treated with the standard CoolCore Applicator using an applicator accessory, the Crown Cooling Insert (CCI) at a protocol-defined temperature for a duration of up to 45 minutes. All enrolled subjects receive identical treatments; the investigator will use alternate subject numbers to balance which flank to treat with and without the CoolCore applicator accessory, such that all even subject numbers will receive treatment using the Standard CoolCore on the right flank and odd subject numbers will receive the same treatment on the left flank.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Subject with body mass index (BMI) up to 30. BMI is defined as weight in pounds&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has had a non-invasive fat reduction and/or body contouring procedure in the&#xD;

        <title>Percentage of Correctly Identified Pre-treatment Photos by a Panel of Blinded Independent Reviewers</title>
        <description>Change in the treated vs. untreated areas will be assessed by observation of changes in surface contour and/or fat volume by an independent photo review of pre-treatment and post-treatment images of the treated areas. Reviewers will be practicing dermatologists or plastic surgeons. All reviewers will be blinded to post-treatment vs. baseline untreated area. The order in which images will be presented will be randomized; for each subject placement of the baseline, pre-treatment image will be randomized for each pair of subject images. Reviewers will be asked to select the baseline photos for each subject photo series and record selections on a data collection form. Success will be defined as at least 70% correct identification of the pre-treatment images for flanks treated with each treatment parameter by at least 2 of 3 reviewers.</description>
