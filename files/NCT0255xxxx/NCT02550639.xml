    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, randomized study is to assess a subject's immunological status&#xD;
      against hCMV before kidney transplantation by an hCMV-specific interferon (INF)-γ ELISPOT&#xD;
      technique confirming previous results and establishing their statistical validity in order to&#xD;
      determine whether this test could be used routinely in clinical practice to assess the risk&#xD;
      of developing hCMV infection after renal transplantation and, ultimately, identify the most&#xD;
      effective individual antiviral therapeutic strategy against hCMV.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) is the most common opportunistic pathogen in the first months&#xD;
      after solid organ transplantation. Traditionally, hCMV infection in renal transplant patients&#xD;
      is indirectly associated with an increased risk of acute rejection, chronic graft&#xD;
      dysfunction, graft loss and even increased patient mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The susceptibility of developing hCMV infection is essentially determined by the immune&#xD;
      status of the donor and the receptor with regards to the virus, whereby seronegative&#xD;
      recipients (IgG) receiving a graft from a seropositive donor (IgG +) are the group of&#xD;
      patients with a particularly high risk for developing hCMV infection and disease. In fact,&#xD;
      without the administration of a preventative therapy for hCMV, 60 to 70% of this population&#xD;
      at risk have an infection (presence of virus in the blood) and up to approximately 20% will&#xD;
      develop associated systemic disease (viral invasion of tissues ). Interestingly, the&#xD;
      incidence of hCMV infection in patients who are seropositive for the HIV virus and receive a&#xD;
      graft is about 20%, increasing to 30% if given cell depletion therapies with polyclonal&#xD;
      antibodies administered after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently two treatment options to prevent infection by hCMV; One is prophylactic,&#xD;
      whereby the antiviral therapy is administered orally for about 90 to 100 days after&#xD;
      transplantation in all patients considered at risk (donor IgG+, recipient IgG-) and the&#xD;
      second is pre-emptive therapy, in which the presence of virus in the peripheral blood is&#xD;
      monitored periodically after transplantation until it appears (at present by polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR) detection of viral nucleic acids),thus triggering the need for intensive&#xD;
      antiviral therapy. When compared with no pharmacological intervention, both therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the development of hCMV and other&#xD;
      herpes virus type diseases, and even a decrease in the incidence of acute graft rejection.&#xD;
      However, there are few prospective randomized studies comparing the effectiveness of these&#xD;
      two therapeutic alternatives. Recently, a German group prospectively compared the efficacy of&#xD;
      prophylactic oral ganciclovir versus intravenous ganciclovir therapy in a group of 148&#xD;
      patients receiving high serological risk renal transplants for hCMV. Interestingly, the group&#xD;
      that received prophylactic oral therapy had a higher graft survival at 4 years of follow up&#xD;
      (uncensored for death) than the group receiving ganciclovir, suggesting that, despite the&#xD;
      administration of intensive intravenous therapy at the time of detection of the virus in the&#xD;
      blood, the potential deleterious effect of the virus on the organs during the initial&#xD;
      asymptomatic period could explain the benefits of prophylactic therapy from the beginning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results have important implications, both clinical and socioeconomic, as they seem to&#xD;
      imply the need for systemic prophylaxis to prevent the development of viral infection in all&#xD;
      patients currently considered at risk (R -/D +). Moreover, another interesting study which&#xD;
      compared primary prophylaxis with oral valganciclovir versus early therapy prevention&#xD;
      (pre-emptive therapy) in a large group of kidney transplant recipients with different&#xD;
      serologic donor / recipient combinations, showed significantly higher rates of viremia and&#xD;
      CMV disease in patients receiving treatment with an incidence of serological CMV infection of&#xD;
      up to 53% in serological R + / R + combinations. In this sense, the latest international&#xD;
      consensus guidelines indicate that both types of therapy (early and prophylactic) are&#xD;
      acceptable, with a degree of moderately high evidence, for groups of seropositive patients&#xD;
      receiving a graft from a seropositive donor. The investigator unit has adopted a pre-emptive&#xD;
      protocol for the last two years, systematically monitoring viral replication in R + / D +&#xD;
      pairs, except in those patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy with Thymoglobulin to&#xD;
      whom the investigator assigns a prophylactic treatment with oral valganciclovir for 3&#xD;
      months.This change was introduced 2 years ago before which a prophylactic treatment was given&#xD;
      to all R + / R + patients. This change has not led to improved results in terms of prevention&#xD;
      of cytomegalic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All such discrepancies among study results examining the efficacy of various therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies preventing hCMV could be explained by the poor diagnostic capabilities currently&#xD;
      available to identify those patients truly at high risk of developing cytomegalic infection.&#xD;
      This is illustrated by the fact that hCMV infection reappears in some patients (15-20%) after&#xD;
      transplantation even though they are seropositive (R+) and that, while the majority of&#xD;
      patients receiving prophylactic treatment never develop cytomegalic infection after its&#xD;
      discontinuation, a small percentage (10-15%) still does, and that, even though 70-80% of&#xD;
      seronegative (R-) patients receiving a seropositive graft (R+) will develop post-transplant&#xD;
      hCMV infection unless they receive prophylactic treatment, approximately 20-30% never will.&#xD;
      All of this leads to important therapeutic contradictions in this field such as that, even&#xD;
      though the majority of seropositive recipients will not develop hCMV infection, all of them&#xD;
      will still receive an intense and costly monitoring for viremia, and that, although a large&#xD;
      majority of patients receiving prophylactic treatment will not develop infection upon&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation, continuing such prophylactic antiviral treatment is being proposed&#xD;
      across the clinical transplantation community, suggesting that immune surveillance of the&#xD;
      risk of developing a post-transplant hCMV infection is currently very poor in clinical&#xD;
      practice. It is well established that memory/effector T-cells play a pivotal role in&#xD;
      controlling general viral replication and survival, particularly for hCMV. Even though it has&#xD;
      been reported that cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells can be activated by a myriad of immunogenic hCMV&#xD;
      viral proteins, the predominant and most robust response is directed at the immediate early&#xD;
      antigen-1 (IE-1) and phosphoprotein 65 (pp65), which is thought to play a critical role in&#xD;
      controlling hCMV replication. Recently published studies suggest that such cellular response&#xD;
      is even important for the control and prevention of infection after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All such publications, however, refer to the post-transplantation period while patients are&#xD;
      under the effects of chronic immunosuppressive therapy and evaluate the T-cell response using&#xD;
      assays hardly applicable to routine clinical practice. Even though available, such assays are&#xD;
      not used in routine clinical practice to evaluate the hCMV-specific immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most precise functional assays to assess both memory cell and humoral responses&#xD;
      under evaluation is the interferon-γ ELISPOT assay. This assay measures antigen-specific&#xD;
      memory response frequency by individual cells as they become stimulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent work in transplantation has established that the detection of highly alloreactive&#xD;
      circulating donor-specific T-cells by ELISPOT offers prognostic value when assessing the risk&#xD;
      of acute rejection or chronic post-transplant graft dysfunction. Likewise, ELISPOT has been&#xD;
      shown to be able to detect highly reactive hCMV-specific T-cells associated with a lower risk&#xD;
      of viral infection with both sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator group has recently published that low frequency rates of specific hCMV&#xD;
      (IE-1) T-cells before transplantation identify renal transplant recipients at a higher risk&#xD;
      of post-transplant hCMV infection with precision, regardless of the therapeutic strategy&#xD;
      adopted against hCMV. Remarkably, the same results were observed in patients receiving&#xD;
      induction therapy with polyclonal antibodies (Thymoglobuline ®). The investigator thus&#xD;
      believes that such an assay approach would allow to identify with precision those patients at&#xD;
      risk of developing an infection regardless of their hCMV serology status.&#xD;
