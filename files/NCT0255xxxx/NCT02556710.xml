      A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Study To Evaluate The Efficacy And Safety Of&#xD;
      An Intra-Articular Injection Of AMPION™ In Adults With Pain Due to Osteoarthritis Of The Knee&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary trial objective is to evaluate the efficacy of 4 mL of AMPION™ versus 4 mL&#xD;
      placebo intra-articular (IA) injection in improving knee pain, when administered to subjects&#xD;
      suffering from OA of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary trial objective is evaluation of the safety of an intra-articular injection of&#xD;
      AMPION™.&#xD;

    <description>The primary trial objective is to evaluate the efficacy of 4 mL Ampion™ versus 4 mL placebo intra-articular (IA) injection in improving knee pain, when administered to subjects suffering from OA of the knee. Efficacy will be evaluated using the 5-Likert scale to assess change in WOMAC A from Baseline to Week 12.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Must be ambulatory;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Index knee must be symptomatic for greater than 6 months with a clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
             OA and supported by radiological evidence (Kellgren Lawrence Grade II to IV) read by a&#xD;
             central reader;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOMAC 5-point Likert pain subscale &lt;1.5 in the contralateral knee;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate to moderately-severe OA pain in the index knee (rating of at least 1.5 on the&#xD;
             WOMAC Index 3.1 5-point Likert Pain Subscale);&#xD;

          -  Moderate to moderately-severe OA pain in the index knee (even if chronic doses of&#xD;
