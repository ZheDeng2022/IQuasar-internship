      Protocol Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will investigate whether a suspected lung protective ventilator therapy in&#xD;
      connection with surgery for cancer of the prostate (prostate) have a relevant beneficial&#xD;
      effects on lung function, renal function and circulation associated with keyhole surgery&#xD;
      performed with surgical robot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is a randomized study (randomized controlled trials), which are drawn between&#xD;
      normal and a suspected lung protective ventilator treatment in connection with the surgical&#xD;
      removal of the prostate due to Cancers. Before the operation, collected urine and blood&#xD;
      samples and that a study of lung function and circulation as a starting point. During the&#xD;
      operation, and in the following two days collected urine and blood samples. Prepare&#xD;
      Furthermore, new studies of lung function and circulation. Blood tests and lung function&#xD;
      studied also in outpatient control about 1 week after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups of patients (for respectively normal respiratory therapy and suspected lung&#xD;
      protective) compared subsequent terms. Impact on lung function, renal function and&#xD;
      circulation as well as the number and severity of any complications compared to assess&#xD;
      whether the suspected lung protective ventilator therapy is safe and provides adequate&#xD;
      beneficial effect to introduce as standard in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue sampling used in the form of blood tests or urine tests MHP research biobank in the&#xD;
      experiment. This tissue will be used for analyzes in the specific project and the tissue will&#xD;
      be destroyed after current guidelines for project completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects and risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are at every blood sampling a small risk of infection and bleeding. Using standard&#xD;
      sterile technique. Blood volume removed by blood tests is max of 250 ml in total. Removing&#xD;
      this amount of blood does not entail health risks in patients. There may be discomfort around&#xD;
      the injection site, the needle drop is wrong in the arm, but using standard sterile technique&#xD;
      and dropped down by experienced personnel. Blood samples for the experiment performed during&#xD;
      routine blood sampling equipment as specified in the department's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For lung studies will in some cases could be detected a certain constriction of the small&#xD;
      branches of the airways (bronchi). To determine whether this is a condition may require&#xD;
      treatment given ally a spray to suck, which aims to expand the branches in order to improve&#xD;
      lung function. This medication can cause slight transient dizziness and palpitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disadvantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The additional lung examinations in the study will attempt established in connection with the&#xD;
      patient's usual attendance and stay at the hospital to avoid extra visits. There must be&#xD;
      calculated some extra time spent for outpatient visits in connection with participation in&#xD;
      the trial. There is no economic disadvantages associated with the trial for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no economic disadvantages associated with the trial for the patient. Funding for the&#xD;
      project will be done through a joint financing by the Urology Department D, Department of&#xD;
      Anesthesiology and University Clinic for Kidney disease and high blood pressure, Hospital&#xD;
      West and Aarhus University. Research funds will be sought from public and private funds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication of trial results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results, both positive and negative findings, will be made published in internationally&#xD;
      recognized scientific journal anonymously with no personally identifiable data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Ethics statement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project reported to the Ethical Science Council at the Central Denmark Region. Database&#xD;
      for the project must be approved by the Data Protection Agency by Region of Central. The&#xD;
      project is started only after the approval of these two bodies. The project will comply with&#xD;
      applicable GCP rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First contacting the patient about the project via the operator, Urology Department, at the&#xD;
      information interview on operation. If the patient wants to get further information about the&#xD;
      project handed out written information and project manager contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The written information consists of: Participant Information, consent form, &quot;Information for&#xD;
      subjects&quot; and &quot;Your Rights as a test subject in a biomedical research.&quot; The patient is&#xD;
      informed both in writing and orally on the right and the opportunity to bring legal counsel&#xD;
      to informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project manager or his representative hold subsequent information interview about 7 days&#xD;
      before surgery. This will last approximately 30 minutes. Information being conducted in&#xD;
      consultation room at the clinic, where there is no other activity in the allocated room&#xD;
      during the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesia controller or his deputy hold right now usual anesthesia monitoring and&#xD;
      ensuring written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the oral information, patients will be informed that there is a request to participate in&#xD;
      a biomedical research. Patients are informed acc. the guidelines in &quot;Guidelines for review,&#xD;
      etc. of a biomedical research for the ethics committee system &quot;from the Central Scientific&#xD;
      Ethical Committee. Information is provided for the experiment, as listed in Annex 1&#xD;
      &quot;Information for volunteers.&quot; The subjects, who wish to participate are advised that, if they&#xD;
      wish, can get consideration before submitting their written consent to participate in&#xD;
      research is voluntary, and that they will always be able to draw a committed participation&#xD;
      back .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were informed that they will receive information on the results achieved by&#xD;
      research reporting on the project if they are interested in this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent given to the project manager or the anesthetic consultant or his&#xD;
      deputy in the project in connection with the information interview, journal recording and&#xD;
      anesthesia monitoring. The subjects signed concent- and proxy statement, which is kept by the&#xD;
      Data Protection Agency guidelines. A copy provided to the subject.&#xD;
