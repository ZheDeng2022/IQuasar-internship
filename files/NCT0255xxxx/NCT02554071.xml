      SYNOPSIS - Manitoba Pharmacist Initiated Smoking Cessation Program Overview Background The&#xD;
      Manitoba government supports the role of the pharmacist as an integral part of the primary&#xD;
      health care team delivering quality care and service to Manitobans. The role of the&#xD;
      Pharmacist is ever evolving and expanding to meet the needs of their clients including&#xD;
      comprehensive medication therapy management and expanded preventative expert. Community&#xD;
      pharmacists are one of the most accessible health care professionals and provide a wide range&#xD;
      of clinical services in the neighborhoods, towns, and cities across this province.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the Manitoba government's wellness initiative, the government is strategically&#xD;
      committed towards reducing the use of tobacco through public policy. Smoking is one of the&#xD;
      leading causes of death in Manitoba and the use of tobacco is responsible for more than 50%&#xD;
      of lung, respiratory, and oral cancers and a substantial factor in cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      While decreases in smoking rates have been achieved in recent years, Manitoba continues to&#xD;
      exceed the national average of 17.3%, ranking the province with the third highest smoking&#xD;
      prevalence. Manitoba' current smoking rates warrant continued efforts to reduce smoking in&#xD;
      youth and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While many believe smoking to be lifestyle choice it is also known to be a changeable&#xD;
      lifestyle behavior and a significant determinant of health. It is also known to be a serious&#xD;
      addiction that is very difficult to overcome both physically and emotionally. As part of&#xD;
      Manitoba's targeted approach to smoking cessation, a partnership has been forged to develop&#xD;
      and implement the pilot program: Manitoba Pharmacist Initiated Smoking Cessation Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The role of the pharmacist can best be described as underutilized and often an&#xD;
      under recognized resource in smoking cessation programs. For individuals who smoke, many find&#xD;
      smoking cessation overwhelming and difficult without assistance, including smoking cessation&#xD;
      drugs and ongoing support and counselling. Many pharmacists have received additional&#xD;
      knowledge and training specifically for initiating and monitoring a smoking cessation for&#xD;
      individual clients. The Manitoba Pharmacist Smoking Cessation Program will provide access for&#xD;
      100 clients to the vital components necessary to quit smoking. Lower socioeconomic status is&#xD;
      associated with higher rates of smoking. The Manitoba Employment and Income Assistance&#xD;
      program provides support for lower income individuals in Manitoba. This smoking cessation&#xD;
      program is a controlled pilot study providing clients with the most appropriate smoking&#xD;
      cessation drugs along with the benefit of one to one pharmacist support and counselling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking Cessation Program Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following are the program objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish a provincial pilot smoking cessation program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce the number of Manitobans who smoke&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enhance utilization of the pharmacist in preventative health care delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program Scope A. Target Population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  100 Manitoba residents over the age of 18 who are Manitoba Employment and Income&#xD;
           Assistance active program participants as of January 01, 2014&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide written consent to participate in a smoking cessation program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Agree to participate in the counselling sessions and smoking cessation behavior&#xD;
           readiness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Agree to participate in an evaluative process and follow up study&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Participation Provider (Pharmacy and pharmacist)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pharmacy/Pharmacists - Up to fifteen pharmacies throughout Manitoba who employ&#xD;
           pharmacists professionally trained in QUIT and/or Catalyst, have previous experience&#xD;
           providing smoking cessation services to patients, who are willing and able to commit to&#xD;
           pilot project timelines, and who receive pharmacy manager approval will be eligible to&#xD;
           apply to participate in this program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In December 2013, MPhA will distribute application forms to each pharmacy for their&#xD;
           voluntary consideration for participation and response to the call for applications.&#xD;
           Each application form consists of a letter of introduction to explain the program and&#xD;
           application process, a pharmacist manager application form, and pharmacist application&#xD;
           form(s). The MPhA is the provincial regulatory body for pharmacists and pharmacies in&#xD;
           Manitoba and thus has access to all pharmacy contact information. MPhA has agreed to&#xD;
           utilize their mailing list and distribution system to communicate with all pharmacies in&#xD;
           the province to ensure that equal access to any pharmacy and pharmacist in the province&#xD;
           is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Steering Committee will establish a Pharmacy Selection Sub-Committee to&#xD;
           confidentially review all application forms for completeness and to select suitable&#xD;
           complete a random selection process of all complete and eligible applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Up to 15 pharmacies in Manitoba who meet the provider eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
           selected by the Pharmacy Selection Sub-Committee. All applicants will receive an outcome&#xD;
           letter from the Program Manager following the selection process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Successful pharmacy applicants will receive an orientation training program in the first&#xD;
           week of January 2014 to share and educate pilot project details, participant recruitment&#xD;
           processes, program implementation processes, methodology to complete participant&#xD;
           informed consent and program surveys, evaluation requirements, and professional pharmacy&#xD;
           reimbursement processes, and participant product reimbursement options.&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Pharmacists participating as providers in the smoking cessation pilot project will be&#xD;
           responsible for identifying eligible adults within their patient population as eligible&#xD;

           contact information for access to pilot project information and independent decision&#xD;
           making for project participation.&#xD;
&#xD;

           applicant.&#xD;
&#xD;
