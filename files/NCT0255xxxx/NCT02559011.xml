  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as a valuable minimal-invasive&#xD;
      treatment option in patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve (AV) stenosis at&#xD;
      prohibitive or increased risk for conventional open-heart surgery. Recent randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials reported a large treatment effect of TAVI over medical treatment among inoperable&#xD;
      patients and similar or superior outcomes compared with surgical aortic valve replacement in&#xD;
      high to intermediate risk patients. However, atrio-ventricular conduction disturbances and&#xD;
      arrhythmias (in particular atrial fibrillation) before, during or after TAVI remain a matter&#xD;
      of concern as they have important consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate the incidence, nature and prognostic&#xD;
      significance of AV-conduction disturbances and arrhythmias among patients with severe,&#xD;
      symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI before, during and after the procedure using a&#xD;
      small implantable cardiac monitoring system (ICM; Medtronic REVEAL LinQTM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred patients will be enrolled in this study. Prior to TAVI (at least 4 weeks), at the&#xD;
      time of preprocedural hemodynamic and anatomical assessment, the ICM will be inserted under&#xD;
      the skin of the chest under local anesthesia. The device will be interrogated just prior to&#xD;
      readmission for TAVI and thereafter at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. The incidence of&#xD;
      symptomatic as well as silent brady- and tachyarrhythmias will be recorded, and its impact on&#xD;
      medical and device treatment as well as clinical outcomes analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will provide information about the actual incidence and impact of&#xD;
      symptomatic and silent arrhythmias and AV-conduction disturbances among patients with severe,&#xD;
      symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI. Specifically, the study estimate the burden of&#xD;
      arrhythmias before TAVI and to accurately determine the incidence of new onset atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation and complete AV-block within 12 months after the procedure. Identifying patients&#xD;
      at risk for AV- conduction abnormalities, atrial fibrillation (AF), and non-sustained or&#xD;
      sustained ventricular arrhythmias may guide future preventive measures, medical treatment and&#xD;
      improve patients outcomes after TAVI.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAVI has emerged as a valuable minimal-invasive treatment option in patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      severe aortic valve stenosis at prohibitive or increased risk for conventional open-heart&#xD;
      surgery. AV conduction disturbances and arrhythmias before, during or after TAVI remain a&#xD;
      matter of concern as they have consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to TAVI the ICM will be inserted under the skin of the chest under local anesthesia.&#xD;
      The device will be interrogated just prior to readmission for TAVI and thereafter at 1, 3, 6,&#xD;
      and 12 months of follow-up. The incidence of symptomatic as well as silent brady- and&#xD;
      tachyarrhythmias will be recorded, and its impact on medical and device treatment as well as&#xD;
      clinical outcomes analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI at the institution&#xD;
      irrespective selected bioprosthesis will be included in the study. Final decision on&#xD;
      eligibility will be made by the local Heart Team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the incidence, nature and prognostic significance of AV-conduction&#xD;
      disturbances and arrhythmias among patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis&#xD;
      undergoing TAVI before, during and after the procedure using a small implantable cardiac&#xD;
      monitoring system (ICM; Medtronic REVEAL LinQTM). The primary endpoint of the study is to&#xD;
      establish the incidence of new onset atrial fibrillation and complete AV-block within 12&#xD;
      months after TAVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this prospective, observational study. Prior to TAVI (at least 4 weeks), at the&#xD;
      time of preprocedural hemodynamic and anatomical assessment, the ICM will be inserted under&#xD;
      the skin of the chest under local anesthesia. The device will be interrogated just prior to&#xD;
      readmission for TAVI and thereafter at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. The incidence of&#xD;
      symptomatic as well as silent brady- and tachyarrhythmias will be recorded, and its impact on&#xD;
      medical and device treatment as well as clinical outcomes analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is observational: the patients will not be assigned to a specific intervention.&#xD;
      Patients consenting will be monitored using a specific device that has been approved for&#xD;
      market release. The objective of the study is to use the information obtained with this&#xD;
      monitoring device to assess the incidence, nature and prognostic significance of&#xD;
      atrioventricular conduction disturbances and arrhythmias among patients with severe,&#xD;
      symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation before, during&#xD;
      and after the procedure. The objective of the study is not to investigate the performance of&#xD;
      the monitoring device.&#xD;
