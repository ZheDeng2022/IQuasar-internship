      The Invisalign® System consists of a series of clear plastic aligners that are intended to&#xD;
      replace conventional wire and bracket technology for many orthodontic cases. Each custom&#xD;
      manufactured aligner exerts gentle, continuous forces to move teeth incrementally from their&#xD;
      original state to a final, treated state. Each aligner is worn for about two weeks, then&#xD;
      replaced by the next in the series until the final position is achieved. For years,&#xD;
      orthodontists and dentists have used removable appliances for orthodontic treatment. Today,&#xD;
      with the application of computer technology and custom manufacturing, Invisalign treats a&#xD;
      broader range of cases with greater precision.&#xD;

    <measure>Total Treatment Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Total treatment time was measured in days. The less days a subject was in treatment, the better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Refinement</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of Refinement was how often subjects in each cohort required additional aligners in (in addition to their originally prescribed aligners) to treat the malocclusion. For example, if a subject was originally prescribed 20 aligners for treatment, but then needed 10 more aligners, the 10 extra aligners would be considered the &quot;refinement.&quot; The Rate of Refinement for each cohort was measured as the total number of additional aligners required to complete orthodontic treatment divided by the total number of aligners that were initially prescribed to complete treatment, multiplied by 100. The smaller the rate of refinement (%), the better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction.</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>(Observational, not used in data analysis). Subjects filled out a Quality of Life Survey with a scale rating of 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy) on how easy the product was to use and their orthodontic experience to date. A higher score on the scale meant a better outcome.</description>

        <description>Rate of Refinement was how often subjects in each cohort required additional aligners in (in addition to their originally prescribed aligners) to treat the malocclusion. For example, if a subject was originally prescribed 20 aligners for treatment, but then needed 10 more aligners, the 10 extra aligners would be considered the &quot;refinement.&quot; The Rate of Refinement for each cohort was measured as the total number of additional aligners required to complete orthodontic treatment divided by the total number of aligners that were initially prescribed to complete treatment, multiplied by 100. The smaller the rate of refinement (%), the better.</description>

Invisalign: The Invisalign® System consists of a series of clear plastic aligners that are intended to replace conventional wire and bracket technology for many orthodontic cases. Each custom manufactured aligner exerts gentle, continuous forces to move teeth incrementally from their original state to a final, treated state. Each aligner is worn for a defined period of time , then replaced by the next in the series until the final position is achieved. For years, orthodontists and dentists have used removable appliances for orthodontic treatment. Today, with the application of computer technology and custom manufacturing, Invisalign treats a broader range of cases with greater precision.</description>

          <title>Rate of Refinement</title>
          <description>Rate of Refinement was how often subjects in each cohort required additional aligners in (in addition to their originally prescribed aligners) to treat the malocclusion. For example, if a subject was originally prescribed 20 aligners for treatment, but then needed 10 more aligners, the 10 extra aligners would be considered the &quot;refinement.&quot; The Rate of Refinement for each cohort was measured as the total number of additional aligners required to complete orthodontic treatment divided by the total number of aligners that were initially prescribed to complete treatment, multiplied by 100. The smaller the rate of refinement (%), the better.</description>
