  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of training Head Start staff to discuss&#xD;
      tobacco use, shs reduction and cessation in their existing encounters with parents in&#xD;
      reducing tobacco use and exposure. Understanding the facilitators and barriers to integrating&#xD;
      the intervention into the Head Start system will support future efforts to address tobacco&#xD;
      use and exposure in families with small children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parental smoking increases children's risk of asthma, infectious illness, sudden infant death&#xD;
      syndrome (SIDS), and other conditions. Accumulating evidence regarding the adverse effects of&#xD;
      total smoke exposure (TSE) led the US Surgeon General to conclude that there is no safe level&#xD;
      of TSE. Parents who smoke endanger themselves, put their children and spouses at risk for&#xD;
      adverse health outcomes, and increase the chance of their children becoming smokers. However,&#xD;
      many parents who smoke are undertreated for their tobacco addiction. Many parents who smoke&#xD;
      are of the age where they have few contacts with primary care physicians and are often&#xD;
      unexposed to counseling and pharmacotherapy offered to older patients. Strategically&#xD;
      identifying sites where trained para-professionals routinely interact with parents who smoke&#xD;
      is vital to making inroads in this high-risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Involuntary secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) in domestic environments is an entirely&#xD;
      preventable public health threat that disproportionately burdens young children in&#xD;
      communities of low socioeconomic position. Research has indicated that interventions to&#xD;
      reduce SHSe for children delivered through child care settings have been effective. In&#xD;
      addition, client-centered approaches, such as motivational interviewing, have been effective&#xD;
      in helping parents to reduce levels of SHS in the home environment. Following guidelines from&#xD;
      established agencies and organizations, we will also evaluate changes in smoking cessation&#xD;
      rates among parents and staff comparing use prior to and after the training programs and&#xD;
      subsequent family service worker to parent encounters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Building on Action for Boston Community Development's (ABCD) current system efforts,&#xD;
      support the development and implementation of system changes to accurately and efficiently&#xD;
      document parental smoking and household tobacco use and exposure, using: i) intake form, ii)&#xD;
      Individual Family Plan, and iii) electronic data system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Collaborate with Legacy and University of Massachusetts (UMass) to train Head Start&#xD;
      staff in skills for encouraging smoking cessation and on a smoke-free home intervention, to&#xD;
      increase staff knowledge of second-hand smoke (SHS) effects and provide skills in&#xD;
      Motivational Interviewing. This will enhance staff confidence in engaging with parents to&#xD;
      assist in efforts to make a sustained quit attempt, reduce children's SHS exposure, and will&#xD;
      provide structure to help staff determine how best to support families on issues of tobacco&#xD;
      use, including referral to cessation services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of sites receiving the a) Motivational Interviewing&#xD;
      intervention for family service workers, b) supervisor education, and c) boosters in&#xD;
      decreasing parent smoking, reducing household tobacco use and children's SHS exposure,&#xD;
      compared with sites receiving only basic tobacco information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Evaluate the effectiveness of the smoking cessation intervention on the staff most&#xD;
      intimately involved in parent counseling-namely, the family service workers who will attend&#xD;
      the training program (s). We will evaluate their knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and smoking&#xD;
      practices as well as their confidence and skills in tobacco-related counseling.&#xD;
