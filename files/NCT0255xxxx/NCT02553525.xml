  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effects of non-regular temporal patterns of deep&#xD;
      brain stimulation (DBS) on motor symptoms and neural activity in persons with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PD), essential tremor (ET) or multiple sclerosis (MS). These data will guide the&#xD;
      design of novel stimulation patterns that may lead to more effective and reliable treatment&#xD;
      with DBS. These data will also enable evaluation of current hypotheses on the mechanisms of&#xD;
      action of DBS. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms of action of DBS may lead to&#xD;
      full development of DBS as a treatment for Parkinson's disease and may lead to future&#xD;
      applications of DBS.&#xD;

      This study will be conducted in the operating rooms at Duke University Medical Center, Emory&#xD;
      University Hospital, University of Florida Shands Hospital or the UF Health Florida Surgical&#xD;
      Center. The study will be performed during surgery on subjects who are undergoing&#xD;
      implantation of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) system during an awake procedure, or on&#xD;
      subjects who are receiving surgical replacement of the implanted pulse generator (IPG) due to&#xD;
      depleted batteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive temporary sterile extensions to the DBS electrode. These temporary&#xD;
      extensions will connect to a stimulation and recording system and allow recording of neural&#xD;
      activity. Over the course of ~45 minutes different non-regular temporal patterns of&#xD;
      stimulation will be delivered unilaterally and the effects on neural activity and movement&#xD;
      disorder symptoms will be measured. The stimulus waveform will be a charge-balanced biphasic&#xD;
      pulse, with charge restricted to values below the limit set by the DBS IPG manufacturer, 30&#xD;
      μC/cm². After the study is completed, the temporary extensions will be removed, and the&#xD;
      ordinary clinical conduct of the procedure will continue for treatment of the patient's&#xD;
      movement disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tremor will be measured using an accelerometer in subjects with essential tremor (ET),&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (MS) and tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). Bradykinesia will be&#xD;
      measured using a finger-tapping task on a computer mouse in subjects with Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      who do not have dominant tremor symptoms. Subjects will be familiarized with the motor&#xD;
      symptom evaluation tasks before surgery, and baseline measurements of tremor or bradykinesia&#xD;
      may be recorded. Further, they may be asked to discontinue use of anti-parkinsonian and/or&#xD;
      anti-tremor medications overnight prior to the study, to reduce variability of motor symptoms&#xD;
      due to the time course of medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No general anesthesia will be given to subjects during surgery, and the procedure will be&#xD;
      performed under local anesthesia to allow subjects to perform the tasks required in this&#xD;
      study. Further, no sedation will be given to subjects receiving a replacement IPG, which can&#xD;
      cause minor discomfort or anxiety in some patients. Subjects undergoing surgery for electrode&#xD;
      implantation will receive monitored anesthesia care (MAC), in which sedation will be&#xD;
      administered as needed, such that subjects are still responsive and pathological motor&#xD;
      symptoms (tremor or bradykinesia) are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery, the subject's pre-operative MRI and post-operative high-resolution CT&#xD;
      scans may be used to determine the location of DBS electrode contacts within the brain.&#xD;
      However, participation in the study will not modify imaging procedures needed for standard&#xD;
      care, and placement of the electrode during DBS implant surgery will not be altered by the&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no additional costs to subjects as a result of being in this study. Additional&#xD;
      operating room costs will be covered by institutional and/or grant resources.&#xD;

    <description>Tremor responses to deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be recorded by an accelerometer in subjects with essential tremor (ET), multiple sclerosis (MS) and tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). Tremor will be quantified by calculating the total power within a window of the power spectrum of the time series of the tremor, and this measure will be compared across stimulation patterns.</description>

    <description>During deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode implantation or implanted pulse generator (IPG) replacement surgery, different stimulation patterns that are designed to suppress oscillatory neural activity at theta- or beta-frequencies will be delivered in randomized order, and the subject will be blinded to the patterns. Neural activity and/or motor symptoms (tremor and/or bradykinesia) will be measured in response to DBS. Measurements will be made during 2- to 8-minute trials, in which stimulation will be off for the first half of the trial, and on for the remaining half. Neural activity and/or motor symptoms will be measured during both the off and on phases. The total amount of time necessary for data collection will be about 45 minutes.</description>
