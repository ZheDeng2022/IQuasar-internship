  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose range finding study in&#xD;
      subjects who have diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). The study will enroll approximately&#xD;
      24 subjects. Subjects will be randomized to receive one of 3 treatments: PDA-002 (3 x 10^6&#xD;
      cells), PDA-002 (30 x 10^6 cells), or placebo (vehicle control) in a 1:1:1 randomization&#xD;
      approach. Investigational product or placebo will be administered monthly (3 administrations&#xD;
      total on Study Days 1, 29, and 57).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo a Screening Period (up to 28 days in duration) to determine study&#xD;
      eligibility and baseline levels of signs and symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)&#xD;
      will be established. Subjects will then enter a Treatment Period (6 months in duration).&#xD;
      During the Treatment Period, subjects will be evaluated on an ongoing basis (at 8 scheduled&#xD;
      study visits). Subjects will receive intramuscular (IM) injections of investigational product&#xD;
      (IP) on Study Days 1, 29, and 57 as fifteen 0.30 mL injections (below the knee and above the&#xD;
      ankle) in one lower extremity in a blinded manner. After completing the Treatment Period,&#xD;
      subjects will enter the Follow-up Period where they will continue to be evaluated at&#xD;
      scheduled study visits over the subsequent months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis of all study data will occur after the last subject has completed Visit 9 (Month&#xD;
      6) and after the last scheduled study visit.&#xD;
