  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics for the&#xD;
      Diagnosis and Management of Acute Bacterial Sinusitis recommends that the diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      sinusitis is made when symptoms of an upper respiratory infection (URI) persist beyond 10&#xD;
      days without showing signs of improvement (persistent presentation), when symptoms appear to&#xD;
      worsen (on the 6th to 10th day) after a period of improvement (worsening presentation), or&#xD;
      when both high fever and purulent nasal discharge are present concurrently for at least 3&#xD;
      consecutive days (severe presentation). In studies to date, children with persistent and&#xD;
      worsening presentations comprise &gt;95% of cases. The investigators preliminary data and the&#xD;
      available literature suggest that only a subset of children being diagnosed with acute&#xD;
      sinusitis on the basis of current criteria are likely to have bacterial disease. This is not&#xD;
      entirely surprising because current criteria rely solely on the duration and the quality of&#xD;
      respiratory tract symptoms (which are both common and non-specific). Accordingly, it seems&#xD;
      likely that many children currently being diagnosed as having acute sinusitis actually have&#xD;
      an uncomplicated upper respiratory infection. This is important because acute sinusitis is&#xD;
      one of the most common diagnoses for which antimicrobials are prescribed for children in the&#xD;
      United States, accounting for 7.9 million prescriptions annually. A critical need thus exists&#xD;
      to establish which subgroups of children currently being diagnosed with acute sinusitis&#xD;
      actually benefit from antimicrobial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to determine whether certain subgroups of children with acute&#xD;
      sinusitis exist in whom antibiotic therapy can be appropriately withheld. This objective will&#xD;
      be achieved by conducting a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial in children 2 to 12 years of age with persistent or worsening presentations of acute&#xD;
      sinusitis. Based on the investigators preliminary data, the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      only certain subgroups of children currently being treated for acute sinusitis actually&#xD;
      benefit from antimicrobial therapy. By identifying, in a large placebo-controlled trial,&#xD;
      subgroups of children who respectively do and do not benefit from antimicrobial therapy, the&#xD;
      investigators will be better able to determine which children should be classified as having&#xD;
      acute bacterial sinusitis. Accordingly, the results of this trial may impact not only the&#xD;
      treatment guidelines for acute sinusitis but also the diagnostic criteria, and will help&#xD;
      ensure that, to the extent possible, antibiotic use is limited to appropriate patients. This,&#xD;
      in turn, will maximize the likelihood of achieving optimal outcomes and minimize the risk of&#xD;
      promoting antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
