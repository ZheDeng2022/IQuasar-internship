    <textblock>
      After a hospitalization, dialysis patients have a high risk of being admitted to the hospital&#xD;
      again within 30 days. The purpose of this research study is to test a new way of reducing the&#xD;
      chance of patients being hospitalized again. In this study investigator will evaluate a&#xD;
      checklist driven evaluation upon return to the dialysis facility as a method to reduce the&#xD;
      rate of rehospitalizations in hemodialysis patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are an excessive number of 30 day readmissions after hospital discharges of dialysis&#xD;
      patients in the U.S. (35.2%). Investigators recent research has found that approximately 2/3&#xD;
      of these readmissions are potentially avoidable. Investigators believe that among the causes&#xD;
      for the excessive number of readmissions, the most important may be that patients usually do&#xD;
      not receive a clinical assessment upon return to dialysis after a hospitalization. An all too&#xD;
      common practice in the U.S. is for the nephrologist to not see the patient but to give verbal&#xD;
      orders to the dialysis nurse to resume previous orders. This increases readmission risk in&#xD;
      that there are a number of key clinical processes that if completed on return to dialysis&#xD;
      might greatly reduce rehospitalization risk. Nephrologists are often not available to see&#xD;
      patients in the peri-discharge period, but there is a trend towards an increasing number of&#xD;
      U.S. dialysis facilities now having nurse practitioners (NP) working in the units.&#xD;
      Investigators believe that NPs using a checklist can conduct a post-discharge clinical&#xD;
      encounter that would allow for key care processes to be carried out and to direct telephone&#xD;
      communication with the treating nephrologist. Our objective is to reduce the risk of dialysis&#xD;
      patient readmissions within 30 days through the use of this intervention. Our research&#xD;
      question is whether this intervention would be effective for reducing 30 day readmission&#xD;
      risk. Our hypothesis is that the intervention will prove to be more effective then usual care&#xD;
      for reducing 30 day readmission risk.&#xD;

    <description>Within 96 hours of hospital discharge an Nurse Practitioner will perform a checklist guided assessment to preventing rehospitalizations. The assessment consists of the following:&#xD;
The participants's hospital course will be reviewed and their clinical recovery and stability assessed.&#xD;
Determination of the participants's estimated dry weight (EDW).&#xD;
The participants's post discharge medications will be checked, compared to the prehospitalization medication, and discrepancies will be reviewed and corrected.&#xD;
Blood tests will be ordered for the participants's first return dialysis treatment if medically appropriate after clinical assessment.&#xD;
Write new dialysis orders.&#xD;
Dialysis Access- review access and determine any changes required in treatment</description>
