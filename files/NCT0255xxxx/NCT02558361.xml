      Apremilast (Otezla®) is a Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for psoriatic&#xD;
      arthritis and psoriasis. Although there are a lot of data demonstrating how apremilast works&#xD;
      in the laboratory, there are very few demonstrating how it works in the actual target organ,&#xD;
      i.e. the skin or synovial (joint) tissue in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory data has demonstrated that apremilast decreases inflammatory proteins and&#xD;
      increases anti-inflammatory proteins. However, almost all of these data/studies have been&#xD;
      performed on the blood of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, not the skin or&#xD;
      synovial (joint) tissue. These studies that have been performed on the blood of patients with&#xD;
      this condition may, or may not, reflect the true response to therapy in the synovial (joint)&#xD;
      tissue and/or skin.&#xD;

      Purpose of the study Apremilast (Otezla®) is a Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approved&#xD;
      treatment for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. Although there are a lot of data&#xD;
      demonstrating how apremilast works in the laboratory, there are very few demonstrating how it&#xD;
      works in the actual target organ, i.e. the skin or synovial (joint) tissue in patients with&#xD;
      psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory data has demonstrated that apremilast decreases inflammatory proteins and&#xD;
      increases anti-inflammatory proteins. However, almost all of these data/studies have been&#xD;
      performed on the blood of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, not the skin or&#xD;
      synovial (joint) tissue. These studies that have been performed on the blood of patients with&#xD;
      this condition may, or may not, reflect the true response to therapy in the synovial (joint)&#xD;
      tissue and/or skin. They also provide no data regarding the timing of response in the target&#xD;
      organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of these limitations in the existing literature, a study assessing the response to&#xD;
      apremilast in synovial (joint) tissue and skin is needed. This will be a small study&#xD;
      assessing the inflammatory response in the synovial (joint) tissue and skin samples from&#xD;
      patients with psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. These data will be very important in&#xD;
      demonstrating the effect of apremilast on the target organ tissues; i.e. synovial (joint)&#xD;
      tissue and skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are asking you to take part in this research study because you have both psoriasis and&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis. Both conditions are active and you are an appropriate candidate to be&#xD;
      treated with apremilast, i.e. this same treatment would be offered to you if you were not to&#xD;
      enroll in this study. You are also an appropriate candidate to receive skin and synovial&#xD;
      (joint) tissue biopsies. We want to find out how specific proteins in your skin and synovial&#xD;
      (joint) tissue that are responsible for the inflammation associated with psoriasis and&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis respond to treatment with apremilast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: What will happen during this study?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of three study visits over a period of three months. If appropriate,&#xD;
      you will be started on apremilast at your first study visit. This is part of your standard of&#xD;
      care. The dose of apremilast you will receive will be the normal FDA-approved dose. You will&#xD;
      not receive a placebo (sugar) pill. Everyone who participates in the study will be treated&#xD;
      with apremilast. The study procedures that will take place at each of the three visits are&#xD;
      listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review inclusion/exclusion criteria Medical history obtained by the study nurse A physical&#xD;
      examination by the study doctor Obtain blood and urine samples with psoriatic arthritis and&#xD;
      psoriasis. These data will be very important in demonstrating the effect of apremilast on the&#xD;
      target organ tissues; i.e. synovial (joint) tissue and skin.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Must be in general good health (except for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis) as&#xD;
             judged by the Investigator, based on medical history, physical examination, clinical&#xD;
             laboratories, and urinalysis. (NOTE: The definition of good health means a subject&#xD;
             does not have uncontrolled significant co-morbid conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients at least 18 years of age with PsA (must meet CASPAR Criteria) and PsO.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active knee synovitis (target joint)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active psoriatic plaque (target skin lesion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Not currently taking or previously on Otezla&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Cannot be on concurrent biologics&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative pregnancy test at&#xD;
             Baseline. While on investigational product and for at least 28 days after taking the&#xD;
             last dose of investigational product, FCBP who engage in activity in which conception&#xD;
             is possible must use one of the approved contraceptive§ options described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Option 1: Any one of the following highly effective methods: hormonal contraception (oral,&#xD;
        injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring); intrauterine device (IUD); tubal&#xD;
        ligation; or partner's vasectomy; OR Option 2: Male or female condom (latex condom or&#xD;
        nonlatex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]; PLUS&#xD;
        one additional barrier method: (a) diaphragm with spermicide; (b) cervical cap with&#xD;
        spermicide; or (c) contraceptive sponge with spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) who engage in activity in which&#xD;
        conception is possible must use barrier contraception (male latex condom or nonlatex condom&#xD;
        NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]) while on&#xD;
        investigational product and for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational&#xD;
        product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        † A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who 1) has not undergone a&#xD;
        hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral oophorectomy (the surgical&#xD;
        removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive&#xD;
        months (that is, has had menses at any time during the preceding 24 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        § The female subject's chosen form of contraception must be effective by the time the&#xD;
        female subject is randomized into the study (for example, hormonal contraception should be&#xD;
        initiated at least 28 days before randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Other than psoriatic arthritis, any clinically significant (as determined by the&#xD;
                  Investigator) cardiac, endocrinologic, pulmonary, neurologic, psychiatric,&#xD;
                  hepatic, renal, hematologic, immunologic disease, or other major disease that is&#xD;
                  currently uncontrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which would&#xD;
                  place the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Prior history of suicide attempt at any time in the subject's life time prior to&#xD;
                  screening or randomization, or major psychiatric illness requiring&#xD;
                  hospitalization within the last 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Active substance abuse or a history of substance abuse within 6 months prior to&#xD;
                  Screening.&#xD;
