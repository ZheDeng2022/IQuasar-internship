      The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential factors that determine&#xD;
      preschool obesity in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates, and assess the effectiveness of a simple&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle tool: Eat Right Emirates (ERE) adapted from the Ten Steps for Healthy&#xD;
      Toddlers, produced in the UK by the Infant and Toddler Forum.&#xD;

      Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify social, developmental and dietary risk factors, which&#xD;
      predispose to obesity in preschool Emirati children and to assess the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      simple healthy lifestyle tool: Eat Right Emirates (ERE) adapted from the Ten Steps for&#xD;
      Healthy Toddlers, produced in the UK by the Infant and Toddler Forum using an RCT study&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do dietary patterns influence obesity risk in Emirati children aged 3-4 years?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are dietary and other behaviours associated with obesity risk in Kuwaiti preschool&#xD;
           children?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Are developmental factors, associated with obesity risk in Emirati preschool children?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Does a healthy lifestyle intervention improve eating behaviour and physical activity in&#xD;
      Emirati preschool children?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determinants of obesity in children aged 3-4 years attending preschool centres in UAE will be&#xD;
      investigated within a cross-sectional observation study. Dietary intake will be assessed&#xD;
      using food records and questionnaires. These will be analysed to give information on dietary&#xD;
      patterns and nutritional intake. Developmental factors, such as infant feeding and growth&#xD;
      patterns and other lifestyle behaviours that may influence obesity risk, such as physical&#xD;
      activity and food related behaviours, will also be evaluated using questionnaires. Obesity&#xD;
      will be assessed using non-invasive methods to measure body size and fatness. Risk factors&#xD;
      for CVD including blood pressure and pulse wave velocity will also be assessed using&#xD;
      non-invasive methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same infants and mothers will be followed-up one year later to allow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigation into tracking of risk factors in preschool children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study of the impact of risk factors on change in BMI during the preschool period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort will then provide a resource to investigate the determinants of obesity in&#xD;
      preschool children from UAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population of preschool children will be recruited from an existing sub-sample of&#xD;
      parents who took part in a previous study in Al Ain district, Abu Dhabi. The study population&#xD;
      will therefore be representative of the general Emirati population. Parents will be contacted&#xD;
      prior to the study, with permission from the Ministry of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential determinants of obesity in preschool Emirati children (exposures) and effects&#xD;
      on obesity and risk factors for CVD (outcomes) will be investigated as detailed below. Data&#xD;
      will be collected at baseline and at follow up one year later. All measurements will be&#xD;
      undertaken by trained team members and performed according to the UCL CNRC standard&#xD;
      operational procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All testing procedures will take place on the school premises with parents present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposures investigated in this study include growth patterns, infant/child feeding practices,&#xD;
      dietary patterns, appetite characteristics and dietary behaviours .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Patterns and Intake&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary patterns in mothers and children will be assessed using a food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire (FFQ). Mothers will also be asked to complete a 5-day food diary representative&#xD;
      of their child's usual diet at study baseline and one-year follow up. Diaries will be&#xD;
      analysed for all nutrients with UK dietary reference values using dietary analysis software&#xD;
      based on food composition data from the 6th edition of McCance and Widdowson's composition of&#xD;
      foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical History and Sociodemographic Factors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on child and parental sociodemographic characteristics and medical history will&#xD;
      be collected using questionnaires. Parental anthropometry will be measured where possible to&#xD;
      give a measure of genetic exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle Practices&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parental and child diet will be assessed using validated questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry Cardiovascular health&#xD;
