  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the effects of a low carbohydrate diet on tumor metabolism&#xD;
      in patients with head and neck cancer. A low carbohydrate diet may reduce the metabolic&#xD;
      activity of cancer cells and of surrounding supportive tissues. Studying samples of tissue&#xD;
      and blood from patients with head and neck cancer in the laboratory before and after a low&#xD;
      carbohydrate diet may help determine any changes in tumor metabolism.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the impact of a low-carbohydrate normocaloric diet on transporter of the outer&#xD;
      mitochondrial membrane subunit 20 (TOMM20) expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in&#xD;
      carcinoma cells and the impact of a low-carbohydrate normocaloric diet on monocarboxylate&#xD;
      transporter 4 (MCT4) expression in fibroblasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the feasibility of a low-carbohydrate normocaloric diet treatment in head and neck&#xD;
      carcinoma (HNC) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the effect of a low-carbohydrate normocaloric diet on the serum levels of insulin,&#xD;
      and insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 and -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the potential impact of a low-carbohydrate normocaloric diet on the following:&#xD;
      disease-free survival, distant metastases-free survival, overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the utility of cancer-derived exosomes to serve as prognostic biomarkers for&#xD;
      real-time monitoring of therapeutic efficacy and identifying early recurrence using&#xD;
      longitudinal samples from cancer patients undergoing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients follow a normocaloric, low-carbohydrate diet for 10-28 days (from the time of cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis to definitive surgical treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month, 3 months, and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 24 months.&#xD;
