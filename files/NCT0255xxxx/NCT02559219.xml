      Smart Adult Living After Childhood Cancer (SmartALACC) Online Care Plans: Feasibility and&#xD;
      Patient Satisfaction is a pilot project designed to test the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      use of an online care plan generator for adult survivors of pediatric cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of improvements in cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment, there are an estimated&#xD;
      13 million cancer survivors living in the U.S. today, with projected growth to 18 million by&#xD;
      2020 (De Moor). These survivors include survivors of leukemia and lymphoma, as well as solid&#xD;
      tumors including breast, colon, testicular and prostate cancers. It also include a subset of&#xD;
      patients who are survivors of pediatric cancers, as over 80% of children diagnosed with&#xD;
      cancer today are cured. In fact, it is estimated that 1 in every 600 young adults between the&#xD;
      ages of 20-35 is a cancer survivor (Dreyer, Hewitt, Greenlee).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer patients as a whole, despite improved cure rates, have been shown to receive&#xD;
      inadequate medical care as survivors. Comprehensive survivorship care should include routine&#xD;
      age appropriate medical care as well as information about prior diagnosis and treatment, and&#xD;
      screening for recurrence of their primary malignancy as well as secondary malignancies, and&#xD;
      screening for late effects of cancer treatment (Earle, Craig). Adult survivors of pediatric&#xD;
      cancer, exposed to life-saving but toxic treatments during times of growth and development,&#xD;
      are particularly prone to late effects but also have been shown to have inadequate monitoring&#xD;
      and follow up. This is a concern as late effects of treatment are sometimes silent for years&#xD;
      or decades after completion of cancer therapy and that adult survivors of childhood cancer,&#xD;
      years from their diagnosis and treatment, have been shown to have alarming rates of life&#xD;
      threatening chronic health conditions compared to their peers (Oeffinger). Thus, these late&#xD;
      effects may emerge during adulthood when patients have moved on from the care of their&#xD;
      primary oncologist. Complicating matters, primary care providers, who often assume the care&#xD;
      of these patients, may not have the knowledge or tools necessary to appropriately care for&#xD;
      survivors of childhood cancer (Suh).&#xD;
&#xD;
      National organizations have come together to identify ways to improve quality of and access&#xD;
      to long term follow up care for adult survivors of childhood cancer. The Children's Oncology&#xD;
      Group published Long Term Follow up guidelines which recommend lifelong risk based follow up&#xD;
      care and screening (COG guidelines). In addition, in 2005, the Institute of Medicine&#xD;
      published a report, From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition gave&#xD;
      recommendations to improve health outcomes of cancer survivors which includes the receipt of&#xD;
      a comprehensive care summary and follow up plan to aid in appropriate risk based follow up&#xD;
      care (Hewitt). Despite these recommendations childhood cancer survivors knowledge about past&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment and engagement in follow up care is suboptimal (Kaden-Lottick,&#xD;
      Nathan). It has been demonstrated that pediatric cancer survivors are not receiving care&#xD;
      summaries, and thus may try to find appropriate follow up information via the other sources&#xD;
      such as the internet (Casillas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oncolife, a free online tool to create survivorship care plans, was created in May 2007 (Hill&#xD;
      2009), and has been housed at maintained at the University of Pennsylvania since then. This&#xD;
      tool has shown to be feasible way to provide information and care plans to survivors of adult&#xD;
      cancers. In addition, survivors who have used the resource, state that it will, or has&#xD;
      already, positively influenced communication about cancer related follow up with their&#xD;
      healthcare team (Hill 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aim is to adapt Oncolife to provide individualized information for adult survivors&#xD;
      of childhood cancer with the unique recommendations for long term follow up for pediatric&#xD;
      cancer survivors. Oncolife has already been collecting data on plans created by adult&#xD;
      survivors of adult cancers and has been reviewed by the IRB previously (IRB#806368 and&#xD;
      #811528 note: previously called Oncolink). Adaption of Oncolife to meet the needs of adult&#xD;
      survivors of childhood cancer will improve access to high quality electronic health&#xD;
      information as patients may find long term follow up guidelines cumbersome or largely&#xD;
      irrelevant to their needs depending on their specific exposures. Individualizing the&#xD;
      available information to a particular survivor will allow for better understanding of and&#xD;
      improved adherence to recommended cancer related follow up care. We propose to develop&#xD;
      survivorship care plans in a way that will most benefit users, thus after creation of the&#xD;
      Smart Adult Living After Childhood Cancer care plan we will ask for patient input via survey&#xD;
      immediately after receipt of their care plan and in a one month follow up survey.&#xD;
