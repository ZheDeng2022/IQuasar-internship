      The goal of this study is to examine in-vivo the effect of intraocular (IOP) and intracranial&#xD;
      pressures (ICP) on the optic nerve head (ONH). The effect of ICP on eye health has been an&#xD;
      area of concrete research effort in recent years. The ability to acquire non-invasive and&#xD;
      highly detailed information on both the eye and the brain using technologies such as magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) have paved the way to assess&#xD;
      non-invasively the effect of ICP in-vivo. In this study, we will quantify the structural&#xD;
      changes in the ONH in subjects with elevated ICP while they are treated to reduce the&#xD;
      elevated pressure. This process will occur in a stepwise fashion over a period of time&#xD;
      determined by the clinical treatment plans. We will apply controlled pressures to the eye&#xD;
      during each step of ICP lowering while OCT images are obtained.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to examine in-vivo the effect of intraocular (IOP) and intracranial&#xD;
      pressures (ICP) on the optic nerve head (ONH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will quantify the structural changes in the ONH in subjects&#xD;
      with elevated ICP while they are treated to reduce the elevated pressure. This process will&#xD;
      occur in a stepwise fashion over a period of time determined by the clinical treatment plans.&#xD;
      The investigators will apply controlled pressures to the eye during each step of ICP lowering&#xD;
      while OCT images are obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of ICP on eye health has been an area of concrete research effort in recent years.&#xD;
      The ability to acquire non-invasive and highly detailed information on both the eye and the&#xD;
      brain using technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT) have paved the way to assess non-invasively the effect of ICP in-vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ONH separates two pressurized compartments: the eyeball and the central nervous system.&#xD;
      Situations in which ICP is elevated are often associated with papilledema, though the&#xD;
      magnitude and the rate of change in ONH elevation in response to increased ICP or the&#xD;
      reduction in ONH elevation in response to ICP treatments are yet to be determined. On the&#xD;
      opposite side, glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness where elevated IOP is the leading&#xD;
      risk factor, with clinical evidence suggesting the presence of ICP below the normal level in&#xD;
      these subjects. The impaired balance between IOP and ICP leads to the deformation of the ONH,&#xD;
      which triggers strangulation of the retinal ganglion cell axons when trespassing through the&#xD;
      lamina cribrosa within the ONH on their way from the eye to the brain, leading to gradual&#xD;
      axonal loss and irreversible visual impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about how the interaction of IOP and ICP pressure changes affect the&#xD;
      macrostructure and microstructure of the optic nerve head structure. This information has a&#xD;
      significant impact both for neurosurgical conditions with elevated ICP along with ocular&#xD;
      conditions such as glaucoma and papilledema. The ability to gauge non-invasively changes in&#xD;
      ICP will have a tremendous impact on neurosurgical management as it eliminates the need of&#xD;
      longitudinal invasive measurements of ICP. The study will also improve the investigator's&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiologic processes that lead to development of glaucoma as well&#xD;
      as the response to treatment for subjects with papilledema. A better understanding of these&#xD;
      processes will ultimately lead to improved detection and management of these conditions and a&#xD;
      better understanding of ocular bio-mechanics.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects scheduled to undergo gradual, step-wise reduction of Intracranial Pressure (ICP) will be screened.&#xD;
The Glasgow Coma Scale will be administered to ascertain the cognitive ability of the participant.&#xD;
A slit lamp examination and indirect ophthalmoscopy will be performed.&#xD;
Experimental:&#xD;
The subject's eye will be held open with an eye speculum during the exam.&#xD;
Another eye exam, which includes a slit lamp examination and indirect ophthalmoscopy, will be performed.&#xD;
Intraocular Pressure will be measured.&#xD;
An Optic Coherence Tomography (OCT) will be performed.&#xD;
At each step along the process of ICP reduction, the eye exam, IOP &amp; OCT will be performed.&#xD;
Optional:&#xD;
The Ophthalmology study team will raise the IOP using an Ophthlmodynanometer. It will be raised to 20 mmHg and 40 mmHg while OCT scans are obtained.&#xD;
OCT scans will be taken at pre-manipulation, 20mmHg, 40mmHg, and post-manipulation at each step of the ICP lowering procedure.</description>
