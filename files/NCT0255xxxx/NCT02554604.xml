      The study is design to assess if there is a correlation between diagnosis of preeclampsia and&#xD;
      its severity to changes in HDL quality, in terms of composition and function and to determine&#xD;
      whether preeclampsia-induced changes in VOCs in saliva can be used for the early diagnosis of&#xD;
      preeclampsia.&#xD;

      Scientific background Preeclampsia is a syndrome characterized by the onset of hypertension&#xD;
      and proteinuria or other end-organ dysfunction. It develops after 20 weeks of gestation and&#xD;
      can cause significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality (1,2). The pathophysiology&#xD;
      of preeclampsia is thought to be developmental abnormalities of placental vasculature leading&#xD;
      to placental under-perfusion or ischemia. This ischemia is believed to mediate the release of&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic factors into the maternal circulation, causing endothelial dysfunction,&#xD;
      hypertension and end-organ injury (2). The elemental factor that leads to the development of&#xD;
      placental vasculature abnormalities is still to be elucidated. However, histological changes&#xD;
      in the placenta include atherosis (lipid laden cells in the wall of the arteriole), fibrinoid&#xD;
      necrosis, thrombosis, sclerotic narrowing of arterioles, and placental infarction, all of&#xD;
      which are similar to findings seen in atherosclerotic plaque (1-3). Another close association&#xD;
      between the mechanisms of preeclampsia and atherosclerosis was found in large epidemiological&#xD;
      studies that demonstrated a strong correlation between preeclampsia (PET) and the development&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease later in life (4). Women with PET are more likely than those with&#xD;
      normal pregnancy to develop chronic hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes&#xD;
      and end-stage renal disease (1,4).Common atherosclerotic diseases, such as hypertension,&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypercholesterolemia and diabetes are strongly associated with&#xD;
      preeclampsia during pregnancy (5-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large epidemiologic and experimental studies have shown an association between low levels of&#xD;
      high density lipids (HDL) in the blood and increased cardiovascular risk (7). The&#xD;
      cardioprotective properties of HDL are thought to be composed of several mechanisms,&#xD;
      including regulation of endothelial functions that enhance NO production and maintaining&#xD;
      endothelial integrity, as well as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-thrombotic&#xD;
      effects (8-9). However, pharmacological studies reported that increases in plasma HDL did not&#xD;
      improve cardiovascular outcomes (10-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, emerging data have revealed the importance of the quality of the HDL more&#xD;
      than its quantity. HDL from patients with CKD was found to lose its anti-atherogenic and&#xD;
      endothelial protective effects. In a study by Shroff et al. (13), HDL from patients with CKD&#xD;
      was incubated with a primary endothelial cell line. Several endothelial functions, such as&#xD;
      reduced NO production, permission of SO production, increased VCAM-1 expression and reduction&#xD;
      of cholesterol efflux capacity were decreased compared to those of HDL from healthy&#xD;
      individuals. These effects were associated with vascular dysfunction markers in those&#xD;
      patients, such as high levels of urate, angiopoeitin and IL-6, as well as poor vascular&#xD;
      function measurements, as measured by aortic pulse velocity and carotid intima media&#xD;
      thickness. These negative functions increased as CKD severity progressed and showed a partial&#xD;
      improvement after kidney transplantation (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information regarding the composition and function of serum lipids and lipoproteins among&#xD;
      preeclamptic pregnancies compared to normal pregnancies is scarce. Early pregnancy&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, particularly hypertriglyceridemia appears to be associated with increased risk&#xD;
      of preeclampsia (14). However, equivocal results were found regarding paraoxonase 1 (PON1)&#xD;
      activity, which is an antioxidative enzyme found in HDL that inhibits low density lipid (LDL)&#xD;
      and HDL oxidation. PON1 activity is decreased in diseases associated with endothelial&#xD;
      activation and dysfunction including diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (15). Demir et al. (16) found low levels of HDL, ApoA1 and paraoxonase activity in&#xD;
      preeclamptic compared to normal pregnancies, whereas Acikgoz et al. (17) demonstrated&#xD;
      significantly higher PON1 activity in preeclamptic compared to normal pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva contains constituents that reflect a diseased or physiologic state of the human body&#xD;
      and hence could be utilized for diagnostic purposes. The sources and composition of whole&#xD;
      saliva (oral fluid) are unique and complex. Saliva consists of secretions from salivary&#xD;
      glands and gingival crevicular fluid, oral mucosa transudate, secretions from nasal and&#xD;
      pharyngeal mucosa, nonadherent bacteria, desquamated oral epithelial cells, keratin debris,&#xD;
      blood cells, and possibly food or medication residuals (18). Its functions include&#xD;
      lubrication, digestion, antimicrobial activity, facilitating remineralization of dental&#xD;
      enamel, and maintaining normal taste sensation (19). These important functions are achieved&#xD;
      by the various chemical components of saliva including water, inorganic compounds (ions),&#xD;
      organic compounds (non-proteins and lipids), protein/polypeptides, and hormones (19). The&#xD;
      search for reliable salivary biomarkers has developed rapidly, especially in oral cancers,&#xD;
      spurred by the fact that collecting saliva is simpler and less invasive than drawing blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salvador-Moys√©n et al. (20) aimed to determine the usefulness of salivary cortisol as a&#xD;
      predictor of preeclampsia in adolescents. They found that cortisol concentrations &gt;14.9&#xD;
      nmol/L were observed in the group that developed preeclampsia, whereas the control group had&#xD;
      values &lt;10.1 nmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volatile organic compounds (VOC) can be detected in the breath and blood and used for the&#xD;
      early detection and characterization of the development and progression of diseases (21).&#xD;
      Many of the VOC that are detected in the breath are systemic or endogenous and are produced&#xD;
      during physiological processes, but the metabolic routes behind their production are known&#xD;
      for only a few (22). Other VOCs are exogenous and result from external contamination through&#xD;
      inhaled air or ingested foods or drinks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solid phase microextraction (SPME) is a simple, automated, rapid technique for VOC detection&#xD;
      combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (20). To the best of our&#xD;
      knowledge, no studies have been conducted to identify VOC in saliva from preeclamptic women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is a correlation between diagnosis of preeclampsia and its severity to changes in&#xD;
           HDL quality, in terms of composition and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether preeclampsia-induced changes in VOCs in saliva can be used for the&#xD;
           early diagnosis of preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research goals&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
           HDL composition and function of normal and preeclamptic pregnancies at weeks 12-14&#xD;
           (second trimester), weeks 28-30 (third trimester) and at delivery Apo-A1 properties,&#xD;
           PON1 activity HDL size HDL lipid content HDL antioxidant activity (toward LDL and&#xD;
           macrophages) HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the effects of HDL from women with PET, normal pregnancies and non-pregnant&#xD;
           women, on primary endothelial culture regarding proteins, mRNA and miRNAs, which are&#xD;
           significant components in normal endothelial function and related to inflammatory&#xD;
           response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate differences in the genomic and lipid profiles of cord blood and placentas from&#xD;
           women with PET, normal pregnancies and non-pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identify VOC in saliva, as early biomarkers of PET during the second and third&#xD;
           trimesters and at delivery.&#xD;
