      This Phase I, multiple ascending dose study will seek to enroll subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory Chronic B-cell Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma&#xD;
      (SLL) with confirmed and measurable disease who have received standard treatment with at&#xD;
      least one anti-CD20 antibody (e.g.; rituximab, ofatumumab) containing front-line regimen that&#xD;
      resulted in initial response, followed by relapse/recurrence and who are not eligible for any&#xD;
      further approved biologic therapy, chemotherapy and/or autologous stem transplantation and/or&#xD;
      refuse alternative approved therapies and/or are unlikely to achieve clinical benefit from&#xD;
      any therapy of higher priority by Investigator assessment.&#xD;

      This study is intended to provide investigators and sponsor with the following information&#xD;
      regarding the investigational new drug MT-3724 in patients with relapsed/refractory Chronic&#xD;
      B-cell Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum dose of a single course of MT-3724 given as intravenous (IV) infusions on Days 1,&#xD;
      3, 5, 8, 10 and 12 at which there are negligible side effects and/or at which maximum serum&#xD;
      levels and/or at which maximum effect on blood lymphocytes are observed. Four dose levels&#xD;
      will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes in MT-3724 serum levels and blood lymphocytes over time following IV doses at&#xD;
      different points in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes and kinds of clinical and laboratory effects and side effects that may occur over&#xD;
      repeated courses of MT-3724 The changes in each subject's immune status and their CLL or SLL&#xD;
      following one or more cycles of 6 infusions.&#xD;
