  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory choroidal neovascularization (InCNV) is the third cause of CNV after myopia and&#xD;
      Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). InCNV is a rare but severe disease and its treatment&#xD;
      should not be delayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      InCNV is treated at the moment with off-label anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)&#xD;
      therapy and could also benefit from aflibercept (EYLEA), a new anti-VEGF currently indicated&#xD;
      in AMD. Case reports suggest that such patients would not need as many injections as in AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALINEA is an open-label, single arm, prospective, multicenter, phase II study. The main&#xD;
      objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness in clinical terms after 52 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      with aflibercept on the visual acuity of patients affected by InCNV. A specific dosage&#xD;
      regimen is designed to achieve maximum efficiency. The patients are followed on a monthly&#xD;
      basis until 52 weeks. The first injection is mandatory. The other ones are injected only in&#xD;
      case of active InCNV.&#xD;

    <description>The patients are followed on a monthly basis until 52 weeks. Intravitreal injections of aflibercept at a dosage of 2 mg are initiated at inclusion (mandatory injection) with reinjection every 4 weeks only in case of CNV activity (PRN regimen) until 52 weeks.Therefore, each patient receives between 1 and 13 injections in the whole study.</description>
