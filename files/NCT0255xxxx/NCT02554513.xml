  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed research is to examine the effects of two treatment approaches on&#xD;
      speech production involving speakers with chronic apraxia of speech (AOS) and aphasia. The&#xD;
      planned investigation is designed to examine the acquisition, maintenance and generalization&#xD;
      effects of each treatment. One approach, electropalatography (EPG) uses visual biofeedback in&#xD;
      conjunction with articulatory-kinematic treatment and the other approach, sound production&#xD;
      treatment (SPT) is one of the most systematically studied articulatory-kinematic treatments&#xD;
      for AOS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EPG has been used to treat apraxia of speech (AOS) as well as other speech production&#xD;
      disorders (i.e., articulation disorders &amp; cleft palate). SPT is one of the most&#xD;
      systematically studied treatment approaches for AOS. Both treatment approaches are considered&#xD;
      clinical treatment approaches/standards of care for AOS. The pseudopalate used in conjunction&#xD;
      with EPG treatment is an acceptable device for treating speech production disorders including&#xD;
      AOS. The pseudopalate is custom-fit for each patient and is similar to a dental retainer and&#xD;
      is considered minimally invasive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to systematically examine the effects of treatment on speech&#xD;
      production using EPG treatment vs. an SPT approach. The planned investigation is intended to&#xD;
      explicate the acquisition, maintenance, and generalization effects of each treatment&#xD;
      approach. The specific experimental questions to be addressed are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will treatment using an EPG approach or an SPT approach result in greater accuracy of&#xD;
           articulation of trained speech sounds produced in words?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will treatment using an EPG approach or an SPT approach result in greater accuracy of&#xD;
           articulation of untrained exemplars of trained speech sounds produced in words (i.e.,&#xD;
           response generalization)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Will treatment using an EPG approach or an SPT approach result in greater long term&#xD;
           maintenance effects for trained speech sounds?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Do different treatment approaches result in distinct ratings of functional communication&#xD;
           skills via the Aphasia Communication Outcome Measure (ACOM; Doyle et al., 2012) and an&#xD;
           outcome measure of speech intelligibility using the Assessment of Intelligibility of&#xD;
           Dysarthric Speech (AIDS; Yorkston &amp; Beukelman, 1981)?&#xD;

    <measure>Speech Production: Percent Change in Treated Items Immediately Post Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline vs. Immediately Post Treatment (7 week treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in accuracy of articulation of treated items measured by percent increase in accuracy above the highest baseline measurement; production of words designated for treatment was measured repeatedly in non-treatment probes prior to treatment, throughout all study phases and immediately post treatment with percent accuracy calculated for each probe (0% to 100% correct). The highest percentage accuracy achieved in baseline probes was subtracted from the percentage accuracy achieved at the conclusion of treatment to obtain change in accuracy value - this reflects change from maximum correct performance in baseline (baseline). e.g., if in baseline probes, performance ranged from 10% to 30% accuracy and at post treatment performance was 90% accuracy, the change value would be 60% (90% minus 30%). A greater value indicates greater change in articulation/production of words. Change could be positive (improved articulation) or negative (poorer articulation)</description>

    <description>Change in articulatory accuracy of treated items as measured by percent increase in accuracy above the highest baseline measurement; production of words designated for treatment was measured repeatedly in non-treatment probes prior to treatment, throughout all study phases, and at 7 weeks immediately after each treatment with percent accuracy calculated for each probe (0% to 100% correct). The highest percentage accuracy achieved in baseline probes was subtracted from the percentage accuracy achieved at 7 weeks immediately after the conclusion of each treatment to obtain change in accuracy value - this reflects change from maximum correct performance in baseline (pre-treatment). e.g., if in baseline probes, performance ranged from 10% to 30% accuracy and at post treatment performance was 90% accuracy, the change value would be 60% (90% minus 30%).

    <description>Measurement of functional every day communication skills using the Aphasia Communication Outcome Measure (ACOM) with a T-score computed at each administration which was at baseline and then 10 weeks after the completion of all treatment.

The rating scale for functional communication skills was completed by the patient (or a spouse if patient's auditory comprehension was significantly impaired) (T-Scores range from 0 to 100; Higher T-scores indicate greater functional communication skills)</description>

        <title>Speech Production: Percent Change in Treated Items Immediately Post Treatment</title>
        <description>Change in accuracy of articulation of treated items measured by percent increase in accuracy above the highest baseline measurement; production of words designated for treatment was measured repeatedly in non-treatment probes prior to treatment, throughout all study phases and immediately post treatment with percent accuracy calculated for each probe (0% to 100% correct). The highest percentage accuracy achieved in baseline probes was subtracted from the percentage accuracy achieved at the conclusion of treatment to obtain change in accuracy value - this reflects change from maximum correct performance in baseline (baseline). e.g., if in baseline probes, performance ranged from 10% to 30% accuracy and at post treatment performance was 90% accuracy, the change value would be 60% (90% minus 30%). A greater value indicates greater change in articulation/production of words. Change could be positive (improved articulation) or negative (poorer articulation)</description>

          <title>EPG Treatment: All Participants</title>
          <description>Participants in this arm received EPG Treatment for 20 treatment sessions. Following a 2 week washout period, participants received Sound Production Treatment (SPT) for 20 treatment sessions.&#xD;
EPG Treatment is also a behavioral treatment that includes clinical modeling, integral stimulation (&quot;watch me, listen to me, say it with me&quot;), articulation instruction, repeated practice and verbal feedback, but also incorporates a device that provides visual feedback about tongue placement/movements for articulation.&#xD;
SPT is a behavioral treatment that includes clinician modeling, orthographic cueing, integral stimulation (&quot;watch me, listen to me, say it with me&quot;), articulation instruction, repeated practice and verbal feedback.</description>
