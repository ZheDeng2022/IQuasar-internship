      A prospective cohort study design will be conducted. Patients with LABC who receive&#xD;
      chemotherapy will undergo physical examination, ultrasound, MRI, and BSGI at baseline,&#xD;
      midway, and at the completion of chemotherapy. Approximately 100 patients will be recruited&#xD;
      over a 2-year period. This study will give clinicians further insight into the usefulness of&#xD;
      ultrasound, MRI, and BSGI in monitoring treatment responses in patients with LABC. This could&#xD;
      potentially lead to changes in clinical management of these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is usually treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      followed by surgery. At present, monitoring of tumor responses to chemotherapy is primarily&#xD;
      carried out using physical examination at the beginning of each chemotherapy cycle.&#xD;
      Differentiating viable tumor tissue from inflammation or fibrotic scar tissue can be&#xD;
      difficult. There is a growing body of evidence that newer imaging techniques such as positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be better at determining&#xD;
      whether or not the tumor is actually shrinking, but their sensitivity and specificity were&#xD;
      not ideal. Breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI) using 99mTcsestamibi is a relatively new&#xD;
      nuclear medicine imaging technique for breast tumor detection. BSGI shows higher sensitivity&#xD;
      than conventional scintimammography in the detection of small breast cancer lesions owing to&#xD;
      its high resolution. BSGI is a useful complementary tool to ultrasound, mammography and MRI&#xD;
      in breast cancer diagnosis, especially in dense breasts and multifocal or multicentric&#xD;
      disease; however, little is known about the ability of BSGI to predict of clinical and&#xD;
      pathological response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of BSGI in&#xD;
      evaluating tumor responses to chemotherapy in patients with LABC and compare this with&#xD;
      physical examination, ultrasound, mammography and MRI, which is the current conventional&#xD;
      standard of care. A prospective cohort study design will be conducted. Patients with LABC who&#xD;
      receive chemotherapy will undergo physical examination, ultrasound, MRI, and BSGI at&#xD;
      baseline, midway, and at the completion of chemotherapy. Approximately 100 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited over a 2-year period. This study will give clinicians further insight into the&#xD;
      usefulness of ultrasound, MRI, and BSGI in monitoring treatment responses in patients with&#xD;
      LABC. This could potentially lead to changes in clinical management of these patients.&#xD;

             carcinoma-not breast sarcoma or lymphoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients having a clinical diagnosis of locally advanced breast cancer (T3 or T4, or&#xD;
             N2 according to TNM classification) including inflammatory breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
