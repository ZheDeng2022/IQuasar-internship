  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2011, 38.6 million hospital stays occurred in the United States at a cost of $387.2&#xD;
      billion. 47.9 percent involved hospitalizations during which surgical procedures were&#xD;
      performed. Orthopedic procedures constituted the most frequently performed and most costly of&#xD;
      operating room procedures. As the healthcare climate in the United States continues to&#xD;
      change, there is a trend towards providing effective care in a fiscally conservative manner.&#xD;
      Central to this strategy is the shift towards increasing ambulatory surgical procedures from&#xD;
      surgeries requiring post-operative admission for patients. While savings to hospitals and&#xD;
      third-party payers are implied, there may be an unrecognized increase in financial, physical,&#xD;
      and psychosocial post-operative costs to patients undergoing ambulatory surgery and to their&#xD;
      caregivers. Rawal et al., and McGarth and colleagues have found that patients undergoing&#xD;
      orthopedic procedures had moderate to severe post-operative pain. We propose to present a&#xD;
      survey to patients and their caregivers before surgery and at multiple timepoints&#xD;
      post-operatively to acquire information on the impacts of ambulatory orthopedic surgery. In&#xD;
      addition to assessing post-operative pain, this study serves to examine various other&#xD;
      possible burdens to patients that have not been previously evaluated in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
