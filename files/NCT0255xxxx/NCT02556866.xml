      Multicenter randomized double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of rituximab in&#xD;
      combination with corticosteroids to corticosteroids plus placebo in the treatment of&#xD;
      non-infectious active mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cryoglobulinemia are responsible for systemic vasculitis, and the most frequently targeted&#xD;
      organs are the skin, joints, kidneys and peripheral nervous system. Cryoglobulinemia&#xD;
      vasculitis are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and require therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention. Management of non-infectious mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis is based on&#xD;
      corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and/or immunosuppressants. These treatments are associated&#xD;
      with frequent side effects. To date, no study has evaluated the efficacy and safety of these&#xD;
      different therapeutic options, explaining the lack of recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, has emerged as a novel therapeutic&#xD;
      option in B-cell related disorders. Data from the French AutoImmunity and Rituximab (AIR)&#xD;
      registry recently reported the positive effect of rituximab in non-infectious mixed&#xD;
      cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. More recently, the multidisciplinary national French CryoVas&#xD;
      survey also suggested a significant superiority of the combination corticosteroid plus&#xD;
      rituximab compared to the corticosteroids alone in terms of complete clinical and&#xD;
      immunological responses and corticosteroid sparing. However, no randomized controlled data&#xD;
      addressing this issue has been published to date.&#xD;
