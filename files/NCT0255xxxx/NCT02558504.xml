  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First intent treatment for superficial circular esophageal neoplasm is surgical resection.&#xD;
      Endoscopic mucosal resection is not recommended due to the high rate of subsequent esophageal&#xD;
      stenosis (higher than 80%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical limits are related to a high level of morbidity due, in particular, to respiratory&#xD;
      complications or infections that require prolonged hospitalisations, and by significant rate&#xD;
      of mortality (from 2 to 5 %). As an alternative to the surgical treatment, an innovative&#xD;
      technique to remove esophageal circular preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions has been&#xD;
      developed: it consists to ablate the mucosa by means of a balloon of a fixed diameter which&#xD;
      incorporates approximately 100 electrodes on its surface that emit radiofrequency waves&#xD;
      (HALOÂ® Radiofrequency Ablation Technology System). By varying the strength and the duration&#xD;
      of the electrical impulses, it is possible to obtain a homogenous and controlled destruction&#xD;
      of the tissue of the whole mucosa, leaving no remaining pre-neoplastic or neoplastic elements&#xD;
      underneath. The technique will be used for high grade glandular epithelial neoplasia, Vienna&#xD;
      4-1 or 4-2, developed on a mucosa at risk, i.e. the Barrett's oesophagus, occupying more than&#xD;
      half of the circumference of the esophagus and that requires surgical treatment. The expected&#xD;
      benefit for the patient is linked to the reduced invasiveness of the technique in comparison&#xD;
      to the surgery&#xD;

    <description>While surgical reference technique for invasive cancer of the lower esophagus is the technique according to Lewis Santy, there is no consensus on the technique and surgical approaches lack of specific work in the particular case of superficial lesions . The centers will have the choice of using the technique according to Lewis Santy with gastric plasty or technique of esophagectomy without thoracotomy with lower mediastinal dissection. In the absence of consensus to date available, abdominal surgery time will be by laparotomy or laparoscopy (laparoscopic assisted technique called). In both cases, an exploratory laparoscopy for diagnostic purposes is realized to remove an extension of the disease that would indicate against-resection with curative intent. For surgery, patients will be put under antisecretory therapy proton-pump inhibitor; this at least throughout the duration of the study.</description>

    <description>The equipment processing is:&#xD;
The radiofrequency generator,&#xD;
The radiofrequency balloon 360,&#xD;
the radiofrequency probe 90.&#xD;
The radiofrequency treatment should be carried out according to the following protocol:&#xD;
The radiofrequency treatment is done within 2 months following the last endoscopic assessment.&#xD;
The maximum number of sessions is 4, including 2 maximum with 360 Halo probe.&#xD;
Endoscopy is performed under general anesthesia.&#xD;
The removal must begin at the top 1cm above the upper pole of the lesion and must end 1cm below the lower pole of the lesion.&#xD;
The patient is left fasting until morning. In case of chest pain, the patient may receive analgesics.&#xD;
During the time of treatment, the patient must follow an antisecretory therapy pump inhibitor with dual proton dose orally. The patient should avoid taking aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during the 10 days following each session.</description>
