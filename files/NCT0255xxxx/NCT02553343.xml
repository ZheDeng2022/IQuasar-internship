    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two formulations of the&#xD;
      high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine compared to the licensed high-dose trivalent&#xD;
      influenza vaccine control in healthy elderly subjects aged 65 years of age and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of all subjects in each study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that the high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine induces an immune&#xD;
           response (as assessed by HAI geometric mean titers (GMTs) that is non-inferior to&#xD;
           responses induced by the licensed high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine for the 3 common&#xD;
           virus strains at 28 days post-vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe post-vaccination immunogenicity for the 4 virus strains (as assessed by&#xD;
           seroconversion and seroprotection) for subjects who receive the high-dose quadrivalent&#xD;
           influenza vaccine and the licensed high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe post-vaccination immunogenicity for the 4 virus strains (as assessed by&#xD;
           GMTs, seroconversion, and seroprotection) for subjects who receive the high-dose&#xD;
           quadrivalent influenza vaccine and the investigational high-dose trivalent influenza&#xD;
           vaccine.&#xD;

      All eligible participants will be randomized to receive a single injection of either one of&#xD;
      the high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine formulations or one of the high-dose trivalent&#xD;
      influenza vaccines at Day 0. They will provide blood samples for hemagglutination inhibition&#xD;
      (HAI) testing. Safety information as solicited, unsolicited reactions, serious adverse&#xD;
      events, including adverse events of special interest will be collected in the trial.&#xD;
