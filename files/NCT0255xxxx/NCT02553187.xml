      The purpose of the study is to explore the efficacy and safety of Kanglaite Injection in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with late-stage cancer cachexia.&#xD;

      The study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study. The planned sample size&#xD;
      is 160 subjects. These subjects will be randomized (1:1) to treatment group (i.e., standard&#xD;
      therapy plus Kanglaite Injection) or control group (i.e., standard therapy plus blank&#xD;
      control). The study population includes the patients with non small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (adenocarcinoma), colorectal carcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma, who are complicated with&#xD;
      cachexia.&#xD;
