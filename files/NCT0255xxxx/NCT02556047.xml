    <textblock>
      Several vaccinations are administered by the intradermal (ID) method where the vaccine is&#xD;
      injected between layers of skin. The current technique required to do this can be difficult&#xD;
      to learn and perform accurately, is slower to deliver than subcutaneous or intramuscular&#xD;
      injections, and there is a risk that the injection will be given to too-deep skin layers or&#xD;
      to underlying tissues, which might change the immune response. There is increasing interest&#xD;
      in using ID administration for vaccines as it may be possible to achieve the same immune&#xD;
      response with a smaller dose of vaccine. This could increase access to vaccines that are&#xD;
      expensive or are only available in small quantities and therefore could have global health&#xD;
      benefit for vaccine programs for diseases such as yellow fever and polio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the potential global-health benefits of being able to give ID injections of&#xD;
      vaccines easily, quickly and with relatively little training or experience, several novel&#xD;
      devices are currently being developed to allow easy ID administration. Star Syringe have&#xD;
      developed two novel intradermal safety devices that differ only in the length of the needle&#xD;
      used. The current study will assess how the two new devices perform, compared to the&#xD;
      traditional Mantoux test, using injections of saline into the upper arm. Twenty volunteers&#xD;
      (18-60 years, male and female) will be recruited and attend a screening visit (1), an&#xD;
      injection visit (2a) and have a follow up telephone call (2b). At the injection visit they&#xD;
      will receive 3 injections in each arm (Mantoux and 2 device injections) and measurements will&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of volunteers will be invited back to attend an additional visit (3a) which will be&#xD;
      a repeat of visit 2 but with an ultrasound image taken of each injection site. There will be&#xD;
      a follow up telephone call 24 hours later (3b).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Volunteers will be asked to attend Surrey CRC for two visits with a follow up telephone call.&#xD;
      A subset of volunteers will be aske to attend an additional visit and follow up call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 - Screening Visit (Day - 28 to -1) Visit 1 will take place up to 28 days prior to the&#xD;
      injections being administered (Visit 2). At this visit consent will be taken and the&#xD;
      following procedures performed: demography, medical history and concomitant medication, vital&#xD;
      signs (blood pressure, heart rate, oral temperature), symptoms-directed physical examination&#xD;
      including assessment of deltoid area, measurement of height and weight, blood sample taken&#xD;
      for haematology and coagulation screen, completion of a medical health questionnaire.&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed and volunteers that continue to be eligible&#xD;
      will be invited back to attend Visit 2a.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2a - Injection (Day 0) At Visit 2a, continuing eligibility will be assessed and both&#xD;
      adverse events and concomitant medication will be recorded. Vital signs will be measured and&#xD;
      if the volunteer is still eligible then they will be randomised onto the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteer will receive a total of 6 injections, 3 in each upper arm. In each arm there&#xD;
      will be one Mantoux injection and 2 device injections (the same device or different). In&#xD;
      total they will receive 2 Mantoux injections and 2 injections from each device. To maintain&#xD;
      the blind of the study the volunteers will be asked to wear a blindfold during the&#xD;
      injections. After each injection a number of measurements will be performed including&#xD;
      assessing wheal size and wetness at the injection site as well as subjectively assessing&#xD;
      pain. In addition the devices will be weighed before and after use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the injections, vital signs will be recorded again and volunteers will be&#xD;
      discharged and provided with a diary card to complete over the following 24 hours. They&#xD;
      should record side effects and any medications taken, including over the counter medications&#xD;
      as well as any skin reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2b - Mandatory Follow Up telephone call (Day 1) The volunteer will be telephoned by a&#xD;
      member of the study team 24 hours after the injection visit and both adverse events and&#xD;
      concomitant medication will be recorded. Volunteers will be asked to return their diary cards&#xD;
      to the CRC in the mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of volunteers will be invited back to attend Visits 3a and 3b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3a - Injection (Within days 7 to 28) At Visit 3a, continuing eligibility will be&#xD;
      assessed and both adverse events and concomitant medication will be recorded. Vital signs&#xD;
      will be measured and if the volunteer is still eligible then they will be randomised onto the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteer will receive a total of 6 injections, 3 in each upper arm. In each arm there&#xD;
      will be one Mantoux injection and 2 device injections (the same device or different). In&#xD;
      total they will receive 2 Mantoux injections and 2 injections from each device. To maintain&#xD;
      the blind of the study the volunteers will be asked to wear a blindfold during the&#xD;
      injections. After each injection a number of measurements will be performed including&#xD;
      assessing wheal size and wetness at the injection site as well as subjectively assessing&#xD;
      pain. At this visit, ultrasound echography will be performed for each injection site. In&#xD;
      addition the devices will be weighed before and after use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the injections, vital signs will be recorded again and volunteers will be&#xD;
      discharged and provided with a diary card to complete over the following 24 hours. They&#xD;
      should record side effects and any medications taken, including over the counter medications&#xD;
      as well as any skin reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3b - Follow Up telephone call (24 h after Visit 3a) The volunteer will be telephoned by&#xD;
      a member of the study team 24 hours after the injection visit and both adverse events and&#xD;
      concomitant medication will be recorded. Volunteers will be asked to return their diary cards&#xD;
      to the CRC in the mail.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy male or female volunteers aged 18 to 60 years inclusive. Attempts will be made&#xD;
             to achieve an equal gender ratio through appropriate screening procedures, but a&#xD;
             failure to do so will not preclude analysis of the final data set.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The volunteer is, in the opinion of the investigator, healthy on the basis of&#xD;
             self-reported medical history, vital signs, a physical examination (including the skin&#xD;
             overlying the deltoids of the upper arms), and the results of routine haematology and&#xD;
             coagulation laboratory tests, with no active disease process that could interfere with&#xD;
             the study endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body Mass Index ≥18.5 and &lt;29.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The volunteer is able to read and understand the Informed Consent Form (ICF), and&#xD;
             understand study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The volunteer has signed the ICF and is willing to comply with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Available for follow-up for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Clinically significant psychiatric, cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological (particularly myasthenia gravis),&#xD;
             immunological, or haematological disease or abnormality, as determined by the study&#xD;
             physician, which might interfere with consenting or self-recording of safety events.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Presence of large or dark tattoos or other marking or abnormal variation in skin&#xD;
             pigmentation in the area of the deltoids that would preclude measurement of six&#xD;
             injection site wheals.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Acute, self-reported needle phobia. 4. Regular use of anti-coagulant medication,&#xD;
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, topical or oral steroids, anti-histamines and&#xD;
             opiates for longer than six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Pregnant or lactating at any point during the study from screening to final follow&#xD;
             up.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, compromises the volunteers'&#xD;
             ability to meet protocol requirements or to complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Unable to read and speak English to a fluency level adequate for the full&#xD;
             comprehension of procedures required in participation and consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Dermatological and other conditions likely to cause excessive soreness, bleeding or&#xD;
             pain at the site of injection or subsequent scarring; these might include&#xD;
             hyperkeratosis and bleeding disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Peripheral neuropathy, which might interfere with pain perception.&#xD;
