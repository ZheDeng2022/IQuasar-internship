  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open trial investigating the long-term use of an online brain training&#xD;
      programme for adults over 50. It will determine whether there is sustained benefit to&#xD;
      cognition, and whether this group can be engaged in this form of intervention over a period&#xD;
      of 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate an optimised brain training programme to determine whether it is&#xD;
      engaging for older adults and whether it results in improvement or maintenance of cognition&#xD;
      over a 12 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Brain Training intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The programme is an updated version of the original 'Brain Test Britain' intervention, which&#xD;
      was successfully evaluated in a large previous trial. It consists of a series of games or&#xD;
      tests, completed on a computer. Each test is designed to target the participants' reasoning&#xD;
      and problem-solving ability, for example by asking them to balance weights on a see-saw or&#xD;
      select the 'odd-one-out' from a series of shapes. As the participants progress over the&#xD;
      course of the study they will receive increasingly more challenging versions of each test,&#xD;
      depending on their performance. The intervention has been updated from the original to&#xD;
      improve engagement through improved visuals, more intelligent difficulty setting and a more&#xD;
      engaging delivery platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research delivery platform: PROTECT&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel infrastructure resource has been developed at King's College London within the&#xD;
      Maudsley Biomedical Research Unit for Dementia (BRU-D), which provides the opportunity to&#xD;
      deliver the intervention to large numbers of older adults. The Platform for Research Online&#xD;
      to investigate Cognition and Genetics in Ageing (PROTECT) is an online research tool. PROTECT&#xD;
      is currently recruiting a cohort of over 10,000 adults over 50 who are cognitively healthy or&#xD;
      have early cognitive impairment. Participants provide demographic and lifestyle information&#xD;
      and will complete a battery of validated cognitive assessments annually. The focus of all&#xD;
      research conducted through PROTECT is on the prevention of dementia and risk reduction. The&#xD;
      optimised brain training intervention will be delivered through this platform. PROTECT has&#xD;
      ethical approval from the NHS Research Ethics Service Committee for London Bridge (Ref:&#xD;
      13/LO/1578).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: 12-month open online clinical trial Participants: 5000 adults over 50 Setting:&#xD;
      Intervention delivered at home, online through the PROTECT website&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be achieved through the PROTECT site through a national advertisement&#xD;
      strategy. This will be accomplished through partnerships with the media and third sector. All&#xD;
      participants registered on PROTECT will be invited to take part and provided with the&#xD;
      information sheet. Participants will consent through the secure online procedure on the&#xD;
      PROTECT site.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will complete a package of online brain training games focusing on reasoning and problem solving. The intervention will be accessed via a computer. There is no minimum or maximum dosage but participants will be recommended to complete the intervention five times a week. The package takes approximately 10 minutes to complete, depending on individual performance.</description>
