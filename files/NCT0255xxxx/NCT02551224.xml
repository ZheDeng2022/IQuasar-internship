    <description>This study will measure patient's perceptions of dose delivery, using a preference questionnaire on use of the Breezhaler® &amp; Ellipta® devices, in COPD patients naïve to DPI devices.The mean (SD) score on a scale of 1- 5 (1 = not at all confident/not at all; 5 = extremely confident/a very great deal) 1a. How confident were you that you received the full dose of medication from your inhaler?&#xD;
1=Not At All Confident, 2=Not Very Confident, 3=Somewhat Confident, 4=Confident, 5=Extremely Confident&#xD;
1b. How certain were you that there was no drug remaining in the device?&#xD;
1=Not At All Certain,2=Not Very Certain, 3=Somewhat Certain,4=Certain, 5=Extremely Certain&#xD;
1c. To what extent did the device help you to know that you have received all the medication?&#xD;

                  cigars is not relevant to smoking history.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  An ex-smoker is defined as a patient who has not smoked for ≥6 months at&#xD;
                  screening.&#xD;

        <title>Patient's Preference on the Feedback Mechanisms of Dose Delivery Confirmation Using the Breezhaler® and Ellipta® Devices</title>
        <description>This study will measure patient's perceptions of dose delivery, using a preference questionnaire on use of the Breezhaler® &amp; Ellipta® devices, in COPD patients naïve to DPI devices.The mean (SD) score on a scale of 1- 5 (1 = not at all confident/not at all; 5 = extremely confident/a very great deal) 1a. How confident were you that you received the full dose of medication from your inhaler?&#xD;
1=Not At All Confident, 2=Not Very Confident, 3=Somewhat Confident, 4=Confident, 5=Extremely Confident&#xD;
1b. How certain were you that there was no drug remaining in the device?&#xD;
1=Not At All Certain,2=Not Very Certain, 3=Somewhat Certain,4=Certain, 5=Extremely Certain&#xD;
1c. To what extent did the device help you to know that you have received all the medication?&#xD;
1=Not At All, 2=A Little, 3=Somewhat, 4=Very Much, 5=A Very Great Deal</description>
