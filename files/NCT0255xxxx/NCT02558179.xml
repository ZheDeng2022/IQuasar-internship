      This study is designed as a prospective evaluation of the diagnostic performance of the&#xD;
      multiplex nucleic acid-based genetic test (Gynecologene Next-Generation Sequencing test) to&#xD;
      identify known significant causative organisms in bacterial vaginosis/vaginitis and other&#xD;
      major pathogens and normal commensals in symptomatic women during the reproductive years.&#xD;
      Vaginal fluid samples will be split and tested with the comparator methods and Nugent score,&#xD;
      with the results evaluated according to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,&#xD;
      and negative predictive value. Laboratorians performing each test will be blinded to the&#xD;
      clinical history and any prior test results to minimize ascertainment bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be followed routinely for up to 6 weeks after initial visit for&#xD;
      vaginosis/vaginitis by telephone or office visit at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial vaginosis (BV, or vaginal bacteriosis) and vaginitis are the most common vaginal&#xD;
      infections of women during the child-bearing years, with BV alone accounting for 27-41% 1&#xD;
      prevalence in Americans. BV is characterized by replacement of the healthy&#xD;
      lactobacillus-dominant microbiome by a diverse polymicrobial overgrowth of multiple taxa of&#xD;
      commensal facultative anaerobes and other pathogenic bacteria. Molecular-based phylogenetic&#xD;
      analyses, including the newly-completed Human Microbiome Project and other next-generations&#xD;
      sequencing (NGS) studies, revealed the complexity of the vaginal microbiome in health and&#xD;
      disease. BV does not appear to be a single entity, but rather consists of multiple bacterial&#xD;
      community clusters. Clusters are dominated by Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus,&#xD;
      or anaerobic combinations with or without Lactobacillus spp. (species) in varying&#xD;
      proportions. In addition, multiple significant BV-associated pathogens were discovered that&#xD;
      had escaped notice with other detection methods such as cultures; previously overlooked were&#xD;
      Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners and other Lactobacillus spp., and multiple&#xD;
      Lachnospiraceae spp (Bacterial Vaginosis Associated 1, Bacterial Vaginosis Associated 2, and&#xD;
      Bacterial Vaginosis Associated 3; BVA1, BVA2 and BVA 3 respectively). This multisite study&#xD;
      proposes to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Gynecologene Next-Generation&#xD;
      Sequencing test in women with symptoms of vaginitis/vaginosis. To the investigators'&#xD;
      knowledge, the Gynecologene is the first commercially-available comprehensive NGS-based&#xD;
      laboratory-developed test available to assist with diagnosis and clinical management of BV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multisite site study compares the diagnostic performance of the Gynecologene&#xD;
      Next-Generation Sequencing test with the clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis/vaginitis&#xD;
      (Nugent score). The second objective is to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the&#xD;
      Gynecologene Score with the Nugent Score for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis/vaginitis. The&#xD;
      third objective is to identify the prevalence and diagnostic thresholds of bacterial loads&#xD;
      with the Gynecologene test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women between 18-55 years of age will be eligible for this study when diagnosed with&#xD;
      bacterial vaginosis or vaginitis confirmed using the CDC (Centers for Disease Control)&#xD;
      diagnostic gold standard of Nugent score; Amsel criteria will also be recorded. Other&#xD;
      inclusion as well as exclusion criteria exist. A minimum of 5 geographically different sites&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study. Co-investigators will follow the protocol to enroll&#xD;
      participants and collect 2 vaginal swabs and 1 slide smear. The patient has no financial gain&#xD;
      nor responsibility within this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the study will have 90% power at a significance level of 0.05 to detect Â± 5%&#xD;
      positive percent agreement of the study device with the predicate device. To achieve this&#xD;
      level of power, 100 total samples will be assayed per group to account for withdrawals and&#xD;
      treatment failures. Samples that contain more than one targeted organism can be counted twice&#xD;
      as the analyses for each organism are independent of each other. The provision of treatment,&#xD;
      including type, dose, and duration, is solely at the discretion of the clinician according to&#xD;
      his/her current routine procedures to reflect typical contemporary practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIBiotech will serve as a central medical diagnostic laboratory for this trial. Results of&#xD;
      all analytical tests will be provided to the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for analysis will be blinded for patient identification and other PHI (protected health&#xD;
      information) by the study administrator. Data will be analyzed and reported.&#xD;
