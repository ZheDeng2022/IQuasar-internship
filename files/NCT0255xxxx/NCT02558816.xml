      This is an open label, multicenter, fixed dose and dose escalation, phase I/II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 3 steps. The first one (step A) will be to ensure the safety&#xD;
      of the combination of Obinutuzumab (GA101) and Ibrutinib at fixed doses in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 9 patients have been included in the first step with grouped inclusions of three&#xD;
      patients (safety evaluation performed at each inclusion of 3 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No unacceptable toxicity has been observed during step A, thefore the second step (step B)&#xD;
      was initiated. The aim of the second step was to determine the MTD of the GDC-0199&#xD;
      (400-600-800mg/d) in combination of GA101 and Ibrutinib (both respecting the previous doses)&#xD;
      by using a Continual Reassessment Method. This dose escalation method was used until the 12th&#xD;
      patient (3 patients included at 400mg/d of GDC-0199-(no DLT), 3 at 600mg/d- (no DLT) and 6 at&#xD;
      800mg/d, (not DLT reported so far). Once the last patient of the 800mg cohort is evaluated&#xD;
      for DLT, all other patients will be treated at the dose of 400mg/d of GDC-0199.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third step (step C) for untreated patients will be conducted at the dose of 400mg/d of&#xD;
      GDC-0199. The aim of step C is to confirm the safety profile of the GA101 + Ibrutininb +&#xD;
      GDC-199 combination according to step B result. 15 patients will be included in this step.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted into 3 steps for respecting the optimal safety of the OASIS&#xD;
      trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step A :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of step A is to evaluate the safety of the combination of GA101 +&#xD;
      Ibrutinib at fixed doses (560 mg per day of Ibrutinib + 1000 mg of GA101), in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the efficacy of the combination of GA101 and Ibrutinib in terms of clinical&#xD;
           benefits response (overall response rate, complete response rate, partial response rate&#xD;
           Cheson 99 and 07 criteria and Working Group Revised Response Criteria for Malignant&#xD;
           Lymphomas 14), overall survival, progression free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety and tolerability of the combination of GA101 and Ibrutinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a bio-bank to explore biomarkers and mechanisms of action including&#xD;
           resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step B : Step B started because no unacceptable toxicity occurred in patients included in the&#xD;
      step A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this step is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of the&#xD;
      GDC-0199 in addition to the GA101 and Ibrutinib in relapsed refractory MCL patients by using&#xD;
      a Continual Reassessment Method (CRM), used up to the 12th enrolled patients. No DLT occured&#xD;
      for the first 12 patients. Based on the most recent publications, the dose of 400mg/d will be&#xD;
      used from the 13th to the 24th patients (no CRM used).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the efficacy of the combination GA101, Ibrutinib and GDC-0199 in terms of&#xD;
           clinical benefits response (overall response rate, complete response rate, partial&#xD;
           response rate Cheson 99 and 07 criteria and Working Group Revised Response Criteria for&#xD;
           Malignant Lymphomas 14), overall survival, progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety and tolerability of the novel combination of GDC-0199, GA101 and&#xD;
           Ibrutinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a bio-bank to explore biomarkers and mechanism of action including&#xD;
           resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step C :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This step has started because no unacceptable toxicity was observed during the second step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this step is to confirm the safety of the combination of GA101 +&#xD;
      Ibrutinib + GDC-199 at fixed doses (560 mg per day of Ibrutinib + 1000 mg of GA101, 400mg/d&#xD;
      of GDC-199 ), in patients with untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), at end of Cycle 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the efficacy of the combination GA101, Ibrutinib and GDC-0199 in terms of&#xD;
           clinical benefits response (overall response rate, complete response rate, partial&#xD;
           response rate cheson 99 and 07 criteria and Working Group Revised Response Criteria for&#xD;
           Malignant Lymphomas 14), overall survival, progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety and tolerability of the novel combination of GDC-0199, GA101 and&#xD;
           Ibrutinib&#xD;
