      The purpose of the study is to compare pre-operative radio-chemotherapy (RT + capecitabine)&#xD;
      to a short course RT associated with a delayed surgery, with two primary objectives: the&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation (rate of R0 resection) and the preservation of autonomy (score IADL).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequent cancers diagnosed in France. The average age of&#xD;
      diagnosis in 2012 was 70 years old for men and 73 years for women, confirming that colorectal&#xD;
      cancer is a disease of the elderly population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature concerning combined treatments of colorectal cancer in the elderly is&#xD;
      extremely limited. The application of combined treatments in the geriatric population is&#xD;
      associated with an increase in the therapeutic complications. These post-operative&#xD;
      complications together with the comorbidities and age are unfavorable prognostic factors for&#xD;
      survival in patients with cancer of the rectum; this explains why the improved results&#xD;
      obtained during the last decades are perceptible in younger patients and not in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the general population, pre-operative radio-chemotherapy has imposed itself as a standard&#xD;
      treatment for the cancer of the rectum locally advanced. The utilization of fluoropyrimidines&#xD;
      associated with radiotherapy (RT) delivered in fractions [long course RT (50 Gy in 5 weeks),&#xD;
      surgery planned 6 to 8 weeks later] increases the complete histological response rate and&#xD;
      decreases significantly the rate of local relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short-course RT [short course RT using the Swedish model (5x5 Gy in 5 days), with the&#xD;
      surgery programmed the following week] is the standard neoadjuvant protocol in an important&#xD;
      number of countries and/or academic groups. The studies that have compared the fractioned RT&#xD;
      scheme to the short-course RT protocols have not shown any evidence of a change in efficacy&#xD;
      of the short course RT concerning the following criteria: rate of R0 resection, rate of&#xD;
      sphincter conservation, rate of relapse at 3 years, the disease free survival or the overall&#xD;
      survival. Similarly, there appears to be no difference in severe toxicities in the long term.&#xD;
      It should however be noted that short-course RT followed by immediate surgery may be less&#xD;
      efficient than combined treatment in patients with a distal T3 cancer, even though these&#xD;
      conclusions published by Ngan have been criticized by certain. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      fractioned combined treatments results in more tumor and stage reduction and thus more&#xD;
      sterilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless a retrospective analysis, performed in the Stockholm region, in patients&#xD;
      irradiated with short-course protocol but operated with a delay of at least 4 weeks resulted&#xD;
      in a sterilization rate of 8%. This result is even more interesting since in this cohort, 46%&#xD;
      of the patients had a tumor classified T4 and that 38% of the patients had a primitive tumor&#xD;
      considered inoperable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the elderly population, the neoadjuvant treatment has rarely been studied. An exploratory&#xD;
      analysis of the PRODIGE 2 study, based on age as the criteria, has shown that pre-operative&#xD;
      radio-chemotherapy is significantly more toxic in the elderly population, from 70 years of&#xD;
      age. Globally the lower tolerance for the pre-operative radio-chemotherapy results in more&#xD;
      frequent early termination of RT and a statistically significant decrease in the number of&#xD;
      patients operated. Furthermore, if the type of surgery was not significantly different&#xD;
      between patients &lt;70 years and those â‰¥70 years, we observe a non-significant increase in the&#xD;
      rate of prolonged stoma (patients amputated without closure of the stoma). These differences&#xD;
      in the surgical procedures is also observed in other publications, placing the emphasis on&#xD;
      the fact that in the absence of any difference in the clinical presentation or the&#xD;
      characteristic of the tumor, the risk of real or supposed decompensation modifies the&#xD;
      surgical care. These data, as well as those in the literature, provides evidence that the&#xD;
      pre-operative radio-chemotherapy strategy followed by surgery, the standard strategy in&#xD;
      younger patients, is associated with more side effects in the elderly, resulting in the&#xD;
      benefit-risk balance, in this population, to be more questionable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore necessary to conduct a specific studies in the elderly population, with&#xD;
      cancer of the rectum with the objective to maintain the carcinological results obtained with&#xD;
      classical radio-chemotherapy with at the same time better controlling the secondary effects&#xD;
      of the treatment and the risk of decompensation of the patients: the short course&#xD;
      radiotherapy associated with a delayed surgery may be a therapeutic scheme well adapted to&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose a study comparing pre-operative radio-chemotherapy (RT +&#xD;
      capecitabine) to a short course RT associated with a delayed surgery, with two primary&#xD;
      objectives: the efficacy evaluation (rate of R0 resection) and the preservation of autonomy&#xD;
      (score IADL).&#xD;
