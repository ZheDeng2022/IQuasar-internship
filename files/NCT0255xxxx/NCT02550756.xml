  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm that the local anesthetic applied to subjects with&#xD;
      Morton's Neuroma satisfactorily mitigates procedure pain and ensures that post-procedure&#xD;
      discomfort or pain will not result in bias or breaking of the blind in the planned Phase 2b&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female subjects aged &gt;/=18 years at the time of the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Symptoms of intermetatarsal neuroma for at least 30 days prior to the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of intermetatarsal neuroma (Morton's neuroma) based on medical history and&#xD;
             physical examination with evidence of focal tenderness and pain in the area of the&#xD;
             neuroma, confirmed by ultrasound or other imaging modality. Typically the subject will&#xD;
             have sensory symptoms in the distribution of the affected common digital nerve.&#xD;
             However, provided the imaging study is positive, the presence of these sensory&#xD;
             symptoms is not required. The neuroma may be in either the second or third&#xD;
             intermetatarsal space.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. An average pain score of 4.0 to 9.0 (during the 7 days prior to dosing) on the Numeric&#xD;
             Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), as rated daily at bedtime for average pain while walking in&#xD;
             the last 24 hours, relevant to the affected foot. At least 4 of 7 scores during the&#xD;
             week prior to dosing must be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For female subjects: reproductive status is such that the subject is surgically&#xD;
             sterile, at least 2 years postmenopausal, or using a medically acceptable method of&#xD;
             birth control; if of child-bearing potential, is not pregnant (negative urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test prior to enrollment), is not planning to get pregnant during the course&#xD;
             of the study, and is not lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing and able to understand the study requirements, abide by the study&#xD;
             restrictions, complete the study procedures, pain scales, and diaries, and to&#xD;
             communicate meaningfully with the study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Signed an Informed Consent Form approved by the Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinically significant bursitis or another significant symptomatic condition in the&#xD;
             region of or adjoining the neuroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has more than one intermetatarsal neuroma on the foot to be injected&#xD;
             (index foot).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior use of injection with a sclerosing agent such as alcohol or phenol, or prior&#xD;
             surgery for intermetatarsal neuroma on the affected foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior injection of corticosteroid in the index foot or oral use of corticosteroids&#xD;
             within 30 days of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has another painful condition that, in the judgment of the investigator,&#xD;
             would interfere with the subject's ability to evaluate the pain and functional&#xD;
             limitations that arise from the intermetatarsal neuroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Other painful foot pathology (e.g., bunion, hammertoe, plantar fasciitis, etc.) or&#xD;
             evidence of clinically meaningful ischemia which in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             would interfere with evaluation of the symptoms and functional limitations that arise&#xD;
             from the intermetatarsal neuroma. For example, if the subject has pain from a bunion&#xD;
             but that pain is easily distinguished by the subject from the neuroma pain, then the&#xD;
             subject would still be a candidate for the study. Note, however, that the subject&#xD;
             should also be able to distinguish the neuroma pain from the bunion pain in terms of&#xD;
             foot function. In general, if another foot pain condition (in the same foot) gives&#xD;
             rise to pain that is greater than the neuroma pain, then that subject should in most&#xD;
             instances be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Signs of arterial insufficiency in the feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ulcer and/or wound in the foot affected by the neuroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Active cutaneous disease, or other anatomical or physiological foot disorder, at the&#xD;
             anticipated site of study drug injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of clearly documented allergic reaction to local anesthetics or capsaicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Presence of any medical condition or instability that, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             Investigator, might adversely impact the conduct of the study or resulting data,&#xD;
             including chronic conditions that are likely to alter the rate of healing or are&#xD;
             likely to result in safety complications unrelated to the study medication, such as&#xD;
             uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Clinically significant laboratory result at the Screening Visit (in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has diabetic neuropathy or other length dependent neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Use of any investigational medication in the 30 days prior to the current study, is&#xD;
             scheduled to receive such an agent while participating in this study, or received a&#xD;
             topical or injected investigational medication in the index foot within the past 60&#xD;
             days.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Use of topical medication on the index foot within 7 days of screening (including&#xD;
             lidocaine or capsaicin).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Prior participation in an ALGRX 4975 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. History of substance abuse disorder within the past year as defined by DSM-IV, has&#xD;
             current evidence for a substance abuse disorder, is receiving medicinal treatment for&#xD;
             drug abuse, or tests positive upon urine drug screen for a substance of abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has any condition or is taking any medication that would be contraindicated for study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
