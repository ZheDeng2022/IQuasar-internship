  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deficient sleep duration and sleep disturbances - such as insomnia, sleep disordered&#xD;
      breathing (SDB) and restless legs syndrome (RLS)- are associated with hypertension and&#xD;
      cardio-cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. Several studies suggest that sleep disorders&#xD;
      are frequent after stroke and detrimental for stroke outcome. However, more prospective&#xD;
      studies in a large unselected sample of stroke survivors are needed to better investigate the&#xD;
      short- and long-term consequences of sleep disturbances on mortality and occurrence of new&#xD;
      cardio-cerebrovascular events. Also their pathophysiological mechanisms and their influence&#xD;
      on stroke recovery should be better understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the impact of sleep deficiency and sleep&#xD;
      fragmentation on the frequency of new cerebro- and cardiovascular events and death after&#xD;
      stroke or transient ischemic attacks, and clinical outcome within one and two years after&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The working hypotheses are that stroke survivors with sleep deficiency and sleep&#xD;
      fragmentation due to insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing or restless leg syndrome will&#xD;
      present: (1) higher mortality from all causes and higher frequency of new cardio-/&#xD;
      cerebrovascular events; and (2) a less favorable clinical outcome. Outcomes will be compared&#xD;
      between patients with and without sleep deficiency and fragmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since current clinical practice in cerebrovascular patients does not sufficiently consider&#xD;
      sleep disorders in patient's management, this study can help to bring attention to a still&#xD;
      overlooked medical problem and change the current standard of management of stroke survivors.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental and clinical data suggest a detrimental effect of sleep deficiency/sleep&#xD;
      fragmentation on stroke outcome. In rodents, sleep fragmentation and sleep deprivation&#xD;
      induced in the acute phase of stroke enhance the extension of the lesion and impair&#xD;
      functional recovery - inversely, sleep-promoting drugs have a positive effect on functional&#xD;
      recovery. In humans, a negative effect of sleep deficiency and sleep fragmentation due to&#xD;
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), restless legs syndrome (RLS) and insomnia on stroke outcome&#xD;
      has also been suggested but only insufficiently tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SDB is found in 50-70% of patients with transient ischemic attacks and acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
      Patients with SDB demonstrate a more rapid progression of stroke severity as well as higher&#xD;
      blood pressure and longer hospitalization in the acute phase of stroke. Over time, they also&#xD;
      exhibit a higher mortality. Functional outcome is also negatively affected by the presence of&#xD;
      SDB. Moreover, SDB was shown to represent an independent risk for hypertension and&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and for stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of insomnia in patients with stroke in a prospective study achieved 68% in the&#xD;
      acute phase decreasing to 49% after 18 months. However, systematic large scale observational&#xD;
      studies on the frequency of insomnia in stroke patients are lacking. Sleep duration after&#xD;
      stroke has been assessed in few studies only (e.g. in patients with paramedian thalamic&#xD;
      stroke), in some of them a good correlation with actigraphic measurements was found.&#xD;
      Moreover, over the last three decades a link was found between sleep deficiency and&#xD;
      fragmentation and cardiocerebrovascular morbidity and mortality based on epidemiological&#xD;
      data. In particular, short sleepers (e.g. sleep duration &lt; 6 hours) and poor sleepers&#xD;
      (reporting a non-restorative sleep) presented a higher risk of cardiovascular events&#xD;
      including death, coronary heart disease and stroke. Insomnia and sleep duration in the&#xD;
      general population were also reported to predispose to an increased risk of hypertension,&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high association between RLS and stroke was demonstrated in a few studies. RLS was found in&#xD;
      12% of 137 patients after stroke and predicted a worse outcome. Few case reports reported&#xD;
      high numbers of periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS), which are often associated with&#xD;
      RLS, in stroke patients. An association of RLS/PLMS with hypertension, cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases and stroke was also discussed in recent years. However, the large scale data on the&#xD;
      impact of RLS for the stroke outcomes are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible mechanisms linking sleep deficiency, poor sleep and sleep fragmentation with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disorders (including stroke) are multiple and include an elevated sympathetic&#xD;
      activation, procoagulatory and inflammatory changes, increased atherosclerosis, and changes&#xD;
      in cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation. However, the clinical relevance and the association&#xD;
      with clinical outcomes needs further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of sleep deficiency and sleep fragmentation&#xD;
      resulting from insomnia, SDB or RLS on the frequency of new cerebro- and cardiovascular&#xD;
      events after stroke or TIA including death of any cause, and clinical outcome within one and&#xD;
      two years after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of the study is the assessment of the frequency of all-cause deaths and new&#xD;
      cerebro- and cardiovascular events within 24 months after stroke or transient ischemic attack&#xD;
      in patients with and without sleep deficiency/fragmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main secondary objective is an assessment of clinical outcome 12 months after stroke in&#xD;
      patients with and without sleep deficiency/fragmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with acute ischemic stroke or TIA will be recruited at two Neurology Departments in&#xD;
      Switzerland (Inselspital Bern &amp; Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland Lugano). Two groups will&#xD;
      be formed based on the presence or absence of sleep deficiency/fragmentation assessed at one&#xD;
      month following stroke by questionnaires and telephone interviews. Examinations (at baseline&#xD;
      &amp; 3, 12 and 24 months follow up after stroke) will include standardized and validated&#xD;
      questionnaires assessing stroke outcome (independence and activities of daily living) as well&#xD;
      as insomnia, RLS, risk for sleep apnea, depression and apathy. Additional non-invasive&#xD;
      physiological assessments will be performed in about every fifth of all recruited patients in&#xD;
      the acute phase of stroke and after 3 and 12 months. They include ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements and wrist activity assessing 24h physical activity patterns over 3 weeks,&#xD;
      assessment of arterial stiffness/endothelial function and basic cognitive performance.&#xD;
