  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label observational study of pure CBD for the treatment for 25 children with&#xD;
      intractable epilepsy. As pure CBD is not FDA approved, the investigators are conducting this&#xD;
      study via the FDA expanded access mechanism on a compassionate use basis. The target patient&#xD;
      population is children with severe refractory epilepsy who have exhausted all other&#xD;
      reasonable avenues of treatment. These are patients for whom the risks of a relatively&#xD;
      untested product are outweighed by the potential benefit. Using seizure-diaries maintained on&#xD;
      a routine clinical basis, seizure frequency will be assessed four weeks prior to initiation&#xD;
      of CBD, one month after CBD initiation, and at least every 3 months thereafter. CBD will be&#xD;
      administered as an adjunct to all current anti-epileptic therapies.&#xD;

      Study Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to gain an understanding of the utility of pure CBD use for the&#xD;
      treatment of drug resistant epilepsy in this open-label dose-finding observational study. A&#xD;
      baseline seizure frequency will be recorded for each subject in a diary for four weeks prior&#xD;
      to investigational drug initiation and parents/caregivers will document seizures on a daily&#xD;
      basis throughout the study period. Investigational drug (CBD) will be administered as an&#xD;
      adjunct to all current anti-epileptic drugs. Once at their maintenance daily dose they will&#xD;
      be evaluated one month after achieving the final steady state dose and every three months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits will consist of neurological exam and seizure diary review. Baseline visit will take 1&#xD;
      hour and each visit thereafter will take approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and Tolerability Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on safety and tolerability of pure CBD is limited. According to the GW Pharma CBD&#xD;
      Investigator's Brochure (Appendix G), side effects reported as greater than placebo with&#xD;
      highly purified CBD in one clinical trial were conjunctival hemorrhage, change in vision,&#xD;
      diarrhea, flatulence, gastric reflux, joint pain, muscle pain, difficulty concentrating,&#xD;
      abnormal mood and trouble sleeping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be closely monitored for side effects during the titration and treatment&#xD;
      period and the dose and/or frequency may be adjusted as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBD is an inhibitor of CYP 2C19, CYP 2C9, and other cytochrome P450s belonging to the 2C and&#xD;
      3A subfamilies. The effects of CBD administered concomitantly with anti-epileptic drugs that&#xD;
      are metabolized by this enzyme system are unknown. Anti-epileptic drug doses will be adjusted&#xD;
      as needed based on signs and symptoms of toxicity and / or changes in drug levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of changes in seizure frequency:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All seizure types will be classified before study entry. Seizure type and frequency will be&#xD;
      monitored during baseline and treatment as recorded in a patient diary. For assessing the&#xD;
      efficacy of CBD, the investigator will count only change in the frequency of seizures (ie,&#xD;
      tonic seizures, clonic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures lasting more than 3 seconds, atonic&#xD;
      seizures, myoclonic seizures including myoclonic absences). In addition, parents/caregivers&#xD;
      will report:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in average seizure severity by seizure type, defined as an increase or decrease&#xD;
           in seizure duration or intensity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the number of episodes of status epilepticus, defined as convulsive seizure&#xD;
           lasting longer than 10 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the number of uses of rescue medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the number of ER visits/ hospitalizations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator will review all data relating to safety and tolerability&#xD;
      throughout the study, after every third patient has been treated, to monitor study conduct&#xD;
      and assess patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject may have a reduction in seizures. This study will help the researchers learn more&#xD;
      about the effectiveness and safety of CBD in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy.&#xD;
      Hopefully this information will help in the treatment of future patients with this condition.&#xD;
