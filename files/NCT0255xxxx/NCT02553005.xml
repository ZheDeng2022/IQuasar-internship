  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by functional&#xD;
      disability and pain. Although acupuncture is widely used, western acupuncture studies on RA&#xD;
      show no conclusive positive result. Acupuncture is regarded as a reflex therapy, and&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnosis was shown to be an individual neurovegetative&#xD;
      state allowing to individually allocated acupoints. Positive results were reported using a&#xD;
      classical diagnostic procedure to allocate acupoints to the patient according to the Shang&#xD;
      Han Lun. The investigators are interested if acupuncture compatible with this ancient theory&#xD;
      would be successful in improve hand function in RA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore developed a prospective randomized control trial in a three-armed&#xD;
      parallel group design with a standardized treatment intervention. Only patients with the TCM&#xD;
      diagnosis of a so-called Turning Point syndrome will be allowed in the experimental phase.&#xD;
      This may harmonize TCM diagnosis and the standardized intervention, in order to optimize&#xD;
      potential therapeutic effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is divided into two parts. First the investigators will follow a&#xD;
      non-experimental nature design. Based on the results of this exploratory study we will then&#xD;
      start a three-armed parallel-group study with equal randomization (1:1:1), prospective,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled and multicenter that will be conducted in Portugal (2&#xD;
      sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to include 381 patients with RA of the hands in accordance to the selection criteria.&#xD;
      The patients are going to be recruited from the national centers of rheumatology and patient&#xD;
      associations in the time from May 2015 to October 2016. All patients are supposed to sign an&#xD;
      informed consent at the time of enrollment according to the rules of the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 1 In the first task we are going to develop a non-experimental, exploratory and&#xD;
      descriptive nature design with the goal to describe the epidemiological, clinical and genetic&#xD;
      profile of patients with RA of the hands according to their TCM diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use an individual instrument for the collection of data to characterize the patients&#xD;
      socio-demographically and clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main characteristics, complaints and objective examinations of participants, will be&#xD;
      characterized by a qualified and experienced acupuncturist (first physician), in accordance&#xD;
      to the Heidelberg Model (HM) to TCM. This physician will assess the pain in the hand by using&#xD;
      a pressure algometer in two different distinct points. It is well known that the lower the&#xD;
      ability to tolerate the pressure is, the worse will be the individual pain. The same&#xD;
      researcher will also record clinical features based on data from tongue-diagnosis that will&#xD;
      have been conducted before by an Automatic Tongue Diagnosis System (ATDS). The results so far&#xD;
      demonstrate that the ATDS is very consistent even in settings with different environmental&#xD;
      lighting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation between pattern classification in TCM and biomarkers that are expressed in&#xD;
      genetic profiles in RA patients will be explored similarly to other recent studies whose&#xD;
      results indicated that different patterns could be regarded as a consequence of biological&#xD;
      networks with deviant gene expressions in various affected tissues and immune effector cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to financial limitations, we will only select 15 participants randomly from each of the&#xD;
      different TCM patterns found. Eight ml of venous blood will be collected in anticoagulation&#xD;
      tubes from each participant and will then be tested in a microarray assay by using the Trizol&#xD;
      extraction method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 2 Next, we aim to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on pain and strength of the hand&#xD;
      according to the criteria of the HM to TCM for a specific vegetative functional state called&#xD;
      the TP syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of 90 patients with clinical features of a TP syndrome will be assigned randomly to&#xD;
      one of three parallel groups, in a 1:1:1 ratio to either the control, verum or sham group&#xD;
      with the help of a computer-generated randomization programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first physician will mark the points with a red or blue colour on the patients that have&#xD;
      been randomized to the verum intervention group as well as on the patients that have been&#xD;
      assigned to the sham intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, the first physician will present these data to a study-coordination program that&#xD;
      will assign the colour-codes to a sequence of possible treatment modalities by using a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization table. A second physician will then be informed by the&#xD;
      programme about the colour of the points that is supposed to be needled. The second physician&#xD;
      will then perform a respective standardized needling technique to the selected points&#xD;
      indicated by the colour which corresponds to either the sham or verum points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We decided to use the Leopard Spot technique, a blood-letting acupuncture therapy that uses&#xD;
      sterile subcutaneous needles (0,30mmx8mm) and it is known to increase local microcirculation&#xD;
      by inducing a vegetative response. All patients will receive three sessions of treatment.&#xD;
      After the acupuncture session, the patients must dress with light garment to cover any&#xD;
      potential marks from needling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the treatments, the patients will return to the first physician for the&#xD;
      assessment of the outcomes. The first physician will not know which acupuncture points have&#xD;
      been used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be followed up for six times Assessment (0) will take place after&#xD;
      randomization; assessments (1), (3) and (5) will take place five minutes after the&#xD;
      intervention; assessment (2) will be done 24 hours after the first intervention and&#xD;
      assessment (4) three days after the first intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments include an evaluation of the patients tolerance to pain in the hand by using&#xD;
      a pressure algometer; a measurement of their grip strength with the help of a dynamometer and&#xD;
      an evaluation of the nerve conduction and muscle function in the hand using an&#xD;
      electromyography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 3 In this task we intend to do a longitudinal study to assess the effect of the&#xD;
      acupuncture treatment on inflammation and on the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients that had been randomized to groups 2 and 3 will be treated two times per week,&#xD;
      over a period of three weeks, respecting an interval of 72 hours in between treatments.&#xD;
      Therefore these participants will be followed up in the assessments (6), (8), (10), (12),&#xD;
      (14) and (16) - (before intervention) and assessments (7), (5), (9), (11), (13), (15) and&#xD;
      (17) - (five minutes after intervention) (Appendix 6). The assessments (0), (5) and (18) will&#xD;
      also include another parameter to measure the inflammation condition: the cortisol and&#xD;
      interleukins level in the saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients randomized to groups 1, 2 and 3 will be followed up in the assessments (0)&#xD;
      and (18) - 28 days after assessment (0), also to measure of pain by Visual Analogue Scale and&#xD;
      of quality of life by Health Survey SF-36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the first task will be conducted by analyzing statistical data, using&#xD;
      techniques of descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests. To the second and third tasks&#xD;
      the results will be analyzed by Pearson Correlation Coefficients and a Multivariate Analysis&#xD;
      of Variance with the significance set at p&lt;0,05.&#xD;
