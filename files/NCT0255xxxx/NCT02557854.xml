      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Doxil (liposomal doxorubicin) given prior&#xD;
      to MR-HIFU Hyperthermia is safe for the treatment of pediatric and young adult patients with&#xD;
      recurrent and refractory solid tumors.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 1-40 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed malignant extra-cranial solid tumor or demoid fibromatosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject's tumor must have relapsed after or failed to respond to frontline therapy&#xD;
             and there must be no other known curative therapies available. Patients with desmoid&#xD;
             fibromatosis must have relapsed after or failed to respond to at least one prior line&#xD;
             of therapy, and in the opinion of the treating physician surgical resection of the&#xD;
             tumor must not be possible without an amputation or other surgery predicted to result&#xD;
             in an unacceptable functional deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have a life expectancy of &gt; 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; 50% for patients &gt;16 years of age, or Lansky&#xD;
             performance status &gt; 50% for patients &lt; 16 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have at least 1 measurable target lesion &gt;10mm in longest dimension&#xD;
             that is in an anatomic location treatable by MR-HIFU. Note that for this study,&#xD;
             lesions in bone WILL be considered measurable provided they meet the other criteria by&#xD;
             RECIST and are confirmed to be metabolically active on baseline studies by either MIBG&#xD;
             uptake (for neuroblastomas) or PET avidity. Target lesions should be located so that&#xD;
             they can be adequately heated by a hyperthermia treatment cell with a diameter of up&#xD;
             to 58 mm, centered at a depth of 35 to 80 mm from the skin. There should be no&#xD;
             staples, implants, extensive scarring, or other highly ultrasound absorbing or&#xD;
             reflecting tissue in the expected beam path. For the first 5 patients enrolled on this&#xD;
             study only, the lesion must be located in the extremities or pelvis to be considered&#xD;
             treatable by MR-HIFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior therapy with&#xD;
             the exception of alopecia. The following time must have elapsed from the last dose of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received prior Doxil and progressed on this therapy are not&#xD;
             eligible, but subjects may have received prior doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of tumor progression within 30 days of anthracycline&#xD;
             administration are not eligible. However, subjects who have previously received an&#xD;

             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital&#xD;
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with conditions that carry high anesthetic risk in the opinion of the&#xD;
             treating anesthesiologist are not eligible (i.e. subjects with significant airway&#xD;
             compression by tumor or craniofacial abnormalities)&#xD;
