      Performance evaluation of LFT Dye Monitor System using ICG - plasma disappearance rate value&#xD;
      (PDR) to assess liver function in normal patients as well as in patients with mild to severe&#xD;
      hepatic impairment compared to manual Serum ICG PDR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Indocyanine green (ICG) is a water-soluble, non-toxic tricarbocyanine dye, extracted&#xD;
      principally by hepatic parenchymal cells and excreted almost entirely into the bile without&#xD;
      enterohepatic circulation. Clinically, its elimination rate is used primarily to measure&#xD;
      hepatic function and liver blood flow. ICG studies are also used in ophthalmic angiography&#xD;
      and the determination of cardiac output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning about 1959, the first human clinical studies were reported wherein an indocyanine&#xD;
      green (ICG) bolus was injected into a vein, and then blood samples were withdrawn over a&#xD;
      period of time and analyzed for ICG concentrations. This method is referred to hereinafter as&#xD;
      the serial blood sampling method. These blood samples are sent to a clinical laboratory for a&#xD;
      multi-step process of centrifuging, separation and spectrophotometric measurements of ICG&#xD;
      levels. The laboratory-based measured levels of residual ICG levels are then used to&#xD;
      determine the ICG clearance rate and R15 value or residual amount of dye remaining after 15&#xD;
      minutes, expressed as a percentage of the initial concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an alternative to the time- and labor-consuming serial blood sampling method, a&#xD;
      non-invasive technique was first reported nearly 20 years ago. In the first published&#xD;
      clinical study, Ishigami reported the use of a pulse dye densitometry (PDD) method to&#xD;
      transcutaneously detect the rate of clearance of ICG from the bloodstream to be referred to&#xD;
      hereinafter as dynamic liver function testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PDD expresses ICG elimination in terms of the indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate&#xD;
      because only relative ICG concentration changes are assessed. The results of this noninvasive&#xD;
      method have been shown to correlate with those obtained by the invasive method used in&#xD;
      critically ill patients (hemodynamically unstable and stable), and in patients after liver&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICG elimination rate after liver transplantation measured by either invasive or noninvasive&#xD;
      ICG methods is widely used to evaluate graft function. Studies have shown that ICG&#xD;
      elimination, measured on the day of transplantation, reflects graft function and can be used&#xD;
      to predict graft viability and the expected survival of the patient. Sequential measurements&#xD;
      of ICG elimination between days 0 and 28 of transplantation, have been shown to predict&#xD;
      clinical outcome in the early postoperative period after living donor transplantation. All of&#xD;
      the studies have shown that the ICG elimination rate is an accurate test for evaluating liver&#xD;
      dysfunction, but lacks the ability to differentiate the underlying causes of the hepatic&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike all currently existing PDD methods for performing liver function testing, LFT Dye&#xD;
      Monitor System employs a more sensitive method for the transcutaneous measurement of ICG&#xD;
      concentration level in the blood using NIR fluorescence, with a sensor that is attached&#xD;
      loosely to the scaphoid fossa of the ear. Thus, the chemical properties of ICG dye to&#xD;
      fluoresce when properly excited are used in the LFT system to enable much lower&#xD;
      concentrations of ICG to be detectable.&#xD;
