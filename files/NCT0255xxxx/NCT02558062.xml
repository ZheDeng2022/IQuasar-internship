  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients are often ventilated in dedicated critical care units to provide&#xD;
      respiratory support. Despite best practice patients can often develop a condition called&#xD;
      adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterised by deterioration in their&#xD;
      respiratory function, and changes on chest x-ray. The correct management for ARDS is&#xD;
      identifying the underlying condition causing the deterioration and identifying appropriate&#xD;
      targeted therapy. One such cause is pneumonia, caused by a bacterial infection in the lungs&#xD;
      of a ventilated patient. The patients may have been ventilated due to pneumonia but they may&#xD;
      also develop pneumonia whilst ventilated. Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) has&#xD;
      significant mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite all the clinical and laboratory data at the investigators' disposal there remains&#xD;
      great difficulty in the accurate diagnosis of pneumonia and therefore treatment is often&#xD;
      given empirically. Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need for accurate methods to&#xD;
      diagnose the presence of bacteria deep in the lung in ventilated critically ill patients. As&#xD;
      such, the investigating team have developed and synthesised an imaging agent called BAC ONE.&#xD;
      BAC ONE will be instilled directly into the lungs of 12 patients (with and without lung&#xD;
      infection) to assess whether it can label bacteria in the human lung.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this study is to deliver a BAC ONE microdose to ventilated controls&#xD;
      and patients with lung infection to assess the imaging parameters of BAC ONE over human&#xD;
      autofluorescence and to assess if bacteria can be detected in vivo in situ within the distal&#xD;
      lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to visualise the delivery of a microdose of BAC ONE and assess&#xD;
      imaging parameters in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 mechanically ventilated patients to provide a control population (cohort 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 bronchiectasis patients with predominant colonisation with gram-negative bacteria&#xD;
           (cohort 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 bronchiectasis patients with predominant colonisation with gram-positive bacteria&#xD;
           (cohort 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 patients with suspected pneumonia and pulmonary infiltrates in ICU (cohort 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all cohorts, eligibility will be verified by a clinical trial physician after written&#xD;
      informed consent has been obtained. For all cohorts, a bronchoscopy with lavage will be&#xD;
      performed to harvest broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Fibre-based endomicroscopy (FE)&#xD;
      will be performed on up to three areas and up to 80μg (± 25%) in total of BAC ONE will be&#xD;
      instilled in up to 3 sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to provide additional blood and urine samples with the intention&#xD;
      of examining for systemic uptake of the BAC ONE probe. Routine blood investigations will be&#xD;
      performed 4-6 hours following the administration of BAC ONE. All participants will either be&#xD;
      contacted by a member of the research team via telephone or ward visit 24 hours (± 4 hours)&#xD;
      after BAC ONE dosing to ensure no AEs/SAEs were experienced. The participant's involvement in&#xD;
      the study is concluded when the 24 hour assessment has been successfully completed and all&#xD;
      AEs/SAEs have been resolved.&#xD;
