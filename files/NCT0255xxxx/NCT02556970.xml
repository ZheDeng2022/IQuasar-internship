  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to establish if thoracoscopic surgery performed through a single port or&#xD;
      incision reduces early post-operative pain compared with conventional multiple port&#xD;
      thoracoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initial pilot study is designed to establish whether a trial of the two techniques is&#xD;
      acceptable to patients, clinically feasible and can be delivered in a reasonable timescale.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a patient- and assessor-blinded, multi-centre randomised trial with two groups (n=20&#xD;
      in each arm). Patients referred to Universities Hospital Bristol NHS Foundation Trust (n=20)&#xD;
      and Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (n=20) requiring elective VATS&#xD;
      lung surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified and recruited by the thoracic surgeons in their surgical&#xD;
      outpatient clinic. Participants will receive verbal and written information about the two&#xD;
      different surgical techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be sought by one of the surgical research nurses in the surgical outpatient&#xD;
      clinic after the thoracic surgeon has recruited them. On the rare occasion that this is not&#xD;
      possible, consent will occur in the pre-operative assessment clinic (POAC) at a later date.&#xD;
      All patients are seen in POAC at least 1 week prior to surgery except in extreme&#xD;
      circumstances. In POAC consent will also be sought by one of the surgical research nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given contact details for the study team should they have any questions&#xD;
      between consent and surgery. They will be able to withdraw consent at any time prior to&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be entered into a Trust-based computer that is password protected. Subject&#xD;
      names will be kept on a database and will be linked only with a study identification number&#xD;
      for this research. There will be no patient identifiers. Only the research team will have&#xD;
      access to this computer. Data will be stored in a locked office and maintained for a minimum&#xD;
      of five years after the completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be block randomised 1:1 in blocks of 10 between single port surgery and&#xD;
      multiple port surgery. Randomisation will occur by computer generation in theatre after&#xD;
      induction of anaesthesia using the website www.sealedenvelope.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment arm will involve performance of the planned surgical procedure through a single&#xD;
      incision in the chest wall, without rib spreading. The camera and instruments will be placed&#xD;
      through this single incision. Use of a soft tissue retractor is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control arm will undergo the operation through a standard 3-incision approach, again&#xD;
      without rib spreading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive skin dressings matching those for the multi-port technique,&#xD;
      irrespective of randomised allocation. Patients will be informed not to remove these&#xD;
      dressings for the first 24 hours. Surgical and anaesthetic staff members will be informed not&#xD;
      to communicate information about the treatment allocation to the patient or nursing staff.&#xD;
      The patient and the nursing staff undertaking pain assessments will not be aware of group&#xD;
      allocation for the first 24 hours. The research nurses collecting the data will also be&#xD;
      blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anaesthetic and surgical team involved cannot practically be blinded but will not be&#xD;
      involved in outcome data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive simple intra-operative analgesia in the form of 1g intravenous&#xD;
      paracetamol and 75mg intravenous diclofenac unless the patient is over 70 or has abnormal&#xD;
      renal function. Extra opioid analgesia will be given as intravenous fentanyl or morphine and&#xD;
      this will be titrated by the anaesthetist. The amount given will be documented as part of the&#xD;
      trial data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, multiple level (target at least 4) intercostal blocks will be&#xD;
      placed subpleurally under thoracoscopic visualisation. 2ml of 2.5mg/ml Chirocaine&#xD;
      (Levobupivicaine hydrochloride) will be injected into each space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative analgesia will compromise of 1g paracetamol four times a day for the first 3&#xD;
      days after surgery. Patient will receive IV morphine titrated to pain in recovery and&#xD;
      oramorph when they return to the ward. If patient is in significant pain a morphine patient&#xD;
      controlled analgesia (PCA) will be set up in recovery and for the first night after surgery&#xD;
      (1mg bolus, lockout 5mins). This will normally be discontinued on the first morning after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be recorded for all patients enrolled in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • At consent, a baseline quality of life score will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following times will be recorded on a sticker attached to the patient's anaesthetic&#xD;
      chart:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of induction of anaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of knife to skin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of skin closure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of extubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time arrived in recovery These times will be recorded by the research nurses allowing&#xD;
           the total surgical time (induction to skin closure) and total operative time (knife to&#xD;
           skin to skin closure) to be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative period (expected to be 36-48 hours post-surgery):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores are routinely recorded by the recovery nurses&#xD;
           and ward nurses every hour for the first 24 hours post operatively and subsequently&#xD;
           every 4 hours until discharge. So assuming the time into recovery is time zero the&#xD;
           investigators will collect a pain score at time zero and then every hour for the first&#xD;
           24 hours. The investigators will then collect a pain score every 4 hours until&#xD;
           discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction survey will be conducted on day 1 and day 2 post-op.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total morphine consumption prior to discharge will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of time chest drain remains in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volume of blood loss in chest drain in first 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 30 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will complete a telephone quality of life score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious adverse events recorded in first 30 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Readmission to hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Re-operation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Admission to ICU&#xD;

    <description>After induction of anaesthesia and lung isolation, a single intercostal incision will be placed laterally. This will usually be anterior to the border of the latissimus dorsi muscle, and in the 4th-7th space as appropriate to the planned surgery.&#xD;
A soft tissue wound protector can be used to protect the wound edges, but rigid intercostal retraction is not permitted. All instruments will be placed via this incision.</description>
