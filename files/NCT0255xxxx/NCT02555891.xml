      The overall objective of the present study will be to describe the occurrence of Potentially&#xD;
      Inappropriate Prescribing (PIP) in Ontario's elderly (&gt;65 yrs) population, assess the health&#xD;
      and economic burden associated with it, and evaluate interventions aimed at mitigating its&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To attain this objective, the investigators will test three specific hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Instances of Potentially Inappropriate Prescribing are frequent and costly. To&#xD;
      test this hypothesis, the investigators will apply a subset of the STOPP criteria and Beers&#xD;
      criteria to Ontario health administrative data to identify instances of potentially&#xD;
      inappropriate prescribing, and estimate potential savings, both direct and indirect, that&#xD;
      could be achieved by reducing inappropriate prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: ED visits and hospitalizations are significantly associated with Potentially&#xD;
      Inappropriate Prescribing. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will estimate the&#xD;
      attributable fraction of ER visits and hospitalizations associated with different frequencies&#xD;
      of PIP using multivariate methods and survival analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The likelihood of inappropriate prescribing is associated with patient and&#xD;
      physician characteristics. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will identify each&#xD;
      physician's annual PIP incidence density, calculated by dividing the number of PIP they&#xD;
      issued by the total number of prescriptions they provided over the study period and then&#xD;
      explore the association of patient and physician level covariates with patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test these hypotheses in the framework of a retrospective cohort study&#xD;
      which the investigators will conduct using Ontario's large health administrative and&#xD;
      population databases. These are housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences&#xD;
      (ICES) and contain information on both hospital and outpatient use of health services, as&#xD;
      well as demographic and socioeconomic data. Patients included in the study will be all OHIP&#xD;
      (Ontario Health Insurance Plan) eligible patients aged 66 yrs of age and older who have been&#xD;
      issued at least one prescription between April 1st 2003 and March 31st 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator team, housed at ICES@uOttawa, has extensive experience and expertise with&#xD;
      the analysis of these databases, and has the support and resources necessary to successfully&#xD;
      carry out this study.&#xD;

      Objective: The overall objective of the study will be to describe the occurrence of&#xD;
      Potentially Inappropriate Prescribing (PIP) in Ontario's elderly (&gt;65 years) population,&#xD;
      assess the health and economic burden associated with it, and evaluate interventions aimed at&#xD;
      mitigating its effects.&#xD;
&#xD;

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will apply a subset of the STOPP criteria and&#xD;
      Beers criteria to Ontario health administrative data to identify instances of potentially&#xD;
      inappropriate prescribing, and estimate potential savings, both direct and indirect, which&#xD;
      could be achieved by reducing inappropriate prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: ED visits and hospitalizations are significantly associated with Potentially&#xD;
      Inappropriate Prescribing&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will estimate the attributable fraction of ER&#xD;
      visits and hospitalizations associated with different frequencies of PIP using multivariate&#xD;
      methods and survival analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The likelihood of inappropriate prescribing is associated with patient and&#xD;
      physician characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will identify each physician's annual PIP&#xD;
      incidence density, calculated by dividing the number of PIP they issued by the total number&#xD;
      of prescriptions they provided over the study period and then explore the association of&#xD;
      patient and physician level covariates with patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Adverse drug events are common in the elderly, and contribute significantly to&#xD;
      emergency room (ER) visits and unplanned hospitalizations. Patients aged sixty-five and over&#xD;
      currently represent over 14% of the Canadian population, yet spending on prescription&#xD;
      medications by seniors accounts for over 40% of all retail prescription drug sales. This is&#xD;
      equivalent to a per capita spending on prescription drugs by seniors that is three times the&#xD;
      Canadian average. A recent Irish study showed that, of 600 elderly patients admitted to&#xD;
      hospital for an acute illness, 25% of them had one or more adverse drug events, of which two&#xD;
      thirds had contributed to the hospitalizations. Of these adverse events contributing to&#xD;
      hospitalizations, 69% were deemed avoidable. A number of tools and strategies have been&#xD;
      developed to identify potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP), however, until recently,&#xD;
      none of the commonly used tools had been shown to reliably predict adverse events. The&#xD;
      STOPP/START criteria (Screening Tool of Older Persons' potentially inappropriate&#xD;
      Prescriptions / Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment) was recently compared to&#xD;
      the long-standing Beers criteria, and found to detect adverse drug effects that are causal or&#xD;
      contribute to hospitalization in elderly patients with acute illness 2.8 times more often&#xD;
      than the Beers criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of these criteria is usually done in a clinical context, which involves&#xD;
      time-intensive and expensive chart reviews. There are relatively few studies looking at&#xD;
      appropriateness of prescribing at the population level, using health administrative data.&#xD;
      Applying tools to assess appropriateness of prescribing, such as a subset of the STOPP&#xD;
      criteria, to health administrative data can provide a unique opportunity to assess both the&#xD;
      frequency of potentially inappropriate prescribing and its associated costs, in terms of both&#xD;
      medication and health services use at the population level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: To achieve these aims, the investigators will conduct a retrospective cohort study&#xD;
      using Ontario's large health administrative and population databases, that contain&#xD;
      information on both hospital and outpatient use of health services, as well as demographic&#xD;
      and socioeconomic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted using Ontario administrative health databases housed at the&#xD;
      Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), which will be accessed from the&#xD;
      ICES@uOttawa site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of our work: By using health administrative data from the Institute for Clinical and&#xD;
      Evaluative Sciences (ICES) we expect to identify factors, both at the patient and prescriber&#xD;
      levels, that are associated with poor prescribing, and to show that a measure already in&#xD;
      place in some practice settings is effective at improving not only the quality of&#xD;
      prescribing, but also at reducing adverse outcomes associated with poor prescribing. This&#xD;
      evidence can provide the basis for targeted policy measures aimed at improving prescribing&#xD;
      quality and outcomes for Ontario seniors, and reducing costs.&#xD;

        Patients included in the study will be all OHIP (Ontario Health Insurance Plan) eligible&#xD;
        patients, 66 years of age or older and receiving at least one prescription medication&#xD;
        during study accrual period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individuals eligible for participation in the study will include all patients who were:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  continuously eligible for OHIP (Ontario Health Insurance Plan) coverage,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  issued at least one prescription (of any type) during the accrual period (between&#xD;
             April 1st, 2003 and March 31st, 2013),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  66 years of age or older at the date of first dispensation during the accrual period;&#xD;
             this is necessary to ensure the availability of one year of background information on&#xD;
             medication and health services use for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will be excluded if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They do not have a valid OHIP number. This includes individuals whose health care is&#xD;
             provided by other plans (e.g. First Nations people living on reserves, members of the&#xD;
             Canadian Armed Forces, and refugee claimants) and is therefore not captured by ICES&#xD;
             data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will also be excluded if they were not OHIP-eligible for at least one year&#xD;
             prior to the index date, or one year after the index date, or if they do not have&#xD;
             continuous OHIP coverage between these two dates; this is necessary to ensure that&#xD;
             predictors and outcomes of PIP can be adequately captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients not dispensed any prescription medication will not be included in the study.&#xD;
