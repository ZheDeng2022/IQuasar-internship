  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1b, platform study in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors. The study will be divided into 3 parts (Part 1a, Part 1b, and Part 2). Part 1a will&#xD;
      evaluate a JAK inhibitor with JAK1 selectivity (Itacitinib) in combination with an IDO1&#xD;
      inhibitor (epacadostat; INCB024360; Group A) and Itacitinib in combination with a PI3K-delta&#xD;
      inhibitor (INCB050465; Group B) to determine the MTD or PAD and the recommended Part 1b doses&#xD;
      for each combination. Once the recommended dose has been identified for each treatment group&#xD;
      in Part 1a, subjects with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled into expansion cohorts based&#xD;
      upon prior treatment history with a PD-1 pathway-targeted agent (Part 1b). In Part 2,&#xD;
      additional expansion cohorts will be enrolled to further evaluate lower doses of itacitinib&#xD;
      and INCB050465 in subjects with select tumor types.&#xD;
