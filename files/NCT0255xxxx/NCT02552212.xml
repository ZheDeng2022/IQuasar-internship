    <textblock>
      Patients with active Axial Spondyloarthritis without x-ray evidence of Ankylosing Spondylitis&#xD;
      and with signs of inflammation will be randomly assigned to receive certolizumab pegol (CZP)&#xD;
      200 mg every two weeks or placebo. The primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of&#xD;
      CZP in these patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score Major Improvement (ASDAS-MI) Response Criteria Response at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>This variable was considered as primary in all countries except for Canada (and any other country where applicable or where requested by Regulatory Authorities) where it was considered as secondary variable.&#xD;
ASDAS-MI was achieved when there was a reduction (improvement) &gt;= 2.0 in the ASDAS relative to Baseline, or when the lowest possible ASDAS score (0.6) was reached.&#xD;
The ASDAS was calculated as the sum of the following components:&#xD;
0.121 × Back pain (BASDAI Q2 result) 0.058 × Duration of morning stiffness (BASDAI Q6 result) 0.110 × Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGADA) 0.073 × Peripheral pain/swelling (BASDAI Q3 result) 0.579 × (natural logarithm [ln] of the (CRP [mg/L] + 1)) Back pain, PGADA, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling and fatigue were all assessed on a numerical scale (0 to 10 units, where 0 is &quot;not active&quot; and 10 is &quot;very active&quot;).</description>

    <description>This variable was considered as primary for Canada (and any other country where applicable or where requested by Regulatory Authorities) and as secondary variable in all other countries.&#xD;
The ASAS40 response was defined as relative improvements of at least 40 % and absolute improvement of at least 2 units on a 0 to 10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), where 0 is &quot;not active&quot; and 10 is &quot;very active&quot; in at least 3 of the 4 domains: Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGADA), Pain assessment (total spinal pain NRS scores), Function (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), Inflammation (mean of Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)) questions 5 and 6 concerning morning stiffness intensity and duration) and no worsening at all in the remaining domain.</description>

    <description>The BASDAI is a validated self-reported instrument, which consists of six 10 unit horizontal Numeric Rating Scales to measure the disease activity of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) from the subject's perspective. It measures the severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning stiffness (both severity and duration) over the last week. The final BASDAI scores ranges from 0 (not active) to 10 (very active), with lower scores indicating lower disease activity.

      <recruitment_details>This study started to enroll participants in September 2015. The study included a Screening Period, up to 6 weeks before Baseline, a Double-Blind (DB) Period from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 52, that included the open label CZP (OL-CZP) treatment and other treatment (OT) and an Open Label Safety Follow-up Extension (SFE) Period, up to Week 156.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The Participant Flow refers to the Randomized Set (RS).</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Subjects who completed Double-Blind Period received CZP 200 mg at Week 52, 54 and 56 to maintain the blinding and who completed the Week 52 Visit on placebo treatment received loading doses of CZP 400 mg at these visits. Subjects who completed the Week 52 Visit on CZP treatment received 1 injection of CZP 200 mg and 1 injection of placebo at these visits to continue their previous CZP treatment regimen and subjects who discontinued from Double-Blind Period and entered OL CZP treatment continued their OL CZP treatment regimen during Safety Follow-Up Extension (SFE) Period. Subjects received CZP 200 mg Q2W for up to 2 years during the SFE Period. An additional signed informed consent for the SFE was a pre-requisite For the additional milestone one (Received OL CZP; Completed Week 52 without starting SFE) reported in Double-Blind Period (Week 0 -52).</description>

        <description>This variable was considered as primary in all countries except for Canada (and any other country where applicable or where requested by Regulatory Authorities) where it was considered as secondary variable.&#xD;
ASDAS-MI was achieved when there was a reduction (improvement) &gt;= 2.0 in the ASDAS relative to Baseline, or when the lowest possible ASDAS score (0.6) was reached.&#xD;
The ASDAS was calculated as the sum of the following components:&#xD;
0.121 × Back pain (BASDAI Q2 result) 0.058 × Duration of morning stiffness (BASDAI Q6 result) 0.110 × Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGADA) 0.073 × Peripheral pain/swelling (BASDAI Q3 result) 0.579 × (natural logarithm [ln] of the (CRP [mg/L] + 1)) Back pain, PGADA, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling and fatigue were all assessed on a numerical scale (0 to 10 units, where 0 is &quot;not active&quot; and 10 is &quot;very active&quot;).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)</title>
        <description>The BASDAI is a validated self-reported instrument, which consists of six 10 unit horizontal Numeric Rating Scales to measure the disease activity of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) from the subject's perspective. It measures the severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning stiffness (both severity and duration) over the last week. The final BASDAI scores ranges from 0 (not active) to 10 (very active), with lower scores indicating lower disease activity. The change from Baseline is calculated, a negative value indicating improvement and a positive value worsening.</description>

An additional signed informed consent for the SFE was a pre-requisite For the additional milestone one (Received OL CZP; Completed Week 52 without starting SFE) reported in Double-Blind Period (Week 0 -52).</description>
