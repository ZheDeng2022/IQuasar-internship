  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) involves the narrowing of blood vessels connected to&#xD;
      and within the lungs. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a focal adhesion-associated protein&#xD;
      kinase involved in cellular adhesion and spreading processes which leads to stiffening and&#xD;
      thickening of blood vessels in lungs. This further increases the blood pressure within the&#xD;
      lungs and impairs their blood flow. This study aims to demonstrate biodistribution of FAK&#xD;
      inhibitor, GSK2256098, in cardiopulmonary sites i.e. heart and lung tissues. The uptake of&#xD;
      11C-radiolabelled GSK2256098 within the lung and / or heart of healthy subjects and&#xD;
      idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) patients will be assessed using Positron&#xD;
      Emission Tomography (PET). Based on study results the decision as to whether a follow-on&#xD;
      phase 2 trial should be initiated to investigate the therapeutic utility of GSK2256098 in&#xD;
      iPAH will be decided. Sufficient number of subjects will be screened (up to 30 days prior to&#xD;
      scan) to enrol 12 healthy subjects and 12 PAH patients in the study. Enrolled subjects will&#xD;
      receive a microdose of [11C]-GSK2256098 on a scanning day which will be followed by the&#xD;
      follow-up visit (2-4 weeks post-last dose).&#xD;
