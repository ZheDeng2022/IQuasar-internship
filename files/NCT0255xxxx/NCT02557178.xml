  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minnesota HealthSolutions Corporation (MHS) proposes to develop and evaluate a program to&#xD;
      motivate and monitor people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to complete&#xD;
      home exercise as part of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). The proposed system has two&#xD;
      components: home-based activity monitoring and health coaching. The investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a randomized, wait-list controlled clinical study to evaluate the effects of the&#xD;
      activity monitoring system and health coaching on quality of life and daily steps.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Physical Quality of Life Between the Intervention and Control Conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>Quality of Life measured at baseline (week 1) and week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Measure Description: The Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire measures physical and emotional aspects with 20 items in four domains/categories. The two domains/categories used for physical summary were dyspnea and fatigue. The items are assessed numerically on a 7-point modified Likert scale (from 1 to 7). Scores are obtained by adding the scores for the items that make up each category and dividing by the number of items. Physical quality of life is obtained by adding the fatigue and dyspnea scores and dividing by two; hence, the score range is from 1 to 7. Higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life. Scores are obtained by adding the scores for the items that make up each category and dividing by the number of items. A minimally important difference is a change in score of 0.5 or more.</description>

          <title>Quality of Life Physical Summary</title>
          <description>The Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire uses 20 items in four categories to assess quality of life. Physical summary uses the dyspnea and fatigue categories. The items are assessed numerically on a 7-point modified Likert scale. Scores for each category are obtained by adding the scores for the items that make up the category and dividing by the number of items. Physical summary adds the fatigue and dyspnea scores and divides by two; hence, the range for each item, domain, and physical scale is 1 to 7. A minimally important difference is a change in score of 0.5 or more.</description>

        <title>Change in Physical Quality of Life Between the Intervention and Control Conditions</title>
        <description>Measure Description: The Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire measures physical and emotional aspects with 20 items in four domains/categories. The two domains/categories used for physical summary were dyspnea and fatigue. The items are assessed numerically on a 7-point modified Likert scale (from 1 to 7). Scores are obtained by adding the scores for the items that make up each category and dividing by the number of items. Physical quality of life is obtained by adding the fatigue and dyspnea scores and dividing by two; hence, the score range is from 1 to 7. Higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life. Scores are obtained by adding the scores for the items that make up each category and dividing by the number of items. A minimally important difference is a change in score of 0.5 or more.</description>
