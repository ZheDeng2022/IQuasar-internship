      Clinical Trial: The investigators aims at comparing providing validated home BP device,&#xD;
      followed by group education of self-management of hypertension as well as self-BP monitoring&#xD;
      and appropriate medication in response to home BP reading, followed by nurse follow up with&#xD;
      usual care, which may possibly improve patients with uncontrolled hypertensions drug&#xD;
      adherence, and therefore improve their BP level in primary care setting. The investigators&#xD;
      will invite total 270 patients from 5 general outpatient clinic (GOPCs) to participate the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative study: The investigators would also like to evaluate patients' view and&#xD;
      operational concerns on self BP monitoring by individually interviewing 30 selected patients&#xD;
      with uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;

      Background Recent oversea randomized control trials have proven effectiveness of lowering&#xD;
      clinic and home BP if uncontrolled hypertensive patients were taught to perform home BP&#xD;
      monitoring properly with validated BP device. Patients were taught to response to home BP&#xD;
      reading (e.g. follow drug regime, or doctor adjust drug according to patients' home BP&#xD;
      record)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design 1. Prospective cluster randomized control trial, 2. Qualitative individual&#xD;
      interview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The investigators aims at comparing providing validated home BP device, followed by&#xD;
      group education of self-management of hypertension as well as self-BP monitoring and&#xD;
      appropriate medication in response to home BP reading, followed by nurse follow up with usual&#xD;
      care, which may possibly improve older adults with uncontrolled hypertension drug adherence,&#xD;
      and therefore improve their BP level in a primary care setting. The investigators would also&#xD;
      like to evaluate patients' view and operational concerns on self BP monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Adult Chinese on hypertensive treatment more than 12 months with uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension by mean clinic BP measurement on the day of recruitment. Uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension is defined as BP &gt; 140/90mmHg in subjects age &lt; 80; and BP &gt; 150/90mmHg in&#xD;
      subjects age≥80. You will be invited to participate if you are willing and capable to perform&#xD;
      self-home BP monitoring on daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size 270 (45 people from each clinic); 30 people for qualitative interview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment 3 clinics will be randomly assigned to intervention clinic while the other 2 will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to the control clinic (usual care)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention(s) Doctors and Nurses in intervention clinic will receive 1 hour briefing +&#xD;
      education on the background, scientific basis and detail of the program during lunch time.&#xD;
      Patients from intervention clinics will be invited to attend 2 x 2 hours education group&#xD;
      (15-30 subjects / group) ran by clinic nurses and doctors. You will be educated on basic&#xD;
      knowledge, management and drug for hypertension in the first session. In the 2nd session, a&#xD;
      certified valid Home BP device will be loaned to you for 6- 9 months and you will be taught&#xD;
      to perform home BP monitoring, record and respond to the BP reading accordingly. Upon&#xD;
      completion of session 2, you will be arranged for nurse individual follow up after 4-8 weeks&#xD;
      to see your progress and monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 people with uncontrolled hypertension will be interviewed individually for their opinion&#xD;
      on the program, management of hypertension and performance of home BP monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures BMI (BH/ BW), Waist circumference, Clinic BP (sitting position/ standing&#xD;
      position), Lab Test: FBS, Lipid profile, eGFR, Urine PCR, ECG Qualitative data for patient's&#xD;
      view on home BP monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up duration 6-18months&#xD;
