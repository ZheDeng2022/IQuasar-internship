  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves people with eating disorders and healthy volunteers (people who have&#xD;
      never experienced an eating disorder). Participants are interviewed about their psychological&#xD;
      and physical health by the experimenter and they have a simulated scan session (about 1&#xD;
      hour). Approximately 1 week after they attend the first study session. They are asked to&#xD;
      complete questionnaires and computerized tasks (about 30 minutes) followed by the active scan&#xD;
      (1 hour). During the brain scan they look at pictures and answer questions about the&#xD;
      pictures. After the first study session, people with eating disorders receive an intensive&#xD;
      meal-support intervention (in the following 3 months) aimed at reducing anxiety and fears&#xD;
      related to food (10 sessions lasting about 60 min.). Three months after the first brain scan,&#xD;
      participants with eating disorders and healthy controls receive a second assessment and brain&#xD;
      scan. We hypothesized that the meal support intervention will be effective in: 1) targeting&#xD;
      eating disorder symptoms (body mass index - BMI, primarily) and 2) producing functional&#xD;
      changes in brain regions that underline food-related anxiety and avoidance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by severe malnutrition. Patients report aversive&#xD;
      experiences of re-feeding and frequently drop-out from treatment. This study will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that gradual and guided exposure to food is associated with increased body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) and reduced eating disorder psychopathology in patients with AN. It is also&#xD;
      hypothesized that the intervention will lead to changes in brain activation in regions&#xD;
      implicated in anticipatory anxiety and fear of food and emotion regulation (i.e. amygdala,&#xD;
      insula, dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC]). Sixteen women with anorexia nervosa not&#xD;
      receiving any interventions at the time of the study will be recruited from the community.&#xD;
      Patients will complete a range of self-report measures and will undergo a functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) scan before and after receiving 10 exposure therapy sessions over 3&#xD;
      months. A matched healthy control group (n=20) will also have two brain scans 3 months apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible for the study, participants will have to be female, proficient in English,&#xD;
      right-handed, between 19 and 60 years. Participants in the clinical group will have to meet&#xD;
      the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa. Participants in the healthy control&#xD;
      group will be required to have a BMI between 18.5 and 25 kg/m² and no history of, or current,&#xD;
      mood and anxiety disorders. Additional exclusion criteria will be: history of head trauma,&#xD;
      hearing or visual impairment, neurological disease, claustrophobia, pregnancy, metal in the&#xD;
      body which cannot be removed, history of (or current) drugs and/or alcohol abuse; acute&#xD;
      suicidality, psychotropic medication (other than antidepressants in the patient group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and post-intervention changes in patients' BMI, anxiety, eating disorders symptoms, mood&#xD;
      and motivation to change will be assessed. Changes in brain activations in selected regions&#xD;
      of interest, including the DLPFC, amygdala and insula will be examined.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention entails 2 sessions of psychoeducation and a clinical assessment including a discussion on learned food-related fears, role of food-related fears in the maintenance of anorexia nervosa, anxiety and its time course, avoidance, exposure and habituation, irrational fears and safety behaviors; and 8 sessions of in vivo exposure to foods, starting from the least scary food of a hierarchy of threatening foods created by each patient. Each session will involve exposure to a new food item and patients will be encouraged to confront their fear by looking at and touching the chosen food item. They will also be encouraged to eat the food and reflect on the consequences of eating and assessing those relative to their fears (e.g. checking whether they have lost control or changed shape after eating).</description>
