    <textblock>
      Hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) and pseudohypoparathyroidism (Ps-hypoPT) are rare diseases,&#xD;
      characterized by low levels of parathyroid hormone [PTH] and plasma calcium or high plasma&#xD;
      PTH and low plasma calcium, respectively. A recently study by the investigators' group,&#xD;
      identified 123 living persons with idiopathic hypoPT and 62 living persons with Ps-hypoPT,&#xD;
      only few of these have been genetic tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to perform a detailed clinical and genetic characterization of Danish&#xD;
      patients with idiopathic hypoPT and Ps-hypoPT. Patients will be examined by questionnaires,&#xD;
      biochemistry, scans, bone biopsies and genetic tests. Furthermore the investigators aim to&#xD;
      perform family tracing for the hereditary forms. The prevalence of magnesium depletion will&#xD;
      be assessed as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to providing new information on symptoms, co-morbidity, and prognosis for this&#xD;
      group of patients, the investigators presume that the study may improve their understanding&#xD;
      on calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism in general.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a group of rare clinical disorders characterized by&#xD;
      hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphatemia with inappropriate low levels of parathyroid hormone&#xD;
      (PTH). Due to the lack of PTH, the renal production of 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol&#xD;
      (1,25(OH)2D) is reduced. Most often, HypoPT is caused by accidental removal of the&#xD;
      parathyroid glands during neck surgery (postsurgical hypoPT). However, in rare in-stances&#xD;
      HypoPT is caused by autoimmune disorders with immune mediated destruction of the parathyroid&#xD;
      glands, or a variety of genetic mutations, including the CATCH-22 (DiGeorge) Syndrome,&#xD;
      familial isolated HypoPT or an activating mutation in the gene encoding the calcium-sensing&#xD;
      receptor (CaSR), termed autosomal dominant hypocalcaemia (ADH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CaSR is not only found in the parathyroid glands, but is also expressed by other tissue&#xD;
      including the renal tubules. Low plasma levels of ionised calcium (Ca2+) are registered by&#xD;
      the calcium sensing receptors (CaSR) located e.g. in the cell membranes of the parathyroids&#xD;
      and in the renal tubules. Low levels of Ca2+ increases the release of PTH from the&#xD;
      parathyroids, which normalises plasma Ca2+ and decrease P-phosphate. Lack of PTH decreases&#xD;
      the renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, witch in combination with low PTH&#xD;
      decreases bone turnover. Although, large-scale meta-analysis of genome wide association data&#xD;
      incorporating 150 candidate genes did not link the CaSR to bone mineral density or&#xD;
      osteoporotic fracture risk, no specific data are available on whether BMD in patients with an&#xD;
      activating mutation in their CaSR gene (ADH patients) differs from the general population.&#xD;
      The largest case series of patients with ADH so far reported included 25 patients and did not&#xD;
      report BMD within this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium is of importance to many physiological processes, including cardiovascular&#xD;
      functioning. The CaSR has been suggested to be of importance in the regulation of blood&#xD;
      pressure and a Batter's like phenotype has been reported in patients with ADH. Although the&#xD;
      recent study by the investigators' group did not show an increased cardiovascular morbidity&#xD;
      in patients with postsurgical hypoPT, no data are available on blood pressure regulation or&#xD;
      indices of atherosclerosis in patients with idiopathic hypoPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PseudoHypoPT is due to PTH resistance in the target organs, causing hypocalcemia with&#xD;
      inappropriate high PTH concentrations. The phenotype in type 1 is known as Albrights's&#xD;
      hereditary osteodystrophy, (AOH) (maternal 2 of 8 allele). Pseudo-pseudoHypoPT is&#xD;
      characterized by AOH, but without the typical biochemical findings (pater-nal allele).&#xD;
      PseudoHypoPT type 2 has typical biochemical changes but no characteristic phenotype.&#xD;
      Discrepant results have been reported on effects on bone mineral density (BMD), as some&#xD;
      studies has shown a decreased BMD (hyperparathyroid bone disease), whereas other studies have&#xD;
      shown that BMD actually may be increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Untreated, hypoPT is characterized by an increased neuromuscular irritability including&#xD;
      weakness, muscle cramps, paraesthesias of the lips, tongue, fingers and feet, loss of memory,&#xD;
      headaches and uncontrollable cramping muscle movements of the wrists and feet (carpopedal&#xD;
      spasm). Other symptoms may be spasm of the facial muscles (Chovstek´s Sign) and the&#xD;
      contraction of the muscle produced by ischemia (Trousseaus Sign).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In long standing congenital cases there may be cataract and malformations of the teeth's. Due&#xD;
      to high blood phosphorous levels intracranial calcifications (basal ganglia) may be seen by&#xD;
      X-ray. Renal stones and renal failure may develop either because of the disease or its&#xD;
      treatment. Studies have shown that postsurgical hy-poPT is associated with a reduced quality&#xD;
      of life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to perform a detailed clinical and genetic characterization of&#xD;
      Danish patients with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, including pseudohypoparathyroidism.&#xD;
      Patients will be examined as detailed in the section on methods, and genetic tests will be&#xD;
      performed in patients who have not been tested previously. Furthermore the investigators aim&#xD;
      to perform family tracing for the hereditary forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional descriptive study on patients with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, autosomal&#xD;
      dominant hypocalcaemia and pseudohypoparathyroidism, including family tracing for inherited&#xD;
      forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with non-surgical hypoPT in Denmark will be invited by letter to participate in&#xD;
      the study. Patients who accept participation will undergo a detailed examination in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire/ interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life: To study the participants health related quality of life the WHO's 5&#xD;
           Well-Being Index, the Physical Activity Scale (PAS), and the SF-36v2 will be used in a&#xD;
           Danish version.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemistry incl. genetics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24hours urine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular indices: Blood pressure is measured in sitting position twice after&#xD;
           minimum 5 minutes of rest. The presence of atherosclerosis is assessed by tonometry&#xD;
           measuring pulse wave velocity and central aortic pressure using the SphygmoCor System.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle function- and postural stability: Isometric maximum voluntary muscle strength on&#xD;
           the dominant hand side is measured using a dynamometer connected to a computer (Good&#xD;
           Strength TM, Meititur Ldt, Finland) (25;26). Muscle strength is assessed at knee and&#xD;
           elbow flexion and extension. Similarly, grip strength on the dominant hand is measured.&#xD;
           Balance function is assessed by measuring the dynamic stability on a stadiometer&#xD;
           (Meititur Ltd, Finland). Two smaller physical tests are also performed, &quot;Repeated chair&#xD;
           stand test&quot; and &quot;Timed Up and Go-test&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Osteodensitometry: Bone mineral content (BMC) and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) is&#xD;
           assessed by Dual-Energy X-ray absorptiometry&quot; (DXA) using a Hologic Discovery scanner.&#xD;
           Measurements are performed at the lumbar spine (L1-L4), hip region, forearm, and the&#xD;
           whole body. Furthermore, body composition (lean and fat-tissue mass) will be determined&#xD;
           by DXA. Volumetric total, cortical, and trabecular bone mineral density (vBMD) at the&#xD;
           lumbar spine (L1+L2) and at the hip are assessed using quantitative computer tomography&#xD;
           (QCT) (Mid-ways Software Inc., Austin Texas, USA). Bone microarchitecture is assessed by&#xD;
           high resolution peripheral quantitative computer tomography (HRpQCT)-scans of the right&#xD;
           forearm and tibia using an XtremeCT scanner (Scan-co Medical).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone biopsies: a bone biopsy will be obtained from the iliac crest for histomorphometric&#xD;
           analyses. Prior to the biopsy, intravital tetracycline double marking will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family tracing: Investigations on first degree relatives will be performed in patients&#xD;
           with known inherited forms of hypoPT as well as in patients with hypoPT of unknown&#xD;
           origin. At first, family members will have plasma levels of calcium and PTH measured. If&#xD;
           results show signs of hypoPT, the relatives will be examined as the index persons&#xD;
           themselves (as detailed in this protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between study groups are assessed using Fisher's Exact Test for categorical&#xD;
      variables and a two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables, as&#xD;
      appropriate. Sample size calculation are as detailed in the section on hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general protocol has been approved by the Central Denmark Region Committees on Biomedical&#xD;
      Research Ethics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HypoPT is a rare disease and only few data are available on this group of patients. In&#xD;
      addition to providing new information on symptoms, co-morbidity, and prognosis for this group&#xD;
      of patients, the investigators presume that the study may improve their understanding on&#xD;
      mechanisms of importance to calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism in general.&#xD;
