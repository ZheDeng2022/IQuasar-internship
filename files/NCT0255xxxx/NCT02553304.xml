    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults in Western&#xD;
      countries; it is stratified as a subtype of indolent lymphoid malignancy with a long but&#xD;
      slowly progressive nature history. However, the clinical course of CLL actually varies&#xD;
      widely. Thus, many clinical and molecular features have been identified for outcome&#xD;
      predictions. The accurate predictions of prognosis through those factors help for the&#xD;
      decision making on the treatment, i.e. to treat patients of high risk of early progression or&#xD;
      poor overall survival (OS) with alternative or investigational therapies, while to avoid&#xD;
      unnecessary over-treatment for low-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLL is much less prevalent in Eastern countries; presently, most available data on CLL are&#xD;
      derived mainly from Western countries. However, a previous report concerning the epidemiology&#xD;
      of CLL in Taiwan revealed a drastic increase in the age-adjusted incidence of CLL, a trend&#xD;
      not found in Western countries where the incidence rate of CLL remained steadily stable over&#xD;
      time. In addition to this epidemiological difference, a population-based analysis has found&#xD;
      the overall outcome of CLL, estimated by relative survivals, is steadily much poorer in&#xD;
      Taiwanese patients than in US Caucasians. In another report about the cytogenetic profiles in&#xD;
      a small cohort of CLL patients in Taiwan, a novel cytogenetic abnormality was found to&#xD;
      correlate with poorer outcomes. These reports suggest the existence of ethnic differences in&#xD;
      the disease natures of CLL between the East and the West.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To delineate the possible underlying racial differences, especially in the molecular&#xD;
      prognostic profiles that might underlie the outcome disparity between Taiwanese and western&#xD;
      CLL patients, a comprehensive surveillance of the molecular profiles for CLL in Taiwan is of&#xD;
      importance. In this study, we are going to enroll around 250 CLL patients; their clinical&#xD;
      parameters will be recorded, their blood samples will be collected for a panel of molecular&#xD;
      and cytogenetic factor studies. The molecular markers to be tested in this project include&#xD;
      (but not limited to) cytogenetic abnormalities by fluorescent-in-situ hybridization (FISH),&#xD;
      immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) hypermutation status, gene mutations for&#xD;
      Notch1, SF3B1, p53, MyD88, and BIRC3, and the expressions for ZAP70 and stem cell factor&#xD;
      (SCF). These proposed markers include not only the conventional prognostic markers derived&#xD;
      from Western studies, and also some novel explorations from our preliminary results, such as&#xD;
      SCF and trisomy 3. Through this study, a comprehensive profile of CLL in Taiwan will be&#xD;
      established to identify the characteristics of CLL in Taiwanese patients and to address the&#xD;
      underlying factors of ethnic differences in the disease nature and outcomes of this disease.&#xD;
