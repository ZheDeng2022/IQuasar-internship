    <measure>Ex-vivo Inhibition Of Platelet Aggregation (IPA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Visit 5 (Day 22-29)</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of ASA in combination with cilostazol and clopidogrel in combination with cilostazol on IPA was determined ex vivo in citrated platelet rich plasma (PRP) after stimulation of aggregation by low-level adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (5 micromolar [uM]) and arachidonic acid (AA) (500 milligrams/liter [mg/L]). Light transmission aggregometry (LTA) was used to measure residual aggregation (the percentage of aggregation 5 minutes after the addition of ADP or AA). Results are reported as the 95% confidence intervals for the reported geometric mean ratios (GMRs) ([cilostazol+reference (ASA or clopidogrel)]/reference) for IPA.</description>

    <measure>Effects On Skin Bleeding Time (BT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 5 (Day 22-29)</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of ASA in combination with cilostazol and clopidogrel in combination with cilostazol on skin BT (minutes) was determined with the Ivy method, utilizing standardized bleeding with the Surgicutt device. Results include the 95% confidence intervals for the reported GMRs ([cilostazol+reference]/reference) for skin BT.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 77 healthy adult male participants were enrolled. Following administration of cilostazol in Period A and wash-out in Period B, participants were stratified according to CYP2C19 genotype and assigned to Groups 1-4 for further treatment in Periods C and D. Two participants who received cilostazol in Period A were not assigned to a group.</pre_assignment_details>

Participants who failed to return to baseline with respect to PF and skin BT were retested within a further week (Day 15 to Day 21). Participants with normal, extensive metabolic (EM) activity (CYP2C19 EM) received ASA 100 mg once daily (QD) for 7 consecutive days from Day 15 to Day 21 or Day 22 to Day 28 for participants who failed to return to baseline with respect to PF testing and skin BT at the scheduled visit 7 days after last administration of cilostazol (from Day 1 to Day 7) (Period C).

        <title>Ex-vivo Inhibition Of Platelet Aggregation (IPA)</title>
        <description>The effect of ASA in combination with cilostazol and clopidogrel in combination with cilostazol on IPA was determined ex vivo in citrated platelet rich plasma (PRP) after stimulation of aggregation by low-level adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (5 micromolar [uM]) and arachidonic acid (AA) (500 milligrams/liter [mg/L]). Light transmission aggregometry (LTA) was used to measure residual aggregation (the percentage of aggregation 5 minutes after the addition of ADP or AA). Results are reported as the 95% confidence intervals for the reported geometric mean ratios (GMRs) ([cilostazol+reference (ASA or clopidogrel)]/reference) for IPA.</description>
