    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Cardiac MRI&#xD;
      is a non-invasive non-ionizing technique for a comprehensive cardiac exam, which can be used&#xD;
      in the diagnosis of CAD. In this work, the investigators will develop and validate techniques&#xD;
      for accelerated cardiac MRI, offering better volumetric coverage of the heart, improved&#xD;
      contrast, and superior spatial and temporal resolutions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, even though&#xD;
      significant efforts have been made in prevention and diagnosis. The clinical gold standard&#xD;
      for diagnosis of CAD is catheter-based invasive x-ray angiography, performed more than a&#xD;
      million times per year. Of these examinations, up to 35% have been found to have no&#xD;
      significant stenosis, yet these patients had to go through the potential risks and&#xD;
      complications of an invasive test that further exposes the patient to ionizing radiation and&#xD;
      iodinated contrast. Thus, non-invasive diagnostic alternatives are highly desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac MRI (CMR) provides a method for a comprehensive non-invasive cardiac exam, including&#xD;
      contractile functional assessment (cine) to detect wall-motion abnormality, myocardial CMR&#xD;
      perfusion for diagnosing perfusion defects, viability assessment using late gadolinium&#xD;
      enhancement for evaluation of acute and chronic myocardial infarction, and coronary MRI for&#xD;
      the identification of stenosis. CMR is advantageous in several respects, since it does not&#xD;
      require ionizing radiation or iodinated contrast, thereby facilitating repeated or follow-up&#xD;
      scanning. However, long data acquisition time remains as one of its main limitations. Several&#xD;
      approaches have been studied to facilitate rapid CMR acquisition. Nonetheless, the&#xD;
      acquisition time for high-resolution CMR remains long, and spatial and temporal resolution is&#xD;
      traded off for acquisition time. Therefore, developments of methods to reduce the duration of&#xD;
      data acquisition beyond what is available now are appealing. The investigators will develop&#xD;
      novel reconstruction methodologies for high-resolution CMR that learn the anatomical&#xD;
      structures in the images being reconstructed. The investigators will validate these&#xD;
      techniques in a range of contrast-enhanced CMR imaging protocols, providing better volumetric&#xD;
      coverage of the heart, efficient use of the contrast agents, and higher spatial and temporal&#xD;
      resolution.&#xD;
