  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators seek to evaluate the effects of cannabidiol (CBD) on cocaine&#xD;
      craving and relapse. Cocaine addiction is characterized by compulsive substance use and&#xD;
      repetitive urges to consume the drug even after a sustained period of abstinence. While&#xD;
      substance use remains the most obvious direct outcome of addiction, there is a growing&#xD;
      interest in other core symptoms of this disorder. Craving has become a subject of great&#xD;
      interest as it is a reliable intermediate phenotype of cocaine relapse and a distressing&#xD;
      symptom of addiction associated with suffering. Indeed, even after a period of abstinence,&#xD;
      cocaine-dependent individuals remain vulnerable to stress and other craving-inducing stimuli,&#xD;
      which, in turn, lead to intense physiological responses and various negative feelings such as&#xD;
      anger and sadness. Real-time daily monitoring of craving and drug use has shown that craving&#xD;
      predicts cocaine relapse among cocaine-dependent individuals. In sum, working toward&#xD;
      improving the treatment of craving could not only help prevent relapse, but also reduce&#xD;
      patient distress on emotional, cognitive, and physiological levels. In the past decades,&#xD;
      significant scientific efforts have been deployed toward the development of innovative&#xD;
      strategies to beat cocaine addiction, but with partial success thus far. Psychosocial&#xD;
      approaches have been widely used to help cocaine-dependent patients achieve better outcomes&#xD;
      after drug cessation, but literature indicates that these strategies alone are at times&#xD;
      insufficient to induce significant behavioural changes or a reduction in rates of drug&#xD;
      consumption. Unlike other types of addiction, such as opioid and alcohol, no pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment has yet been found to be truly effective in relieving cocaine-cessation symptoms&#xD;
      like craving and anxiety or to prevent relapse. CBD is a natural cannabinoid with a&#xD;
      favourable tolerability profile and discrete neurobiological actions that are linked to&#xD;
      neural circuits closely involved in addiction disorders. Addiction to cocaine is&#xD;
      characterized by alternating phases of intoxication and short abstinence, followed by&#xD;
      recurrent drug-craving episodes which result in distress and relapse. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      CBD a cannabinoid known for its broad spectrum properties is an interesting pharmacological&#xD;
      contender to decrease cocaine craving and treat cocaine addiction. Previous studies conducted&#xD;
      in animals and humans confirm that CBD is a very safe and tolerable medication.&#xD;

      The investigators will carry out a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial to assess the effects of 92 days of CBD 400 mg (for the first 2 days&#xD;
      starting on Day 2 of the study) or 800 mg (subjects who report side effects with the 800mg&#xD;
      dose will be administered the CBD 400 mg dose for the remainder of the trial) or placebo on&#xD;
      cocaine craving and cocaine use among 110 cocaine-dependent individuals. Phase I of the trial&#xD;
      will assess the effects of CBD or placebo administration on cocaine craving in the context of&#xD;
      a 10-day inpatient medical detoxification period. Phase II of the trial will be a 12-week&#xD;
      post-detoxification outpatient follow-up period.&#xD;
