  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a course of acupuncture is effective in the&#xD;
      management of peripheral neuropathy related pain in patients receiving chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants and settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients with lung, breast, head &amp; neck, colorectal or gynaecological cancer receiving&#xD;
      taxanes or platinum-derivative chemotherapy experiencing CIPN after the end of cycle one will&#xD;
      be the population of the study. The study will take place in a large cancer centre in the&#xD;
      territory (Prince of Wales Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Potential subjects will be identified (through clinic lists and databases of patients who&#xD;
      are undergoing treatment) and approached initially by the relevant clinical team and&#xD;
      screening then undertaken by research staff. The trial will be run ethically, details of&#xD;
      which process can be seen under additional material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients will be allocated to a group through computer-generated randomisation to be done&#xD;
      at the Prince of Wales clinical trials unit. Randomisation will consist of minimisation with&#xD;
      a random element (stochastic minimisation), balancing for the treatment types (taxanes or&#xD;
      platinum analogues received) at a ratio of 1:1 to the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The acupuncture intervention is described below based on the STRICTA recommendations for&#xD;
      reporting acupuncture trials. In the acupuncture group, patients will receive, in addition to&#xD;
      standard care, a standardised 30-minute acupuncture session needling specific body points&#xD;
      although there will be flexibility in case some points cannot be punctured (ie. in case of&#xD;
      lymphoedema), and alternative points (as in routine practice) may be selected by the&#xD;
      therapists using their discretion to maintain an equal dose of treatment to all patients. The&#xD;
      points will be standardised according to the clinical manifestations of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The comparison arm will be a standard care control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Treatment duration will be 8 weeks. The duration of each patient's involvement in the study&#xD;
      will be 20 weeks (5 months) with assessments at baseline, end of 8-week treatment, 14 weeks&#xD;
      and 20 weeks. Based on available numbers in the study hospital, recruitment will be at 10&#xD;
      subjects/month, requiring 11 months for trial recruitment. Four months are assigned for trial&#xD;
      set up, preparation and staff training, 5 months for follow-up of last patient recruited, and&#xD;
      4 months for data cleaning, analysis and report writing (=24 months study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Functional status and Quality of Life [baseline, week 8, week 14, week 20 to assess&#xD;
           changes from baseline over time]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary outcome is assessment of Pain at 8-weeks (end of acupuncture treatment): Pain:&#xD;
           'worst pain during past week' will be measured using the Brief Pain Inventory which&#xD;
           measures pain intensity and its interference with function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The NCI-Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) for Adverse Events will be completed at&#xD;
                baseline and week 8 to assess change from baseline. This is a physician based&#xD;
                grading system that includes criteria and definitions for quantifying and grading&#xD;
                CIPN (both neurosensory and neuromotor components). This grading scale comprises a&#xD;
                sensory and motor assessment and utilises a 5-point scale ranging from grade 1 to&#xD;
                grade 5. Previous studies demonstrated that the CTC scale is a quick to use, easy&#xD;
                to administer and most useful in carrying out a screening procedure for choosing&#xD;
                which patients need a neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Total Neuropathy Score clinical version (TNSc) will be completed at baseline&#xD;
                and week 8 to assess change from baseline.. The TNS combines information obtained&#xD;
                from grading of symptoms, signs, nerve conduction studies, and quantitative sensory&#xD;
                tests, and provides a single measure to quantify neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Functional assessment of cancer therapy (FACT/GOG-Ntx) will be completed at&#xD;
                baseline, week 8, week 14, week 20 to assess changes from baseline over time. This&#xD;
                is a 38-item self reported questionnaire, divided into two sub-scales: the first&#xD;
                one is a 27-item general assessment of quality of life sub-scale (FACT-G) while the&#xD;
                second one is a 11-item neurotoxicity sub-scale. This tool demonstrated good&#xD;
                internal reliability and construct validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Consumption of analgesics will also be measured with a patient diary, as well as&#xD;
                the presence of other related symptoms (ie. fatigue, sleep, etc) using the 10-item&#xD;
                Symptom Distress Scale at baseline, week 8, week 14, week 20 to assess changes from&#xD;
                baseline over time] .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sensory examination [baseline and at the end of Acupuncture course -8 weeks- to assess&#xD;
           change from baseline] Sensory examination will take place by the doctor/nurse using 10-g&#xD;
           monofilament to lightly touch the patient's hands and feet bilaterally with the patients&#xD;
           eyes closed. The monofilament test is a standardised plastic filament that will be&#xD;
           pressed against parts of the hands and feet. When the filament bends, its tip is&#xD;
           exerting a pressure of 10-gr. Abnormal responses including hyperesthesia, anesthesia or&#xD;
           hypoesthesia will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Neurophysiological testing will include a detailed motor nerve conduction study of&#xD;
                the following nerves on the affected limbs. For upper limbs, the test will include:&#xD;
                median nerve (bilateral) and ulnar nerve (bilateral). For lower limbs, the test&#xD;
                will include peroneal nerve (bilateral), tibial nerve (bilateral). There will be&#xD;
                provision of the most sensitive parameters to register any axonopathy or&#xD;
                demyelination. Distal latencies, amplitudes and conduction velocities will be&#xD;
                measured. F-waves will be also performed. For the sensory nerve conduction part,&#xD;
                the following nerves will be studied. For upper limbs, the test will include:&#xD;
                median nerve (bilateral) and ulnar nerve (bilateral). For lower limbs, it will&#xD;
                include sural nerve (bilateral). We anticipate that the most common abnormalities&#xD;
                will reside in the sensory nerve conduction study with axonal derangement as the&#xD;
                most common manifestation. Knowing the test may cause a little bit discomfort to&#xD;
                participants, so participation in the testing is voluntary. We expect that equal&#xD;
                number of participants in the intervention group and control group will participate&#xD;
                in the testing (n=25 per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sociodemographic and treatment characteristics will be obtained from the patients'&#xD;
                records or patients themselves at baseline. Patients will be asked about treatment&#xD;
                expectations, how much they believe this method will help them alleviate their pain&#xD;
                and how much faith they have in acupuncture (10-point scales). As CIPN is managed&#xD;
                with dose reductions in clinical practice, chemotherapy dosage documentation&#xD;
                (cumulative dosage received, dose reductions, dosage each cycle, completed number&#xD;
                of cycles, chemotherapy type) will also be collected. The dosage information is&#xD;
                necessary to use this data as a covariate in the data analysis, if the dosing is&#xD;
                not constant across patients. Adverse effects will be monitored and collected from&#xD;
                patients or researchers at each clinic visit for the duration of the acupuncture&#xD;
                treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measurement of costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will explore the cost impact data and capture the frequency, type and extent of the costs&#xD;
      of and service utilisation by patients. This will be done at week 14 only covering the period&#xD;
      from start of treatment until week 14. This is the first time a cost evaluation is taking&#xD;
      place in a cancer symptom-related acupuncture trial. More specifically, costs will be&#xD;
      identified, measured and valued using a micro-costing approach (by which each component of&#xD;
      resource use is identified, estimated and a unit cost derived from market prices and national&#xD;
      estimates). The cost analysis will be performed from the perspective of the health service&#xD;
      provider and from a societal perspective. Included in the health care provider costs will be&#xD;
      those accrued by the hospitals and general practitioners. Costs to the patients and their&#xD;
      families, including social care, will be considered as the additional costs for society.&#xD;
      Indirect costs in terms of workdays lost will also included. Data will be collected&#xD;
      prospectively and retrospectively using a questionnaire designed by the University of&#xD;
      Leeds.multiple sources including patient records and patient self reported questionnaires.&#xD;
      The questionnaires will determine health service utilisation as a result of CIPN (e.g.&#xD;
      outpatient or general practitioner visits), patient out of pocket expenses such as over the&#xD;
      counter medicines or transport together with use of services in the social sector such as&#xD;
      home help and support from family and friends. Valuation of resource items including hospital&#xD;
      resources (e.g. bed days and staff time) and community resources (e.g. general practitioner&#xD;
      visits, home help) use will be carried out using national estimates; market prices will be&#xD;
      assigned to medication; non-market items, specifically patient time and informal help&#xD;
      provided by family and friends, will be valued using market wage rates; out of pocket&#xD;
      expenses (e.g. bus fares) will also be obtained. We have used this approach successfully in a&#xD;
      multisite acupressure trial with 500 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Analyses will include descriptive statistics to summarise the data, analysis of variance to&#xD;
      assess between-groups differences for primary and each of the secondary outcomes, and&#xD;
      regression analysis (such as ANCOVA) using the baseline pain score as covariate. 95% CIs will&#xD;
      also be calculated. In more detail, while a t-test is adequate for analysis, analysis of&#xD;
      covariance will be used with the baseline pain score as a covariate and centre and trial arm&#xD;
      as grouping factors. Equivalent analyses will be performed for the week 20 data (although it&#xD;
      is acknowledged that such analyses would not be independent of the 14-week scores, as it is&#xD;
      likely the week-14 and week-20 values will be correlated). Drop-out cases and non-respondents&#xD;
      will be asked to complete the primary outcome scale (1-item) and the 5 items of the CTC scale&#xD;
      on CIPN in order to capture outcomes in as many patients as possible in the intention to&#xD;
      treat analysis, and if this is not feasible, we will use data imputation (LVCF: last value&#xD;
      carried forward). An intention-to-treat analysis will be carried out.&#xD;
