      Background: More than 10% of the adult population in Styria, a federal state in the south of&#xD;
      Austria, is allotted to a stationary stay at a health resort each year. In practice&#xD;
      approximately 50.000 adults receive these stays that are financed from the health insurance&#xD;
      companies and that last up to 3 weeks. The target group for theses stays is the general&#xD;
      population aged between 30 and 65 years that shows minor health deficits like back pain or&#xD;
      risk factors for cardio-metabolic diseases. The treatment during the stays consists of&#xD;
      exercise, nutritional and psychological interventions. Thus the increase of physical activity&#xD;
      is an important goal that is focussed during the stationary stay. Because of the absence of&#xD;
      regional facilities that are linked to the resorts and that provide accesses to standardised&#xD;
      regional programmes sustainability is questionable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: This prospective controlled open label study compares two study groups. After&#xD;
      a stationary stay at a health resort patient are allocated to a standardised, regional&#xD;
      sports-club based exercise programme or to another group, where only written hand-outs are&#xD;
      provided. The primary outcome is the weekly level of health enhancing physical activity which&#xD;
      is objectively measured with an accelerometer and an activity log-book. Additionally, social&#xD;
      determinants are requested, fitness and anthropometric measurements are done at baseline&#xD;
      until 12 months. Beside the changes in measurable parameters, processes are evaluated&#xD;
      accurately. Consequently the gateway - function of the health resort is analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The structured cooperation between the health sector, where health resorts&#xD;
      informing and assigning patients to regional sports-clubs and the sports sector potentially&#xD;
      provides a wide network of standardised programmes. Within this study we aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      sustainability of stationary stays and a continuing regional standardised exercise programme.&#xD;
