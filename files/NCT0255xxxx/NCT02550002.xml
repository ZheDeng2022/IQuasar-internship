    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test non-inferiority of aflibercept &quot;treat and&#xD;
      extend&quot; using a relaxed retinal fluid management relative to aflibercept &quot;treat and extend&quot;&#xD;
      using a strict retinal fluid management SD-OCT (spectral domain optical coherence tomography)&#xD;
      disease activity guided retreatment with respect to best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from&#xD;
      baseline to end of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly&#xD;
      population in developed countries. Severe visual loss in AMD usually occurs in patients with&#xD;
      neovascular AMD (nAMD), which is caused by vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A)&#xD;
      driven choroidal neovascularization (CNV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravitreal therapy with VEGF-A inhibitors is the current standard treatment for nAMD.&#xD;
      Optimization of current VEGF-A therapies includes finding a dosing regimen that maximizes&#xD;
      visual acuity (VA) and minimizes the frequency of intravitreal injections and associated&#xD;
      risks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;treat and extend&quot; protocol is OCT guided with the primary aim of complete resolution of&#xD;
      all retinal fluid, i.e. both intraretinal fluid (IRF) and subretinal fluid (SRF), both of&#xD;
      which are considered to be a sign of disease activity. Once all fluid is resolved, an&#xD;
      extension of the treatment interval by 2 weeks is mandated. If there is return of either SRF&#xD;
      or IRF, the interval is shortened by one week. Currently, the relevance of both IRF and SRF&#xD;
      in relation to best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) outcomes is still being disputed. From the&#xD;
      CATT and VIEW studies there is some reason to suspect that some SRF may be allowed to remain&#xD;
      to extend the treatment interval without affecting BCVA. In contrast to IRF which has clearly&#xD;
      been shown to correlate with poorer VA and is considered to be a sign of active disease, SRF&#xD;
      may only be a sign of impaired pumping function of the RPE, similar to what is seen in&#xD;
      central serous chorioretinopathy and as such may not be considered as an indication of&#xD;
      ongoing disease activity. The consequence of insisting upon complete lack of SRF (strict&#xD;
      approach) is more injections and therefore increased exposure of the retina to anti-VEGF&#xD;
      agents. And there are recent reports that frequent intravitreal injections may lead to&#xD;
      changes in the retinal nerve fiber layer and increased risk of geographic atrophy&#xD;
      development. As a consequence, limiting the number of injections would be desirable if the&#xD;
      same VA result could be achieved. From the pivotal anti-VEGF studies it has become apparent&#xD;
      that patients show an individualised response to therapy. As such optimization of&#xD;
      individualized treatment needs to be explored and understood. This study aims to explore&#xD;
      further the &quot;treat and extend&quot; approach and will evaluate and compare two individualized&#xD;
      aflibercept treatment regimens, differentiated by the definition of disease activity which&#xD;
      determines the treatment interval until the next injection. The aim will be to determine&#xD;
      whether small amounts of SRF may be tolerated using a &quot;treat and extend&quot; regimen in the&#xD;
      treatment of nAMD and whether the presence and extent of both intra-retinal fluid and/or&#xD;
      sub-retinal fluid (SRF) helps to decide on extension or reduction of treatment intervals in a&#xD;
      &quot;treat and extend&quot; regimen. The results will be used to generate further recommendations&#xD;
      about strict versus relaxed treatment approaches and how they can be utilised within a&#xD;
      clinically practical &quot;treat and extend&quot; approach to maximize patient outcomes, while reducing&#xD;
      the need for potentially unnecessary intravitreal injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking all together, the study aims for optimization of flexible patient treatment.&#xD;
