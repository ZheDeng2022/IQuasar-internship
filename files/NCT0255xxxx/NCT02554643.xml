    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the impact of a soccer training program lasting 12 weeks&#xD;
      in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 60 sedentary adults and elderly patients with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes mellitus (age: 50-75 y), with a BMI &gt; 25kg/m2 and &gt; 29kg/m2, respectively, from&#xD;
      the Hospital of the Medical Faculty of São Paulo University will participate in this study.&#xD;
      They will be randomly divided in 3 groups (soccer, running and control). All patients will&#xD;
      undergo the following assessments: anthropometric, dietary, physical performance,&#xD;
      inflammatory, metabolic and hormonal parameters such as gene expression, bone markers and&#xD;
      predictors of cardiovascular disease. In addition the investigators aim to evaluate the body&#xD;
      composition of these patients by DXA, and muscle and visceral lipids content by proton&#xD;
      spectroscopic MRI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the regular soccer practice on cardiorespiratory fitness,&#xD;
      body composition, bone health and metabolic and hormonal variables, and compare it with other&#xD;
      types of classic aerobic training, such as running, for example .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soccer is a high popularity team sport, with more than 400 million active practitioners in&#xD;
      the world, and due to various motivational and social factors of this activity we can&#xD;
      consider it as a great tool potential in promoting the health of sedentary individuals, but&#xD;
      football fans. Thus, we believe that the combined use of exercises that make up the soccer&#xD;
      training, such as running, walking, sprints, acceleration, deceleration, jumps, side court,&#xD;
      dribbling, etc., can result in significant adaptive changes in the physiological system,&#xD;
      contributing improvements in cardiovascular function, bone mineralization in muscle strength,&#xD;
      physical performance and metabolism of lipids and glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore we aimed to investigate in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 the impact of a&#xD;
      soccer training program with 12 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body composition, by examining DXA, assessing the content of lean mass and fat mass;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the concentration of muscle and visceral fat by means of nuclear magnetic resonance&#xD;
           spectroscopy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the bone markers for the quantification of osteocalcin hormone, carboxy terminal&#xD;
           telopeptides (CTX), propeptide amino-terminal of procollagen type I (P1NP), parathyroid&#xD;
           hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxy vitamin D, growth factor insulin-like-1 free ( IGF1-free);&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a secondary objective, we intend to evaluate the impact of soccer training and classic&#xD;
      aerobic exercise on metabolic and hormonal variables of type 2 diabetic patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the parameters of cardiovascular disease, for investigating blood pressure and&#xD;
           quantification of lipid fractions (total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides) and&#xD;
           C-reactive protein;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical performance, evaluating the physical capacity by examining ergospirometry;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and the metabolic variables, enzymatic and hormonal following: blood glucose, glycated&#xD;
           hemoglobin (HbA1c), tolerance test oral glucose (OGTT), blood lactate, free fatty acids,&#xD;
           blood count, insulin, proinsulin, leptin, adiponectin, and enzymes AST, ALT, CK and DHL.&#xD;
