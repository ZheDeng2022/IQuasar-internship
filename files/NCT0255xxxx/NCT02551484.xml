  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      50 patients will be included for each of the 2 procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - For procedure 1: Patients will be selected during multidisciplinary consultations for&#xD;
      amputees who are stabilized with their definitive prosthesis and have returned to their usual&#xD;
      place of residence. The aim of this procedure is to show the validity and reproducibility of&#xD;
      measurements of tissue oxygenation using NIRS (TcPO2 being the reference measurement), to&#xD;
      determine the way in which NIRS measurements are more precise (i.e. in terms of validity and&#xD;
      reproductibility) (values at rest with the patient lying perfectly flat or with the amputated&#xD;
      limb raised 30°). These patients will require a single visit which will include measurements&#xD;
      by NIRS and TCPO2, a walk test and the completion of 2 questionnaires (visual scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      - For procedure 2: The patients will be included in the initial phase of postamputation&#xD;
      rehabilitation, during the period of in-hospital rehabilitation. The main problems of healing&#xD;
      and tolerance to the temporary prosthesis arise during this phase. The specific objectives&#xD;
      will be: To show that measurement by NIRS predicts the quality of healing in trans-tibial&#xD;
      amputees; to show that the zone of uncertainty concerning the predictive values for the&#xD;
      viability of the stump is smaller with NIRS than with TcPO2 (better discrimination). NIRS and&#xD;
      TCPO2 measurements as well as the evaluation of stump healing will be done 15, 30 and 45 days&#xD;
      after the amputation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with associated chronic motor deficiency, of a neurological origin (examples:&#xD;
             sequelae of stroke, balance and coordination disorders), or osteo-articular disease&#xD;

             making it impossible for amputees to walk with a prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe medical disorder that significantly impairs functional abilities (severe heart&#xD;
             failure, respiratory failure, non-stabilized metabolic disorders, such as progressive&#xD;
             kidney failure) and diseases with an impact on short or medium-term survival&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Complications, other than microcirculatory, with the stump, able to affect the use of&#xD;

             tissues, bone spur, infection (skin, abscess), neurinoma, deterioration of the knee&#xD;
             joint of the amputated limb, angle of the tibial cut leading to specifically painful&#xD;
             osteo-cutaneous impingement, venous thrombosis, abnormal shape of the stump making it&#xD;
             unsuitable for a socket (flexum of the knee, &quot;pear shaped&quot; stumps or stumps with&#xD;
             severe invaginations )…&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Local skin disorders in the measurement zone (summit of the antero-external area) of&#xD;

             TcPO2) : severe edema, hyperkeratosis, ulceration, inflammatory and infectious&#xD;
             phenomena.&#xD;
