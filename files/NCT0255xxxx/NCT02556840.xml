  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maturity-onset diabetes of youth (MODY) are the most frequent monogenic diabetes with&#xD;
      autosomic dominant inheritance (2% of diabetes). The MODY2 diabetes is related to a defect in&#xD;
      the glucokinase (GCK) enzyme, the first limiting step of insulin secretion. An abnormal GCK&#xD;
      leads to a delayed insulin secretion. Patients with GCK mutations have only mild raised&#xD;
      fasting plasma glucose. Treatment is usually unnecessary since hyperglycemia is stable and&#xD;
      MODY2 patients have no microvascular complications of diabetes. In contrast, pregnancy in&#xD;
      MODY2 women is a challenging situation. A non-mutated fetus will produce excess insulin in&#xD;
      response to raised maternal blood glucose leading to an accelerated growth and a higher risk&#xD;
      of macrosomia. The mother of non-mutated fetus should therefore be treated to normalize her&#xD;
      blood glucose levels. On contrary, a mutated fetus will produce a delayed insulin secretion&#xD;
      (as his MODY2 mother) in response to maternal hyperglycemia. Consequently insulin therapy&#xD;
      during pregnancy would reduce fetal insulin secretion and result in a low birth weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, insulin therapy exposes pregnant women to more labor induction, prematurity and&#xD;
      cesarean deliveries. In these MODY2 women whose glucose set point is physiologically higher,&#xD;
      glycemic goals are difficult to achieve while often requiring extensive insulin therapy. An&#xD;
      optimal situation would consist in initiating insulin therapy only for women with non-mutated&#xD;
      offsprings. Unfortunately no antenatal diagnosis of the GCK mutation on fetal cells is&#xD;
      available yet. In literature, birth weight differences between mutated and non-mutated&#xD;
      neonates may reach up to 700g. In clinical practice, two strategies are used but without&#xD;
      standardized protocol on glycemic targets, delay and doses of insulin : 1) insulin at&#xD;
      diagnosis of pregnancy 2) treatment based on fetal abdominal circumference and fetal weight&#xD;
      measurements by ultrasonography (US) and initiated if fetal biometry is greater than the 75th&#xD;
      percentile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate for the first time these two management strategies&#xD;
      through a prospective and standardized study. Hypothesis: US assessment would be sufficient&#xD;
      to identify fetuses at risk of macrosomia and to initiate insulin treatment in mothers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design The investigators propose to conduct a national multicenter prospective study on&#xD;
      the clinical management of pregnancy in women with GCK mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical management of the pregnancy After obtaining written informed consent, each&#xD;
      investigator of the Diabetes Departments will include MODY2 women, at the time of gestation&#xD;
      planning or at the first prenatal appointment. Pre-gestational maternal parameters (maternal&#xD;
      age, pre-gestational weight, blood glucose, mean blood glucose levels before and 2 hours post&#xD;
      prandial over one week when available, HbA1c, parity, medical history of macrosomia) will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antenatal care will be provided according to the local routine protocol for MODY2. All women&#xD;
      will receive dietary and physical activity counselling according to current recommendations&#xD;
      for pregnant women with pregestational diabetes. Vitamin B9, 0.4 or 5 mg/day, according to&#xD;
      local habits, will be prescribed as usual care from pregestational appointment until the end&#xD;
      of first trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women with a pregestational HbA1c ≥ 6.5 % will be systematically treated with insulin&#xD;
           because of a potential increase in the malformation rate as documented in women with&#xD;
           type 1 diabetes (Bell, Glinianaia et al. 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In women with pregestational HbA1c &lt; 6.5%, insulin therapy will be initiated either&#xD;
           according to capillary maternal blood glucose target values or according to fetal growth&#xD;
           assessed by ultrasonography, according to each Diabetes Department habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, care will be standardized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasonography (US) examinations will be performed as usually at 12, 22 and 32&#xD;
           gestational weeks. Additional US will be performed at 25, 28, 35 and 38 gestational&#xD;
           weeks, as performed in the several randomized controlled trials that showed that this&#xD;
           strategy allows prevention of an increase in the rate of macrosomia in women with GDM&#xD;
           (Schaefer-Graf, Kjos et al. 2004). A referent sonographer will be identified in each&#xD;
           center to limit the inter-examiner variability. At each US, fetal biometry (with&#xD;
           abdominal circumference and fetal weight estimations) and the percentiles according to&#xD;
           gestational age will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood glucose self-monitoring, comprising 6 measures (before and 2 hours after the&#xD;
           beginning of each meal), will be registered during a whole week at the end of the three&#xD;
           trimesters of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women body weight will be measured before pregnancy, at each Diabetology appointment and&#xD;
           before delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fetal monitoring will be performed according to local routine protocols. Modalities of&#xD;
           delivery will be decided as usual care in each obstetrics department. No specific&#xD;
           gestational age and modalities of delivery will be recommended for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group of women with insulin therapy from the beginning of pregnancy :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be conducted according to national guidelines for GDM (2010) and consists in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood glucose self-monitoring before and 2 hrs after each meal, i.e. 6 tests per day.&#xD;
           Recommended targets are less than 0.95 g/L before meals and less than 1.20 g/L&#xD;
           postprandial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diet counseling with carbohydrate intake divided into three meals and two to three&#xD;
           snacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 7-10 days of glucose monitoring, insulin therapy will be instituted if capillary&#xD;
           glucose levels exceed the targets in 20% of all measurements or in 40% of a single time&#xD;
           slot. Each caregiver will manage insulin therapy according to local habits (use of&#xD;
           long-acting insulin, regular insulin, insulin analogs, continuous subcutaneous insulin&#xD;
           infusion by an external pump), and will increase the doses in order to obtain&#xD;
           recommended glucose targets. Preliminary data suggest that high insulin doses may be&#xD;
           necessary and that normalizing fasting blood glucose may be difficult. Thus, insulin&#xD;
           doses will not be further increased in case of the occurrence of repeated hypoglycemia&#xD;
           (i.e. 2 mild hypoglycemic episodes in a single slot over one week or one single severe&#xD;
           hypoglycemic episode even when blood glucose targets are not achieved).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin treatment will be stopped only in case of fetal restricted growth defined by an&#xD;
      estimated fetal weight &lt; 10th percentile, on two consecutive US with at least 3 weeks&#xD;
      interval and no other etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group of women with insulin therapy initiated according to fetal US measurements :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will monitor their blood glucose levels before and 2 hours after meals twice a week&#xD;
      during the whole pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this group, MODY2 women will not be treated with insulin until delivery, except when:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the fetal abdominal circumference exceeds ≥ the 75 percentile on one US. This threshold&#xD;
           is similar to the one chosen to initiate insulin therapy in several RCTs that showed&#xD;
           that this strategy allowed prevention of an increase in the rate of macrosomia in women&#xD;
           with GDM (Schaefer-Graf, Kjos et al. 2004, Kjos and Schaefer-Graf 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  or maternal fasting capillary blood glucose is ≥ 1,20 g/L or maternal post-prandial&#xD;
           capillary blood glucose is ≥ 2,00 g/L. In the mentioned RCTs, women followed with&#xD;
           monthly fetal growth evaluations were not treated with insulin except when fetal&#xD;
           abdominal circumference was ≥ 75th percentile, or when their glucose levels exceeded the&#xD;
           same safety thresholds. No increase in macrosomia and other pregnancy adverse outcomes&#xD;
           was observed using this strategy, as compared to conventional treatment with insulin&#xD;
           (Kjos and Schaefer-Graf 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When initiated, insulin therapy will be conducted as described in 11.2, with the same&#xD;
      capillary blood glucose targets&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Maternal care Systematic visits in the Diabetes department will be scheduled at 2- 4 weeks&#xD;
      intervals. A monthly visit in the Obstetrics department will be scheduled from 22 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine care, including measurement of weight, height and arterial pressure, as well an&#xD;
      urinary testing for proteinuria will be performed at the first appointment and at each&#xD;
      following visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of insulin treatment, the type and dose of insulin will be recorded, as well as the&#xD;
      frequency of mild or severe hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with pre-gestational HbA1c &gt; 6.5% will be treated with insulin from the pregnancy&#xD;
      planning period or from the beginning of the pregnancy as described in part 6.2.1 and all&#xD;
      data concerning these pregnancies will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life Three self-questionnaires, already used in randomized studies of GDM&#xD;
           treatment (Crowther, Hiller et al. 2005), will be proposed to all women at the first&#xD;
           appointment and at three months post partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal health status will be assessed by means of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item&#xD;
           Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36), which assesses eight aspects of health status:&#xD;
           general and mental health, physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role,&#xD;
           pain, and vitality. Scores on each scale can range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal anxiety will be assessed with the use of the short form of the Spielberger&#xD;
           State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, a self-rating scale consisting of 6 items (scores below&#xD;
           15 are considered normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of a maternal depression will be reflected by a score of more than 12 on the&#xD;
      Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at three months post partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Anthropometrics and biological measures in neonates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometrics parameters will be recorded the first day of life for each neonate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight to determine &quot;large for gestational age&quot; defined as birth weight above the 90th&#xD;
           percentile and &quot;small for gestational age&quot; defined as birth weight below the 10th&#xD;
           percentile on sex-specific neonatal growth standards published by the AUDIPOG group&#xD;
           (Mamelle et al, 1996)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin fold between 1st and 3rd day of life (bicipital, tricipital, scapular, iliac) for&#xD;
           departments experienced in this type of measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capillary blood glucose test will be collected 3 hours before the first feeding to look for&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia. After the second feeding, blood glucose tests will be repeated every 6 hours&#xD;
      if &gt; 2.5 mmol/L. If blood glucose is normal during 24 hours and feeding is also normal,&#xD;
      neonate glucose monitoring will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will be categorized as having clinical neonatal hypoglycaemia if there are symptoms&#xD;
      and/or treatment with a glucose infusion or a glucose value ≤ 2 mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-peptide will be measured on cord blood. Hyperinsulinemia is defined by a C-peptide level&#xD;
      above the 90th percentile of a neonate reference population. Samples will be centralized in a&#xD;
      single laboratory for determination of the C-peptide level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal leptin will be measured on cord blood as a biological marker of infant adiposity.&#xD;
      Leptin is specifically produced by adipose tissue and placenta, and maternal leptin does not&#xD;
      cross the placenta. Fetal leptin reflects the amount of adipose tissue, and its production&#xD;
      could be regulated by insulin (Hauguel-de Mouzon, Lepercq et al. 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      -GCK genotyping In order to analyze the effect of the maternal treatment according to the&#xD;
      fetal genotype, a targeted sequencing of the maternal GCK mutation will be performed on DNA&#xD;
      extracted from blood cord sample. The mother (and her partner) will sign an informed written&#xD;
      consent for the genetic testing of their baby.&#xD;
