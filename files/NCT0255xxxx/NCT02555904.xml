      This is an observational, single center study to evaluate if acoustic and accelerometer-based&#xD;
      measures of voice and speech have sufficient precision to detect a change in lung fluid&#xD;
      status for patients with confirmed acute heart failure syndrome with pulmonary congestion.&#xD;
      The study shall be conducted in concordance with the United States FDA regulations for a&#xD;
      non-significant risk study. Patients admitted for acute heart failure syndrome with pulmonary&#xD;
      congestion with an expected stay greater than 3 to 4 days, who are willing and able to sign&#xD;
      an informed consent, and who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, as identified by the&#xD;
      clinical investigator, will be enrolled in the study. Results of this study will evaluate the&#xD;
      sensitivity of voice and speech measures in detecting changes in lung fluid status in a&#xD;
      symptomatic population. Up to 12 subjects will be enrolled to comparatively evaluate the&#xD;
      voice outcome measures in this pilot study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two specific aims for this first phase of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collect short-term acoustic and accelerometric data on groups of patients with volume&#xD;
           overload before and after successful diuresis of amounts of fluid that are large enough&#xD;
           to permit robust statistical testing of derived measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether direct measures (based on previously-developed approaches for acoustic&#xD;
           and ACC-based monitoring of vocal function can differentiate between hypervolemic and&#xD;
           optivolemic patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Justification for Clinical Study The study will evaluate if acoustic and accelerometric&#xD;
      measures of voice and speech production have the sensitivity to detect a clinically&#xD;
      significant change in lung fluid status for patients with confirmed acute heart failure&#xD;
      syndrome with pulmonary congestion. Changes in lung fluid in acute heart failure syndrome are&#xD;
      difficult to diagnose and evaluate. A blinded observational methodology was chosen as the&#xD;
      most appropriate study design to understand changes in lung fluid values in patients with&#xD;
      acute heart failure syndrome with pulmonary congestion. The primary endpoint is significant&#xD;
      correlation of changes in voice and speech characteristics with change in total body water as&#xD;
      measured by change in weight during the hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Measurement Precision Exploratory endpoints will be to determine the distributions of&#xD;
      lung fluid values for patients with confirmed acute heart failure syndrome and to determine&#xD;
      if acoustic and accelerometer-based measurements have sufficient sensitivity to detect&#xD;
      changes in lung fluid status in a symptomatic hospitalized population. The establishment of&#xD;
      the underlying etiology of the heart failure will help determine how it may contribute to&#xD;
      symptomology and changes in acoustic and accelerometric measures of voice and speech&#xD;
      production. The types of analyses that can be performed on the airborne acoustic (microphone)&#xD;
      signal are somewhat limited by the levels of background noise in the recording environment,&#xD;
      particularly with respect to some of the acoustic measures related to voice quality. For this&#xD;
      reason it is proposed that recordings of voice/speech production for this pilot study be&#xD;
      obtained simultaneously with both a microphone and a neck-placed miniature accelerometer&#xD;
      (ACC). The ACC is relatively immune to environmental noise, and we have been able to extract&#xD;
      some voice quality-related measures from the ACC signal. The ACC is easily placed on the&#xD;
      anterior neck just above the clavicular notch using double-sided medical grade adhesive tape&#xD;
      (see Figure 1). The recording protocol will be comprised of: 1) sustained vowels, 2) standard&#xD;
      sentences and a reading passage, and 3) 30 seconds of spontaneous speech. Recordings will be&#xD;
      made before, during, and after an acute episode of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). Each&#xD;
      recording session should take less than 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 STUDY PROTOCOL 3.1 Study Design and Objective - see above&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Study Duration Enrollment in the trial is expected to take approximately 4 months&#xD;
      including enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.1 Enrollment Procedure and Follow-up Procedure Patients will be screened and enrolled&#xD;
      prior to admission required for their medical management. Subjects enrolled in the study will&#xD;
      have their baseline voice recordings made within 24 hours of admission. Following their index&#xD;
      measurement, all subjects will have their recording performed daily within the first 96 hours&#xD;
      and on discharge and/re reaching presumed dry weight. At the discretion of the investigator,&#xD;
      voice recordings may be obtained more frequently but no more than once per day of the&#xD;
      hospital admission up to a maximum of ten (10) days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: see below&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 OutComes - See below for primary and secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 Statistical Methods 5.1 Introduction This is an observational study. Subjects are enrolled&#xD;
      in the study throughout their inpatient stay up to maximum of 10 days. The objective of the&#xD;
      statistical analysis is to determine via Pearson correlation if voice and speech measures&#xD;
      have sufficient precision to detect clinically significant changes in overall volume status&#xD;
      for those experiencing acute heart failure syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Confirmation of a reduction in body fluid volume In order to confirm that a clinically&#xD;
      significant reduction in overall volume status has occurred during the voice recording&#xD;
      period, a cardiologist will review all relevant medical records pertaining to the patient and&#xD;
      independently determine if the admission resulted in reduction in volume overload. They will&#xD;
      have access to source medical records and any additional information that becomes available&#xD;
      after the evaluation in the hospital environment. This information will include the&#xD;
      following: reading of the chest roentgenograms obtained in the emergency department or&#xD;
      inpatient stay by a radiologist, medical history obtained from a medical chart that was not&#xD;
      available to the emergency department physicians at the time of presentation, the results of&#xD;
      subsequent tests, such as echocardiography, radionuclide angiography,or left&#xD;
      ventriculography, performed at the time of cardiac catheterization, and the hospital course&#xD;
      for patients admitted to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 Statistical Analysis 6.1. Data Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital signal processing approaches will be to extract the following measures from the&#xD;
      acoustic and ACC signals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Sustained vowels: measures related to voice quality including perturbation (jitter and&#xD;
      shimmer) and signal-to-noise levels (harmonics-to-noise, spectral, and cepstral measures),&#xD;
      and the frequency locations of subglottal resonances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Connected speech (sentences, reading, and spontaneous speech): measures related to sound&#xD;
      segment, suprasegmental, and utterance length parameters including pitch (fundamental&#xD;
      frequency), loudness (relative sound pressure level), and articulation/timing (sound segment&#xD;
      durations, vocalic formant transitions, pauses).&#xD;
&#xD;
