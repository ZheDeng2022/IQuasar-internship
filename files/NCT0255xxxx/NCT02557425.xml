    <textblock>
      Each year, ~85.3 million pregnant women are at risk of becoming infected with Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum(1). Among women in sub-Saharan Africa, most of whom have some degree of clinical&#xD;
      immunity to malaria, malaria infection in pregnancy leads to placental malaria (PM), often&#xD;
      without clinical symptoms in the mother. The systemic and placental changes that occur with&#xD;
      malaria in pregnancy can adversely affect the developing fetal brain, an fetal brain injury&#xD;
      strongly affects long-term childhood neurodevelopmental (ND) and behavior but there are no&#xD;
      published studies to date on the impact of malaria in pregnancy on childhood ND. This study,&#xD;
      conducted in Uganda, will address the effects of malaria in pregnancy and childhood ND and&#xD;
      define mechanisms by which malaria may lead to ND impairment including micronutrient&#xD;
      deficiencies. ND outcomes will be measured by the following neuropsychological and behavioral&#xD;
      tests: Mullen Scales of Early Learning, the Color Object Association Test, the Early&#xD;
      Childhood Vigilance Test, the Behavior Rating Scales, the Behavior Related inventory of&#xD;
      Executive Function and the Child Behavior Checklist. These tests will be given at 12, 24, 36,&#xD;
      and 60 months of age. This study will be nested in an ongoing Ugandan IRB approved&#xD;
      interventional trial (PROMOTE-II) (NCT02163447). Blood sampling is being conducted in the&#xD;
      PROMOTE-II protocol for research purposes. Some of that blood will be used to test for&#xD;
      micronutrient deficiencies as well as other immune responses to malaria.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The PROMOTE-II randomized clinical trial in Tororo, Uganda, led by investigators from&#xD;
      Makerere University in Uganda and the University of California-San Francisco (UCSF), provides&#xD;
      an ideal setting to assess the effects of malaria prevention in pregnant women and their&#xD;
      children on childhood ND. In PROMOTE-II Project 1,300 pregnant HIV-uninfected women will be&#xD;
      randomized at 12-20 weeks of gestation to malaria prophylaxis with 3 doses of&#xD;
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (current standard of care), 3 doses of&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), or monthly DP. Their children will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive DP prophylaxis monthly or every 3 months from 2 to 24 months age. The children will&#xD;
      be followed for malaria episodes from birth to age 36 months. The proposed prospective study&#xD;
      of child ND, the Prophylaxis against malaria To Enhance Child developmenT (PROTECT) study,&#xD;
      will be nested within the PROMOTE-II Project 1 cohort. It is hypothesized that mothers on SP&#xD;
      and mothers and children on less frequent prophylaxis will have more malaria episodes. The&#xD;
      investigators predict that child ND will improve with more effective prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypotheses of this study are that malaria prevention in pregnant women and their&#xD;
      children improves child ND through 1) prevention of placental sequestration and inflammation&#xD;
      and of consequent micronutrient deficiency in the fetus, and 2) reduction of systemic&#xD;
      inflammation and endothelial activation that can lead to micronutrient deficiency and anemia&#xD;
      during pregnancy and in early childhood and thus to alteration of brain structures&#xD;
      particularly sensitive to such deficiencies (e.g., the hippocampus, myelin and the frontal&#xD;
      lobe). The collaborative team, which has expertise in malaria in pregnant women and children,&#xD;
      malaria pathogenesis, micronutrient deficiency, fetal and child neurodevelopment, and&#xD;
      modeling of complex disease pathways, is well qualified to undertake the proposed research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Determine the effect of malaria prevention in pregnant women and their children on&#xD;
      child ND. Hypotheses: 1) Long-term child ND improves with more effective chemoprevention in&#xD;
      pregnant women and in their children. 2) The effect of malaria prevention on child ND&#xD;
      persists through 36 months of age. Child ND will be assessed with a testing battery validated&#xD;
      in previous studies by this group in Ugandan children. The investigators will test these&#xD;
      hypotheses by comparing child ND at 12, 24, 36 and 60 months of age between treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Identify the major mechanisms by which malaria prevention in pregnant women and&#xD;
      children affects child ND. Hypotheses: 1) Malaria prevention in pregnant women affects child&#xD;
      ND through prevention of placental sequestration and inflammation, with consequent prevention&#xD;
      of prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation and fetal micronutrient deficiency. 2)&#xD;
      Malaria prevention in pregnant women and in their children after birth improves child ND&#xD;
      through reduction of systemic inflammation, endothelial activation, micronutrient deficiency&#xD;
      and anemia, but the relative contributions of the factors differ in pregnant women compared&#xD;
      to children. The investigators will test these hypotheses by conducting path analysis to&#xD;
      determine if networks that include these paths explain a significant proportion of the&#xD;
      difference in child ND between treatment groups.&#xD;
