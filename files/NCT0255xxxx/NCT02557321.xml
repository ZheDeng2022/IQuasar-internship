  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international multicenter, open-label, sequential phase study of intralesional&#xD;
      (IL) PV-10 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition. Metastatic melanoma patients&#xD;
      (Stage IV or Stage III unresectable, in-transit or satellite disease) with at least one&#xD;
      injectable lesion who are candidates for pembrolizumab (both treatment na√Øve patients and&#xD;
      treatment refractory patients who have failed to achieve a complete or partial response to or&#xD;
      previously progressed on one or more checkpoint inhibitor) will be eligible for study&#xD;
      participation. In the Phase 1b portion of the study, all participants will receive the&#xD;
      combination of IL PV-10 and pembrolizumab (i.e., PV-10 + standard of care). In the subsequent&#xD;
      Phase 2 portion of the study participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either the&#xD;
      combination of IL PV-10 and pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone (i.e., PV-10 + standard of&#xD;
      care vs. standard of care).&#xD;

      Phase 1b. Up to 24 eligible subjects will be enrolled in an initial cohort in the Phase 1b&#xD;
      portion of the study (Main Cohort). Up to an additional 24 eligible subjects who have failed&#xD;
      to achieve a complete or partial response to or progressed on prior checkpoint inhibition&#xD;
      will be enrolled in a first expansion cohort (Expansion Cohort 1). Up to an additional 24&#xD;
      eligible subjects with Stage III unresectable, in-transit or satellite melanoma will be&#xD;
      enrolled in a second expansion cohort (Expansion Cohort 2). Each subject in each Phase 1b&#xD;
      cohort will receive the combination of IL PV-10 and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2. A total of an estimated 120 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      the two treatment arms (i.e., PV-10 + pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone) in the Phase 2&#xD;
      portion of the study. This number of subjects may be modified based on emerging evidence of&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy and effect size from the Phase 1b and initial Phase 2 portions of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects assigned to receive PV-10 in Phase 1b and 2 will receive initial IL PV-10 to their&#xD;
      injectable lesions commencing on study Day 1 for up to 12 weeks (i.e., investigational&#xD;
      Treatment Phase of the study). PV-10 may be re-administered at 21-day (3-week) intervals&#xD;
      during the Treatment Phase of the study to any remaining, uninjected injectable lesions until&#xD;
      all injectable lesions have been injected. Lesions that fail to exhibit complete ablation may&#xD;
      be re-injected on this schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab will be administered at 21-day (3-week) intervals per prescribing information&#xD;
      (label) commencing on study Day 1 for up to 24 months or until disease progression, toxicity&#xD;
      requiring discontinuation of study treatment or study termination.&#xD;
