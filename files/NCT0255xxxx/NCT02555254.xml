  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest (CA) is at present a major cause of mortality as well as a cause of disability&#xD;
      for the surviving victims. In France, every year counts as 50,000 cardiac arrests responsible&#xD;
      for 40 000 deaths. Thus, less than 20% of patients with heart failure discharged home. Then&#xD;
      these patients had impaired quality of life associated with symptoms of fatigue, stress,&#xD;
      anxiety hindering the resumption of business activity including. The prognosis is related in&#xD;
      part to the initial cardiac rhythm present at the establishment of specialized resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent progress in improving mortality and neurological outcome has been achieved over the&#xD;
      last decade with systematic implementation of a period of targeted temperature management&#xD;
      between 32 and 34 ° C (TTM 32-34) in patients with cardiac arrest and who benefited from the&#xD;
      completion of at least one external electrical shock when help arrived. The mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying this improvement of neurological prognosis are many, but mainly related to an&#xD;
      attenuation of post resuscitation syndrome that combines in one hand an inflammatory response&#xD;
      (mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6) and secondly the formation&#xD;
      of reperfusion injury related to the production of radical oxygen species (free radicals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While some studies have shown the feasibility of induction of this TTM 32-34 in prehospital&#xD;
      conditions, no prospective study has evaluated the significant speed of warming in the end.&#xD;
      An observational study in which the heating was carried passively, found that patients with&#xD;
      an extended heating period (600 minutes) had a worse neurological outcome than patients with&#xD;
      a duration of shorter warming (479 minutes) while a second retrospective study concluded the&#xD;
      opposite in case of active warming . Besides the fact that these studies were observational,&#xD;
      in the two originals randomized studies on TTM 32-34 in CA, the rate of warming was not like:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective 6 hours with active warming is 0.5 ° C / h in the Australian study with an OR&#xD;
           of 5.25 (1.47 - 18.76) for the neurological prognosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective 8 hours with passive warming of 0.37 ° C / h in the European study with an OR&#xD;
           of 1.4 (1.08 - 1.81) for the neurological prognosis Although populations of two studies&#xD;
           are obviously not comparable, it is possible that suboptimal speed of rewarming could&#xD;
           mitigate some of the gain related to the implementation of TTM 32-34.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, investigators propose to conduct a randomized, single-center pilot study&#xD;
      comparing a fast warming in a slow warming when performing a TTM 33 patients presented with a&#xD;
      shockable cardiac arrest.&#xD;
