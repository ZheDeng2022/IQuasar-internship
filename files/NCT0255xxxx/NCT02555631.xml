      The purpose of this two-year proposal is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. develop and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. complete a pilot test of an adaptation of the evidence-based National Diabetes&#xD;
           Prevention Program (NDPP) tailored to engage men with prediabetes in disadvantaged&#xD;
           communities in New York City.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sites for this pilot study are New York City Parks and recreation centers. Study's main&#xD;
      outcome is weight loss of 5-7% baseline weight.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During year one, the multi-disciplinary research team will work closely with the expert and&#xD;
      community Advisory Panel and consultants to adapt the standard NDPP curriculum in order to&#xD;
      promote increased engagement of men. &quot;Engagement&quot; is defined in this proposal to include&#xD;
      recruitment, group participation and retention in the 16-week program. This modified NDPP♂&#xD;
      (i.e., for men) renamed by the advisory panel as &quot;Power Up for Health,&quot; will have only&#xD;
      NDPP-trained male coaches and male participants, with adaptations to dietary and physical&#xD;
      activity messaging and a new behavioral &quot;toolbox&quot; approach developed for men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By month 10 of year one, investigators will begin implementation of the 16-week pilot studies&#xD;
      of the NDPP♂ at 6 NYC Parks and Recreation Department (REC) sites in disadvantaged&#xD;
      communities in three of the NYC boroughs currently offering the standard NDPP programming.&#xD;
      Investigators will utilize an iterative and adaptive process during the pilot phase to modify&#xD;
      recruitment and retention strategies, as well as the NDPP curriculum and activities. The&#xD;
      exploratory aim, as feasible, is to then compare the adapted NDPP♂ pilot data to the standard&#xD;
      NDPP mixed-gender groups' available data on recruitment, participation, weight loss, and&#xD;
      retention of men from similar NYC neighborhoods. The goal will be pilot study data from 15-20&#xD;
      male participants at each REC pilot site-a recruitment goal of 120 male participants. Working&#xD;
      in collaboration with the investigators' consultants and Advisory Panel of community leaders&#xD;
      and academic experts in men's health promotion, as well as study partners at the NYC&#xD;
      Department of Parks and Recreation, investigators will conduct focused outreach to the target&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims for the Pilot Study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. to collaborate with the expert and community Advisory Panel to complete the adaptation&#xD;
      of the NDPP curriculum and the recruitment and retention activities to better engage men with&#xD;
      prediabetes from disadvantaged communities of NYC;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. to assess preliminary indicators of effectiveness of the NDPP♂ with respect to&#xD;
      reductions in body weight; Hypothesis 1: Men engaged in the NDPP♂ will have reductions in&#xD;
      body weight at 16 weeks at least equivalent to the NDPP goal of 5-7% of their baseline body&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. to examine and describe from pilot data the extent to which recruitment, intervention&#xD;
      and retention strategies, tailored for men with prediabetes are associated with improved&#xD;
      engagement of the target population; Exploratory Hypothesis 3.1: Recruitment of men to NDPP♂&#xD;
      will occur more rapidly and with less intensive strategies than recruitment of men to the&#xD;
      standard NDPP in comparable communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Hypothesis 3.2: Men enrolled in the NDPP♂ will be more engaged in program&#xD;
      activities and self-report greater improvements in healthy eating and physical activity&#xD;
      compared with men in the standard NDPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Hypothesis 3.3: Men enrolled in the NDPP♂ will have retention rates that are at&#xD;
      least equivalent to men in the standard NDPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All comparison data analyses are exploratory and as data are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. to examine preliminary data to identify demographic, psychosocial, neighborhood, and&#xD;
      REC site characteristics associated with differential recruitment, retention and intervention&#xD;
      effects in the NDPP♂.&#xD;
