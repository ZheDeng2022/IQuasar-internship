  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in 100 people suffers from coeliac disease. It affects the lining of the bowel and causes&#xD;
      many symptoms such as diarrhoea, wind, stomach pain, constipation and nausea. The only&#xD;
      treatment so far is a strict glutenfree diet for life which reverses the bowel damage and&#xD;
      often improves symptoms. Up to 25% of patients however may have persistent symptoms despite&#xD;
      the gluten free diet but the reasons for this are not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to help us understand how the gluten free diet works. Investigators will&#xD;
      use medical imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or MRI) to measure the volumes of fluid in&#xD;
      the small bowel, the size of the large bowel and the time it takes for foods to go through&#xD;
      the entire bowel in patients who have just been diagnosed with coeliac disease by their&#xD;
      hospital doctor. Investigators will also carry out a breath test and collect a stool sample&#xD;
      for basic analysis of the stool bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will also collect questionnaires about their feelings and their bowel habits&#xD;
      and will try to see how the MRI measurements relate to the patients' symptoms. Investigators&#xD;
      will observe how all these measures change after one year of the gluten free diet that&#xD;
      doctors will have prescribed as part of the coeliac patients' standard care. As such there is&#xD;
      no dietary intervention in this study, investigators will simply study changes in the&#xD;
      patients due to their standard treatment. Investigators will also look at a matched group of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers to gather a likely reference range of the measurements. This research will&#xD;
      be carried out in Nottingham with the help of the specialist coeliac clinics and it will last&#xD;
      3 years. There is a dedicated Coeliac Patient Public Involvement group who have helped plan&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;

      Hypotheses of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the investigators' pilot data and on the literature available, this study aims to&#xD;
      test the main hypotheses that in adults newly diagnosed with coeliac disease treatment with&#xD;
      GFD will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. reduce the water content of the fasting small bowel&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. reduce the volume of the fasting colon&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. increase whole gut transit time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of the study are therefore to quantify any change following treatment&#xD;
      with a gluten-free diet (GFD) in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the water content of the fasting small bowel&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. fasting colon volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. whole gut transit time in adults newly diagnosed with coeliac disease using non-invasive&#xD;
           MRI Co-variates of interest&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study investigators will measure a series of exploratory co-variates of interest&#xD;
      at diagnosis and at 12 months follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gastrointestinal symptoms (Bristol Stool diary for a week, HAD, PHQ-15, IBSS, QOL, GI&#xD;
           symptoms VAS scales )&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Marsh grading of D2 segment duodenal biopsies (defined as routine clinical assessment in&#xD;
           NUH)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Fasting breath hydrogen&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Serology values (tTG, EMA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Faecal microbiota and short chain fatty acids&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subgroup analysis, investigators will describe associations (if any) between the MRI&#xD;
      outcomes and these co-variates:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. before treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. after treatment and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. differences between the two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latter will represent the most useful analysis. By using the after treatment measure as&#xD;
      the outcome and the before treatment measure as a covariate this will be mathematically&#xD;
      equivalent to analysing the change with treatment (adjusted for baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parallel Healthy Volunteers group This study will also include a parallel pilot study healthy&#xD;
      volunteers (HVs) frequency matched for age (in 20 years bands) and gender to provide&#xD;
      descriptive statistics on a likely reference range for the healthy population to inform the&#xD;
      design of future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study in 36 newly diagnosed coeliac disease patients before and after a gluten-free&#xD;
      diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      University based&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study on patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no data available to estimate the size of the change in water content of the fasting&#xD;
      small bowel in patients hence this is a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' own MRI pilot data in n=20 untreated, newly diagnosed coeliac patients&#xD;
      showed a fasting small bowel water content of (mean ± SD) 202 ± 115 ml volume. We can predict&#xD;
      that we should be able to detect a change of 40% (or a reduction of 80 ml volume) after&#xD;
      gluten free diet with a power of 90% and a Type I error probability of 0.05 using n=24&#xD;
      patients in a paired study design. This is considered a clinically significant change after&#xD;
      gluten free diet; this change reflects twice the level of normal control values of 65 ± 43 ml&#xD;
      volume. Investigators plan to recruit n=36 to allow for dropouts and to increase power also&#xD;
      for secondary outcomes.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study on healthy volunteers (HVs):&#xD;
&#xD;
      For exploratory purposes and to provide pilot reference data for the design of future&#xD;
      studies, investigators aim to collect data on 36 HVs 36 patients and 36 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study in coeliac disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging - 2 scans 12 months apart&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Self-administered symptom questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stool sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hydrogen breath test The patients will have had a biopsy and serology as part of their&#xD;
           standard care. The healthy volunteers will undergo only the blood sample as part of&#xD;
           screening with no biopsy taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study = 36 months. Duration of study for each participant = around 12 months.&#xD;
      Follow-up of participants will stop after 12 months if they fail to receive the subsequent&#xD;
      MRI scan There is no randomisation or blinding as this is a simple pilot study. Primary&#xD;
      endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fasting small bowel water content (SBWC) measured in ml approximately 12 months after&#xD;
           initiation of GFD&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fasting colon volume measured in ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Whole gut transit time measured in hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-variates analysis as indicated above&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic characteristics of the study population will be calculated using frequencies and&#xD;
      proportions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this cohort of patients with newly diagnosed coeliac disease, investigators will compare&#xD;
      the mean difference of their fasting small bowel water content (the primary outcome) before&#xD;
      and after the initiation of GFD. This will be done using Paired Test at 5% level of&#xD;
      significance. This assumes normality of the data, should the data have a high level of&#xD;
      skewness non-parametric methods will be used. In order to assess the potential effect&#xD;
      modification with age and gender, investigators will stratify the above analysis by those&#xD;
      variables. For this purpose age will be considered as categorical variable and analysed as 20&#xD;
      years bands. This analysis will only be conducted for cases with complete follow-up data on&#xD;
      MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives 2 and 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This analysis will be repeated for the two secondary outcomes, namely the volume of the&#xD;
      fasting colon and the gastrointestinal transit time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-variate analyses in the coeliac disease group. The potential association between&#xD;
      co-variates (gastrointestinal symptoms, Marsh grading etc.) and the three MRI outcomes will&#xD;
      be assessed using stepwise linear regression analysis. Investigators will also assess the&#xD;
      magnitude of the effect in term of mean difference along with their respective confidence&#xD;
      interval. The analysis would be separately conducted for each outcome and co-variates&#xD;
      recorded during the first and the subsequent MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should this analysis highlight a few particularly strong associations, investigators will&#xD;
      attempt to input those to a regression model to predict either baseline values or change with&#xD;
      GFD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study in HVs The HVs group is included to provide pilot reference data to inform the&#xD;
      design of future studies. Investigators will compare the small bowel water content among the&#xD;
      coeliac disease cases to the HVs (controls), and then compare the mean difference pre- and&#xD;
      post-measurement between cases and controls using linear regression.&#xD;
