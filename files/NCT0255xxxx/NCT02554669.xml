  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity performed in the postprandial state has the ability to blunt postprandial&#xD;
      glycemia acutely, even as a result of very light or small amounts of postprandial physical&#xD;
      activity. Postprandial physical activity decreases postprandial glycemia more effectively&#xD;
      than activity performed in the post-absorptive state. However, studies comparing postprandial&#xD;
      and postabsorptive physical activity have measured glycemic outcomes in only short periods of&#xD;
      time (hours) or have used a very large dose of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity have the ability to entail an acute increase in markers of systemic&#xD;
      inflammation.Previous studies has also shown that systemic inflammation is increased during&#xD;
      glycemic spikes, such as after a high carbohydrate load. Therefore the effect of postprandial&#xD;
      physical activity is difficult to predict. One one hand it might increase markers of systemic&#xD;
      inflammation. On the other hand it might decrease systemic inflammation as a result of a&#xD;
      blunting effect on postprandial glycemia. The effect of physical activity after carbohydrate&#xD;
      intake might therefore also differ from postabsorptive physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study: I) The investigators hypothesized that light physical activity&#xD;
      performed in the post-prandial sate decrease blood glucose in a day and night cycle compared&#xD;
      to the same activity performed in the postabsorptive state and a control day. II) To test&#xD;
      whether postabsorptive and postprandial light physical activity do affect markers of systemic&#xD;
      inflammation different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 participants diagnosed with hyperglycemia but not on hypoglycemic medication took part in&#xD;
      a randomized cross-over trial with 3 test days. A control day with no physical activity, and&#xD;
      two days similar to the control day except that one of them contained a one hour bout of&#xD;
      treadmill walking prior to breakfast and the other a similar exercise bout after breakfast.&#xD;
      Continuous glucose monitoring was performed from start of exercise / breakfast until the&#xD;
      morning next day (at least 22 hours). Venous blood was also sampled at given timepoints&#xD;
      (before exercise / before breakfast, and 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 24 hours after breakfast. Dietary&#xD;
      intake was individually standardized prior to and during test days.&#xD;
