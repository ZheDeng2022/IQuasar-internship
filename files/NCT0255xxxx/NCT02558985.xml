      No interventions outside the normal course of patient care. The investigators will be&#xD;
      collecting data at specified points throughout the casting process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will measure lung compliance during the casting process for spinal&#xD;
      manipulation. Research questions include: Is there a quantifiable change in lung compliance&#xD;
      during the casting process? Is there an individual change in lung compliance over time&#xD;
      comparing collection points at each cast change? Is there a change in appearance of&#xD;
      flow-volume loop? Is there a decrease in oxygen saturation from post-induction baseline? The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that there is a change in lung compliance and a decrease in oxygen&#xD;
      saturation during the casting process.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients undergoing spine manipulation and scoliosis casting will receive general&#xD;
      anesthesia with a standard anesthetic technique regardless of if the patient is included in&#xD;
      the study or not. The investigators will meet with the patient and the patient's&#xD;
      parent/guardian prior to the procedure, which is traditionally done whether a patient&#xD;
      participates in a study or not, to discuss the anesthetic plan. As part of the investigator's&#xD;
      description of the anesthetic plan, the investigator will inform the patient and the&#xD;
      parent/guardian of the study including the rationale for the study and the non-invasive means&#xD;
      of obtaining data. The data will be obtained during the current cast application as well as&#xD;
      any subsequent cast application surgeries that the patient will return for the future. A&#xD;
      patient's cast will be changed approximately as needed per each child's circumstance; common&#xD;
      time periods a child's cast may need to be changed include, but not limited to: growth, the&#xD;
      cast becoming soiled, damaged, or other circumstances the study physician feels it is&#xD;
      advisable to change the cast. The study will follow them until casting procedures are&#xD;
      completed for treatment of scoliosis. The standard general anesthesia technique will be used.&#xD;
      Please see Appendix A for suggested Anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be seven data collection points during the patient's general anesthetic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to the removal of the old cast, if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After removal of old cast, if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In frame, pre-traction&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In frame, in traction&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Post-body cast application (prior to cast windows; in traction)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Post cast application in bed out of traction (prior to cutting out windows)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Post-cast windows cut out (in bed, prior to return of spontaneous ventilation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will include the following physiologic parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Non-invasive blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Oxygen saturation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The amount of traction (in pounds) that the patient is placed in for the spine&#xD;
           manipulation. This will be measured at the beginning of traction, the beginning of cast&#xD;
           application, and at the end of cast application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Respiratory measurements from the Philips Spirometry Module, consisting of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. lung compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. tidal volume&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. peak inspiratory pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. flow volume loop&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. airway resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be subject to a chart review. The chart review will include previous&#xD;
      anesthetic records which may provide valuable information concerning the patient's baseline&#xD;
      lung compliance, tidal volume, peak inspiratory pressure, flow volume loop, and airway&#xD;
      resistance, amount of traction applied and scoliosis curve correction. This previous data&#xD;
      will be used to compare to the data collected before, during and after cast changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appendix A: Suggested Anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Premedication: 0.5mg/kg midazolam PO (max 15mg), PRN&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Induction: Mask with sevoflurane in oxygen&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Secure Intravenous Access&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intubation: Propofol 3-4mg/kg IV. Oral endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ventilation: Controlled using volume mode at 8ml/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Maintenance: oxygen, sevoflurane, controlled ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Emergence: ondansetron 0.15mg/kg IV&#xD;
