  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long term toxicity of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is a substantial contributor&#xD;
      to morbidity and mortality in chronically infected HIV positive individuals. To date it is&#xD;
      still debated, whether long term nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI's)&#xD;
      -sparing regimens are practicable or even superior compared to standard of care cART in terms&#xD;
      of efficacy, safety and tolerability. In addition, data about efficacy of integrase inhibitor&#xD;
      (INSTI) based monotherapy is lacking. We aim at investigating the efficacy of standard of&#xD;
      care combination antiretroviral therapy with a simplified dolutegravir monotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with a primary HIV-1 infection under suppressive early standard of care&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy. Briefly, hundred-thirty-eight patients with a documented primary&#xD;
      HIV1- infection (PHI) will be recruited from the Zurich Primary HIV-1 Infection Study (ZHPI),&#xD;
      which is an open label, non-randomized, observational, single-center study&#xD;
      (http://clinicaltrials.gov, ID 5 NCT00537966). All subjects formerly underwent early cART&#xD;
      consisting of either a protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      inhibitor (NNRTI) or a INSTI in combination with two NRTIs at the time point of enrolment in&#xD;
      the ZPHI and must be under a fully suppressive ART (i.e., &lt;50 copies/ml) for at least 48&#xD;
      weeks at the time point of randomisation. The primary end point is the proportion of&#xD;
      individuals with a viral failure at week 48 or before.&#xD;
