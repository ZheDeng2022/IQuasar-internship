    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the 4th leading cause of death in the United&#xD;
      States. It is projected to be the leading cause of death by 2020. As many as 24 million&#xD;
      Americans are estimated to suffer from impaired lung function. Of those more than 12 million&#xD;
      were actually diagnosed with COPD, and over 118,000 deaths were attributed to COPD in 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD has been linked with an increased risk for lung cancer. Both airway obstruction, defined&#xD;
      by abnormal pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and CT scan diagnosed emphysema were shown to be&#xD;
      independent risk factors for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for COPD includes cessation of environmental exposures (i.e. smoking), dampening&#xD;
      the inflammatory response, symptoms control and, for a small subgroup, surgical approaches&#xD;
      and lung transplant. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these treatment options to change the&#xD;
      natural history of this disease is very limited. Recent evidence suggests a new role for&#xD;
      macrolides as immune-modulators in patients with COPD, although the mechanisms are not&#xD;
      clearly determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in patients with COPD, treatment with azithromycin will&#xD;
      show reduced inflammatory markers, transcription factors changes, and lung function changes&#xD;
      consistent with reduced inflammation.&#xD;
