  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive blood pressure monitoring is achieved by cannulating an artery and transducing the&#xD;
      pressure. During arterial cannulation the artery can be located by palpation, but use of&#xD;
      ultrasound has increased the success rate of cannulation. A new ultrasound technique for&#xD;
      vascular cannulation (dynamic needle tip positioning) has been described. Investigators aim&#xD;
      to compare this technique to the palpation technique for arterial cannulation. Investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the use of this novel ultrasound technique will result in a higher first&#xD;
      attempt success rate and overall success compared to palpation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to enroll 310 patients in this study. The participants in the study will&#xD;
      have been deemed by the attending anesthesiologist to require a radial arterial line for the&#xD;
      operation and thus the research protocol will not involve a deviation from the standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

      Participants will be brought to the main operating rooms. The patient will not be required to&#xD;
      do anything different than if they were not enrolled in the study. The anesthesiologist will&#xD;
      be asked to confirm that the patient still requires an arterial line. The patient will be&#xD;
      randomized either to palpation or ultrasound group. Patients would be placed in supine&#xD;
      position on the operating room table and all regular monitors (electrocardiogram, pulse&#xD;
      oximeter, non-invasive blood pressure) applied. After preoxygenation, the patient would be&#xD;
      induced and the airway secured. For those requiring an arterial catheter before induction of&#xD;
      general anesthesia, subcutaneous lidocaine will be used to anesthetize the planned puncture&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arms would be abducted and the decision on which side to place the arterial line will be&#xD;
      determined by the operator after palpation or scanning the wrists with ultrasound. An&#xD;
      ultrasound image of the radial artery to be cannulated will be obtained. A wrist roll would&#xD;
      then be placed under the wrist and the hand secured with tape. The wrist would then be&#xD;
      prepped with chlorhexidine and sterile towels placed around the prepped site. Timing would&#xD;
      begin once the ultrasound or the operator fingers touch the prepped wrist. For those&#xD;
      randomized to ultrasound, a Sonosite linear ultrasound probe would then be used to locate the&#xD;
      radial artery. After satisfactory position is obtained, a 20 ga angiocath 45mm long would be&#xD;
      used to puncture the artery and then would be advanced until the tip appears on the&#xD;
      ultrasound view. When this happens the ultrasound is advanced about 2mm proximal along the&#xD;
      artery. The needle is advanced until the tip is again visualized. This is repeated until the&#xD;
      needle tip is in the lumen of the radial artery. At this point the needle is sequentially&#xD;
      advanced in the lumen of the artery in small steps under ultrasound vision and then the&#xD;
      cannula is advanced over the needle. The needle core is then retracted and the transducer is&#xD;
      connected to the cannula. If the first attempt is unsuccessful, then more attempts may be&#xD;
      made until 5 minutes elapse. Success is defined as arterial cannulation as shown by an&#xD;
      arterial waveform that is obtained within 5 minutes of touching the prepped skin with an&#xD;
      ultrasound probe or the operator fingers. After that the operator may use the arterial&#xD;
      cannulation method of choice or decide to change to the other wrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the palpation method, the radial artery would be palpated and then a 20 ga angiocath used&#xD;
      to puncture the artery. After a return of blood in the catheter an attempt will be made to&#xD;
      advance the catheter over the needle core. If this is not successful, the operator can make&#xD;
      multiple attempts until 5 minutes elapse. After this time, the operator can use any desired&#xD;
      method to cannulate the artery and may also decide to use the other wrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will record the successful first pass cannulation, and time to cannulate the&#xD;
      vessel. Other measures will be number of attempts, number of catheters, radial artery depth,&#xD;
      radial artery diameter, blood pressure, heart rate, and failure rate. Other data that will be&#xD;
      recorded will include patient age, gender, weight, height , body mass index, and history of&#xD;
      peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not require any followup for the study.&#xD;
