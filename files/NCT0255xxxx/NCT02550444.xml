      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effects of intravenous clonidine in acute and&#xD;
      chronic post-cesarean pain, possible adverse effects over mother-newborn pair, in comparison&#xD;
      to intrathecal adjuvant clonidine and placebo.&#xD;

      METHODS Patients The research was submitted and approved by the Clinics Hospital of&#xD;
      University of São Paulo Ethics in Research Board (CAAE 05847312.8.0000.0068, Nº 940.941).&#xD;
      Patients authorized their participation and the proposed interventions and data collection,&#xD;
      through signature of Free Consent Term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria were women aged 18 years or older, in term pregnancy, who underwent&#xD;
      elective cesarean (no labor). Exclusion criteria was the following: multiple pregnancy;&#xD;
      moderate or several systemic disease, categorized as American Society of Anesthesiology&#xD;
      physical status (ASA) higher or equal to 3; contraindications for spinal anesthesia;&#xD;
      contraindications for the drugs involved in the study; uncontrolled high blood pressure or&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus in need of insulin therapy; intravenous psychotropic drugs users;&#xD;
      previously known malformation on the fetus; and patients with previous history of chronic&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients anesthetic management All volunteers were managed according to the hospital protocol&#xD;
      for cesarean delivery, and the one difference between groups was the clonidine or placebo&#xD;
      given intrathecally or intravenously. Multiparameter non-invasive monitoring was used. The&#xD;
      patients received a intravenous 10ml/kg Ringer Lactate bolus during realization of spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia with heavy Bupivacaine 0,5% (15mg), morphine 0,02 (80mcg) and fentanyl (10mcg).&#xD;
      Blood pressure was measured non-invasively during intra-operative period, each 1 minute until&#xD;
      the baby was born, and each 3 minutes after the delivery. Low blood pressure was treated with&#xD;
      Metaraminol 0,2mg intravenous bolus and/or Ephedrine 5mg intravenous bolus. Bradycardia was&#xD;
      defined as heart rate inferior to 45 beats per minute, and treated with Atropine 0,5mg&#xD;
      intravenous bolus. Intra-operative rescue analgesia was provided, if necessary, according to&#xD;
      the patients needs or if the assistant anesthetist felt that it was necessary, with Fentanyl&#xD;
      intravenous bolus, until a maximum dose of 100mcg. Before the skin incision, the patient&#xD;
      received cefazolin 2g IV. After cord clamp, patients received Oxytocin 5 international units&#xD;
      diluted in Ringer Lactate 250ml, ketoprofen 100mg IV, Dipyrone 2g IV, Omeprazole 40mg IV,&#xD;
      Ondansetron 8mg IV. After procedure, the women were driven to Post Anesthetic Care Unit&#xD;
      (PACU). There, if they felt pain, they could receive morphine 2mg IV, each 5 minutes,&#xD;
      according to the patients needs. Post-operative pain control in the ward was standardized on&#xD;
      the following protocol: ketoprofen 100mg IV 12/12h, Dipyrone 2g IV 6/6h; Tramadol IV 100mg&#xD;
      maximum 8/8h, if uncontrolled pain. If pain persists, morphine subcutaneously, 5mg could be&#xD;
      administered by nurse, 4/4h. Nauseas were treated with Dimenhydrinate 50mg IV 6/6h and&#xD;
      Metoclopramide 10mg IV 8/8h, and itch was attenuated with Diphenhydramine 25mg IV, in case of&#xD;
      such symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A neonatology team was present in every delivery and was responsible for the first evaluation&#xD;
      of the newborn, including Apgar score and resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups and interventions The included patients were randomly divided into one of three&#xD;
      groups. The professional who administered the drugs was external to de research group, and&#xD;
      did it unblinded. The researcher who did the assessments of the variables was blind for what&#xD;
      intervention had been made. In control group, patients received placebo intravenously and&#xD;
      intrathecally. In the intrathecal clonidine group, patients received 75 mcg of spinal&#xD;
      clonidine, and intravenous placebo. In the intravenous clonidine group, patients received 75&#xD;
      mcg of intravenous clonidine, and spinal placebo. The solutions volumes were the same in all&#xD;
      three groups, by 0,9% saline fluid addition to intrathecal and intravenous infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Data including age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), number of pregnancies,&#xD;
      number of deliveries, associated morbidities, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA)&#xD;
      physical status classification, reason to cesarean, length of anesthesia, amount of fluids&#xD;
      needed, basal blood pressure, minimum and maximum values, heart rate variation, vasopressor&#xD;
      and chronotropic drugs need, anesthesia complications, adverse effects (nauseas, vomits, itch&#xD;
      and shivering) and analgesic complementation intra-operative needs were registered. Systolic,&#xD;
      diastolic and mean hypotension was considered when values decreased more than 20% of basal&#xD;
      values. During the stay at PACU, motor block duration (time from beginning of the anesthesia&#xD;
      until the patient be able to do 90º flexion movement of tights over hips and 90º flexion&#xD;
      movement of legs over tights, on both inferior limbs, simultaneously and sustained for 5&#xD;
      seconds or more), pain and adverse effects were evaluated. Patients were assessed by&#xD;
      researchers in 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after spinal anesthesia induction. Post-operative pain&#xD;
      was measured using a number verbal scale (NVS), from 0 to 10 (0 is equivalent to no pain at&#xD;
      all and 10 means the worst pain ever). Patients informed their pain in rest and after been&#xD;
      asked to change from the lying position to the sitting position. Treatment satisfaction was&#xD;
      evaluated using a 0-10 scale, in which 0 meant unsatisfied and 10 full satisfaction. Patients&#xD;
      were asked by research team to quantify the intensity of itch, nausea, vomit and dizziness in&#xD;
      a four points scale (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). Sedation was measured by the&#xD;
      Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months, the women were evaluated trough a individual telephone call by a member of&#xD;
      study team, when they were asked if they had any pain or abnormal sensation (burning, itch&#xD;
      and numbness) at the section site; if they had any functional limitation due to pain; if they&#xD;
      needed any drug for section site pain in last week; if they were nursing; and if the&#xD;
      not-nursing reason was due to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newborn data included gestational age, weight after born, Apgar score at first, fifty and&#xD;
      tenth minutes, umbilical artery blood gas analysis, and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (ICU)&#xD;
      admission need.&#xD;
