      A 16-week double blind, placebo-controlled investigation of escitalopram in adolescents with&#xD;
      depression and/or anxiety with a family history of Bipolar Disorder. Subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated using semi-structured diagnostic interviews and symptom ratings, participate in a&#xD;
      MRI scan and then randomized to treatment. Following randomization, high-risk youth will have&#xD;
      visits every week for the first 4 weeks of treatment then biweekly up to 16 weeks during&#xD;
      which time tolerability and ratings will be performed. MRI scan will be repeated at week 4.&#xD;

      The primary goals of this proposal are to investigate the etiological mechanisms associated&#xD;
      with antidepressant-related dysfunctional emotional arousal and to characterize baseline&#xD;
      neurobiological risk factors that predict the development of dysfunctional emotional arousal&#xD;
      in treatment seeking youth with a family history of BD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antidepressants have moderate benefit for treating mood and anxiety disorders in childhood&#xD;
      but their effects on the developing brain are largely unknown. Antidepressants are among the&#xD;
      most commonly prescribed medications used by youth in the United States and are used to treat&#xD;
      many psychiatric disorders including depression, dysthymia and anxiety. However, recent&#xD;
      reviews suggest that antidepressants provide only mild to moderate benefit. Moreover, a&#xD;
      growing number of case reports and clinical studies have described antidepressant-related&#xD;
      psychiatric adverse events such as aggression, psychosis, agitation, suicidal ideation,&#xD;
      hypomania or mania, all behaviors associated with increased emotional arousal. Importantly,&#xD;
      these adverse events are more likely to occur in children than adults. With younger ages of&#xD;
      treatment combined with increased and repeated exposure during critical sensitive periods of&#xD;
      neurodevelopment, these adverse events are becoming a rising concern for youth, and may lead&#xD;
      to the development of serious psychopathologies in youth that carry an enormous burden of&#xD;
      illness, such as bipolar disorder (BD). Given that BD typically begins before 18 years of age&#xD;
      and with a depressive episode, there are millions of youth in the U.S. each year who&#xD;
      experience their first bipolar episode as a depressive episode that is routinely treated with&#xD;
      antidepressants. However, the mechanisms and risk factors through which antidepressants&#xD;
      increase risk for developing adverse outcomes are largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Youth with a family history of BD have a high likelihood of developing adverse responses to&#xD;
      antidepressants, possibly because such youth are already vulnerable to developing&#xD;
      dysfunctional emotional arousal and may use antidepressants to treat mood and anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms. Indeed, a family history of BD is among the strongest risk factors for developing&#xD;
      disorders of emotional arousal in youth. Twin and family studies have provided compelling&#xD;
      evidence that having a parent with BD is associated with dramatic increases in risk for the&#xD;
      offspring's development of disorders of emotional arousal compared with the general&#xD;
      population. Moreover, when these offspring develop dysfunctional emotional arousal, their&#xD;
      risk of developing BD increases even further. Antidepressants are commonly used to treat&#xD;
      initial mood presentations; however, they may also accelerate the onset of dysfunctional&#xD;
      emotional arousal in these high-risk youth. In this context, it becomes difficult to&#xD;
      disentangle a natural illness progression from an antidepressant-related dysfunction leading&#xD;
      to BD. Thus, there is a significant clinical dilemma regarding whether antidepressants should&#xD;
      be prescribed to treat youth with a family history of BD, who also have DSM-5 (Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) depressive and anxiety disorders.&#xD;

    <description>Study the neural mechanisms of antidepressant-related dysfunctional arousal by ensuring that the treatment assignment precedes the 4-week scan, and the 4-week scan precedes the assessment of highest arousal measured between 4 and 16 weeks.The change in amygdala hyperactivity from the baseline to 4-week scan will be treated as the outcome and the treatment status (MED vs. No MED) will be treated as the predictor variable. The primary outcome is the level of post-treatment arousal (highest after the 4-week scan). The early change (baseline to 4 weeks) in amygdala hyperactivity, treatment assignment (MED vs. No MED), and the interaction between the two will be the predictors of arousal.</description>
