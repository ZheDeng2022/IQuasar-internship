  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After sustaining severe trauma to the chest, patients will often bleed into the chest cavity&#xD;
      pleural space) which is called hemothorax or they may also experience air leakage within the&#xD;
      chest cavity in combination with the bleeding (hemopneumothorax). The treatment for these&#xD;
      conditions include the insertion of a tube into the chest called a chest tube). Insertion of&#xD;
      the chest tube is commonly very painful for the patient due to the size or diameter of the&#xD;
      tube. Alternatively, procedure it is standard practice in the acute care setting at&#xD;
      Banner-University of Arizona Tucson Campus (B-UATC) to insert a pigtail catheter, which has a&#xD;
      smaller diameter, into the chest wall to treat the hemothorax or hemopnuemothorax. The&#xD;
      primary purpose of this study is to see if the use of the pigtail catheter is just as&#xD;
      effective as chest tube insertion in terms of removing leaked blood and/or air from the chest&#xD;
      cavity. An additional objective of this study is to evaluate which procedure is less painful&#xD;
      for the patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for traumatic hemothorax (HTX) and hemopneumothorax (HPTX) has been an&#xD;
      insertion of a large-bore chest tube (CT) (French 28-32). The procedure is associated with&#xD;
      significant patient's pain and discomfort. Investigator's institution has taken a lead role&#xD;
      to replace chest tube insertion with pigtail catheter (PC) (14F) insertion. The investigators&#xD;
      have previously published that, not only PC works just as well as the traditional CT for both&#xD;
      pneumothorax 1) and hemothorax( 2), but it is also associated with a significant less&#xD;
      insertion pain and tube site pain (3). In that hemothorax study, investigator reported 36&#xD;
      patients who received PC for HTX (2) with the same success as 32-36F chest tube in term of&#xD;
      initial output and success rate; success rate was defined as no further intervention was&#xD;
      needed. Since the completion of that study (December 2011), investigator's division has&#xD;
      inserted probably 100 PC for hemothorax and hemopneumohthorax Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      now believe that it is time for the investigator to demonstrate the efficacy of the PC for&#xD;
      hemothorax with a prospective and randomized study as the investigator had done previously&#xD;
      for traumatic pneumothorax (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that pigtail catheter will be just as effective as the chest&#xD;
      tube in patients with traumatic HTX and HPTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' study aim is to demonstrate the efficacy of the pigtail catheter in a&#xD;
      prospective and randomized fashion as we have done previously in pneumothorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' primary end point is the success/failure rate. Failure is defined as a&#xD;
      second intervention is required i.e., second tube, video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS), etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' secondary end points are the amount of initial tube drainage, 24-hour,&#xD;
      48-hour, 72-hour; and complications, hospital length of stay, and chest tube or pigtail&#xD;
      insertion experience as expressed by the patient.&#xD;
