      The general objective is study medical, socioeconomic, behavioral, health environmental,&#xD;
      school and professional integration, and short- and medium- term quality of life determinants&#xD;
      for all patients under 18 years old, residing in France for which the diagnosis of inherited&#xD;
      metabolic diseases with specific regime (MHMRS) has been achieved during their childhood.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population is a dynamic/open cohort consists of all patients MHMRS diagnosed and&#xD;
      supported in one of the six Centers of Reference for Metabolical disease or one of the three&#xD;
      Centers of Competence for Hereditary Metabolic Diseases or in the Center of Réference for&#xD;
      Hereditary liver Metabolism Diseases since 2000. For each patient, the date of entry into the&#xD;
      cohort is the diagnostic date of MHMRS. The study includes all prevalent and incident cases .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluations include all data collected by querying patients and their families and&#xD;
      medical data collected by the medical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected concern in one hand explanatory variables characterizing the state of&#xD;
      health and quality of life of patients, on the other variables describing the factors&#xD;
      considered as potential determinants, namely:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socio -demographic and socio-economic on the patient and family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical and therapeutic relative to the patient : age at the time of diagnosis, illness&#xD;
           and consequences, type of treatment and diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On possible alterations of physical health: overall assessment of the importance of&#xD;
           using health professionals and specific description of the various physical health&#xD;
           problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psycho- behavioral and cognitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life of patients and their family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the patient's relationship with the care system (access to care and satisfaction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of evaluations is 2 years. The evaluation will be at a consultation in the&#xD;
      usual medical monitoring way up conducted in these children, allowing to collect clinical&#xD;
      information directly nearby medical teams that support them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The various measurement tools used are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  STAI-C and STAI-Y&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BRIEFCOPE and KIDCOPE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GOODMAN questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FAS questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WECHSLER scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VSPA, VSPA-e and VSPA-p&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QUALIN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WHOQOL-BREF&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is under the authority of a Steering Committee comprising representatives of all&#xD;
      the partners in the project teams. The project is supervised by the Scientific Council of the&#xD;
      SFEIM (Société Francaise pour les Erreurs Inées du Métabolisme) and the G2M (Groupement des&#xD;
      centres de référence et de compétence des Maladies héréditaires du Métabolisme) which is&#xD;
      consulted on the scientific guidance of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of a study report will be prepared. It will detail all the decisions inherent in&#xD;
      the conduct of the project and the results obtained. This report will be sent to the Ministry&#xD;
      of Health under the cover of the Delegation for Clinical Research. The report will form the&#xD;
      basis of the adjacent communications will be co-signed by the members of the Steering&#xD;
      Committee and will reference the origin of the aid received.&#xD;
