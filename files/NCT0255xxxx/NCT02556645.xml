      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the efficacy and potential&#xD;
      biological mechanisms of action of 10 sessions of a web-version of Prolonged Exposure (PE),&#xD;
      &quot;Web-PE,&quot; delivered over 8-weeks to 10 sessions of Present Centered Treatment (PCT) delivered&#xD;
      over 8-weeks by a therapist in 120 active duty military personnel with PTSD. Up to 170&#xD;
      individuals will be consented to obtain data from 120 for analysis. Participants will be&#xD;
      assessed at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, and 1-, 3- and 6-months after treatment completion.&#xD;

      Background: It is urgent to make EBTs for military personnel readily accessible in order to&#xD;
      meet the growing demand for effective and efficient treatment for PTSD in a timely manner.&#xD;
      Effective EBTs for PTSD are available, but barriers to accessing care can deter military&#xD;
      personnel from accessing care. Web-treatments represent an innovative way to overcome these&#xD;
      barriers. The efficacy of previously developed web-treatments for PTSD appear promising,&#xD;
      however, they are not based on treatment protocols with strong empirical support for their&#xD;
      efficacy. Hence, it cannot be discerned whether the outcomes associated with existing&#xD;
      web-treatments are due to the new intervention or to factors associated with the use of the&#xD;
      Internet to deliver the treatment. No study to date has examined web-treatment of PTSD using&#xD;
      a well-established treatment program. An important unanswered question is whether moving from&#xD;
      the traditional, costly, access-limiting, therapist-delivered format of an effective&#xD;
      treatment to a more accessible, cost-effective, web-format will impact treatment efficacy. In&#xD;
      addition, based on evidence showing a link between neurosteroids and psychopathology and a&#xD;
      role in PTSD treatment response, an add-on biomarkers study was funded that examines the role&#xD;
      of candidate biomarkers [endogenous glucocorticoids and neurosteroids, i.e. cortisol,&#xD;
      allopregnanolone (ALLO) and metabolites, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA/DHEAS)] as: a)&#xD;
      predictors of treatment response, and b) indices of therapeutic change during PTSD treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective/Hypotheses: To eliminate the confound inherent in changing simultaneously both the&#xD;
      treatment program and the mode of delivery, the investigators propose to develop a&#xD;
      web-version of PE, &quot;Web-PE&quot;, and compare its efficacy to Present Centered Treatment (PCT), an&#xD;
      active control comparison. The investigators hypothesize that Web-PE will be a more&#xD;
      efficacious in reducing PTSD severity than PCT among military personnel returned from&#xD;
      deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq at post-treatment and 3- and 6-months after treatment&#xD;
      completion. In addition, the investigators expect that changes cortisol and neurosteriods&#xD;
      will track symptom change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The first aim is to develop a Web-PE program that will receive high ratings of&#xD;
      ease of use, acceptability, comprehension of program content and functionality, and overall&#xD;
      satisfaction by military personnel with PTSD symptoms and an advisory board of eight experts&#xD;
      in PE and the treatment PTSD in the military. The second aim is to examine the efficacy of&#xD;
      Web-PE by comparing it to therapist-delivered PCT on the following outcomes: 1) Change in&#xD;
      PTSD severity and diagnostic status from pre- to post-treatment; 2) Change in symptoms of&#xD;
      depression, anger, and other frequently co-occurring problems from pre- to post-treatment.&#xD;
      The biological aims of the study include: 1) To identify specific neuroendocrine and&#xD;
      neurosteroid changes that &quot;track&quot; Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptom change over&#xD;
      the course of effective treatment and 2) to determine the specificity of Prolonged Exposure&#xD;
      (PE) -induced neuroendocrine/neurosteroid changes by directly comparing patterns of change&#xD;
      during PE to those during Present Centered Therapy (PCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: During Phase I (months 0-9), the investigators will develop and demonstrate the&#xD;
      feasibility of the Web-PE program by piloting it with 10 military personnel with PTSD or&#xD;
      subclinical PTSD and by members of the expert advisory board. During Phase II (months 9-36),&#xD;
      the investigators will conduct an RCT comparing the efficacy of Web-PE with&#xD;
      therapist-delivered PCT on measures of PTSD symptom severity and related psychopathology with&#xD;
      160 OIF/OEF active duty military personnel with PTSD. Cortisol Awakening Response collected&#xD;
      at home on the three mornings prior to the research sessions that occur at baseline, week 4,&#xD;
      one and three months follow-up. Script driven imagery saliva collection for salivary cortisol&#xD;
      in response to the general environment and specific trauma cues at baseline, week 4, and one&#xD;
      and three months follow-up. Serum neurosteriods (allopregnanolone, pregnenolone,&#xD;
      pregnanolone, androsterone, DHEA) at baseline, week 4 and 1 month follow-up of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: Untreated PTSD becomes a chronic disorder, leaving military service-men and -women&#xD;
      less effective or unable to perform their military duties, more likely to have comorbid&#xD;
      mental and physical health problems as well as difficulties in daily functioning (Vasterling&#xD;
      et al., 2007). The proposed Web-PE program can function as the first step in a step care&#xD;
      model. As such it is expected to greatly facilitate the dissemination of EBT to those in need&#xD;
      by capitalizing on the greater accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and anonymity that is&#xD;
      afforded by Internet. Thus, the proposed study directly targets the MOM/JPC interest in&#xD;
      research aim at developing and validating novel EBTs that exploit innovative telemedicine&#xD;
      technologies. Because Web-PE could be accessed at home, the proposed study is also relevant&#xD;
      to the MOM/ JPC interest in strategies to reduce the stigma associated with PTSD treatment.&#xD;
      Integrating affective neuroscience methods into an RCT can make each study more informative,&#xD;
      effective, and less expensive than two independent studies. Neurobiological studies of PTSD&#xD;
      have linked specific candidate biomarkers [endogenous glucocorticoids and neurosteroids, i.e.&#xD;
      cortisol, allopregnanolone (ALLO) and metabolites, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA/DHEAS)]&#xD;
      to PTSD severity and potentially to treatment response. Identifying the mechanisms involved&#xD;
      in treatment response can assist in improving therapeutic techniques by targeting specific&#xD;
      neurobiological processes involved.&#xD;
