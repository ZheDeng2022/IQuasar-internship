    <textblock>
      Patients with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will be randomized to a 12-week&#xD;
      intervention of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga Trauma Relief Program (SKY) or a wait list control (WLC)&#xD;
      to assess the effects of this intervention on symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, quality&#xD;
      of life, autonomic symptoms, and blood inflammatory markers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-center, single blind longitudinal randomized controlled naturalistic trial comparing&#xD;
      a 12 week Sudarshan Kriya Yoga Trauma Relief Program (SKY) intervention to a wait list&#xD;
      control (WLC) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research participants will be men and women, 18-75 years of age, who have PTSD. The study&#xD;
      will recruit from the general adult ambulatory mental health clinics as well as the geriatric&#xD;
      mental health program in London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be screened as per inclusion and exclusion criteria by trained&#xD;
      research staff. These patients will already have clinically diagnosed PTSD by a psychiatrist&#xD;
      and any other comorbid diagnoses would have already been confirmed. However, for research&#xD;
      purposes a diagnosis of PTSD will be confirmed through a structured clinical interview&#xD;
      specifically the MINI (Mini International neuropsychiatric Interview) and the&#xD;
      Clinician-administered PTSD Scale for DSM5- past month version (CAPS5). CAPS5 will also be&#xD;
      used to rule out exclusion criteria of severe depersonalization and derealization. The scales&#xD;
      will be administered by a trained research staff and confirmed by a psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MINI will also be used to assess for suicidality. If the total score on Questions C1 and&#xD;
      C2 is more than 5 at any time during the study then this will be reported to the PI who will&#xD;
      further assess the patient for safety and risk assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is above the age of 65 years of age they will also be asked to complete a&#xD;
      cognitive screening test (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE) to ensure they are not&#xD;
      suffering from any memory impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to either SKY or WLC with&#xD;
      equal probability (1:1) using computer generated randomisation numbers. Concealment of&#xD;
      randomisation to outcome assessors and investigators will be ensured by an independent staff&#xD;
      member who will perform the randomisation using a third party web based provider.&#xD;
      Computerised randomization will take place in the Geriatric Mental Health Program outpatient&#xD;
      unit in London Health Sciences, London, Ontario. A telephone number will be available for&#xD;
      study concerns/queries. Pre-randomized information will be stored using unique de-identifiers&#xD;
      and downloaded on a secure database. It will not be possible to blind participants to&#xD;
      intervention status hence the single-blind design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SKY training involves attending a week-long (6 days) course that teaches the basic principles&#xD;
      of SKY over 2.5-3 hour daily sessions. This will be followed by once weekly follow up&#xD;
      sessions (90 min/wk) for 3 weeks and then bimonthly sessions (every 2 weeks) for the next 8&#xD;
      weeks. In addition, participants will be asked to practice SKY at home daily (25 min/day)&#xD;
      throughout the duration of the study period and log practice frequency and any other&#xD;
      noteworthy observations in a log sheet that will be provided to them (please see attached log&#xD;
      sheet). Meals will be provided for 2 days during the initial SKY training course and&#xD;
      nutritional snacks on the other 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the control arm of the study will continue to receive their&#xD;
      treatment as usual, including pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy. They will follow&#xD;
      assessment and study procedures as listed below. Upon completing the initial 12 weeks of the&#xD;
      study, participants in the WLC arm will also be offered the opportunity to learn SKY and&#xD;
      attend follow up therapy sessions; that is, WLC participants will be offered the same&#xD;
      intervention as the SKY group received in the first 12 weeks of the study. No study&#xD;
      procedures will be applied or any other information collected during this period except for a&#xD;
      final assessment that will take place at 24 weeks (see below).&#xD;
