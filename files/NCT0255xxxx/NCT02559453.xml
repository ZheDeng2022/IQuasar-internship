  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have designed this study to determine whether performing two, compared with ≥3 operations&#xD;
      has an effect on key clinical outcomes after discharge from the hospital of an infected wound&#xD;
      that requires admission. Each arm of this study represents the two commonly practiced&#xD;
      standard of care treatment plans for patients presenting with infected wounds. It is&#xD;
      currently unknown which SoC option provides the best patient outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of consensus about whether or not a patient with an infected wound requires&#xD;
      more than 2 surgical procedures. For patients admitted for an infected wound this study will&#xD;
      investigate whether 2, compared with ≥3, operative interventions results in better outcomes.&#xD;
      All patients admitted for an infected wound will be assessed for eligibility in the study. If&#xD;
      eligible, subjects will be randomized into Cohort A (2 operative visits) or Cohort B (≥3&#xD;
      operative visits). Subjects will then be followed during the hospitalization as well as 180&#xD;
      days post discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 250 subjects will be enrolled into this study. Two operations (n=125) will be&#xD;
      compared with ≥3 operations (n=125) during the hospitalization. We will compare the following&#xD;
      factors between the two treatment groups: length of hospital stay; readmission&#xD;
      post-discharge; quality of life; proportion of wounds closed or covered with a graft; culture&#xD;
      results; host factors; environmental factors post-hospital discharge; and, financial charges&#xD;
      related to admission and readmission. We expect full enrollment to take 3 years in duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Debridement of the wound will be performed in the customary manner per SOC in the operating&#xD;
      room. Prior to the start of the study, the surgeons performing the operations will be&#xD;
      required to view a video that demonstrates the standardized debridement technique that will&#xD;
      be utilized. The following is the standardized technique depicted in the video:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All wound surfaces will be painted with dye prior to debridement. Debridement involves the&#xD;
      use of a scalpel, scissors, curette, rongeur, or hydro-surgery. A 2-3 millimeter skin edge&#xD;
      around the perimeter of the wound will also be resected. All infected/nonviable tissue will&#xD;
      be removed and all tissues with dye will be surgically removed. This includes decompression&#xD;
      of any purulent material and excision of any indurated tissue (until tissue pliability is&#xD;
      established). Nonviable tissue includes necrotic and fibrous tissue. Debridement will be&#xD;
      performed until the there is bleeding on the wound base and perimeter.&#xD;
