  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV study cohort, uncontrolled, composed of two segments: children and healthy&#xD;
      adults. It will be included 2756 children and 2005 adults, evaluated initially in six&#xD;
      different times (before vaccination, 30-45 days, 1 year, 4 years, 7 years and 10 years after&#xD;
      vaccination). The Paraiba state was selected for the study because in this region there are&#xD;
      no yellow fever virus dissemination and therefore no NIP recommendation for people's routine&#xD;
      vaccination. However, the NIP indicate yellow fever vaccination for individuals who are&#xD;
      moving to areas with virus circulation. The study will take place in six (6) Basic Health&#xD;
      Units of three (3) municipalities (2 units per municipality) in the state of Paraíba. The&#xD;
      selected municipalities are: Alhambra, Caaporã and Conde. The study target population&#xD;
      consisted of healthy children and adults of both sexes. Children must be between 9 months and&#xD;
      4 years,11months and 29 days; adults between 18 and 50 years. It will be eligible for the&#xD;
      study, people who have never received the yellow fever vaccine checked in vaccine design and&#xD;
      history and who agree to participate. Not be included participants with any contraindication&#xD;
      to vaccination against yellow fever and individuals who previously moved to risk areas for&#xD;
      extended periods. The study main objective is to assess the immune status of children and&#xD;
      adults who have never vaccinated, they will receive the first dose of 17DD yellow fever&#xD;
      vaccine provided by the study and will be monitored for 10 years. Depending on the results of&#xD;
      the analyzed of the data, the period of monitoring may be extended.&#xD;
