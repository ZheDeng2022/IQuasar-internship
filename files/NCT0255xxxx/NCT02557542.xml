      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Measure the quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained at 3 months (using EuroQoL's&#xD;
           EQ-5D) &amp; AVVQ by patients randomised to treatment in the One Stop Vein Clinic with&#xD;
           patients randomised to treatment in the normal care pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient satisfaction with the service provided using the Picker patient experience&#xD;
                questionnaire both post-operatively and at the 3 months follow-up (One Stop Vein&#xD;
                Clinic versus Normal Care Pathway)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measure and compare the quality of life scores using CIVIQ at 0 and 3 months in&#xD;
                patients randomised to treatment in the One Stop Vein Clinic with patients&#xD;
                randomised to the Normal Care Pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Record the time from referral to treatment (RTT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assess the cost-effectiveness of the One Stop Vein clinic compared to the normal&#xD;
                care pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Record the time to return to normal activities and to work&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assess the estimated societal costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND Varicose veins are very common conditions, affecting approximately 25% of the&#xD;
      population. Over 35,000 varicose vein procedures are currently carried out in the UK.&#xD;
      However, with the new 2013 NICE guidelines, the Department of Health has estimated that this&#xD;
      is set to increase to 50,000 per year. Waiting for varicose vein interventions has been shown&#xD;
      to be detrimental to the severity of the condition and the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
      Progression of varicose veins can also lead to complications such as leg ulcerations and can&#xD;
      be costly to the health service. Over the past decade, new endovenous techniques have been&#xD;
      introduced and these are felt to be cost-effective, especially, when performed in an&#xD;
      outpatient or 'office-based' setting. At present, patients referred to the Vascular unit for&#xD;
      consideration of management of their varicose veins have to attend the outpatient clinic at&#xD;
      least twice prior to be listed for their procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, patients referred to the Vascular Outpatient Clinics for consideration for&#xD;
      varicose vein management have an initial appointment where the severity of the venous&#xD;
      insufficiency is assessed clinically and, subsequently, have a venous Duplex scan to evaluate&#xD;
      the extent and cause of any venous incompetence. If any treatable lesion is found, they are&#xD;
      then added to the waiting list to come for the eventual varicose vein procedure. This means,&#xD;
      they have to attend at least two outpatient appointments and attend another appointment for&#xD;
      their venous scans, before actually attending for their varicose vein procedure. Waiting for&#xD;
      varicose vein interventions has been shown to lead to worsening of their conditions both&#xD;
      clinically and radiologically. In addition, the quality of life of patients waiting for&#xD;
      elective surgery is adversely affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate patients' ideas and expectations with respect to the provision of&#xD;
      varicose vein service in the investigator's unit, they conducted a survey of patients&#xD;
      attending the Vascular Outpatient Clinic between March and June 2014. One hundred and six&#xD;
      patients completed the anonymous questionnaire. Most were females (62.4%) with a mean age of&#xD;
      51 Â± 15 years. More than 90% of patients stated that the waiting time between a Vascular&#xD;
      appointment and a venous scan should be no more than 1 month and 85% of patients believed&#xD;
      varicose vein procedures should be received within 1 month of their Vascular clinic&#xD;
      appointment. Ninety percent of patients were agreeable to attend a 'one-stop' vein clinic&#xD;
      offering same day diagnosis and treatment. Patients were generally accepting of the fact that&#xD;
      most procedures would be carried out under local anaesthetic (89%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, it appears that patients in this unit have a preference for a one stop clinic. This&#xD;
      concept is not new and has been piloted in other specialities with good success - a one-stop&#xD;
      carpal tunnel clinic as well as a one stop cataract clinic was shown to be feasible with good&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. Both laparoscopic and open inguinal hernia repairs, where patients&#xD;
      received a general anaesthetic, have been carried out successfully using a one stop model&#xD;
      offering same day diagnosis and treatment. There is currently already a 'see and treat'&#xD;
      service for skin lumps operating at many NHS Trusts and there is already a one stop carpal&#xD;
      tunnel service being provided at the Imperial College NHS Trust. It would appear that these&#xD;
      one stop clinics have the advantage of reducing the number of unnecessary hospital visits as&#xD;
      well as possibly leading to cost savings to the health service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, the investigators intend to evaluate the one stop model within their own&#xD;
      varicose vein service. They will assess the feasibility of having a one-stop vein clinic,&#xD;
      where patients will be assessed, have their venous Duplex scans and, depending on the lesions&#xD;
      shown, have their venous treatment on the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothetical benefits of such a stratagem are an improvement in patient satisfaction, a&#xD;
      reduction in the number of appointments, the abolition of any waiting times as well as cost&#xD;
      savings to the health savings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS GP referrals will be screened and patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      invited to take part in the trial .&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be sent an information pack containing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Information leaflet about the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Information about varicose veins, their treatments and a telephone number as a helpline&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), the Chronic Venous Disease Quality of&#xD;
           Life Questionnaire (CIVIQ) and EuroQoL's quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Consent form to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients agreeing to be part of the trial will be consented and randomised either to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The One Stop Vein Clinic (offering same day diagnosis and treatment); or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The normal care pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients indicate their consent to participate, their General Practitioners (GP) will be&#xD;
      sent a letter informing them of the patient's participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients declining to partake in the randomised part of the study, but agreeable to complete&#xD;
      study questionnaires while continuing down the normal care pathway, will also be consented.&#xD;
      Further information will be provided to them when they attend for their clinic appointment&#xD;
      and the consenting process will take place when they attend for their subsequent procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      One Stop Vein Clinic Pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending the One Stop Vein Clinic will be reviewed by the Vascular Surgeon, who&#xD;
      will confirm the patient's consent in the trial, then assess the degree of venous disease and&#xD;
      fill in the Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification and Varicose&#xD;
      Clinical Severity Score (VCSS). If the patient's symptoms are deemed secondary to venous&#xD;
      disease, they will be sent to have a Duplex scan to confirm the presence of the venous&#xD;
      disease. The results will be reviewed by the Vascular Surgeons, and if the patients are&#xD;
      suitable for endovenous ablation +/- avulsions or UGFS, they will be informed of the findings&#xD;
      of the scan and proposed treatment. If they are happy to go ahead with the proposed&#xD;
      intervention, they will be consented and transferred to the waiting area to wait for their&#xD;
      intervention. If, however, they decline same day treatment, they will be put onto the&#xD;
      conventional care pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another Vascular Surgeon will be carrying out the interventions in an 'office-based'&#xD;
      environment under local anaesthetic. Once done, the patients will be asked to fill the Picker&#xD;
      patient experience questionnaire. They will subsequently be discharged, similar to current&#xD;
      practice, and will be given a diary card to fill for when they return to their normal&#xD;
      activities and work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three (3) months post-operatively, they will be asked to fill the AVVQ, CIVIQ, EQ-5D and&#xD;
      Picker patient experience questionnaires once more. This will be done by sending them the&#xD;
      questionnaires by post.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Normal Care Pathway (NCP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the normal care pathway, patients referred by their GP are seen in the outpatient clinic&#xD;
      and, if their symptoms are suggestive of varicose vein disease, they are sent to have a&#xD;
      venous duplex scan. This usually happens on a different day. Afterwards, they are seen back&#xD;
      in the clinic (again on a different day) and, if the scan result suggests venous incompetence&#xD;
      amenable to day case treatment, they are added to the waiting list. The eventual procedure&#xD;
      takes place some time later (within 18 weeks from referral to treatment). After their&#xD;
      procedure, they will be asked to fill a Picker patient experience questionnaire. On&#xD;
      discharge, they will be given a diary card to fill for when they return to their normal&#xD;
      activities and work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 months post intervention, patients randomised to the normal care pathway will be sent&#xD;
      the QoL questionnaires again and asked to fill the AVVQ, CIVIQ, EQ-5D and Picker patient&#xD;
      experience questionnaires. As there will be an inherent delay in the NCP pathway, the time&#xD;
      from randomisation cannot be used as many patients will not have received their&#xD;
      interventional treatment by then.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adults over the age of 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Unilateral lower limb symptoms suggestive of venous disease on the referral letter&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recurrent varicose veins&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Known arterial disease or ABPI&lt;0.8&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Current deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients who withdraw their consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Inability to complete the questionnaire or attend follow up appointments&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Currently enrolled in other venous study&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT SELECTION This is a pilot randomised controlled study and patients will be selected&#xD;
      following screening of the GP referral letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT As part of the consenting process, patients will be given three options.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients wishing to attend the One Stop Vein Clinic and participate in the study will be&#xD;
           asked to indicate their consent by signing a consent form and filling in a reply slip.&#xD;
           Patients will be randomised either to the One Stop Vein Clinic group or to the Normal&#xD;
           Care Pathway (NCP) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients not wishing to attend the One Stop Vein Clinic and participate in the study&#xD;
           will be asked to indicate this by filling in a reply slip. They will instead attend the&#xD;
           normal care pathway. They will, however, be asked, if agreeable to complete the QoL and&#xD;
           Picker patient experience forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients declining either the trial or simple service evaluation will be offered the&#xD;
           NCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT ALLOCATION Treatment received will depend on the findings on the venous Duplex&#xD;
      scan. All treatments are minimally invasive with endovenous ablation procedures (either&#xD;
      radio-frequency ablation, endovenous laser ablation or mechano-chemical ablation), avulsions&#xD;
      or ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy. All procedures will be carried out under local&#xD;
      anaesthetic and patients will be discharged home later that day, as is the current standard&#xD;
      of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      â¢ Measure the quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained at 3 months (by patients randomised&#xD;
      to treatment in the One Stop Vein Clinic with patients randomised to treatment in the Normal&#xD;
      Care Pathway)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction with the service provided using the Picker patient experience&#xD;
           questionnaire both post-operatively and at the 3 months follow-up (One Stop Vein Clinic&#xD;
           versus Normal Care Pathway)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure and compare the quality of life scores using EQ-5D, AVVQ and CIVIQ at 0 and 3&#xD;
           months in patients randomised to treatment in the One Stop Vein Clinic with patients&#xD;
           randomised to the Normal Care Pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time from referral to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the cost-effectiveness of the One Stop Vein clinic compared to the normal care&#xD;
           pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the time to return to normal activities and to work&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the estimated societal costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION &amp; SAMPLE SIZE Following screening of their GP referral letter, patients with&#xD;
      varicose vein disease will be invited to participate in the study. It is estimated that 12-14&#xD;
      patients will be invited on a weekly basis to participate in the study following screening.&#xD;
      Out of those, only 8 patients is expected to agree to be randomised to the One Stop Vein&#xD;
      Clinic or Normal Care Pathway. If the clinic is held weekly, approximately 416 patients could&#xD;
      be recruited over the course of the year (8 patients X 52 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis suggests that the sample size of 208 patients per group would be able to&#xD;
      power a potential phase 3 multicentre randomised controlled trial. Compared to a previous&#xD;
      study conducted in the investigators' unit which involved 317 patients in total and looked at&#xD;
      different quality of life scores and their responsiveness11, the coefficient of variation&#xD;
      (ratio of standard deviation to mean) was found to increase at the follow-up period and to&#xD;
      vary among the different scores used. With a larger sample size as in this pilot study, this&#xD;
      variability would be reduced and result in a smaller coefficient of variation when looking at&#xD;
      the follow-up scores. Hopefully, this will enable us to identify the QoL score with the least&#xD;
      variability and use it as the primary outcome measure in a future Phase 3 study. A primary&#xD;
      outcome measure with little variability would provide us with enough information to estimate&#xD;
      an adequate sample size for any future randomised controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, with a sample size of 208 patients and coefficient of variation of 0.5, a 15%&#xD;
      reduction in the geometric mean (a measure of central tendency, similar to median) would be&#xD;
      required compared to 25% from the Shepherd et al. study. With power at 85%, this would allow&#xD;
      us to determine an adequate sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed-up post-procedure for 3 months, including for patients&#xD;
      randomised to the Normal Care Pathway (with potentially longer waiting time from referral to&#xD;
      treatment). This means that the study period will be about 18 months. With 3 months for study&#xD;
      start-up and 3 months to write the study up, the study will last for 24 months. Approximately&#xD;
      1,000 patients undergo varicose vein procedures at the Imperial College NHS Trust every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COST BENEFIT OF PROJECT The hypothesis is that along with improved patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      improved waiting times for outpatient appointment, there will be cost savings derived from&#xD;
      the One Stop Vein Clinic. On average, 1,000 patients are treated every year in the Imperial&#xD;
      College NHS Trust and the cost of an outpatient attendance is approximately Â£93. Savings&#xD;
      could be made if patients are seen and treated at their first appointment rather than having&#xD;
      to attend another two appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential cost saving is estimated to be in the order of Â£186,000 annually (Â£93 x 1,000 X&#xD;
      2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated societal costs. Data will be collected on time off from work and carer's duties&#xD;
      (child/relative/friend). Additionally, data on income, cost of attending clinic and impact on&#xD;
      family and colleagues will be assessed to estimate the societal cost of the two pathways.&#xD;
