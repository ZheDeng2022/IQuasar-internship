  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Putting the limited use of titration algorithms in the context of escalating diabetes&#xD;
      prevalence rates, strategies and tools are urgently needed to help both patients and primary&#xD;
      care providers efficiently initiate and continue basal insulin therapy. Basel insulin is&#xD;
      considered to be the appropriate strategy after oral diabetic agent failure. This project&#xD;
      could set the stage for the need for a blood glucose meter with built-in algorithms designed&#xD;
      to support decision making by patients as well as care providers. Furthermore, the project&#xD;
      will evaluate the uptake and use of the newly developed Meter by Abbott Diabetes Care, which&#xD;
      was launched in Canada in October 2014, and its impact on primary care diabetes consultation.&#xD;

      The objectives of this study are to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe patients' and care providers' satisfaction associated with the use of the&#xD;
           FreeStyle Precision Neo-Meter&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the uptake and use of the Meter&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Describe the impact of the Meter on primary care diabetes consultation from care&#xD;
           providers' perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve the objectives of this study, diabetes healthcare providers and people&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes who have been using the Neo meter will be interviewed. Maximum&#xD;
      variability will be sought for provider discipline and patient demographic characteristics.&#xD;
      Sampling will continue until theme saturation is reached. A total of up to 20 (10 care&#xD;
      providers and 10 people with diabetes) will be interviewed for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes healthcare provider interview: Two care providers from each discipline including&#xD;
      physicians, nurses, nurse educators and dietitians in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, who have&#xD;
      been using the Neo meter will be recruited for interviews. Care providers satisfaction will&#xD;
      be assessed after the use of the Meter with sample representation of sole and team based&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient interviews: Eligible patients who agreed to participate in the study will be provided&#xD;
      with a Neo meter and test strips. Their care providers will provide them with instructions,&#xD;
      guidance and support in using the device as part of their self-management activities.&#xD;
      Patients will be interviewed 3 months after (post only) the use of the Meter to assess their&#xD;
      satisfaction with its functionality, capacity, design and ease-of-use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will take place at a location and time convenient for participants and will take&#xD;
      approximately 45min-60min in Oct/Nov 2015. Interviews will be audio tape recorded to allow&#xD;
      for a fluid discussion such that the interviewer does not need to stop the conversation to&#xD;
      take notes. A letter of information and consent form will be provided to participants.&#xD;
