    <textblock>
      The subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a relatively severe disease whose prognosis is&#xD;
      particularly related to the early onset of arterial vasospasm, maximum between the 5th and&#xD;
      14th day after SAH. Many obstacles make it difficult screening and monitoring of such&#xD;
      complication. The challenge is to be able to demonstrate a reduction in regional cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow before the onset of irreversible parenchymal sequelae, responsible for the&#xD;
      majority of long-term morbidity among survivors. In clinical routine, screening vasospasm is&#xD;
      achieved by Doppler intracranial arteries (DTC). However, its sensitivity is poor with regard&#xD;
      to the middle and anterior cerebral arteries. The gold standard for diagnosis is cerebral&#xD;
      arteriography. However, vasospasm in arteriography or trans-cranial Doppler does not&#xD;
      prejudice the appearance of a delayed ischemic deficit.&#xD;
