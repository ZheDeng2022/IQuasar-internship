      The overall aim of this proposed research is to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of a&#xD;
      decision support system aimed at reducing glucose variability in T1DM patient using an&#xD;
      insulin pump. The system will be deployed on our portable medical application platform (DiAs)&#xD;
      and will include insulin pump treatment parameters optimization and an exercise risk warning&#xD;
      system, capable of predicting hypoglycemia at the onset of physical activity and advising on&#xD;
      mitigating alteration of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second phase of the trial will enroll additional users of insulin pumps, and subjects who&#xD;
      treat their T1DM with the use of multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin. MDI users should&#xD;
      be administering the Lantus (glargine) dose at approximately the same time each day and use&#xD;
      only one basal rate per day. MDI users will also use MySugr app to count carbohydrates for&#xD;
      all meals that require insulin treatment.&#xD;
