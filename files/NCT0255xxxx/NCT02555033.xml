    <textblock>
      Aging results in a gradual decline of physical abilities and consequently in functional&#xD;
      impairments which increases the risk of falls in elderly people. It has been shown, that&#xD;
      balance and resistance training can counteract the effects of aging. The aim of this study&#xD;
      was to investigate effects of instability resistance training (IRT), combining balance and&#xD;
      resistance training, on measures of muscle strength / power and balance for falls in healthy&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults. Therefore 75 elderly people, aged 65 - 80 years (Mage =&#xD;
      70.4; SD = 4.3 years) were assigned into three intervention groups: machine-based (M-RT),&#xD;
      machine-based instability (M-IRT), free weight instability resistance training (F-IRT). All&#xD;
      three groups exercised over 10-weeks with two training sessions per week. Assessment of&#xD;
      muscle strength (e.g. maximal isometric leg extension strength), power (e.g. chair rise test)&#xD;
      and balance (e.g. gait, functional reach test) was conducted before and after training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the principle of training specificity, it is assumed, that groups to improve better&#xD;
      within their respective training modality. Thus, the investigators hypothesis that regarding&#xD;
      measures of strength and power, M-RT performs better than M-IRT, performs better than F-IRT.&#xD;
      As to measures of balance, we hypothesis that F-IRT performs better that M-IRT, performs&#xD;
      better than M-RT.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the course of aging, physical abilities gradually decline. Even though the cause of falls&#xD;
      is assumed to be multifactorial, loss in muscle strength and balance control seems to be the&#xD;
      most crucial intrinsic risk factors for falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several meta-analysis and reviews emphasise positive effects of resistance, balance and&#xD;
      combined exercise interventions on measure of strength, power and balance performance and&#xD;
      thus on intrinsic (i.e., person-related) risk factors for falls. Pure balance as well as pure&#xD;
      resistance training have been effective in improving postural control (e.g., gait measures,&#xD;
      leg extension strength) and reducing risk of falling in elderly people. Combined resistance&#xD;
      and balance training describes in general a sequential or concurrent training program, where&#xD;
      resistance and balance exercises are executed in a consecutive order within the same training&#xD;
      session. These exercise interventions have shown positive effects as well. Merging resistance&#xD;
      and balance training, executing both simultaneously has not been investigated in regard to&#xD;
      fall prevention in elderly people yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past 15 years, research of simultaneous resistance and balance training, so called&#xD;
      'instability resistance training' (IRT), has been grown. IRT utilises unstable devices (Swiss&#xD;
      balls, BOSU® balls, wobble boards, etc.) and an external load (e.g., weights). This training&#xD;
      modality has shown to affect core and lower limb muscle activation positively, improving&#xD;
      balance and further having comparable gains in measures of strength analogue to traditional&#xD;
      resistance training. Kibele and Behm, for example, found superior improvements in the single&#xD;
      leg hop following an IRT in healthy young adults. They concluded in line with the principle&#xD;
      of training specificity, that IRT induced higher balance adaptions, which were prominent in&#xD;
      the balance demanding singe leg hop. Further, Behm and Colado recommended IRT for elderly&#xD;
      people and there are studies investigating effects of different kinds of IRT on older adults.&#xD;
      Granacher and colleagues examined effects of core instability strength training (CIT) on&#xD;
      measures of trunk muscle strength, spinal mobility, dynamic balance and functional mobility&#xD;
      in older adults. They found meaningful improvements in measures of strength, balance and&#xD;
      mobility in comparison to a control group. Another study, investigating effects of a swiss&#xD;
      ball exercise program on older adults, found positive effects on measures of physical fitness&#xD;
      and balance in comparison to a control group. Based on used exercises, these studies focused&#xD;
      on strengthening the core and improving mainly balance abilities. In a slightly different&#xD;
      approach to improve balance in older women, Chulvi-Medrano and colleagues utilized a&#xD;
      lower-limb training program using a unstable T-Bow® device. The training group improved in&#xD;
      measures of dynamic, static and overall balance, whereas the control group experienced a&#xD;
      decline or no change in balance abilities. All three aforementioned studies utilised unstable&#xD;
      devices but none incorporated additional loads within their training programs, hence the&#xD;
      resistance component of IRT is limited to bodyweight. Hence, there is a lack of literature&#xD;
      supporting evidence for feasibility and effectiveness of IRT incorporating additional load as&#xD;
      resistance to improve measures of strength, power and balance in elderly people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators knowledge, no study has been conducted yet, investigating effects of IRT&#xD;
      with additional load as resistance on risk factors for falls for elderly people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was acquired in our biomechanics laboratory. Questionnaires were completed in separated&#xD;
      rooms. All tests were conducted and explained, using standardised verbal instructions&#xD;
      regarding the test procedure to maintain equal treatment for all participants. A single&#xD;
      assessment lasted 90 min per participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength / power assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Well established clinical and biomechanical tests were administered to measure primary&#xD;
      outcomes in muscle strength and power. In accordance with the recommendations of Granacher et&#xD;
      al. strength assessments were performed after balance assessments to reduce interfering&#xD;
      effects of muscle fatigue. Further, strength and balance tests were administered in a random&#xD;
      order within their respective block. One practice trial was provided for every test. Test&#xD;
      procedures were conducted according to the recommendations of Gschwind et al. if not stated&#xD;
      otherwise. Two test trials were executed using the mean for further statistical analysis.&#xD;
      Except for maximal isometric leg extension strength and hand grip strength. There, the better&#xD;
      value of two consecutive trials was used for statistical analysis. In between the trials,&#xD;
      sufficient recovery periods were provided to reduce fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal isometric leg extension strength (ILES) was examined with a cable pull device (Takei&#xD;
      A5002, Fitness Monitors, Wrexham, England) with an upright body posture. Individual cable&#xD;
      lengths were chosen to ensure a knee angle of approximately 135°. Participants were asked to&#xD;
      start &quot;pull[ing] initially with a moderate intensity and slowly increase the intensity to&#xD;
      maximum exertion while keeping the upper body extended and upright&quot; to prevent injuries. To&#xD;
      ensure upright posture, participants were instructed to maintain contact between shoulder and&#xD;
      wall and not lift their scapula while pulling. The test was repeated with at least one minute&#xD;
      between measurements. The ILES showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = .98) for leg&#xD;
      extension strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure handgrip strength a Takei hand dynamometer (Takei A5401, Fitness Monitors,&#xD;
      Wrexham, England) was used. Participants stood upright with their arm aligned to the body and&#xD;
      squeeze the device as hard as they could, using the dominant hand. The handle's width was&#xD;
      adjusted to the participant's hand size. The intermediate phalanges had to be placed on the&#xD;
      inner handle. The Takei handy dynamometer showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC =&#xD;
      .95).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to isometric strength, power tests were conducted. Supplementary to the standard&#xD;
      Chair Rise Test (CRT) on stable surface, test trials were recorded while standing on a foam&#xD;
      pad (AIREX©) as well. Participants had to stand up and sit down five times as quickly as they&#xD;
      could, without the aid of their arms. Therefore, arms had to be folded across the upper body.&#xD;
      Time was measured by an ordinary stop watch to the nearest .01 second. After the countdown&#xD;
      &quot;ready-set-go&quot;, testing time was started and stopped when participants were sitting down for&#xD;
      the fifth time. For the CRT high test-retest reliability has been shown (ICC = .89).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a stair climb power test was administered. This test has shown meaningful&#xD;
      associations with mobility performance and strength measures. Ascent and descent times were&#xD;
      recorded separately and power was calculated with the following formula: P =((M x D) x g )/t,&#xD;
      where P = Power (Watt), M = Body mass (kg), D = Vertical distance covered (meters), t = Time&#xD;
      (seconds) and g = 9.8 (constant of gravity). Participants were instructed to walk quickly but&#xD;
      safely up and down a 9-step flight of stairs (17 cm step height). Time was started after the&#xD;
      cue to go and stopped when the second foot reached the top step and/or the floor,&#xD;
      respectively. Use of the handrail was allowed for safety reasons. Time was measured with an&#xD;
      ordinary stop watch to the nearest .01 second. Test-retest reliability has shown to be&#xD;
      excellent (r = .99).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic steady-state balance was tested while walking on a 10-m walkway, measuring&#xD;
      temporal-spatial gait variables (stride length (cm), double support time (%), speed (m/s),&#xD;
      step width (cm)) using a two-dimensional OptoGait© system (Microgait, Bozano, Italy). In&#xD;
      addition the coefficient of variation was computed (CV = (SD/mean) x 100). The OptoGait©&#xD;
      system showed high interclass correlation coefficients (ICC's = .93 - .99) and high&#xD;
      concurrent validity between the OptoGait© system and a previously validated system.&#xD;
      Participants were asked to walk for 10 m with their own footwear at a self-selected pace&#xD;
      three times to calculate test-retest reliability. Because the OptoGait© system is able to&#xD;
      record automatically, a starting signal was not necessary. A three-minute interval was given&#xD;
      between individual trials to rest, save the data as well as to prepare for the next trial. At&#xD;
      the start and the end of the walkway sufficient distance was provided to accelerate and&#xD;
      decelerate safely. In addition, the first and last step was excluded from analysis to&#xD;
      eliminate possible acceleration and deceleration bias. Each trial was recorded with 1000 Hz&#xD;
      using the manufacture provided OptoGait© software running on a laptop computer (Lenovo&#xD;
      ThinkPad T530).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proactive balance was tested using the Functional Reach Test (FRT) and the Timed up and Go&#xD;
      Test (TUG). The FRT measures the maximal distance participants were able to reach forward&#xD;
      while standing. For this purpose, participants were instructed lift their dominant arm and to&#xD;
      reach forward as far as they could without taking a step forward. Maximal reach distance (cm)&#xD;
      was assessed. The FRT showed excellent test-retest reliability with elderly people (ICC =&#xD;
      .92). FRT trials were repeated when participants were not able to maintain both feet on the&#xD;
      ground at a fixed position. In addition to the standard FRT on solid surface, test trials&#xD;
      were recorded while standing on a foam pad (AIREX©) as well. For the TUG, participants were&#xD;
      asked to rise from a chair and walk three meters in their normal walking speed around a cone,&#xD;
      return and sit down. Time for the TUG was recorded with an ordinary stopwatch to the nearest&#xD;
      .01 second on the command &quot;ready-set-go&quot; and stopped as soon as the participants sat down.&#xD;
      The TUG showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = .99) in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test reactive balance, the Push and Release Test (PRT) was used. The PRT rates the&#xD;
      postural response to a sudden perturbation. Participants were instructed to push backwards&#xD;
      against the examiner's hands and to regain their balance after the examiner releases his&#xD;
      hands. The number of steps required to regain balance was counted and the corresponding score&#xD;
      was recorded (0 = 1 step, 1 = 2-3 small steps backwards with independent recovery, 2 = ≥4&#xD;
      steps with independent recovery, 3 = steps with assistance for recovery, 4 = fall or unable&#xD;
      to stand without assistance). For a detailed description of the PRT see Jacobs and&#xD;
      colleagues. The PRT showed high test-retest reliability (ICC = .84) with a sensitivity of 89%&#xD;
      and a specificity of 85%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial functions were assessed using several questionnaires. Global cognition was&#xD;
      tested using the MMSE, which is a reliable test for assessing cognitive function showing high&#xD;
      test-retest reliability (r = .89). The CDT and FAB-D were used to assess executive function.&#xD;
      Inter-rater reliability of the CDT was shown to be high (IRR = .92) with sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity values of .50 and .84, respectively. Falls self-efficacy was measured using the&#xD;
      German version of the FES-I. This test has shown excellent internal validity (Cronbach's&#xD;
      alpha = .96) and test-retest reliability (r = .96) to assess the level of fear of falling. To&#xD;
      assess health-related physical activity, exercise and the amount of energy expenditure, FQoPA&#xD;
      was conducted. Frey and colleagues showed that FQoPA score correlates with maximum oxygen&#xD;
      uptake, indicating high validity (r = .42).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the exercise intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were stratified into three intervention groups based on equal distribution of&#xD;
      age and equal gender ratio. The allocation of the training program occurred randomly.&#xD;
      Intervention group one conducted a 'traditional' machine-based resistance training (M-RT).&#xD;
      Intervention group two (machine-based instability resistance - M-IRT) followed a similar&#xD;
      training program with exercise-machines, but with additional unstable devices placed between&#xD;
      participant and exercise-machine or floor respectively. The third intervention group&#xD;
      conducted free-weight resistance training on unstable devices (F-IRT) using dumbbells instead&#xD;
      of exercise-machines. All intervention groups trained for 10 weeks, twice per week on&#xD;
      non-consecutive days for 60 min. The 10-week intervention period consisted of one week&#xD;
      introductory phase and three major training blocks lasting three weeks each. Training&#xD;
      intensity was progressively and individually increased over the 10-week training program by&#xD;
      modulating load and sets for all groups and level of instability for group M-IRT and F-IRT.&#xD;
      After week one, four and seven the training load (weight) was increased following 1RM (one&#xD;
      repetition maximum - maximum amount of force that can be generated within one repetition)&#xD;
      testing for each exercise. Since the load of 1RM is too heavy for untrained elderly, training&#xD;
      load was calculated using the prediction equation provided by Epley, showing .03% deviation&#xD;
      of actual achieved 1RM in squats with a correlation of .97. Instructors made sure that&#xD;
      repetitions did not exceed 15-20, because 1RM predication accuracy is higher with fewer&#xD;
      repetitions. Training under unstable conditions, especially with additional weight, implies a&#xD;
      certain degree of accident risk. Therefore all instability exercises were secured by&#xD;
      instructors and additional aids like boxes. Training has been supervised by skilled&#xD;
      instructors. For the first two weeks the participant to instructor ratio was 5:1, afterwards&#xD;
      10:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since effectiveness of resistance training to prevent falls has been reported frequently,&#xD;
      intervention group one (M-RT) acted as an active control group. In a study by Orr and&#xD;
      colleagues, participants with comparable baseline characteristics showed significant higher&#xD;
      treatment effects in comparison to a passive control group (p &lt; .001). Since the aim of the&#xD;
      study was to compare an untested intervention (IRT) and an effective treatment (RT), the&#xD;
      investigators decided to implement an active instead of a passive control group design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All three intervention groups conducted a resistance training program consisting of three&#xD;
      main exercises, a warm-up and cool-down phase. Participants performed 10 min low-intensity&#xD;
      stepping on a stair-walker as a brief warm-up in the beginning of each training session. The&#xD;
      core part of the intervention exercises focused on strengthening leg extension muscles.&#xD;
      Therefore squat-movements were chosen, as recommended by Flanagan and colleagues. M-RT and&#xD;
      M-IRT groups performed squats on a Smith machine, fixing the barbell at hip level. Pilot&#xD;
      testing revealed that shoulder and lower back mobility of elderly were too limited for fixing&#xD;
      the barbell on the shoulders. In addition, the M-IRT group used instability devices (e.g.&#xD;
      BOSU balls, wobble boards, inflatable discs) placed under the feet. Instability devices were&#xD;
      used in the F-IRT group as well, but they performed the squat with dumbbells instead of a&#xD;
      barbell. As a secondary leg extension exercise, leg-press for the M-RT and M-IRT (using&#xD;
      instability devices put between feet and foot plate) were chosen. The front lunge (with&#xD;
      dumbbells) was used as a secondary exercise by the F-IRT group. To strengthen the core, the&#xD;
      bridge exercise was incorporated into the training program. Again, group M-IRT and F-IRT used&#xD;
      instability devices placed under the shoulder and the feet in addition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An a priori power analysis using G*Power 3.1 with an assumed type I error of .05 and a type&#xD;
      II error of .10 (90% statistical power) was computed to determine an appropriate sample size&#xD;
      to achieve statistically significant interaction effects. The calculations were based on a&#xD;
      study assessing the effects core instability strength training in older adults. The analysis&#xD;
      revealed the necessity of 54 participants (18 per group) to obtain medium (.24 ≤ f ≤ .39)&#xD;
      &quot;time x group&quot; interaction effects. Considering the likelihood of dropouts we decided to&#xD;
      recruit more than 66 participants to compensate a possible dropout rate of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to main analysis normal distribution was tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for&#xD;
      each dependent variable. In addition, Levene's test for equality of variance was conducted.&#xD;
      We tested baseline differences between groups with a one-way ANOVA or a Kruskal-Wallis test&#xD;
      depending on distribution and homogeneity. In order to test the hypothesis, a 3 (group: M-RT,&#xD;
      M-IRT &amp; F-IRT) x 2 (time: pre- and post-test) ANOVA, with repeated measures on time was&#xD;
      calculated. In case of distribution or homogeneity violations non-parametric Friedman and&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis tests were computed to control results of parametrical tests and for&#xD;
      non-parametrical variables. If differences were detected, non-parametrical results were&#xD;
      expressed. Because Bonferroni-correction for multiple comparisons has been found too&#xD;
      conservative, Ryan-Holm-Bonferroni adjusted post-hoc tests were used to analyse significant&#xD;
      &quot;time x group&quot; interactions or tendencies (.051 ≤ p &lt; .10). Independent t-tests or Mann&#xD;
      Whitney-U were used to identify differences between groups. Ryan-Holm-Bonferroni corrected&#xD;
      p-values were reported. In addition, differences in absolute training intensity within the&#xD;
      last training block were analysed. Thus, the training load of the squat movements, which was&#xD;
      common to all groups, was used. Differences were computed using a one-way ANOVA. Dependent on&#xD;
      distribution and homogeneity, Ryan-Holm-Bonferroni adjusted post-hoc tests (independent&#xD;
      t-test or Mann Whitney-U) were computed to detect differences between groups. Changes for all&#xD;
      variables within groups were calculated by the formula ∆% = ((Meanpre / Meanpost) - 1) x 100.&#xD;
      The effect size for ANOVAs' was determined by calculating Cohen's f. Following Cohen,&#xD;
      f-values ≤ .24 indicate small effects, .25 ≤ f ≤ .39 indicate medium effects and f ≥ .40&#xD;
      indicate large effects. For post-hoc tests Cohen's d was calculated. Following Cohen,&#xD;
      d-values ≤ .49 indicate small effects, .50 ≤ d ≤ .79 indicate medium effects and d ≥ .80&#xD;
      indicate large effects. Significance level was set at α = 5%. All analyses were performed&#xD;
      using SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
