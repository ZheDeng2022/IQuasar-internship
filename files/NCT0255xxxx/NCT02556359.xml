  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The molecular mechanisms participating in the various aspects of the DNA Damage Response&#xD;
      (DDR) are absolutely essential to maintain the genome dynamics essential to all living&#xD;
      organisms. The most commonly studied consequence of faulty DDR is genome instability&#xD;
      participating in cancer onset. In the present proposal, we wish to explore another aspect of&#xD;
      DDR, not relevant to cancer, which is its absolute requirement at several key steps of the&#xD;
      development, maturation, and function of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most &quot;spectacular&quot; consequences of faulty DNA repair processes with respect to the&#xD;
      immuno-hematopoietic tissue are the complete block of B and T lymphocytes maturation owing to&#xD;
      defective DNA joining phase during V(D)J recombination resulting in patients with Severe&#xD;
      Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to increase our knowledge on the role of the various DNA&#xD;
      repair processes in the development, the maintenance, and the function of the immune system&#xD;
      and thus, to better understand why and how dysfunctions of these DNA repair processes result&#xD;
      in human severe conditions such as CVID, LOCID or other manifestations of immune disorders&#xD;
      such as autoimmunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The explorations of DNA repair mechanisms in the patients will allow us to establish the&#xD;
      genetic diagnosis in some patients with until now undefined molecular diagnosis. This is of&#xD;
      immediate importance for the patients and their families, as it not only contributes to a&#xD;
      better understanding of the patients' condition, but also allows providing genetic counseling&#xD;
      for the families.&#xD;

      Blood samples will be obtained as a source of DNA and viable lymphocytes for functional&#xD;
      studies. Blood will be sent to the laboratory of Dr JP de Villartay, INSERM UMR1163, Genome&#xD;
      Dynamics in the Immune System, Université Paris Descartes - Sorbonne Paris Cité, Institut&#xD;
      Imagine, 24 boulevard du Montparnasse, 75015 PARIS. Functional studies will be performed&#xD;
      immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A portion of the blood sample taken as part of the research will be included in a biological&#xD;
      collection: B-EBV cell lines will be derived from patients and their parents. EBV-B cell&#xD;
      lines will be established by Centre de Ressource Biologique (CRB, Hôpital Necker - Enfants&#xD;
      Malades, Bâtiment IMAGINE 1er étage, 149, rue de Sèvres - 75 743 PARIS CEDEX 15, under the&#xD;
      supervision of Dr Marie-Alexandra Alyanakian &amp; Anne Esling &amp; Christine Gouarin). Skin&#xD;
      biopsies will be obtained from patients to derive fibroblast lines at CRB.&#xD;
