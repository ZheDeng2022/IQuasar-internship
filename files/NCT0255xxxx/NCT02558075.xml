  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large scale, effective, low-cost, and evidence-based programs that can nimbly translate new&#xD;
      research discoveries into prevention and care for psychosocial based problems are urgently&#xD;
      needed. This study hopes to provide support for Mood-Lifters, a template for a low-cost&#xD;
      evidence based program, so that investigators may fill this gap and relieve suffering for&#xD;
      millions of people who are not getting adequate mental health care. Mood-Lifters provides a&#xD;
      low cost, research based program designed to enrich people's lives and reduce psychological&#xD;
      distress. It is designed to provide useful support, coaching and information. It seeks to&#xD;
      help people enhance pleasure, engagement and meaning in their lives while minimizing&#xD;
      depression, fear, loneliness and other negative feelings via a proprietary peer based program&#xD;
      that offers weekly meetings and other flexible support options. The goal of this pilot study&#xD;
      is to test the efficacy of this program. This is not traditional therapy, rather an&#xD;
      educational supportive program similar to WeightWatchers, but for mental health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately half the population of the United States will meet criteria for a diagnosable&#xD;
      mental illness over their lifetime. Many of these individuals will experience changes in&#xD;
      productivity, family relationships and self-esteem. Some will engage in behaviors that&#xD;
      endanger themselves or others. A small percentage of these people will receive treatment.&#xD;
      This lack of treatment is partly due to stigma or lack of knowledge, but it is also due to&#xD;
      lack of affordable or available services. Furthermore, even when people manage to receive&#xD;
      care, it is often ineffective because it is not evidence-based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This lack of prevention and treatment is costly. The economic burden of depression alone is&#xD;
      second only to cardiovascular disease, and anxiety disorders cost the U.S. more than $42&#xD;
      billion per year. Moreover, it has been estimated that as many as 70% of primary care visits&#xD;
      stem from psychosocial issues. This is problematic because primary care physicians often have&#xD;
      neither the time nor expertise to provide adequate support for the wide range of psychosocial&#xD;
      issues with which their patients are coping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In short, a large scale, effective, low-cost, evidence-based program that can nimbly&#xD;
      translate new research discoveries into prevention and care for psychosocial based problems&#xD;
      is urgently needed. Mood Lifters intends to be the &quot;Weight-watchers&quot; of mental health and is&#xD;
      a program designed to precisely fill these gaps and relieve these burdens for millions of&#xD;
      people who are not getting adequate mental health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight watchers is a highly effective, evidence based, para-professionally delivered program&#xD;
      that serves nearly 1.2 million customers a week. It serves a different population than a&#xD;
      primary care physician or an obesity specialist. It is not bariatric surgery but rather&#xD;
      supports the majority of people who need to lose weight. In comparison, Mood Lifters is not&#xD;
      intensive psychiatric care. Rather, it serves an adjunctive service to primary care doctor's&#xD;
      typical medical care (i.e., Medications) and utilizes a de-stigmatized service delivery&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will pilot this innovative program. Researchers will test and refine the proof of&#xD;
      concept in multiple community groups from Ann Arbor. Each group will consist of 8-12&#xD;
      participants who will be recruited from local communities via a variety of methods. Criteria&#xD;
      for participation will be all adults who are not actively manic, suicidal or psychotic. These&#xD;
      participants will not be able to participate and will be referred to mental health&#xD;
      professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This program consists of 15 different sessions with a different topic for each session. These&#xD;
      sessions will occur once a week for 15 weeks and will last approximately an hour each. Prior&#xD;
      to participation in the first session, participants will complete comprehensive baseline&#xD;
      measures, including a comprehensive mood assessment and measures to assess their knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes, and behaviors relating to the topics to be covered. This will take approximately 2&#xD;
      hours. At each meeting, participants will complete a brief questionnaire on all the topics in&#xD;
      order to track progress from week to week. Between weekly meetings, participants will&#xD;
      practice and track their skill-building via a Daily &amp; Weekly Points Checklist, which will&#xD;
      include the topics discussed over the course of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first group session, the group facilitator will provide an overview of the&#xD;
      program, including the weekly topics. These topics will be in one of five theoretically&#xD;
      important areas: biological, cognitive, affective, behavioral and social. Each subsequent&#xD;
      week will involve an in-depth exploration of each topic, including why it is important to&#xD;
      mental well-being and practical ideas about how to implement positive changes into one's&#xD;
      everyday life. Following the facilitator's brief presentation, group members will be invited&#xD;
      to share their experiences, challenges, and provide peer support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the program, each participant will again complete the comprehensive mood&#xD;
      assessment as well as the same measures of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors that were&#xD;
      assessed at the beginning of the 15-week period. Additionally, participants will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to complete these same measures at 1 month and 6 month post Mood Lifters program.&#xD;
      A final analysis will then be conducted to assess the program's overall efficacy and its&#xD;
      efficacy among the various populations described above. The results will be formally written&#xD;
      up and reported, program modifications will be made, and further grant funding will be&#xD;
      pursued.&#xD;
