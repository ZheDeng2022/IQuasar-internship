  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the delivery of SR-T100 from the topical gel (containing&#xD;
      2.3% solamargine in Solanum undatum plant extract) by determining the plasma levels of&#xD;
      solamargine in subjects with AK while administration of a 25 cm2 contiguous or non-contiguous&#xD;
      dermal treatment area.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is an open-label, multiple-dose, pharmacokinetic study. In stage 1, plasma concentration&#xD;
      of solamargine will be examined after the test products were administrated to 5 subjects with&#xD;
      Actinic Keratosis (AK). Thereafter, an interim report based on the results of stage 1 will be&#xD;
      submitted for Taiwan Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) review to determine stage 2 will be&#xD;
      conducted or not. For stage 2, another 5 subjects with AK will be enrolled to complete the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be recruited from AK patients of Taiwan. All subjects will sign an informed&#xD;
      consent form (ICF). A copy of the signed ICF will be handed to the subjects. The subjects&#xD;
      will be screened on an outpatient basis within 1 month prior to entry according to defined&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria (medical history, personal history, physical examination,&#xD;
      and laboratory values). The subject must be qualified for the study by fulfilling all of the&#xD;
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study period, study drug will be given once daily for sixteen consecutive weeks.&#xD;
      Specifically, subjects will receive a single dose of 0.3-0.5 g topical SR-T100 gel&#xD;
      (containing 2.3% solamargine in Solanum undatum plant extract) in 25 cm2 skin area covered by&#xD;
      occlusive dressing at least 20 hours a day.&#xD;
