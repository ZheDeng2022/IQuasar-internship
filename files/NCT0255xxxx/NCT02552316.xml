    <textblock>
      The ASPIRE study is a clinical trial designed to examine the microbes (e.g., bacteria) within&#xD;
      psoriasis skin lesions compared with normal skin. The investigators will also examine the&#xD;
      effect of NB-UVB (narrow-band ultraviolet B) phototherapy (i.e., light therapy) on skin&#xD;
      microbes.&#xD;

    <description>Variation in the microbial diversity of skin affected and unaffected by psoriasis was characterized at baseline.&#xD;
The Alpha Diversity Index is a quantitative measure that reflects the diversity of bacterial species in a sample. The greater the index value, the more diverse the skin microbiota. The diversity of the microbiota present in the given sample was measured using the Shannon Diversity Index, whereby each &quot;arm title&quot; is describing the difference in the measure of diversity between the comparison groups.</description>

    <description>NB-UVB phototherapy is a therapy which uses ultraviolet B (UVB) light directed at the skin. This type of light therapy is given through the use of phototherapy booths which contain fluorescent tubes that emit UVB light. Booths used for phototherapy look similar to commercial tanning booths. NB-UVB phototherapy affects psoriasis by causing changes to the cells of the skin and producing a local effect by reducing the number of certain types of skin cells which have an impact on psoriasis formation.</description>

          <description>Fitzpatrick skin type describes a method of classifying skin by its reaction to sunlight. This system classifies skin types from I through V whereby a lower Fitzpatrick skin type classification indicates skin that burns more easily than it tans, while a higher Fitzpatrick skin type indicates the opposite. The skin type classification criteria are detailed below.&#xD;
Type I: Always burns, never tans Type II: Burns easily, tans poorly Type III: Tans after initial burn Type IV: Rarely burns and tans darkly easily Type V: Never burns, always tans very darkly</description>

          <description>The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) is an instrument that measures the severity and extent of psoriasis. The score is based on a combination of psoriasis appearance (erythema, induration and desquamation) and percentage of body surface area. The scale ranges from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease severity), whereby higher PASI scores indicate higher severity of psoriasis.</description>

        <title>Change in Cutaneous Microbiota Shannon's Alpha Diversity at Baseline vs Week 8</title>
        <description>Variation in the microbial diversity of skin affected and unaffected by psoriasis was characterized at baseline. Changes in microbial diversity was assessed between baseline and week 8.&#xD;
The Alpha Diversity Index is a quantitative measure that reflects the diversity of bacterial species in a sample. The greater the index value, the more diverse the skin microbiota. The diversity of the microbiota present in the given sample was measured using the Shannon Diversity Index, whereby each &quot;arm title&quot; is describing the difference in the measure of diversity between the comparison groups.</description>

          <description>Variation in the microbial diversity of skin affected and unaffected by psoriasis was characterized at baseline. Changes in microbial diversity was assessed between baseline and week 9.&#xD;
The Beta Diversity Index is a quantitative measure that reflects the diversity of bacterial species between two different regions. The greater the index, the more diverse the microbiota between the two regions.</description>

          <title>NB-UVB Phototherapy</title>
          <description>NB-UVB phototherapy is a therapy which uses ultraviolet B (UVB) light directed at the skin. This type of light therapy is given through the use of phototherapy booths which contain fluorescent tubes that emit UVB light. Booths used for phototherapy look similar to commercial tanning booths. NB-UVB phototherapy affects psoriasis by causing changes to the cells of the skin and producing a local effect by reducing the number of certain types of skin cells which have an impact on psoriasis formation.&#xD;
