      Introduction: Population aging is associated with increased prevalence of chronic diseases.&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world&#xD;
      population, affecting motor function and functional independence progressively. The&#xD;
      physiological aging promotes the gradual reduction of body weight, lung function, peripheral&#xD;
      muscle strength, cardiopulmonary endurance and physical capacity, which increase the&#xD;
      debilitating effects. Aging, when associated with PD, can induce loss of functionality,&#xD;
      postural changes, further affecting the nutritional status, worsening the quality of life and&#xD;
      functional independence of the individual. Although physical therapy is commonly applied with&#xD;
      a variety of methodologies to PD patients, evidence for the effectiveness of these&#xD;
      interventions is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of the study is to compare the effects of Functional&#xD;
      Training, Stationary Bike and Exergaming Exercises on proportion of fallers in elderly&#xD;
      participants with PD. In addition, the secondary objectives are to compare the effects on&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary endurance, posture, postural control, executive function, quality of life and&#xD;
      functionality of individuals with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This is an interventional, randomized, blinded, longitudinal and prospective&#xD;
      study. This research will be conducted in the State Reference Center for Health Care of the&#xD;
      Elderly (CREASI). The sample will consist of 63 individuals with PD per group. The&#xD;
      Experimental Group 1 will be submitted to Functional Training, the Experimental Group 2 with&#xD;
      undergo training with Stationary Bike and the Experimental Group 3 will be submitted to&#xD;
      exergame training using Xbox360 with KinectTM sensor. All the interventions will be performed&#xD;
      three times per week, with 50 minutes per session, during 8 weeks.&#xD;

      The original study goal was to recruit 210 subjects based on the assumption of a fall risk of&#xD;
      70% in the Bicycle group and 40% in either Exergaming or Functional Training groups, with 80%&#xD;
      power and alpha=0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUPS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      G1-Functional Training&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity was increased by progressive resistance with dumbbells, ankle weights, elastic&#xD;
      bands and manual resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gait with obstacles: To perform this exercise hula hoops, rubber cones, plastic sticks,&#xD;
           wood steps and mattresses were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Up and down stairs and ramp: The participant went up and down 3 steps and 1 ramp until&#xD;
           completing 3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sitting and standing exercises: To increase the difficulty level were used manual&#xD;
           resistance, dumbbell and unstable bases (swiss ball).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Side gear and shin guards: The participant performed side gait according to the physical&#xD;
           therapist's commands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Balance exercise: The participant performed balance exercises in proprioceptive&#xD;
           platforms: balance discs, jumping beds proprioceptive tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Activities with ball: Kicking balls of different sizes and weights, alternating each&#xD;
           foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Step exercises: Going up and down steps with the right or left foot according to&#xD;
           cognitive commands of the physical therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Foot tip exercises: The participant performed the exercise on flat and sloped surface&#xD;
           with one or two feet maintaining sural triceps contraction for 5 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Graded reaching exercises: The exercise was performed standing and sitting. Dual task&#xD;
           activities were performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Gait training: The participant walked around the gym following verbal commands to stop&#xD;
           and change direction. Gait reeducation consisted of working scapular and pelvic girdle&#xD;
           dissociation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G2-Bicycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aerobic training on a stationary bicycle: The training intensity was 50% of maximum heart&#xD;
      rate (adjusted for age - Karvonen formula) in the first week, increasing gradually to 75% in&#xD;
      the eighth week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First week: 50% of maximum heart rate. Second and Third weeks: 55% of maximum heart rate.&#xD;
      Fourth and Fifth weeks: 65% of maximum heart rate. Sixth and Seventh weeks: 70% of maximum&#xD;
      heart rate. Eighth week: 75% of maximum heart rate. The intensity was increased progressively&#xD;
      by bike endurance (resistance) and speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G3-Exergaming&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical components involved in Exergames (Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy): strength and&#xD;
      muscular endurance, cardiorespiratory fitness, postural balance, executive function and&#xD;
      emotional demands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants did not use weights to perform the exercises in the Exergame Group. A&#xD;
      physical therapist guided the participants to explore the correct posture and the articular&#xD;
      range of motion using both tactile and assistive stimulus and/or verbal command during the&#xD;
      games. Each mini-game lasts about 3-minutes, and to complete 30-minutes training, the same&#xD;
      one or two mini-games were repeated in different levels of intensity and speed in each&#xD;
      session. Mini-games of Kinect Advenctures! game:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  River Rush: One or two players must control the raft using their body, moving from side&#xD;
           to side, and jumping in front of the Kinect sensor. Players must work as a team to earn&#xD;
           as many points as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reflex Ridge: One or two players can move freely on platforms (rollercoaster-like&#xD;
           tracks), allowing them to dodge left and right, duck and jump over hazards as they&#xD;
           spring forward. Jumping in place makes the platform move faster along its rail.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20,000 Leaks: The characters are positioned in a rectangular glass tank underwater, and&#xD;
           each of the tank's four walls can crack and begin to leak water at any time. One or two&#xD;
           players stand in front of the Kinect sensor and use their arms and legs - or any other&#xD;
           body parts - to stop leaking water.&#xD;
