      This study aims to analyze the effectiveness and feasibility of using an implantable system&#xD;
      that provides epidural electrical stimulation directly to the left prefrontal dorsolateral&#xD;
      cortex (Brodmann area 9/46) in patients with chronic and refractory Depressive Disorder&#xD;
      Major.&#xD;

      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the hypothetical advantages of epidural cortical stimulation compare to less&#xD;
      invasive method of transcranial magnetic stimulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical implantation of stimulating electrodes can lead to a more powerful, consistent&#xD;
           and accurate form of stimulation to the cortex, one of the main concerns associated with&#xD;
           the variability observed in studies of transcranial magnetic stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A definitive system for the implantation could also overcome another disadvantage of&#xD;
           transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy, the need of repetitive treatment period of&#xD;
           several weeks, and the need for maintenance sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To achieve remission of depressive symptoms by promoting improved quality of life and&#xD;
           reducing the risk of suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve patient adherence to the treatment by the establishment of a permanent&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected from outpatient clinics and psychiatric wards of specialized&#xD;
      services in Distrito Federal, Brasília, Brazil. These patients will be included in a specific&#xD;
      outpatient affective disorders at the University Hospital of Brasília. Those patients with&#xD;
      major depressive disorder considered untreatable by conventional methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The inclusion in this study requires that patients meet the criteria for recurrent Major&#xD;
           Depressive Disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - V (recurrent&#xD;
           Major Depressive Disorder without psychotic features), being in a current depressive&#xD;
           episode lasting at least two years or have produced at least four episodes of major&#xD;
           depression, along with the current episode lasting at least one year. All individuals&#xD;
           must be adults, women can not be pregnant and must be submitted to contraceptive&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects must have failed to respond to at least four different trials with&#xD;
           antidepressant at therapeutic doses for a period of at least six weeks, associated with&#xD;
           specific psychotherapy during this period and/or use of electrochemotherapy or vagal&#xD;
           nerve stimulation . The medication treatment for depression used at the moment of&#xD;
           selection should remain unchanged for at least eight weeks after implantation and will&#xD;
           not change during the study period. Possible needs therapeutic adjustments during the&#xD;
           study will be managed with changes in parameter magnetic stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients should score at least 20 points on the Hamilton Rating Scale (Hamilton&#xD;
           Depression Rating Scale-28 (HDRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Pregnancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Preexisting neurological disease including epilepsy;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Other psychiatric disorders except for anxiety disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Less than 24 Mini-Mental or any other cognitive disorder;&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Being with serious suicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Medical conditions that preclude surgery as judgment of the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rating Scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rating Scale Hamilton Depression (HAM-D), the 28 items: assessment of severity of&#xD;
           symptoms in depressed patients with primary depressive illness and monitoring changes&#xD;
           due to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Depression Scale Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), specific evaluation&#xD;
           of clinical changes in depressed patients during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Scale of the SF-36, evaluates subjectively the individual's perception regarding their&#xD;
           own health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Side Effects Scale (UKU- Ugvalg is Kliniske Undersgelser): detailed scale for assessment&#xD;
           of drug side effects comprising the following four groups of side effects: psychic,&#xD;
           neurological, autonomic and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected patients will undergo surgical implant procedure performed at the Surgical Center of&#xD;
      the University Hospital of Brasília (HUB). The implant will be done by a specialist&#xD;
      neurosurgeon in the treatment of functional disorders and in implantation of epidural&#xD;
      electrodes for other pathologies. The procedure will be done using neuronavigation and the&#xD;
      implant material is already acquired by the neurosurgery unit of HUB by direct import.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks associated with surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk of system infection: 3%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk of surgical hematoma: 0.2%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk of death: 0.1%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk of neurological sequelae: 0.1%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be selected in outpatient Psychiatry, University Hospital of Brasilia.&#xD;
           This clinic will be conducted by psychiatrists and psychiatry residents and it will be&#xD;
           specific to patients with major depression and clinical management difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After obtaining informed consent and informed consent and resolved all questions from&#xD;
           participants about the research, patients who agree to participate in the study will&#xD;
           undergo a general physical examination, neurological evaluation, EEG assessment and&#xD;
           neuropsychological assessment. Depression severity will be assessed by the Hamilton&#xD;
           scale (HAM-17). Secondary measures of depression severity will be assessed with the&#xD;
           Depression Scale Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Scale of the&#xD;
           SF-36.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging exam (Positrons Emission Tomography - PET) pre-procedure will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric diagnoses are excluded by structured interview, including history of&#xD;
           previous treatment with the respective drugs used, length of treatment and therapeutic&#xD;
           response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To the patients who meet inclusion criteria of this research will be offered the&#xD;
           possibility of the definitive implant with epidural electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Realization of imaging examination for surgical planning and anatomical and functional&#xD;
           brain assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of agreement, participants who meet inclusion criteria will be forwarded to the&#xD;
           implantation of an epidural electrode at the HUB by a trained neurosurgeon in&#xD;
           psychosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One week after implantation of the device, participants will be randomized in order to&#xD;
           receive continuous magnetic stimulation of high frequency (50Hz) stimulation or sham&#xD;
           stimulation (placebo) in the first eight weeks of the study. After eight weeks, patients&#xD;
           randomized to receive sham stimulation will receive stimulation 50Hz also for eight&#xD;
           weeks. At no time participants will be informed of which are part of the research group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completed eight weeks of continuous stimulation at 50 Hz (in the eighth week of the&#xD;
           subjects with stimulation at 50Hz and sixteenth week for those who made the first eight&#xD;
           weeks of sham stimulation), patients enter into adaptive protocol based on individual&#xD;
           response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New imaging test (PET) will be held at or after 28 weeks of treatment response criteria&#xD;
           achieved, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be reassessed every two weeks for a period of 16 weeks with reapplication&#xD;
           of HAM-17 and MADRS. During these reassessments will also be investigated possible&#xD;
           adverse effects and patients will have their devices checked stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The results will then be subjected to statistical analysis in order to verify the&#xD;
           effectiveness of the method.&#xD;
