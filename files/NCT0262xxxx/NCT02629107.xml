      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An electroencephalogram (EEG) measures the brain s electrical activity. EEG shows that the&#xD;
      louder the sound needed to wake a person, the deeper the person s sleep. Researchers are&#xD;
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study people during sleep so they can&#xD;
      view brain activity in 3D. But they still need to correlate fMRI with sound thresholds, like&#xD;
      the EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure brain activity during sleep using fMRI and EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18 34 who can sleep on their back for several hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened online about their sleep and general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a screening visit, participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hearing exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scan. A strong magnetic field and radio waves take pictures of the brain. Participants&#xD;
      will lie down on a bed that slides into the scanner, which is shaped like a cylinder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear an actigraph on their wrist that records their motor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will follow a 2-week routine. This includes regular in-to-bed and out-of-bed&#xD;
      times and limits on alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the overnight visits, participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female subjects will have a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI. A coil will be placed over the head. Participants will do tasks shown on a computer&#xD;
      screen inside the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG. Small electrodes on the scalp will record brain waves while sleeping or doing a task in&#xD;
      the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to try to sleep while researchers collect fMRI and EEG data.&#xD;
      Participants eyes will be monitored with a video camera. Headphones will deliver sounds to&#xD;
      wake them up throughout the night.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography is generally considered the gold standard for defining sleep, but, in&#xD;
      fact, sleep is a behavior and is defined by widely accepted behavioral characteristics like&#xD;
      auditory arousal threshold. Electroencephalography merely became a surrogate for the&#xD;
      behavioral definition when, in the first electroencephalographic sleep studies, researchers&#xD;
      discovered a strong correlation between electroencephalographic slow waves and auditory&#xD;
      arousal thresholds. With the advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging, one would&#xD;
      expect the first sleep studies that used this new measure would have been designed&#xD;
      tocorrelate it with auditory arousal threshold. However, these studies have never been&#xD;
      conducted. This protocol will fill this gap in the literature. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      undiscovered patterns of brain activity or functional connectivity exist during sleep and&#xD;
      that an approach that defines sleep behaviorally will expose these patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject group in this study will be young, healthy individuals with excellent sleep&#xD;
      health. Choosing this subject group will maximize the probability that subjects will sleep&#xD;
      during all-night functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our target number of completers was&#xD;
      12 for the pilot study and is 43 for the main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a one-week home-monitoring period that includes a regular in-to-bed and out-of-bed&#xD;
      time, subjects will undergo two all-night functional magnetic resonance imaging sleep studies&#xD;
      separated by a one-week washout period with continued home monitoring. The first night will&#xD;
      serve as an adaptation night, which is known to reduce the sleep alterations that accompany&#xD;
      sleeping in a laboratory environment. We will measure sleep depth behaviorally by arousing&#xD;
      subjects with auditory stimuli that progressively increase in intensity. This procedure will&#xD;
      be performed approximately eight times per night. The timing of the arousals will be&#xD;
      distributed randomly across the night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Generated&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data generated will be auditory arousal thresholds and the preceding brain activity and&#xD;
      functional connectivity derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
