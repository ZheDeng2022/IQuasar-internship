      The study aims to develop and evaluate the efficacy and causal mechanisms of an interactive&#xD;
      SMS intervention to optimize individual health and secondary HIV prevention benefits of ART&#xD;
      in HIV-positive FSWs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is highly effective at reducing the infectiousness of&#xD;
      HIV-positive people, and is considered the cornerstone of all new HIV prevention approaches.&#xD;
      A critical question is how to harness the potency of ART to reduce transmission from female&#xD;
      sex workers (FSWs), a key population that has been central to HIV transmission in Africa for&#xD;
      more than 25 years. In high prevalence countries like Kenya, FSWs represent about 1% of the&#xD;
      population, yet contribute to one in seven (14%) new HIV infections. Targeting treatment as&#xD;
      prevention (TasP) to FSWs could efficiently reduce HIV transmission on a population level.&#xD;
      Effective TasP will require higher levels of ART adherence than those achieved in typical&#xD;
      treatment programs. The rapid spread of mobile technology in Africa provides unique&#xD;
      opportunities for mobile health (mHealth) interventions, which have been shown to be&#xD;
      acceptable to providers and patients, and can improve ART adherence and suppression of plasma&#xD;
      HIV viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of mobile (SMS) interventions to support ART adherence in key populations like&#xD;
      FSWs and unique clinical scenarios such as TasP has yet to be evaluated. The investigators&#xD;
      will answer these fundamental questions by addressing the following aims: 1) To use a&#xD;
      qualitative rapid assessment and development approach to craft a theory-based,&#xD;
      individualized, interactive SMS intervention, grounded in the Theory of Information,&#xD;
      Motivation, and Behavior (IMB), to support ART adherence in HIV-positive FSWs, 2) To compare&#xD;
      individualized, interactive SMS to standard care in achieving undetectable HIV VL 6 months&#xD;
      post ART initiation in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 210 FSWs and 3) To administer&#xD;
      an adaptation of the LifeWindows Information - Motivation - Behavioral Skills ART Adherence&#xD;
      Questionnaire (LW-IMB-AAQ) to understand the mechanism of our SMS intervention's effect by&#xD;
      comparing perceptions of support and motivation to adhere to ART in FSWs who received the&#xD;
      intervention versus standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overarching goal is to develop and evaluate the efficacy and causal mechanisms of an&#xD;
      interactive SMS intervention to optimize individual health and secondary HIV prevention&#xD;
      benefits of ART in HIV-positive FSWs. The aims of this project proceed sequentially from&#xD;
      developmental (Aim 1) through implementation of the intervention (Aim 2) to evaluation of the&#xD;
      fit with the behavioral model (Aim 3).&#xD;
