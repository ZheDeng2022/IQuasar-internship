  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for over 10 percent of death in children under five&#xD;
      and many of these deaths occur in early infancy before the current pneumococcal schedule is&#xD;
      effective and nearly half occur in sub Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PROPEL trial will examine the effect of either a maternal or a neonatal dose of a&#xD;
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on pneumococcal colonisation in the nose which can be used to&#xD;
      measure the risk of disease in early life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      600 Expectant mothers will be randomized at between 28 and 34 weeks to a maternal group, a&#xD;
      neonatal group or a control group in equal number (200 per group). Their subsequent born&#xD;
      offspring will be followed up until nine months of age. Infants born from expectant mothers&#xD;
      in the maternal and control group will receive their subsequent pneumococcal conjugate&#xD;
      vaccination according to the national Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) schedule in&#xD;
      the Gambia at 8, 12 and 16 weeks while infants born to expectant mothers in the control group&#xD;
      will receive the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine within 48 hours of birth and at 8 and 16&#xD;
      weeks of life. Randomization will be undertaken by defined un-blinded members of the clinical&#xD;
      trial team who will be delegated for this task and who will not be involved in any other&#xD;
      trial related procedures Pregnant women who are willing and who are identified by the staff&#xD;
      of the government antenatal clinic as being potentially eligible according to gestation&#xD;
      (assessed initially according to the date of the last menstrual period (LMP) - if known, or&#xD;
      the fundal height), will be referred to a member of the clinical trial team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who remain interested in participation having had the details of the study explained&#xD;
      will have basic demographic, obstetric and contact details collected and will be invited, at&#xD;
      a time of their convenience, to the Medical Research Council (MRC) clinical trial site for&#xD;
      the formal informed consent process to be completed. Following informed consent, pregnancy&#xD;
      will be confirmed with a urinary pregnancy test. Initial screening (e.g. for past-obstetric&#xD;
      history and past-medical history etc) will be undertaken at this point along with screening&#xD;
      bloods for serology (HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis) and haematology (haemoglobin and sickle&#xD;
      test). A dating ultrasound scan (USS) will also be undertaken by designated clinical trial&#xD;
      staff. On completion of screening, expectant mothers who are confirmed to be eligible&#xD;
      according to the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled and randomized in&#xD;
      parallel into one of three equally sized groups mentioned above (maternal, neonatal,&#xD;
      control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the group into which they have been randomized, mothers will receive a dose of&#xD;
      PCV13 and tetanus toxoid [maternal group], placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) and tetanus toxoid&#xD;
      [control group] or tetanus toxoid alone [neonatal group]. From this point on, the maternal&#xD;
      and control groups (now 'Routine EPI Schedule') will be followed up in exactly the same way&#xD;
      for the purposes of interventions and all endpoint assessments. Infants in the neonatal group&#xD;
      ('Neonatal Schedule') will be followed up according to the schedule outlined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of presentation to the delivery unit a blood sample for serology and malaria&#xD;
      Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) and an nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) sample will be obtained prior to&#xD;
      or shortly following delivery. Immediately following delivery a sample of cord blood will be&#xD;
      obtained and as soon as possible an NPS sample will be taken from the newborn. Anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements will be taken from the newborn and an examination conducted. Once there has not&#xD;
      been any contraindication to vaccination identified, all newborns will be administered the&#xD;
      routine EPI vaccines according to the schedule in The Gambia (BCG, Hepatitis B and OPV).&#xD;
      Those newborns in the Neonatal group will additionally be administered a single intramuscular&#xD;
      (IM) dose of PCV13. At two, three and four months, infants will be administered the routine&#xD;
      EPI vaccines. Those infants in the Maternal and Control Groups (Routine EPI Schedule) will&#xD;
      additionally receive PCV13 at eight, 12, and 16 weeks while those in the Neonatal group will&#xD;
      receive the vaccine at eight and 16 weeks only having received the first dose at birth. All&#xD;
      infants will additionally receive a single dose of the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV)&#xD;
      at 16 weeks in line with the routine EPI schedule in The Gambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the vaccines administered to expectant mothers and following the vaccines&#xD;
      administered at birth, home visits will be undertaken on day 1 to 6 to collect solicited&#xD;
      local and systemic adverse (for PCV only) reactions and any unsolicited. A day 7 safety&#xD;
      clinic visit will be conducted following the vaccines administered to expectant mothers and&#xD;
      following the vaccines administered at birth. Infant will attend the clinical trial site for&#xD;
      NPS and blood samples to be taken at specific time points.&#xD;

      Members of the clinical trial team will base themselves within the government run antenatal&#xD;
      clinics at the clinical trial sites in order to identify potentially eligible pregnant women.&#xD;
      Working closely alongside government midwifery and nursing staff they will aim to identify&#xD;
      pregnant women who are yet to reach 34 weeks gestation and who are thus potentially eligible&#xD;
      for enrolment. Assessment of gestation at this first contact point will be based on the date&#xD;
      of the LMP or the assessment of fundal height as is local practice (gestational age will be&#xD;
      confirmed by ultrasound scanning once informed consent has been obtained and ultrasound based&#xD;
      assessment will be used to determine final eligibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the clinical trial team will discuss the study with potentially eligible&#xD;
      expectant mothers who are provisionally interested and agree to receive this additional&#xD;
      information. The discussion will be based on the contents of the informed consent document&#xD;
      (ICD) and a copy of the ICD will be provided to the expectant mother at the end of the&#xD;
      discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible women who are interested will be encouraged to discuss the study with&#xD;
      their spouse and other family members as appropriate. Following individual sensitization of&#xD;
      the mother, a member of the field team may provide information to other family members&#xD;
      (particularly the spouse) either by telephone or through a visit to the subject's residence&#xD;
      according to the preference of the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expectant mothers who express an interest in participation will then be contacted to arrange&#xD;
      a visit to the clinical trial site where informed consent will be undertaken.&#xD;
      Written/thumb-printed informed consent will only be required from the expectant mother but in&#xD;
      all cases it will be confirmed directly with the spouse (the father of the unborn baby) that&#xD;
      they are aware of the study and have given their agreement. In the case of expectant mothers&#xD;
      who are literate in English, they will be provided with a copy of the ICD but a member of the&#xD;
      clinical trial team will nonetheless review the contents of the ICD line by line in English&#xD;
      to ensure all details are covered and that the subject has the opportunity to ask questions&#xD;
      regarding any aspect of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of potential participants who are not literate in English but only in one of the&#xD;
      local languages, a member of the clinical trial team fluent in the local language (as well as&#xD;
      being English literate) will review the ICD line by line translating directly from the&#xD;
      English ICD to the appropriate local language. In this case an impartial witness must be&#xD;
      present throughout all elements of the consent process and must attest that the information&#xD;
      on the ICD has been given accurately and in full. The impartial witness will also be required&#xD;
      to sign the ICD to confirm that this has been the case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent for study participation will be documented on the signature page of the ICD.&#xD;
      The option to consent for the future use of any residual samples on study completion will&#xD;
      also be given on the same page but the provision of such additional consent is not required&#xD;
      for participation in the main trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A certified copy of the ICD is provided to the participant unless it is refused for some&#xD;
      reason in which case it will be filed at the trial site. Such refusal must be documented in&#xD;
      the subject's file so it is clear that the subject has been offered a copy The study will&#xD;
      randomize 600 pregnant women at between 28 and 34 weeks gestation. Mothers will not be&#xD;
      replaced following randomization. Screening of potentially eligible women will continue until&#xD;
      this number is reached unless the trial is stopped for some other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No further selection or assessment of eligibility will be undertaken on the newborn infants.&#xD;
      All data will be included in the safety reporting irrespective of pregnancy outcome and&#xD;
      safety follow-up should occur as planned for all infants. An infant may be excluded from the&#xD;
      trial for the purposes of vaccination and/or clinical sampling if ongoing participation is&#xD;
      considered to be against their best interests or if a contraindication to vaccination and/or&#xD;
      to the obtaining of clinical samples is identified. An infant excluded in this way would not&#xD;
      be replaced and hence this would not alter the target sample size of 600 pregnant women.&#xD;
