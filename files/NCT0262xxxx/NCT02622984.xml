  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The traditional paradigm that relies upon training physicians and nurses or uses on-site&#xD;
      interventionists to perform screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT)&#xD;
      for alcohol has proven unsustainable in most clinical settings. The Remote Brief Intervention&#xD;
      and Referral to Treatment (R-BIRT) for alcohol is an innovative telehealth service model with&#xD;
      potential to improve public health through evidence based counseling for patients who exceed&#xD;
      the NIAAA low risk drinking limits or have evidence of an Alcohol Use Disorder with&#xD;
      professional and self-help treatment. For those that are appropriate, the R-BIRT service will&#xD;
      provide facilitated referrals to specialized alcohol abuse treatment. The service model is&#xD;
      being studied in the emergency department (ED) setting to demonstrate its utility in a&#xD;
      medical setting with a very high prevalence of risky alcohol use and Alcohol Use Disorders;&#xD;
      however, the model is relevant and will be accessible to a broad array of healthcare&#xD;
      settings, including primary care practices. Our new model, the R-BIRT, challenges the&#xD;
      prevailing paradigm and offers the promise of not only clinical efficacy but increased cost&#xD;
      effectiveness as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Significance: The USPHSTF, SAMHSA, CDC, and NIAAA have affirmed the importance of screening&#xD;
      in medical settings for alcohol consumption that exceeds the NIAAA low risk limits, brief&#xD;
      educational and motivational counseling for those who screen positive or have other evidence&#xD;
      of an Alcohol Use Disorder, and, when appropriate, referral to treatment (SBIRT). However,&#xD;
      translation to clinical practice continues to be elusive. Polaris Health Directions (Small&#xD;
      Business) and the University of Massachusetts Medical School (Research Institute) have&#xD;
      partnered to solve this problem by creating the Remote Brief Intervention and Referral to&#xD;
      Treatment service for alcohol (R-BIRT), a telehealth service for delivering evidence based&#xD;
      alcohol brief interventions and referral to treatment during a medical encounter in a&#xD;
      cost-effective, sustainable way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators: The investigators have extensive expertise in SBIRT for alcohol (Boudreaux,&#xD;
      Bernstein); telehealth (Boudreaux); development, testing, and marketing of behavioral&#xD;
      intervention technologies (Boudreaux, Harralson); comparative effectiveness trial design and&#xD;
      analysis (Barton); and health economics (Sachs). Combined, the team has over 100 publications&#xD;
      related to SBIRT and constituent technology domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: This Phase 2 STTR will pioneer telehealth delivery of SBIRT for alcohol. It will&#xD;
      be flexible enough for a variety of medical settings, and will develop and expand software&#xD;
      capable of facilitating both telehealth and in-person SBIRT delivery models. It will further&#xD;
      innovate SBIRT research and clinical practice by exploring mechanisms of action, an objective&#xD;
      rarely incorporated into SBIRT studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: The design is a two arm, single blind (outcomes assessor), randomized,&#xD;
      non-inferiority trial. Emergency department (ED) patients (n=356) who drink above the NIAAA&#xD;
      low risk limits or have evidence of an Alcohol Use Disorder will be randomized to the&#xD;
      telehealth model (R-BIRT) or a gold-standard in-person intervention (SBIRT) and followed for&#xD;
      6 months post-visit using a multi-method outcomes attainment plan. The study will establish&#xD;
      the non-inferiority of the telehealth model compared to the in-person model in reducing&#xD;
      alcohol use and alcohol related consequences, while showing that the telehealth model is the&#xD;
      more cost effective of the two. Mechanisms of action, including patient knowledge of low risk&#xD;
      drinking limits, motivation, self-efficacy, substance abuse treatment initiation, and&#xD;
      self-help program engagement, will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environment: With the success of the R-BIRT Phase 1 and other relevant projects, including&#xD;
      previous large scale Phase 2 STTR clinical trials, Polaris and UMass have clearly established&#xD;
      their capability of successfully carrying out this study, disseminating its results, and&#xD;
      marketing the final product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: Because alcohol misuse, abuse, and dependence carries an enormous burden in both&#xD;
      human suffering and healthcare costs, a strategy that provides high quality, evidence based&#xD;
      care in a manner that is more cost effective and easier than existing models has potential to&#xD;
      exert a substantial impact on public health.&#xD;

    <description>Consistent with the latest standards in ED SBIRT research, alcohol use will be measured by a one-week Timeline Follow-back (TLFB), which is a validated procedure wherein participants report the number of drinks they consumed each day for the past seven days using a protocol that facilitates recall. This will allow computation of drinks/week and drinking above the NIAAA low risk drinking limits.</description>

    <description>The Cornell Services Index will be used to ascertain all outpatient and inpatient healthcare use, including substance abuse treatment. It will be modified to also assess self-help program engagement, such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Per our standard procedures used in other studies, self-reported substance abuse treatment initiation will be validated by contacting the treating provider.</description>
