      BACKGROUND: In 2011 a Maternity Services Development Programme was implemented in a South of&#xD;
      England city, to promote effective collaborative working between maternity services&#xD;
      (midwives) and other service providers (health visitors, social workers, specialist services&#xD;
      etc.) by co-locating services in local childrens centres. The progamme ultimately aimed to&#xD;
      improve care for local service users (women and their families), especially those considered&#xD;
      vulnerable. Implemented changes were based on evidence that suggests poor collaborative&#xD;
      working contributes to poorer outcomes. RATIONALE: To explore the impact of the programme on&#xD;
      local service providers, and by association service user care. AIM: To explore a localised&#xD;
      Maternity Services Development Programme, identifying how inter- agency collaborative working&#xD;
      occurs, and the service providers perceived benefits and challenges on collaboration, and by&#xD;
      association service user care. METHODOLOGY: The proposed research uses a case study approach&#xD;
      to collect and analyse predominantly qualitative data, and some quantitative data. Data will&#xD;
      be collected using observation episodes (e.g. participant meetings) to observe collaboration,&#xD;
      and interviews to explore these experiences. Additionally documents will be analysed to&#xD;
      observe documented evidence of collaborative practice. Pre-existing statistical data will&#xD;
      also be used to highlight changes in indicators of service user well being since the&#xD;
      implementation of the Maternity Services Development Programme. PARTICIPANTS: A cross-section&#xD;
      of service providers (no service users) working in or with maternity services from 4 of 9&#xD;
      city Children Centre's. FINDINGS: No current findings, data collection expected to start&#xD;
      September 2015.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2011 a Maternity Services Development Programme (MSDP) was implemented in one South of&#xD;
      England city. The programme aimed to promote effective collaborative working between&#xD;
      maternity services (midwives) and other service providers (health visitors, social workers,&#xD;
      Children Centre staff, specialist and volunteer services) to improve outcomes for service&#xD;
      users (women and families). The MSDP utilised local Children's Centres, which provide&#xD;
      community focused family support, to co-locate maternity services and other service&#xD;
      providers. The rationale to improve collaborative working is supported by evidence suggesting&#xD;
      poor collaborative working contributes to poorer outcomes (Laming Report 2003; Marmot Review&#xD;
      2010). Therefore programmes such as the MSDP could potentially improve short and long-term&#xD;
      outcomes for those accessing maternity services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research uses a case study approach to collect and analyse predominantly&#xD;
      qualitative data, and some quantitative data. This method will allow for analysis of the MSDP&#xD;
      and understanding of its influence on maternity services and collaboration, and will aim to&#xD;
      illuminate perceived strengths and challenges of the MSDP evident to services providers. Data&#xD;
      will be collected using observation episodes (e.g. participant meetings) to observe&#xD;
      collaboration, and interviews to explore experiences. Additionally documents will be analysed&#xD;
      to observe documented evidence of collaborative practice. Pre-existing statistical data will&#xD;
      also be used to highlight changes in indicators of service user well-being since the&#xD;
      implementation of the MSDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will recruit a cross-section of service providers (no service users) that work&#xD;
      in or with maternity services from four of the nine city Children Centres. Invitation letters&#xD;
      will be circulated to potential participants through participating Children Centre&#xD;
      management, where they will be invited to participate in the observation and interview data&#xD;
      collection activities. They will then be able to select the extent of their participation.&#xD;

    <description>The Maternity Services Development Programme was implemented to improve care for local families (service users) involved with maternity services. The aim was to improve care during the early stages of a family's development and to establish foundations for long-term well-being. One aspect of the programme worked to improve the delivery of care by facilitating collaboration and joint-planning between service providers. The programme uses local city Children's Centres to co-locate services (different agencies or professionals who are working within the same locality). The aim of co-location was to promote stronger collaboration between maternity services and other service provider agencies to develop stronger partnerships, and to help identify those who are (or who may become) vulnerable.</description>
