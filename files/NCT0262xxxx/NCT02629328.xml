    <textblock>
      This study will quantify the safety and efficacy of the CardioCel implant in tri-leaflet&#xD;
      repair. 80 patients in up to 7 sites in Europe and the US will all be treated with the&#xD;
      CardioCel implant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the CardioCel for the&#xD;
      repair of aortic valve stenosis and/or insufficiency. CardioCel is a cardiovascular patch&#xD;
      manufactured with the so called ADAPT® technology. The ADAPT technology uses bovine&#xD;
      spongiform encephalopathy-free pericardium which is processed in several ways to make it&#xD;
      biocompatible with human tissue. CardioCel should provide an off the shelf material solution&#xD;
      for tri-leaflet repair surgery due to its functional attributes, low propensity for post&#xD;
      implant calcification, and overall biocompatibility. As a result adverse events and&#xD;
      complications associated with the autologous pericardium repair surgery are mitigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study patients suffering from moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis and/or aortic&#xD;
      insufficiency will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study 80 patients will be enrolled in up to 7 centers in Europe and the US. The&#xD;
      expected study duration is 36 months; 12 months of recruitment and 24 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CardioCel is US FDA cleared for the repair of cardiac and vascular defects, including&#xD;
      intra-cardiac defects; septal defects, valve and annulus repair, great vessel reconstruction,&#xD;
      peripheral vascular reconstruction, suture line buttressing and pericardial closure.&#xD;
