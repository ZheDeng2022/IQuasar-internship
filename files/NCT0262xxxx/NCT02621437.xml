  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer can be painful following surgery or can develop later and remain persistent.&#xD;
      Pain occurrence is frequent with 50% of women developing sequelae pain of varying intensity&#xD;
      with an impact on the quality of life. One of the priorities of the 3rd French Cancer Plan is&#xD;
      to preserve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteopathy, complementary therapy, may help to reduce inconvenience caused by the disease,&#xD;
      treatments and their side effects (asthenia, anxiety and pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess the impact of osteopathic treatment on pain in patients&#xD;
      following breast cancer surgery. The impact will be considered beneficial if the pain score&#xD;
      (digital scale) in the intervention group is lower, by at least two points, than the pain&#xD;
      score in the control group at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a monocentric, randomized, parallel group, single-blind and prospective clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
