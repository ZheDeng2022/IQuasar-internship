  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic (Allo) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a recognized curative&#xD;
      procedure for hematological malignancies. It is now well known that this property is related&#xD;
      to the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect developed from the immunocompetent cells contained in&#xD;
      or generating from the donor graft. For years, however, and despite this unique antitumoral&#xD;
      activity, Allo-HSCT has been restricted to a limited number of patients due to two major&#xD;
      limitations: the toxicity of the procedure and the absence of a donor for every single&#xD;
      patients. More recently the stage has dramatically changed with respect to these two&#xD;
      restraints. Over the last decade, many studies have established the feasibility of Allo-HSCT&#xD;
      in older patients but the availability of MRD is even less frequent in elderlies, likely&#xD;
      related to medical contraindication for graft donation or sibling deaths. UD are routinely&#xD;
      used but associated with a high incidence of GVHD. As compared to younger populations,&#xD;
      unrelated cord-blood HSCT is seldom performed in this population and numbers decrease with&#xD;
      age due to the feared risk of supposed increased lethal infectious complications related to&#xD;
      the effect of the delayed immune reconstitution in elderlies. Thus the need for alternative&#xD;
      donors allowing for a safe and efficient transplantation is still unmet. In consequence,&#xD;
      overall, despite the fact that Allo-HSCT feasibility has been established in the oldest&#xD;
      patients, all these lacks contribute eventually to maintain a low rate of allo-HSCT performed&#xD;
      in a population with the higher incidence of hematologic malignancies that usually present&#xD;
      with the poorest prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus it is critical developing innovative efficient therapeutic strategies answering this&#xD;
      unmet-medical need. In this perspective, Haplo-HSCT could represent a part of the answer in&#xD;
      this aged population. It offers the potential advantage to offer a rapid donor determination&#xD;
      for virtually every single patient. In addition, our data suggest that in elderlies&#xD;
      haplo-HSCT using T-repleted graft, RIC and PT-HDCy presents low NRM and retains an antitumor&#xD;
      effect despite low GVHD incidences. They also suggest that haplo-HSCT may conduct to better&#xD;
      outcome than URD-HSCT as an alternative to MRD-HSCT. It may also be associated with lower&#xD;
      costs (no graft purchase and low post-transplant complications rate) and better QOL likely&#xD;
      related to low cGVHD-rate. In addition the conduct of such trial at a time when the diffusion&#xD;
      of the strategy in this population is just starting is really crucial before widespread&#xD;
      uncontrolled dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to address this question by prospectively comparing these 2&#xD;
      strategies in elderly patients without MRD, in terms of efficacy, safety and including the&#xD;
      prospective evaluation study of quality-of-life (QOL). They will conduct a national,&#xD;
      multicenter, open-label, comparative, randomized phase III trial in patients with&#xD;
      hematological malignancies justifying an allo-HSCT from an alternative donor when a MRD has&#xD;
      not been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When MRD search is recognized to be a failure, patients will be included in the clinical&#xD;
      trial after informed consent and randomized in the two strategies based on donor search:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reference group: Unrelated Donor group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigational group: Haplo Donor Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will use a composite end-point embracing the three main causes of failure:&#xD;
      death, relapse and severe cGVHD (as a surrogate endpoint for QOL). We will analyze the HSCT&#xD;
      usual objectives as GHVD, NRM, relapse and survival. A specific study of patients' health&#xD;
      related quality of life will also be conducted using the FACT-BMT questionnaire. In addition,&#xD;
      the success of the two strategies in term of transplant completion (donor determination,&#xD;
      transplant realization and time to do so) will be compared.&#xD;
