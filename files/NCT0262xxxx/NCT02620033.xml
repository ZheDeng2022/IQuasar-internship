  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers hope to learn if yoga complementary therapy would improve health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, recovery of urinary continence and erectile function in patients who&#xD;
      underwent prostate cancer surgery (i.e. radical prostatectomy). We hypothesized that in&#xD;
      patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, preoperative and postoperative Yoga complementary&#xD;
      therapy would improve health- related quality of life (HRQOL), recovery of urinary continence&#xD;
      and erectile function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This two-arm, randomized controlled pilot study will compare Yoga intervention to usual care&#xD;
      group. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of Yoga complementary therapy on HRQOL in patients&#xD;
      who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). Yoga therapy will be given to the intervention&#xD;
      group three times in a week for 6 weeks prior to surgery and then initiated 3 weeks after the&#xD;
      surgery for another 6 weeks. The yoga exercise will be tailored to the participant's comfort&#xD;
      level. As an exploratory analysis, we will evaluate pro-inflammatory and immunological&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;

Each session will be approximately 60 - 75 minutes. These yoga session will be held at Nydia's Yoga Therapy Studio, located in San Antonio, TX, under the guidance of certified yoga instructor, Dr. Nydia Tijerina Darby, PT, DPT, MS, who's the owner of the studio and co-investigator of this study. The yoga exercise will be tailored to patient's comfort level.</description>
