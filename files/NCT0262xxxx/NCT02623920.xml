    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well brentuximab vedotin, bendamustine, and rituximab work in&#xD;
      treating patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a period of&#xD;
      improvement or has not responded to previous treatment. Monoclonal antibody-drug conjugates,&#xD;
      such as brentuximab vedotin, use antibody to target chemotherapy in cancer cells. Drugs used&#xD;
      in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine, work in different ways to kill cancer cells.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, kill the cancer cells directly, but also harness&#xD;
      the immune system to kill the cancer cells. Adding brentuximab to rituximab may improve&#xD;
      response rates in CD30 positive, CD20 positive Relapsed Refactory NHL.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Complete response (CR) rate and overall response rate (ORR) for patients with relapsed&#xD;
      aggressive high-risk non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) treated with brentuximab vedotin,&#xD;
      bendamustine and rituximab (S-BR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate 2-year progression-free survival (PFS). II. To evaluate rate of positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET)-CR and correlation to 2 year PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the toxicity of six cycles of S-BR. IV. To evaluate mobilization, stem cell&#xD;
      collection, engraftment in patients that proceed to salvage autologous stem cell transplant&#xD;
      (ASCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate percentage of tumor cells that are positive or negative for cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation (CD)30 by immunohistochemistry (IHC), the subcellular location of CD30&#xD;
      (membrane or cytoplasmic only with absence of membrane expression), intensity of scoring, and&#xD;
      correlating with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate gene expression profiling (GEP) by Nanostring Technology and comparing&#xD;
      expression levels of target genes in CD30 membrane positive, CD30 cytoplasmic only positive&#xD;
      or CD30 negative tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate correlation between mutations identified through next generation sequencing&#xD;
      (NGS) including ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing of the tumor transcriptome, and correlating&#xD;
      to GEP and CD30 IHC, and correlating to clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the levels of soluble CD30 at baseline and in response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCHEDULE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1,&#xD;
      bendamustine IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1-2, and rituximab IV on day 2. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
