      Ten patients who were referred to receive physiotherapy and 10 healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      participants of the study.Following the initial evaluation, participants with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis will take the fascial mobilization for their posterior crural muscle group and&#xD;
      hamstring distal tendons which connects the crural bones at first day. After the day&#xD;
      following the first visit participants will asked to come again and stretching exercises will&#xD;
      apply to plantar muscle groups after the evaluation. Every participants will evaluate with&#xD;
      the following assessment tools: Modified Ashworth scale will use to evaluation of severity of&#xD;
      plantar flexor spasticity. Static and dynamic loading parameters will assess with dynamic&#xD;
      pedobarography.&#xD;

      Ten patients who were referred to receive physiotherapy at the neurology department of&#xD;
      Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation of the Faculty of Health Sciences of Hacettepe University,&#xD;
      Ankara with multiple sclerosis and ten voluntary healthy age matched participants will be the&#xD;
      subjects of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the initial evaluation, participants with multiple sclerosis will take the fascial&#xD;
      mobilization (FM) for their posterior crural muscle group and hamstring distal tendons which&#xD;
      connects the crural bones at first day. After the day following the first visit participants&#xD;
      will ask to come again and stretching exercises will apply to plantar muscle groups after the&#xD;
      evaluation. In the investigators' study fascial mobilization will use to release plantar&#xD;
      flexor muscles and fascia because it is believed to not aggravate the spasticity and is&#xD;
      widely used in clinical practice. Fascial mobilization will applied regarding the following&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient lied on prone position with knee extension and therapist put the patient's&#xD;
      plantar surface to her femoral region. Achilles, tibialis posterior, perenous longus and&#xD;
      brevis distal tendons, gastrocnemius proximal tendons, hamstring's distal tendons will&#xD;
      mobilize at first stage. The second stage of fascia mobilization includes the deep fascial&#xD;
      mobilization of posterior crural muscle trunks. After that, the skin also gently mobilize.&#xD;
      During fascial mobilization, once the spastic muscles relaxation were appeared, the ankle is&#xD;
      been moved to dorsiflexion gradually. FM will carry out for 15 minutes for each foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Same patients will receive also stretching exercises consisted of 30 s stretching and 10 s&#xD;
      resting periods and will carry out for 15 minutes for each foot at second day after the first&#xD;
      evaluation.Fourteen healthy volunteers will receive no interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will utilize at initially and after FM were applied at first visit. The day after&#xD;
      patients will asked to come again and initially evaluations will repeat before stretching&#xD;
      exercises. After stretching exercises patients will evaluate again with same tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment tools described as following: Modified Ashworth scale will use to evaluate of&#xD;
      severity of plantar flexor spasticity. Static and dynamic loading parameters will be evaluate&#xD;
      with pedobarography.Maximum loading pressure -N/cm2, maximum loading time- ms for; 1st. and&#xD;
      5th metatarsal head, medial and lateral heel and midfoot will be recorded both while the&#xD;
      patients standing and walking.&#xD;
