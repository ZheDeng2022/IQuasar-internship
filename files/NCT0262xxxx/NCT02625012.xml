  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is the most common acquired depigmented disorder of the skin characterized by&#xD;
      destruction of melanocytes resulting in well-circumscribed achromic macules. Ultraviolet&#xD;
      phototherapy with narrow band (UVB-NB) is currently one of the treatments of choice, because&#xD;
      it is able to induce proliferation, differentiation, maturation and migration of melanocytes.&#xD;
      This repigmentation has distinctive patterns such as follicular, marginal, and diffuse. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to observe the dynamics of migration and proliferation, in vitiligo&#xD;
      patients under UVB radiation phototherapy treatment. The investigators will evaluate this&#xD;
      process by measuring FAK (focal adhesion kinase ) and c-Kit by immunohistochemistry and&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is the most common acquired depigmented disorder of the skin characterized by&#xD;
      destruction of melanocytes, which results in well-circumscribed achromic macules. Its&#xD;
      etiology is not fully recognized but functional melanocytes may disappear by autoimmune&#xD;
      response, oxidative stress that induces melanocytes apoptosis, and loss of cell-cell adhesion&#xD;
      between melanocytes and keratinocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultraviolet phototherapy with narrow band (UVB-NB) is currently one of the treatments of&#xD;
      choice with an average response rate of 60-70% on lesions. UVB-NB phototherapy may induce&#xD;
      immune regulation and melanogenic induction. It is also able to induce Treg cells&#xD;
      proliferation to suppress the autoimmune response which destroys melanocytes. By the other&#xD;
      hand, UVB-NB induces signaling of proliferation, differentiation, maturation and migration of&#xD;
      melanocytes, playing an important role in vitiligo re-pigmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK125) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that&#xD;
      plays as an important component in the signal transduction of cell migration, as it modulates&#xD;
      cytoskeletal proteins necessary for their movement. UVB-NB radiation induces migration on&#xD;
      melanocytes cultures increasing their levels of p-FAK125 and it has been proposed as a&#xD;
      melanocyte migration marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-kit is a tyrosine kinase receptor expressed on melanoblasts and differentiated melanocytes.&#xD;
      Ligand binding induces PI3K, MAPK and Src kinase pathways, which traduce differentiation of&#xD;
      melanoblast into proliferating melanocytes; so its expression imply the presence of mature&#xD;
      pigmented melanocytes. C-kit is increased in mature melanocytes after UVB exposure, but it&#xD;
      has been show that in melanoma cases the loss of c-kit expression is involved in cancer&#xD;
      progression , therefore c-kit signaling is also associated in migratory process. Although,&#xD;
      different reports have been established the expression of this markers on vitiligo, is not&#xD;
      defined this markers on the repigmentation patterns induces to UVB radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UVB radiation induces repigmentation in distinctive patterns such as follicular, marginal,&#xD;
      and diffuse. Follicular pattern is the predominant, and comes from hair follicle melanocytes.&#xD;
      In the marginal pattern melanocytes from healthy skin are attracted to the lesion. In the&#xD;
      diffuse pattern UVB radiation stimulates those inactive melanocytes. In contrast, achromic&#xD;
      pattern not induces melanocyte activation. The relation between the biological behavior of&#xD;
      melanocytes and these repigmentation patterns, may provide insights to an improved method to&#xD;
      treat vitiligo. The aim of this study is to observe the dynamic of migration and&#xD;
      proliferation by specific markers on the repigmentation patterns of vitiligo patients under&#xD;
      UVB radiation phototherapy.&#xD;
