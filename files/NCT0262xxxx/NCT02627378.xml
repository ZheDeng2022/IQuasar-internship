  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A highly pathogenic human coronavirus causing respiratory disease emerged in Saudi Arabia in&#xD;
      2012. This viral infection termed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is&#xD;
      associated with high mortality rate in approximately 36% of reported patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,374 laboratory-confirmed worldwide infections,&#xD;
      including at least 490 related deaths, from September, 2012, to July 24, 2015.2 The higher&#xD;
      incidence of MERS-CoV infections in Saudi Arabia may be related to multiple factors,&#xD;
      including seasonality, increased proactive screening, poor infection control measures, low&#xD;
      relative humidity, and high temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infected patients with MERS-CoV usually have abnormal findings on chest radiography, ranging&#xD;
      from subtle to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities. MERS progresses rapidly to&#xD;
      respiratory failure, in approximately 2/3 of infected patients, which has a high mortality&#xD;
      rate, particularly in immunocompromised patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has emerged as a rescue therapy in patients with&#xD;
      refractory hypoxemia during the H1N1 epidemic.The use of veno-venous (VV)-ECMO provides&#xD;
      respiratory support for patients with respiratory failure, whereas the use of veno-arterial&#xD;
      (VA)-ECMO could be helpful in those with cardiorespiratory failure.10 However, the survival&#xD;
      rate of the infected patients with H1N1 who required the use of ECMO varies considerably&#xD;
      among the Caucasian and Asian countries (90% survival in Sweden and 83% in the UK13 vs. 35%&#xD;
      in Japan). This large discrepancy could be explained with lack of satisfactory equipment,&#xD;
      therapeutic guidelines, training of staff, and effective systems allowing patient transfer to&#xD;
      the dedicated ECMO centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guery and co-investigators described the use of ECMO in two French patients with&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory failure secondary to MERS-CoV infection.This has been extended for&#xD;
      treatment of refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure during the Saudi MERS-CoV outbreak.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Saudi Ministry of Health has implemented a national ECMO program since 2014 in three&#xD;
      major cities including Jeddah, Al Madinah and Riyadh which have most of the reported infected&#xD;
      cases with MERS-CoV. The Saudi ECMO program provides a rapid transportation chain system&#xD;
      (Medevac system), adequate number of intensive care beds and ECMO machines, and highly&#xD;
      trained perfusionists and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that the early use of ECMO for treatment of severe acute&#xD;
      hypoxemic respiratory failure, defined as a ratio of the PaO2 to the fraction of inspired&#xD;
      oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) less than 80 despite optimized ventilator management, in infected&#xD;
      patients with MERS-CoV, would be associated with reduced in-hospital mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators obtained a centralized ethics approval from the Ministry of Health to avoid&#xD;
      delays and to facilitate the conduct of this timely important study. Eligible patients or&#xD;
      their legal guardians were contacted to request their participation and obtaining of their&#xD;
      written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are 18 years or older who received ECMO support for MERS-CoV associated&#xD;
      hypoxemic respiratory failure were included. MERS-CoV infection is defined using the WHO case&#xD;
      definition. A positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal&#xD;
      swabs, sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchial alveolar lavage is sufficient to establish the&#xD;
      diagnosis of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Standardized National Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participating Saudi centers had adopted a standardized protocol based on the&#xD;
      evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
      associated with the H1N1 virus infection using low-tidal volume, lung-protective mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation as the initial strategy. A lung-protective strategy was applied using volume&#xD;
      assist-control mode, pressure-controlled synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation mode&#xD;
      or pressure-controlled ventilation mode, with a tidal volume of 6 to 8 mL/kg of predicted&#xD;
      body weight and variable FiO2 and the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to achieve&#xD;
      arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) from 88% to 95% or a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of&#xD;
      55 to 80 mm Hg.Then a full spectrum of ventilator modes, including airway pressure release&#xD;
      ventilation, prone ventilation and high frequency ventilation was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If, despite and after the above measures, a patient cannot achieve a ratio of the PaO2 to the&#xD;
      fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) greater than 100 on ''safe'' settings&#xD;
      (i.e. FiO2 less than 80%, peak inspiratory (Ppk) and plateau (Ppl) pressures less than 40 and&#xD;
      35 cm H2O, respectively and tidal volume less than 6 to 8 ml/kg), the patient was assessed&#xD;
      for eligibility for ECMO support. Veno-venous (VV-ECMO) was used for respiratory support for&#xD;
      those with respiratory failure, whereas the veno-arterial (VA-ECMO) was used for those with&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once adequate ECMO support was instituted, the ventilator was set to low ''recruitment''&#xD;
      settings. When a patient began to show evidence of pulmonary recovery, the ECMO support was&#xD;
      weaned off with gradual reducing blood flow, gas flow, and FIO2 over the membrane, when the&#xD;
      PaO2/FiO2 ratio was greater than 200 with an FiO2 of 50% and pressures less than 38 cm H2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of Historical Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group was identified retrospectively, patient who did not receive ECMO due to&#xD;
      lack of access but who fulfill the criteria for initiating treatment will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      National database was used to identify patients who met our eligibility criteria. Trained&#xD;
      research investigators collected the relevant datafor eligible patients. The investigators&#xD;
      used pre-designed case report forms (CRF) to abstract data. The investigators collected data&#xD;
      on: baseline characteristics including age, sex, height, weight, and ethnicity, as well as&#xD;
      the presence of a number of predefined comorbidities, ICU pharmacologic interventions,&#xD;
      ventilation data including days of mechanical ventilation, ventilation mode, and mean values&#xD;
      of tidal volumes, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels, FiO2, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio&#xD;
      before, during and after the initiation of ECMO support, and the administration of antiviral&#xD;
      and antibiotic medications, the type, gas flow (liter/min), blood flow (liter/min/m2) and&#xD;
      duration of ECMO, circulatory support, length of ICU and hospital stays, mortality during&#xD;
      hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the need for renal replacement therapy; tracheostomy; bacterial co-infection&#xD;
      duringICU stay; ventilator-associated pneumonia was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will document whether the ECMO treatment was initiatedatthe participating&#xD;
      centeror whether the patient was transferred to an ECMO center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on eligible patients was recorded retrospectively during ICU stay. Data on hospital&#xD;
      discharge or death will be recorded as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data were reported as numbers and percentages for dichotomous variables; and&#xD;
      median [interquartile ranges] or and mean (SD) for continuous variables. All outcome data&#xD;
      from the Cohort-Controlled groupand ECMO group were compared using independent Student t&#xD;
      test, Mann Whitney U test or X2 test as appropriate. P values &lt; 0.05 were considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the predictors of the need for ECMO and factors associated with death in&#xD;
      ECMO-treated patients were entered in a multivariate stepwise backward logistic regression&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
