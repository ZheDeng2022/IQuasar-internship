    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell therapy is an experimental cancer therapy. It takes young tumor infiltrating lymphocytes&#xD;
      (Young TIL) cells from a person s tumors and grows them in a lab. Then they are returned to&#xD;
      the person. Researchers think adding the drug pembrolizumab might make the therapy more&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if adding pembrolizumab to cell therapy is safe and effective to shrink melanoma&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 70 years with metastatic melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT, MRI, or PET scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart and lung function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment, participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A piece of tumor taken from a biopsy or during surgery in order to grow TIL cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukapheresis: Blood flows through a needle in one arm and into a machine that removes white&#xD;
      blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rest of the blood returns through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An IV catheter placed in the chest for getting TIL cells, aldesleukin, and pembrolizumab (if&#xD;
      assigned)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the hospital for treatment. This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily chemotherapy for 1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some participants, pembrolizumab infusion 1 day after chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIL cell infusion 2 4 days after chemotherapy, then aldesleukin infusion every 8 hours for up&#xD;
      to 12 doses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible filgrastim injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery for 1 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Take an antibiotic and antiviral for at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      If assigned, have pembrolizumab treatment every 3 weeks for 3 more doses. They may have&#xD;
      another round.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have 2-day follow-up visits every 1 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can&#xD;
      mediate the regression of bulky metastatic melanoma when administered along with highdose&#xD;
      aldesleukin (IL-2) following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting&#xD;
&#xD;
      preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 axis,&#xD;
      facilitates the activity of anti-tumor lymphocytes in the tumor micro environment.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab administration can result in objective tumor responses in patients with&#xD;
&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma and is approved for use by the FDA for the treatment of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administered TIL express low levels of PD-1, though PD-1 can be re-expressed on TIL in&#xD;
           vivo following TIL administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In pre-clinical models, the administration of an anti-PD1 antibody enhances the&#xD;
           anti-tumor activity of transferred T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine in a prospective randomized trial whether the addition of pembrolizumab to the&#xD;
           standard non-myeloablative conditioning regimen, TIL, and high-dose IL-2 can improve&#xD;
           complete response rates in patients with metastatic melanoma who have received prior&#xD;
           anti PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (Cohort 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the complete response rate to the standard non-myeloablative conditioning&#xD;
           regimen, TIL, and high-dose IL-2 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with&#xD;
           metastatic melanoma who have not received prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (Cohort 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 16 and less than or equal to 70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluable metastatic melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of TIL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No allergies or hypersensitivity to high-dose aldesleukin administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with metastatic melanoma will have lesions resected for TIL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be assigned one of 2 cohorts: (1)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  patients who are refractory to prior anti PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  patients who have not received prior anti PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After TIL growth is established:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients assigned to Cohort 1 will be randomized to either receive or not receive&#xD;
                pembrolizumab in combination with the standard non-myeloablative conditioning&#xD;
                regimen, TIL and high dose IL-2&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All patients assigned to Cohort 2 will receive the standard nonmyeloablative&#xD;
                conditioning regimen, TIL, and high-dose IL-2ACT in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For those patients receiving pembrolizumab- Pembrolizumab will be administered&#xD;
           immediately prior to TIL administration and continue for an additional three cycles&#xD;
           following the cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 170 patients may be enrolled over 3-4 years.&#xD;

             toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less)&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients must demonstrate progressive disease at the time of treatment. (Note:&#xD;
             Patients who have received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. vemurafinib) may be&#xD;
             treated if they present with stable disease at the time of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subjects must be co-enrolled in protocol 03-C-0277.&#xD;
&#xD;
