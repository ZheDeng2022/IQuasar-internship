  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study which will be conducted&#xD;
      at multiple centers in the U.S. All subjects will receive oral immunotherapy for their&#xD;
      specific food allergies (limited to 5 of those food allergens in Investigational New Drug&#xD;
      (IND) 14831). All subjects will receive Omalizumab for 16 weeks. The subject's allergens will&#xD;
      be introduced in a rush desensitization day at week 8. Subjects will return to clinic to&#xD;
      escalate the dose of their allergens until 2,000mg protein of each allergen is reached&#xD;
      Subjects will return to clinic for a DBPCFC to each allergen at week 30. If subjects are&#xD;
      nonreactive to 2 or more allergens during their DBPCFC at week 30 they will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of three double blinded arms: Arm A- continue with current dose (2000 mg each food&#xD;
      allergen protein), Arm B-300 mg of each food allergen protein, Arm C-placebo (avoiding food&#xD;
      allergen protein), their current dose. All subjects will return to clinic for a DBPCFC to&#xD;
      each allergen at week 36. The final challenge of week 36 will be the final end of study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety is a paramount concern in the study design and will be monitored carefully throughout&#xD;
      the study. Study subjects and their parents/guardians will receive extensive education on&#xD;
      food allergy reactions and medication use.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll multi food allergic subjects (4-55 years of age) with proven&#xD;
      multi food allergies. The investigators anticipate enrolling 70 subjects with multi food&#xD;
      allergies at more than one site. Subjects must have food specific Immunoglobulin E &gt;4 kilo&#xD;
      Units/Liter for each allergen or a skin test reactivity to each food allergen greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 6mm wheal diameter. In addition, subjects must have a total Immunoglobulin E &lt;2,000&#xD;
      kilo Units/Liter, a clinical reaction during a double blind placebo controlled food challenge&#xD;
      (DBPCFC) with food protein/powder to establish sensitivity to given food protein/powder&#xD;
      (pecan, milk, egg, peanut, almond, wheat, cashew, sesame seed, soy, walnut, hazelnut, shrimp,&#xD;
      cod, salmon) and no clinical reaction during placebo (oat) as per Chemistry Manufacturing and&#xD;
      Control section of Investigational New Drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject is planned to be enrolled in the active phase of the study for 36 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food protein and powder will be obtained and prepared as per Investigational New Drug 14831&#xD;
      and will be in compliance with all applicable regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omalizumab is approved by the European Medicines Agency (European FDA) for patients with&#xD;
      severe asthma &gt;6 years of age, and by the US FDA for patients &gt;12 years of age. Omalizumab&#xD;
      will be dosed according to Genentech Dosing Omalizumab will be provided by the site.&#xD;
