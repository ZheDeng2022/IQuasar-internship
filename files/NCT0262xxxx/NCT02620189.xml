  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary data suggest that up-regulation of Interleukin -17 (IL-17) and the T-helper 17&#xD;
      (Th17) pathway occurs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients on anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor&#xD;
      (TNF) therapy who demonstrated an incomplete clinical response. A deeper understanding of&#xD;
      this is required in order to determine whether IL-17 or the Th17 pathway is a valid target&#xD;
      for intervention in this population to improve response outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective is to observe biologic naïve RA subjects on anti-TNF therapies and take&#xD;
      measurements of peripheral blood and synovial tissue to assess differences in the IL-17 and&#xD;
      Th17 pathways between responders and non-responders. The aim of the study is to test if&#xD;
      increased Th17 pathway activity is present in subjects who do not respond clinically to&#xD;
      anti-TNF therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessments, synovial bio-markers and ultrasound will be used as determinants of&#xD;
      clinical response. The study may identify disease characteristics that determine which&#xD;
      subjects may be more likely to respond to anti-TNF therapy, or those who may require either a&#xD;
      different treatment option, or additional pathway inhibition in addition to TNF, in order to&#xD;
      achieve clinical response.&#xD;

      The study aims to recruit 50 participants in total to this study. Potential candidate for&#xD;
      this research include those that have active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with the symptoms, and&#xD;
      current medication status that qualify for anti-TNFα therapy. This is the treatment plan&#xD;
      patients will be placed on regardless of whether or not they are taking part in the study;&#xD;
      however, within the research environment, information will be gathered that may be able to&#xD;
      help better understand the levels of response to anti-TNF treatment and why this differs&#xD;
      between people. Participants will be asked to provide blood and urine samples as part of the&#xD;
      research. Pieces of genetic material called ribonucleic acid (RNA) will be extracted from the&#xD;
      study specific blood samples (and synovial tissue from patients that are part of the biopsy&#xD;
      sub-study) provided by participants. This material will be analysed to reveal information&#xD;
      about what genes are 'active' in the joint environment during anti-TNF treatment period. This&#xD;
      information can tell us what proteins might be involved in the inflammation of affected&#xD;
      joints and might also be able to predict what type of response patients will experience in&#xD;
      response to different treatments. The analysis of research samples from this study will&#xD;
      provide new information on the mechanisms for response/non-response to anti-TNF therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional Biopsy sub-study A number of participants that have consented to the main study will&#xD;
      be invited to take part in the optional biopsy sub-study. This will involve taking a biopsy&#xD;
      of one of the affected joints via an ultrasound guided procedure. The procedure is minimally&#xD;
      invasive and has good safety and tolerability with participants. The procedure is performed&#xD;
      under local anaesthetic and removes tiny pieces of inflamed tissue (synovial tissue) from the&#xD;
      lining of the joint using a needle under the guidance of an ultrasound scanner. This&#xD;
      sub-study will collect tissue from affected joints to help answer the research questions in&#xD;
      this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional DNA genetic sampling Participants are also invited to take part in the optional DNA&#xD;
      genetic sampling and are asked to contribute DNA samples for this study. The purpose of this&#xD;
      optional part of the research study is to help understand how anti-TNF therapies work, and&#xD;
      how they may cause side effects, to further understand rheumatoid arthritis, and to&#xD;
      understand why some people respond to anti-TNF therapy while others do not. Genetic&#xD;
      (genotyping) testing refers to patient sample being used for genetic research. This is the&#xD;
      study of DNA and how it determines our traits. DNA research can also explain why some people&#xD;
      respond well to their medications and others do not and can also provide reasons as to why&#xD;
      some people develop some diseases and others do not. Samples from participants that have&#xD;
      consented to the optional DNA genetic sampling will also be used for a type of genetic&#xD;
      research called epigenetics. This is the study of chemical modifications of DNA that occur&#xD;
      over time, without a change in DNA sequence. These modifications control the way cells&#xD;
      produce proteins and respond to the environment. Epigenetics research is not a test to&#xD;
      diagnose a person for a genetic disease or to determine whether a person may have a risk of&#xD;
      developing a genetic disease. It is only used to understand prevailing disease and how drugs&#xD;
      may work in different groups of people. In epigenetic testing, DNA samples from participants&#xD;
      will be analysed to determine how this may influence response to anti-TNF therapy.&#xD;
