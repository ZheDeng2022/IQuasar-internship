      Fatty liver disease including liver steatosis (fat deposition) is a major health problem&#xD;
      worldwide. It is considered pathological when fat accumulation exceeds 5% of the liver&#xD;
      weight. Transplantation represents the ultimate treatment for end stage liver disease.&#xD;
      However, the discrepancy between the demand for donor organs and their availability presents&#xD;
      one of the greatest hurdles of liver transplantation. Therefore, extended criteria organs&#xD;
      have to be considered to overcome this shortcoming. Hepatic steatosis is one of the most&#xD;
      important criteria defining extended-criteria donor liver. In liver transplantation, 'severe'&#xD;
      fat deposition in donor liver is a major cause of graft failure while 'mild' deposition is&#xD;
      considered transplantable and 'moderate' deposition represents the gray zone and remains&#xD;
      difficult to assess. Surgeons usually perform a hepatic steatosis assessment during liver&#xD;
      donor surgery. However, this method is very subjective and difficult especially when&#xD;
      inexperienced surgeons or trainees are concerned. Furthermore, it has recently been&#xD;
      documented that the assessment of steatosis is challenging even in the hands of experienced&#xD;
      surgeons. Theoretically, a better way to assess steatosis before organ procurement would be a&#xD;
      non-invasive imaging technique. However, some of these techniques appear to lack the&#xD;
      sensitivity to accurately quantify hepatic fat content while others are complex, expensive&#xD;
      and inconvenient to use in the setting of organ procurement. Therefore, liver biopsy remains&#xD;
      the reference for grading hepatic steatosis. In daily practice the assessment and&#xD;
      quantification of steatosis by a pathologist during organ procurement is more complex related&#xD;
      to the lack of availability of dedicated hepatopathologists outside of office hours and in&#xD;
      smaller community hospitals. A simple and short technique is therefore required to assess&#xD;
      liver steatosis before retrieval. We have recently demonstrated that Raman spectroscopy could&#xD;
      provide an accurate, rapid and real-time assessment of hepatic fat content and correlated&#xD;
      highly with the gold standard (i.e. histopathological assessment of liver sections) in an&#xD;
      animal model of liver steatosis. The purpose of this study is to validate the use of Raman&#xD;
      spectroscopy for quantitative assessment of hepatic steatosis. In the hands of the surgeons&#xD;
      this device can provide an immediate, robust tool to assess the suitability of donor livers&#xD;
      at the site of retrieval prior to liver transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are three main methods reported to assess liver steatosis before deceased&#xD;
      donor liver retrieval: Noninvasive imaging techniques, evaluation of a liver biopsy sample by&#xD;
      an experienced pathologist and assessment by transplant surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging techniques that are currently in use include ultrasonography (USG) , computerized&#xD;
      tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although it has an acceptable level of&#xD;
      sensitivity, USG does not provide reproducible quantitative information. It can be used in&#xD;
      most centers but it is operator dependent. Likewise, the diagnostic performance of&#xD;
      non-enhanced CT scan for the accurate quantification of steatosis is unreliable. MRI is&#xD;
      highly sensitive and specific in diagnosing hepatic steatosis and it has been reported that&#xD;
      fat quantification using a 3.0-T MRI can provide sufficient sensitivity to detect and&#xD;
      quantify steatosis in live liver donor candidates. However, this complex technology limits&#xD;
      its use in routine organ procurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microscopic evaluation of a liver biopsy sample by an expert pathologist is the gold&#xD;
      standard for steatosis assessment. The presence and type of steatosis can be determined by&#xD;
      microscopic evaluation. The grade of steatosis can be determined according to the&#xD;
      international standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite being gold standard, biopsies are recorded for only 23% of transplanted livers in&#xD;
      United States. Since a pathologist is not always available at the time of procurement, many&#xD;
      centers rely mainly on the assessment of steatosis and organ quality by the procurement&#xD;
      surgeon (i.e. transplant surgeon). During this assessment the donor liver is evaluated&#xD;
      according to parenchymal texture criteria such as degree of yellowness (normal, mild,&#xD;
      moderate, severe) and degree of firmness (soft, normal; mild, moderate, severe). However,&#xD;
      studies which investigated how accurately a transplant surgeon could predict hepatic&#xD;
      steatosis concluded that these assessments could be significantly misleading even in&#xD;
      experienced hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since all these three methods have their limitations, there is a need for a convenient and&#xD;
      simple technique to better assess hepatic fat content prior to transplantation. Raman&#xD;
      spectroscopy is an inelastic light scattering technique that is sensitive to molecular&#xD;
      vibrations, the symmetry and frequencies of which are unique to the type of atoms and their&#xD;
      spatial arrangement. Sensitivity to these properties is the basis of its ability to provide a&#xD;
      spectral fingerprint of molecules in the illuminated region. It has been used to detect amino&#xD;
      acids, nucleotide bases, fatty acids, saccharides, primary metabolites and other constituents&#xD;
      that form the protein, carbohydrates, fats and DNA/RNA of biological tissues. It is an&#xD;
      attractive technology for bioanalysis because no sample preparation is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raman spectroscopy is currently under investigation for use in clinical settings and it is&#xD;
      carried out mainly for diagnostic purposes. It is currently approved for use in Canada for&#xD;
      skin cancer diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a variety of different Raman spectroscopy systems. We have recently designed a high&#xD;
      throughput Raman spectroscopy system which is smaller than the others, portable and robust.&#xD;
      It enables in situ scans of tissue to be undertaken with very little experience required of&#xD;
      the operator. This system uses 'near infrared (NIR) excitation wavelength to improve the&#xD;
      penetration depth of the laser while reducing the possibility of tissue damage. It gives&#xD;
      information in the form of Raman spectra, analysis of which gives a Principal Component (PC)&#xD;
      score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This specially designed system could accurately quantify steatosis in mice and rat livers.&#xD;
      The PC scores exhibited a significant correlation with histopathological examination results.&#xD;
      Since steatosis in human liver tissue exhibit changes similar to the left liver lobe of mice&#xD;
      and rats, we concluded that this technique could be applied to the field of transplantation.&#xD;
      Clinical validation and subsequent adoption of this technique can provide transplant&#xD;
      specialists with a valuable tool to obtain real time information on the severity of hepatic&#xD;
      steatosis to assess the likelihood of a successful outcome and reduce inadvertent organ&#xD;
      discard rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to validate Raman spectroscopy (by means of our specially&#xD;
      designed high throughput fiber optic Raman system) in a clinical setting in assessment of&#xD;
      hepatic fat content. The in vivo Raman spectra (PC scores) will be compared to the findings&#xD;
      of a pre-operative imaging method (MRI-fat quantification) and the current gold standard,&#xD;
      liver biopsy (i.e. histopathological assessment of the liver specimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC RESEARCH QUESTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Can Raman spectroscopy utilizing a portable fiber optic system rapidly assess the fat&#xD;
      content of the liver in situ in clinical setting? 2. Do Raman spectra (principal component&#xD;
      scores) correlate well with the findings of MRI-fat quantification and histopathological&#xD;
      assessment of the liver biopsy specimen? STUDY DESIGN: This study is conceived as a&#xD;
      single-centre, prospective validation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Partial liver resection is the surgical removal of a portion of the liver. Most&#xD;
      partial liver resections are performed for the treatment of hepatic neoplasms. Patients who&#xD;
      will undergo an open partial liver resection surgery in our institution will be reviewed with&#xD;
      the circle of care team and approached for consent if deemed suitable for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Nova Scotia Health Authority Research Ethics Board-approved informed consent form will be&#xD;
      utilized in the consent discussion (run by the clinical fellow or the research associate-&#xD;
      both of whom are investigators participating in this project) and patients will be provided&#xD;
      time to read the document in full before being asked for a decision on participation.&#xD;
      Patients who give their consent for the study will be assigned to the study group. Assignment&#xD;
      process will continue until 25 patients are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will undergo a pre-operative MRI for fat quantification. They will be&#xD;
      asked to fast for at least 8 hours prior to MRI. Fat quantification technique (proton density&#xD;
      fat fraction technique) will be performed using the IDEAL pulse sequence, which has been&#xD;
      Health Canada approved for assessment of hepatic fat fraction, on a 3.0-T MR unit (GE 750; GE&#xD;
      Healthcare). An attending fellowship trained abdominal radiologist who is experienced in MR&#xD;
      image interpretation will measure the hepatic fat fraction (FF) on FF maps, which will be&#xD;
      generated automatically. The automatically calculated hepatic FF will be displayed as a&#xD;
      percentage on a full scale of 0-100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the liver resection procedure a region of the specimen that is to be removed but not&#xD;
      the actual lesion will be illuminated by the Raman spectroscope fiber-optic probe. The Raman&#xD;
      spectra provided and recorded in real-time (within a few seconds) will subsequently be&#xD;
      analyzed (principal component analysis). This analysis will provide a PC score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the application of Raman spectroscopy the operative procedure will continue as&#xD;
      planned. Histochemical stains, H&amp;E (hematoxylin-eosin) and trichrome, are routinely used for&#xD;
      the interpretation of liver specimens in our anatomic pathology laboratory. As a special&#xD;
      stain Oil Red O will need to be used to demonstrate the presence and extent of the fat (i.e.&#xD;
      fat quantification) in liver tissue. Since it can only be performed on frozen sections a&#xD;
      frozen section will be obtained from the removed liver specimen section to allow for Oil Red&#xD;
      O staining- specific for diagnosing and quantifying fat droplets. An attending pathologist&#xD;
      who is blinded to the MRI findings will evaluate these sections and determine the grade of&#xD;
      steatosis as per the international standards:&#xD;
&#xD;
      M0: no macrovesicular steatosis M1: mild focal macrovesicular steatosis (&lt;30% hepatocytes are&#xD;
      involved) M2: moderate, zonal macrovesicular steatosis (&gt;30 and &lt;60% hepatocytes involved)&#xD;
      M3: severe, panlobular macrovesicular steatosis (&gt;60% hepatocytes involved) Correlation&#xD;
      analysis will be performed between hepatic FF percentages, PC scores and steatosis grades for&#xD;
      each study participant. Study participants will be followed after the surgery according to&#xD;
      our standard post-liver resection follow-up protocol without any deviations from the standard&#xD;
      of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS For statistical analysis, quantitative data will be expressed as means&#xD;
      and standard deviations and qualitative data will be expressed as numbers. Linear regression&#xD;
      will be performed between macrovesicular steatosis grade and hepatic FF percentages and PC&#xD;
      scores. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves will be generated for the PC scores&#xD;
      and hepatic FF percentages to identify their ability predict the grade of macrovesicular&#xD;
      steatosis. All statistical analysis will be performed with commercially available statistical&#xD;
      software (XLSTAT 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal health information will not be used for the conduct of this project. Code numbers&#xD;
      will be assigned for each participant. A database which will be accessible only to the&#xD;
      investigators will be stored in a secured computer (requiring password entry) in transplant&#xD;
      office (Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Victoria General Site, 4th floor, Dickson&#xD;
      Building, Room 4074). This database will include the code numbers of the participants and the&#xD;
      data elements such as hepatic FF percentage, PC score and steatosis grade.&#xD;
