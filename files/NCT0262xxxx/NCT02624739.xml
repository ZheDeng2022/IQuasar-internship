    <textblock>
      This study is designed to descriptively assess improvement in quality of life and test the&#xD;
      usability of remotely monitored respiration parameters in the routine management of recently&#xD;
      discharged heart failure patients. It will consist of two arms: (i) intervention, and (ii)&#xD;
      control. Participants will be randomized to either arm at time of enrollment. Every&#xD;
      participant enrolled in the study will receive a device for remote monitoring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure ('HF') presents an increasing social and economic burden, especially with&#xD;
      respect to HF related hospitalizations. Some commentators suggest that these costs may double&#xD;
      within the next two decades. Respiration patterns are well acknowledged as having diagnostic&#xD;
      and prognostic value in HF. In this preliminary study, the investigators assess the usability&#xD;
      of remote monitoring of respiration parameters in the routine management of HF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: (primary and important secondary objectives)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess usability of the system (primary measurement is % of successful data&#xD;
           transmissions from participants' homes, secondary measurement includes scores from the&#xD;
           System Usability Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess quality of life (as measured using the KCCQ) for HF patients monitored with a&#xD;
           non-contact respiration monitor which can be used by clinicians to guide standard&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other key secondary objectives include examining trends in healthcare utilization,&#xD;
      descriptively assessing any differences in care patterns post hoc between participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the study plan , the investigators will also analyze respiration and sleeping&#xD;
      patterns from the raw data files to assess the prevalence of unusual breathing patterns such&#xD;
      as sleep apnea in newly discharged HF patients and how these patterns may be linked to&#xD;
      outcomes. These analyses will be executed retrospectively on a population rather than&#xD;
      individual participant basis and will not be used to inform individual treatment plans.&#xD;
