  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite current medications, morbidity and mortality of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)&#xD;
      remain high. According to the World Health Organization, MDD affects 121 million people&#xD;
      worldwide, and is projected to be the second leading cause of global disability by 2020.&#xD;
      Monotherapy with SSRIs is the most widely used treatment for MDD. However, on average, SSRIs&#xD;
      require six weeks for onset of action, and two-thirds of those on SSRIs fail to achieve&#xD;
      remission.Compounding this problem, patients with residual symptoms are significantly more&#xD;
      likely to discontinue treatment or relapse, be hospitalized for medical and psychiatric&#xD;
      conditions, or die of suicide and other causes. Although eliminating ineffective treatment&#xD;
      trials would significantly reduce patient suffering and healthcare costs,clinicians currently&#xD;
      do not have the tools to objectively select treatment based on an individual's likelihood of&#xD;
      remission. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify markers predictive of an&#xD;
      individual's SSRI treatment outcome. Developing this personalized treatment requires&#xD;
      increased understanding of the relationship between pretreatment neurobiology, SSRI-induced&#xD;
      biological changes, and the corresponding symptom improvements.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: Determine a Pretreatment Marker of SSRI Effectiveness Using PET. With the goal of&#xD;
      reducing MDD burden, many studies have assessed the utility of FDG-PET in antidepressant&#xD;
      treatment prediction. However, due to the limitations listed above, there is no consensus on&#xD;
      which brain regions are predictive of treatment efficacy. In addition to serving as a&#xD;
      biomarker of SSRI effectiveness, only conclusive determination of these regions will provide&#xD;
      insight into depression pathophysiology, helping uncover SSRI mechanism of action, and aiding&#xD;
      in the search of novel therapeutics. Based on the investigators' preliminary data and other,&#xD;
      similar studies, the investigators hypothesize that SSRI-induced change in the Hamilton&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale (deltaHDRS) will be correlated with pretreatment metabolic rate of&#xD;
      glucose (MRGlu, quantified using arterial blood analysis) in three potential regions: (1)&#xD;
      midbrain, (2) right anterior insula, and/or (3) left ventral prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Isolate the Neurobiological Basis of the &quot;Loss&quot; Research Domain Criteria (RDoc) and&#xD;
      the Change Associated with Treatment. Using a factor analysis of the HDRS, the investigators&#xD;
      have previously demonstrated that the &quot;loss&quot; RDoC criteria is significantly correlated to&#xD;
      MRGlu in frontal cortical areas. The investigators therefore hypothesize that change in MRGlu&#xD;
      (pre to post treatment) in these regions will be correlated with symptom improvement&#xD;
      specifically in &quot;loss&quot; symptoms. As an exploratory extension, the investigators will&#xD;
      determine whether these changes are treatment-specific (i.e. to SSRI or placebo). A&#xD;
      validation of the hypothesis suggests a targeted mechanism of action, and provides a&#xD;
      significant step forward for precision treatment. If regional changes in MRGlu are not&#xD;
      correlated to improvement in this RDoC category, it suggests that SSRI (or placebo) induced&#xD;
      changes may be a downstream effect that should be examined further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Validate NonInvasive Full Quantification of MRGlu Using Simultaneous Estimation. Full&#xD;
      quantification of brain MRGlu with FDG (as performed in this study) requires measuring FDG in&#xD;
      arterial plasma (input function) from arterial catheter insertion and blood analysis. This&#xD;
      costly and invasive procedure creates a barrier to widespread PET use. The investigators have&#xD;
      developed an innovative method for Simultaneous Estimation (SimE) of input information and&#xD;
      PET outcome measures (e.g. MRGlu). SimE fully quantifies brain MRGlu without requiring an&#xD;
      arterial catheter. In the case of FDG, the investigators' data suggests that SimE used with a&#xD;
      single venous sample can provide accurate results. The investigators further hypothesize that&#xD;
      the venous sample may be entirely replaced by study data (e.g., injected dose) and biometrics&#xD;
      (e.g., body surface area, lean body mass index). Using two different approaches (statistical&#xD;
      imputation and physiological parametric modeling) and previously collected data, the&#xD;
      investigators will train the SimE for accurate quantification in the absence of blood data.&#xD;
      The rich data collected in this study will then provide a robust benchmark for validation of&#xD;
      the SimE approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Validate Noninvasive Estimates of Plasma Radioactivity from a Novel miniPET Scanner.&#xD;
      In parallel to SimE (algorithm/software) development, the investigators will test a&#xD;
      noninvasive method of plasma analysis using hardware. FDG concentration will be measured at&#xD;
      the wrist, arm, ankle or leg with a novel synchronized PET scanner developed by&#xD;
      co-Investigator, Dr. Paul Vaska.&#xD;
