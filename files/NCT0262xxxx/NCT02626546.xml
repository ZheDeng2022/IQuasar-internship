  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study. Consecutive patients,&#xD;
      operated in six University Hospitals in Sweden will be recruited following major surgical&#xD;
      procedure. The length of patient recruitment period will be 12 weeks. The length of follow up&#xD;
      will be 360 days . The objectives are to determine the postoperative morbidity (during the&#xD;
      hospital stay), the survival (0-360 days), to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes and&#xD;
      to identify risk factors that may potentially be influenced by any intervention in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The follow-up of mortality is extended to 3 years of the cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The mortality of the background population at 30 and 90 Days will be analyzed&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Validation of the Surgical Outcome Risk Tool in the study cohort and in the background&#xD;
           population are planned&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study. Length of patient recruitment is 12&#xD;
      weeks, the length of observation is 360 postoperative days. The expected number of patients&#xD;
      is 1000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected from the operation planning software on each study site. It is done&#xD;
      by daily screening of the operation list and will be enrolled by applying the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The criteria of surgical severity will be assessed by the UK surgical severity&#xD;
      grading system ( AXA PPP/ Specialist Procedure Codes, United Kingdom). For that purpose a&#xD;
      scroll list will be used, which is available on the website of the Surgical Outcome Risk Tool&#xD;
      calculator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics will be prospectively collected from medical records: age, gender,&#xD;
      co-morbidities, medical history, physical activity, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and neurological function; routine laboratory findings; type, complexity, urgency&#xD;
      of surgery, incision localization and malignancy; lowest intraoperative systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate. The outcomes are the postoperative morbidity (assessed by the&#xD;
      Postoperative Morbidity Survey) classified by the Clavien-Dindo classification tool (during&#xD;
      hospital stay), and mortality, use of medications, hospital re-admissions (0-360 days) and&#xD;
      new occurrence in different disease related national quality registries.Relationships between&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity (POMS) the severity of morbidity (Clavien Dindo) and mortality will&#xD;
      be analyzed. For illustration, Kaplan Meyer plots will be used, and for analyses Cox&#xD;
      proportional hazard model will be used with adjustment for sex and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional changes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The length of observation for survival was extended to 3 years. The mortality at 3 years&#xD;
           will be analyzed addressing the relationship between the postoperative morbidity (POMS)&#xD;
           and mortality. Cox regression model will be used with adjustment of age, comorbidity and&#xD;
           malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Validation of Surgical Outcome Risk Tool is planned in two populations related to the&#xD;
           PROFS study: eligible and background population. As the PROFS cohort was manually&#xD;
           selected, we presumed that the eligible population is larger than the enrolled&#xD;
           population.To enable electronic selection of the eligible population, we have developed&#xD;
           a script, which translates the Swedish surgical codes into the UK severity codes. Using&#xD;
           the same script we will classify the surgical severity in the background population of&#xD;
           the PROFS cohort. Variables included in the Surgical Outcome Risk Tool will be extracted&#xD;
           from the operation databases of each study site. The date of death will be extracted&#xD;
           from the Swedish National Adress Registry and the malignancy from the registry of&#xD;
           National Swedish Cancer Registry.&#xD;
