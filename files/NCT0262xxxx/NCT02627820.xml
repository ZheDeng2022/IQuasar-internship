  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ATTRwt (also known as senile systemic, or senile cardiac amyloidosis) is a progressive heart&#xD;
      disease, causing congestive heart failure. It is caused by amyloid protein deposits in the&#xD;
      heart, that are derived from a normal protein, TTR, made in the liver. The aim of the study&#xD;
      is to determine whether lowering the blood levels of TTR, by a weekly injection of a compound&#xD;
      designed specifically to do this, will slow the progression of the disease when treated&#xD;
      patients are compared to previously-followed patients who were not receiving this drug. The&#xD;
      study also aims to determine how well this drug is tolerated and the existence and severity&#xD;
      of any drug side-effects.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        All patients with documented SSA will be considered for inclusion. SSA is defined as an&#xD;
        echocardiographic appearance of left ventricular wall thickness of 13 mm or more, in the&#xD;
        absence of uncontrolled hypertension, and with a positive biopsy for amyloid, which also&#xD;
        stains positive for TTR by immunochemistry or mass spectrometry. For the definition of SSA,&#xD;
        genetic testing should be negative for a mutation. Identification of amyloid type is&#xD;
        standard of care for all patients seen at the Cardiac Amyloidosis Program and the presence&#xD;
        of a clinically -obtained positive biopsy will be a requirement for study inclusion. The&#xD;
        positive biopsy can be from any organ, providing that the echocardiographic appearance is&#xD;
        typical of amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients should, in the opinion of the Investigator, be in a stable state in terms of&#xD;
             NYHA class. Class I-III patients will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 50-90 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females. If a woman is premenopausal, or a male&#xD;
             partners with a premenopausal woman, she/he must be willing to use the following&#xD;
             methods of contraception: condoms, oral/hormonal contraception, Intrauterine Device,&#xD;
             diaphragm, or abstinence&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Written informed consent to be obtained prior to study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Histochemical diagnosis of amyloidosis as based on detection by polarizing microscopy&#xD;
             of green birefringent material in Congo red-stained tissue specimens&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Molecular definition of the absence of a TTR mutation or immunohistochemical staining&#xD;
             of amyloid fibrils with anti TTR antibody and negative genetic testing for a TTR&#xD;
             mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willingness to return to the treating center for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Willingness and ability to self-administer, or to have spouse administer weekly&#xD;
             subcutaneous injections of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, require further adjustment of&#xD;
             diuretics at the time of screening to achieve optimal treatment of heart failure. Once&#xD;
             stable for 2 weeks, patients in Class I-III will become eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with NYHA class 4 congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Concomitant non-amyloid heart disease that might, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             cause changes in strain imaging on serial follow-up (e.g. aortic stenosis of greater&#xD;
             than mild severity, unstable coronary artery disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior liver transplantation or liver transplantation anticipated in less than 6&#xD;
             months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ALT and/or AST ³ 2 x ULN and/or Alkaline phosphatase ³ 2 x UNL;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) &lt; 50 ml/min;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any other lab values that in the opinion of the investigator might place the subject&#xD;
             at unacceptable risk for participation in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of poor compliance with medications or medical treatment, based on a review of&#xD;
             medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of the study therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Use of any investigational drug for amyloidosis within 4 weeks prior to study entry or&#xD;
             during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Current use of tafamidis, diflunisal, doxycycline or TUDCA for therapy of amyloidosis.&#xD;
