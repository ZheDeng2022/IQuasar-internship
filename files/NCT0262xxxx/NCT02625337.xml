  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 trial consisting of 24 patients receiving the combination of dabrafenib +&#xD;
      trametinib + pembrolizumab in 3 different dosing schemes and 8 patients receiving&#xD;
      pembrolizumab standard monotherapy. All patients start with pembrolizumab standard therapy&#xD;
      for 6 weeks and will then be randomized to continue pembrolizumab monotherapy or to receive&#xD;
      additional intermitted/short-term dabrafenib + trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification will be baseline LDH level and baseline PD-L1 expression.&#xD;
