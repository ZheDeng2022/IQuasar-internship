      Objective: The effect of weekly professional oral care on the composition of the oral flora&#xD;
      in dentate, dependent elderly residents was followed during a 12-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Long-term, regular professional oral hygiene care reduces the total number of&#xD;
      microorganisms and oral disease-related microorganisms. Less is known about the effect on the&#xD;
      quality/composition of the remaining oral flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: Thirty-three subjects were included in the study group and 35 in the&#xD;
      control group. Dental status, presence of supragingival-plaque, labial minor gland secretion&#xD;
      rate, and prescription medicines were recorded. Microbial samples, collected from&#xD;
      supragingival plaque and the dorsum of the tongue, were analyzed using cultivation technique.&#xD;

      Ethics statement The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at the University of&#xD;
      Gothenburg, Sweden (Permit Number 039/00).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study and control groups After giving an informed and written consent to participate, either&#xD;
      by the subjects themselves or by a relative or a guardian, 68 subjects were recruited from&#xD;
      two nursing homes for elderly persons. The nursing homes, belonging to the same institution&#xD;
      and having the same leadership, are situated in the same area of the city. The study group&#xD;
      was recruited from one of the nursing homes and consisted of 21 women and 12 men. The control&#xD;
      group, recruited from the second nursing home, consisted of 23 women and 12 men. To be&#xD;
      included in the study, the subjects had to have at least 10 natural teeth and no removable&#xD;
      dentures and be able to follow simple instructions, such as open and close the mouth. The&#xD;
      subjects were included in the study in the order they gave their informed consent and&#xD;
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Throughout the study period, the subjects in both groups&#xD;
      were eligible for dental care for dependent individuals, as regulated by law in Sweden,&#xD;
      including an oral health care assessment free of charge, basic dental care at subsidized&#xD;
      rates, and nursing home personnel trained in oral health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The study group received professional oral care, once a week throughout the&#xD;
      12-month study period, by either of two dental hygienists. The oral care was carried out in&#xD;
      the residents´ private rooms with the participant sitting in his/her own chair or lying in&#xD;
      bed. The treatment included brushing of the teeth, at labial and lingual sides, with use of&#xD;
      an electric toothbrush (Oral-B Professional Care 7000) and a 1100 ppm sodium fluoride&#xD;
      dentifrice (Zendium Classic, Opus Health Care AB/Zendium). Inter-dental cleaning was carried&#xD;
      out using inter-dental brushes (TePe: TePe, Malmö, Sweden) and toothpicks (TePe Birch: TePe,&#xD;
      Malmö, Sweden). Information and training in oral hygiene procedures were given to those in&#xD;
      the study group capable to understand instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the intervention, each subject in the study group, as well as their main&#xD;
      responsible nursing aid, received an electric toothbrush of the same kind as was used by the&#xD;
      two dental hygienists (Oral-B Professional Care 7000), and instructions and training on how&#xD;
      to use the brush. In the control group, the oral health care procedures followed the ordinary&#xD;
      routines for the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of clinical data and samples for microbial analysis Clinical examinations,&#xD;
      measurements of labial minor gland salivary secretion rate, and microbial samplings were&#xD;
      performed between 9 and 12 am (by author KL K) and were carried out in the residents´ private&#xD;
      rooms. All microbial sampling was performed in duplicate, one week apart. The clinical&#xD;
      examination was performed at the first of the two duplicate sampling occasions. Plaque&#xD;
      registration followed by the collection of supragingival plaque for microbial analysis was&#xD;
      performed at four sites, in that order. The sites selected were interproximally the upper&#xD;
      right first and second molars, the lower left first and second molars, the upper right second&#xD;
      incisor and the canine, and the lower left second incisor and the canine. If one or more of&#xD;
      these teeth were missing, the closest available site was selected. The measurement of the&#xD;
      labial minor gland salivary secretion rate, followed by microbial sampling from the tongue,&#xD;
      was performed in that order and at the end of the registration and sampling sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both the study and control groups, clinical data, data on prescription medicines, the&#xD;
      labial minor gland salivary secretion rate, and microbial samples were collected at the&#xD;
      baseline and at the end of the 12-month study period. In the study group, additional plaque&#xD;
      registration and sampling for microbial analysis were performed after 3, 6, and 9 months from&#xD;
      the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination The clinical examination was carried out, in the light of an adjustable&#xD;
      headlight, using a dental mirror and a dental probe. The number of natural teeth, clinically&#xD;
      visible caries lesions and plaque were recorded. Plaque was recorded as no visible plaque&#xD;
      (score 0), visible but thin plaque (score 1) or visible thick plaque (score 2). A mean of the&#xD;
      plaque scores recorded at the four interproximal sites selected for registration was&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescription medicines Data on prescription medicines was collected from the residents´&#xD;
      medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labial minor gland salivary secretion rate For measurement of the labial minor gland salivary&#xD;
      secretion rate, performed as described by Eliasson et al., the area of the lower labial&#xD;
      mucosa was gently dried with a cotton pad. A pre-cut piece of a standard filter paper was&#xD;
      then placed for 15 s near the midline approximately 3 mm from the outer border of the mucosa.&#xD;
      The volume of liquid absorbed by the filter paper was measured using a calibrated Periotron®&#xD;
      (8000, ProFlow™ Inc., Amityville, NY, USA). At each examination, four samples were collected&#xD;
      from each subject and an individual mean was calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbial sampling and analysis Microbial samples were collected from the supragingival&#xD;
      plaque and the dorsum of the tongue. An experienced laboratory assistant blinded to which&#xD;
      group of subjects, study or control group, and to which of the examination occasions the&#xD;
      samples were collected from, analyzed the samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supragingival plaque samples were collected using sterile toothpicks (TePe Birch) and&#xD;
      pooled. The tongue samples were collected using sterile tweezers, cotton pellets and plastic&#xD;
      spatulas. The spatula, with a circular hole 1.5 cm diameter, was placed on the back part of&#xD;
      the dorsum. A cotton pellet, immersed in sampling fluid, was swept over the area inside the&#xD;
      hole. The two samples were each transferred to 3.5 ml of transport medium VMGA III and&#xD;
      processed within four hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses of the samples were performed as previously described using enriched blood agar&#xD;
      plates and selective agar plates. The total number of microorganisms growing under anaerobic&#xD;
      conditions, the total number and proportion of streptococci and the number and proportion of&#xD;
      Streptococcus sanguinis/oralis and Streptococcus salivarius, both associated with good oral&#xD;
      health, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and Actinomyces spp, associated with dental caries,&#xD;
      F. nucleatum, and P. intermedia/nigrescens, associated with gingival inflammation, P.&#xD;
      gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans, associated with periodontitis, Candida albicans,&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus, and enteric rods, associated with mucosal and aspiratory infections,&#xD;
      were calculated. The detection limit was 100 colony-forming units for all species except A.&#xD;
      actinomycetemcomitans, where the detection limit was 10 colony-forming units. If possible,&#xD;
      the number of microorganisms was calculated from their number on a plate giving 30 - 300&#xD;
      colonies. A mean of the results from the duplicate samplings was calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods To normalize the microbial data, the numbers were transformed&#xD;
      logarithmically. Zero counts were treated as one colony forming unit/ml. Mean and median&#xD;
      values and standard deviations were calculated. One-way ANOVA was used for the analysis of&#xD;
      differences between the study and control groups. Two-way ANOVA was used for statistical&#xD;
      analysis of differences at different time points within the two groups. Results were regarded&#xD;
      statistically significant at p-values &lt; 0.05. Owing to the multiple influence aspect,&#xD;
      isolated significances should be interpreted with some caution.&#xD;
