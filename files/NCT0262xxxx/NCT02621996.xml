  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The individual who is born premature, in addition to a CNS still in accelerated training&#xD;
      suffers early loss of intrauterine restraint, conditions that promote hypotonia&#xD;
      characteristic of premature birth. Given this hypotonia associated with musculoskeletal&#xD;
      immaturity when improperly positioned in the incubator for an extended period, the PN can&#xD;
      develop joint contractures and postural imbalances that, in most cases, are transitory,&#xD;
      however can become persistent, causing delay in their Motor development. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to analyze the influence of the positioning of preterm infants in the incubator&#xD;
      hammock on the tone and the myoelectric activity of the rectus abdominis flexor muscles,&#xD;
      biceps and hamstrings. Study type controlled, randomized, double-blind, to be carried out&#xD;
      from November 2015 to April 2016 will be obtained two groups, control (in containment nest&#xD;
      &quot;U&quot;) and experimental (with hammock) to from randomized samples with premature births in&#xD;
      Barao de Lucena Hospital or the Hospital das Clinicas, UFPE, the Intermediate Care Units&#xD;
      (ICU) Neonatal. The sample will consist of 30 premature. To collect, pulse oximeter will be&#xD;
      used, electromyography, neurological testing Dubowitz and recording behavioral responses.&#xD;
      Each baby will be accompanied for about 8 hours daytime placement for two days and three&#xD;
      evaluations performed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study population will consist of moderately preterm newborns, attended by SUS, admitted&#xD;
      to the NICU of HBL or HC UFPE. From randomized samples with preterm infants born in the HBL&#xD;
      or HC, and are admitted to the NICU, will be obtained two groups, one for positioning in&#xD;
      hammock (experimental group) and the other in incubator containment nest &quot;U&quot; ( group&#xD;
      control). The sample will consist of 30 premature babies, 15 in each group. The allocation of&#xD;
      the PN is made in two blocks, using the site randomization.com, so that the block 1&#xD;
      corresponds to the group with hammock and positioning block 2, the group subjected to the&#xD;
      usual positioning in the incubator, which at the study site it is &quot;containment nest in U&quot;.&#xD;
      The recruitment of premature will be conducted by researcher 1, which will identify premature&#xD;
      the NICU potentially eligible for the study, invite the parents or guardians to sign the&#xD;
      consent form and clear, and then make the screening (inclusion) of the truly eligible babies&#xD;
      after filling in a checklist of eligibility criteria, always registering why exclude the&#xD;
      other. Then, the PN will be wrapped in a sheet and carried by the investigator 1 to the&#xD;
      support area of neonatal sector, located within the NICU, and where they will be placed on&#xD;
      the counter, a mattress (incubator) and electromyography to carry out the assessments. Since&#xD;
      each premature will be submitted to reviews of protocol only when alert according to the&#xD;
      state 4 or 5 (warning with little activity and alert to activity) of the Brazelton scale,&#xD;
      evaluations will be carried out between meals, avoiding the baby stay angry or sleepy. This&#xD;
      procedure will be followed regardless of the position that the baby will be submitted later.&#xD;
      In the event, the evaluation will be interrupted, and the baby will be taken back to the&#xD;
      incubator, receiving the assistance that is required, and will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
      The electromyographic and clinical evaluations will be conducted by researcher 1, preventing&#xD;
      the masking at this stage. The results obtained in the evaluations (global posture, gathering&#xD;
      maneuvers arm and popliteal angle, via video recording, and the electromyographic signal)&#xD;
      will be analyzed by researchers 2 and 3, blind research. The EMG will be made via a portable&#xD;
      electromyography surface mark with four channels, which will be connected to a laptop, and&#xD;
      double electrode surface, specially developed for use in EMG, disposable, adhesive gel Ag&#xD;
      conductor / AgCl, intended for clinical and research use. According to SENIAM recommendations&#xD;
      (EMG Surface European consortium for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles), the pads will&#xD;
      be fixed between the motor point and the tendon of the flexor muscles: rectus abdominis,&#xD;
      biceps and hamstrings, and the electrode reference on the left lateral malleolus. Three&#xD;
      channels will be used to record the electrical activity unilateral (right of all PN) and&#xD;
      simultaneously in the three above-mentioned places, so that the spontaneous muscle activity&#xD;
      baby is captured under the same conditions. The PTN will be submitted for evaluation by&#xD;
      surface EMG while simultaneously performed the clinical evaluation of tone with the&#xD;
      neurological test Dubowitz. It will only be applied to size of that test by referring to the&#xD;
      tone match the focus of this research, and only the chosen sub-items that do not require much&#xD;
      manipulation premature. These sub-items refer to the observation of global postural baby&#xD;
      standard (which observe the legs and the upper to the trunk in the supine position), the arms&#xD;
      collection operation (in which it analyzes the by rapid extension muscle strength elbow, and&#xD;
      elbow flexion speed and angle he takes after three seconds long maintained the elbow), and&#xD;
      popliteal angle (baby knee is positioned over the abdomen and exercises to gentle pressure&#xD;
      with the index finger behind the ankle in order to increase the popliteal angle, the maximum&#xD;
      angle observing obtained. Test up one leg at a time). Thus, after placement of the&#xD;
      electrodes, it will initially be observed and recorded the signal picked up by EMG of the&#xD;
      rectus abdominis muscles, biceps and hamstrings for 30 seconds, representing the muscle tone&#xD;
      baby home. Simultaneously to this first record in the EMG, the researcher will make the&#xD;
      clinical evaluation of the tone by observing the posture of premature standard. Then, still&#xD;
      using the EMG in association with the Dubowitz Test, evaluation of the maneuvers of the&#xD;
      popliteal angle and gathering arms are made that lead to be performed 30 seconds each.&#xD;
      Similarly, in parallel to this clinical evaluation of tone, will be made in the records EMG&#xD;
      muscle activity of the biceps and hamstrings related to muscle resistance to stretching&#xD;
      caused the Dubowitz test. All evaluations of muscle activity (EMG and clinical) will be&#xD;
      recorded on video using a digital camera Sony® brand (model 1000 Cyber Shot 7.2 Mega Pixels),&#xD;
      attached to a tripod positioned in order to capture the image of the entire PN body, so&#xD;
      researchers can analyze 2 and 3 evaluation results, but also so that we can resolve any doubt&#xD;
      about the future evaluations. After the evaluations, the researcher first position the PN in&#xD;
      hammock or incubator containment nest &quot;U&quot;, according to the randomization envelope content to&#xD;
      it corresonding. The hammock was made of knitted fabric (100% cotton) for improved tactile&#xD;
      comfort and prevent allergic reactions in the baby, and its dimensions follow the&#xD;
      determinations that are in the process of patenting requested by Roberta Tenorio and Roberta&#xD;
      Bione the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) in 2014, with number 19140000184&#xD;
      protocol and order number BR 20 2014 017 809 6. In the control group, the position will&#xD;
      follow the routine procedure of HBL and HC, which is the use of containment nests &quot;U&quot; , made&#xD;
      with rolled sheet placed on the mattress of the incubator and covered by another sheet. To&#xD;
      identify if there was adaptation of premature positioning, physiological parameters (RR, HR&#xD;
      and SaO2) and motor behavior (approach reactions and Withdrawal) shall be observed and&#xD;
      recorded 5 minutes before the positioning in the hammock or incubators containment nest &quot;U&quot;&#xD;
      immediately following (1 minute), after 5minutes and 10 minutes. The behavioral state of the&#xD;
      newborn will be given by the presence or absence of specific movements welfare indicators&#xD;
      (Approach reactions - hands to her mouth / face, holding hands, gripping motion, curling up&#xD;
      on itself); and specific movements of stress indicators (Withdrawal reactions - aircraft&#xD;
      wing, greeting, removal of the fingers, sitting in the air, arching). If the baby does not&#xD;
      display any of these reactions at predefined times, the comfort will be checked only by&#xD;
      physiological indicators. HR and SaO2 will be obtained by the pulse oximeter, and the FR will&#xD;
      be obtained by the number of breaths per minute count made by the researcher 1. In order to&#xD;
      detect any complications during the positioning, continuous monitoring of physiological&#xD;
      parameters will be baby both by the researcher as one by the nursing staff of the NICU as&#xD;
      routine neonatal sector. If there apnea situations, desaturation or no adjustment to the&#xD;
      positioning in the hammock, the baby will be removed from this position and use the hammock&#xD;
      will be discontinued, but should be placed in an incubator with containment nest &quot;U&quot; (routine&#xD;
      neonatal HBL sector and HC), excluding the study of preterm infants and considering it as&#xD;
      sample loss. The first stage assessment will be before the positioning, being named T0. At&#xD;
      the end of about 8 positioning daylight hours, babies are taken from the hammock, being&#xD;
      positioned according to routine neonatal sector (in containment nest &quot;U&quot; in the incubator)&#xD;
      for the nighttime. All of the protocol tone evaluations will also be repeated the next day,&#xD;
      24 hours after the beginning of the positioning, both for the group that was placed in the&#xD;
      hammock in the group that was placed in the incubator containment nest &quot;U&quot;. This second&#xD;
      assessment will be called T1. Again, after about 8 hours of daytime position, the baby will&#xD;
      be removed from the hammock or position &quot;U&quot; for the nighttime. The final evaluation will take&#xD;
      place the next morning, approximately 48 hours after the start of positioning hammock or&#xD;
      containment nest, a time called T2. Also, all revaluations will be filmed for any questions&#xD;
      that may arise.&#xD;
