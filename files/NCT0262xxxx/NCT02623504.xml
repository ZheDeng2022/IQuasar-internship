      A phase 4 unequal randomization, double blind study to evaluate the dose tolerance and safety&#xD;
      of extended release Equetro (carbamazepine) versus placebo followed by an Open label and long&#xD;
      term maintenance treatment in children and adolescents aged 10-17 years diagnosed with acute&#xD;
      manic or mixed Bipolar I Disorder&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate under double blind conditions the dose&#xD;
      tolerance and safety of extended release Equetro (carbamazepine) versus placebo followed by&#xD;
      an open label and long term maintenance treatment on extended release Equetro in children and&#xD;
      adolescents aged 10-17 year diagnosed with acute manic or mixed bipolar I disorder. The&#xD;
      safety evaluations will be based on the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events,&#xD;
      laboratory values, physical examination, vital signs ECG and trough serum level of study&#xD;
      medication. The secondary objective is to evaluate under double blind conditions the efficacy&#xD;
      of extended release Equetro versus placebo followed by an open label and long term&#xD;
      maintenance treatment on extended release Equetro in children and Adolescents Aged 10-17&#xD;
      years diagnosed with acute manic or mixed Bipolar I disorder. Efficacy evaluations will be&#xD;
      based on the measures of YMRS, CGI-S, CGI-I, CDRS-R. Manic episodes over double blind and&#xD;
      open label periods will comprise the use of study medication and duration of night time sleep&#xD;
      as monitored using a daily diary. Subject's will be enrolled in the double blind period for&#xD;
      two months and evaluated on a weekly basis. Once completing the db phase they will continue&#xD;
      on Equetro for long term maintenance for an additional six months. Placebo subject will have&#xD;
      the opportunity to continue for another eight months in the study. The first two months will&#xD;
      be the titration period as was done in the db phase and then they will have the option to&#xD;
      continue in the study for an open long term maintenance for and additional 6 months. During&#xD;
      the maintenance period subjects will be evaluated for safety and efficacy on a monthly basis.&#xD;
      At the end of the study there will be a 30 day follow-up.&#xD;
