      Neuroretinal damage in diabetes produces functional abnormalities such as the loss of&#xD;
      chromatic discrimination,contrast sensitivity and dark adaptation. These alterations can be&#xD;
      detected by means of electrophysiological studies in diabetic patients with diabetes duration&#xD;
      of less than two years, i.e. before microvascular lesions can be detected in ophthalmologic&#xD;
      examination. Neurodegeneration seems to be a generalized process that occurs throughout the&#xD;
      macula and is not confined to local abnormalities, in the cases with visible signs of&#xD;
      retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The debate is still open as to whether diabetic retinal neuropathy is the effect of vascular&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy or is primarily caused by direct neurologic damage from chronic&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. The hypothesis that diabetes causes retinal neuro-pathy independent of&#xD;
      retinopathy is intriguing and potentially links retinal neuropathy to other diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroretinal degeneration initiates and/or activates several metabolic and signalling&#xD;
      pathways which participates in the microangiopathic process as well as in the disruption of&#xD;
      the blood-retinal barrier which is a crucial element in the pathogenesis of diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinal ganglion cells are the earliest cells affected and have the highest rate of&#xD;
      apoptosis. However, an elevated rate of apoptosis has been also observed in the outer nuclear&#xD;
      layer (photoreceptors) and in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The use of spectral&#xD;
      domain OCT (SD-OCT) makes it possible to measure the thickness of individual layers at higher&#xD;
      resolution and indicates that the thinning of the inner retina in the macula is primarily due&#xD;
      to loss of ganglion cells.&#xD;

      This was a prospective case-control study conducted from October 2012 to April 2013 at Kasr&#xD;
      Al-ainy hospital- cairo university.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were divided into two groups; Group 1 consists of diabetic patients free from&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy (45 eyes). Group 2 consists of non-diabetic subjects, free from any&#xD;
      ocular pathology(21 eyes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects were subjected to full medical and ophthalmological history, refraction, best&#xD;
      corrected visual acuity (according to the snellen visual acuity chart and recorded in&#xD;
      decimals), slit lamp examination (including measuring the intraocular pressure by Goldman&#xD;
      applanation tonometer), dilated fundus examination by binocular indirect slit-lamp&#xD;
      biomicroscopy and measuring of the retinal ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness and the&#xD;
      central foveal thickness (CFT) using the RTVue® SD-OCT (Optovue, Inc.) at the LASER unit,&#xD;
      Kasr Al-ainy hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition; diabetic patients were subjected to fundus fluorescein angiography to exclude&#xD;
      diabetic changes that could be missed on clinical examination and measuring level of HbA1C in&#xD;
      blood at kasr Al-ainy hospital chemical pathology unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mapping of the GCC using the RTVue GCC scan consists of 15 vertical line scans covering a 7mm&#xD;
      square region. The GCC scan centers at 1mm temporal to fovea center for better coverage of&#xD;
      the temporal region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GCC thickness values are analyzed and compared to an extensive age-matched normative&#xD;
      database. If the patient's values are outside the normal range, the measurement is&#xD;
      color-coded appropriately. The Deviation Map shows the percent loss from normal as determined&#xD;
      by the normative database. The significance Map shows regions where the change from normal&#xD;
      reaches statistical significance. (Figure 1) Focal Loss Volume (FLV) and Global Loss Volume&#xD;
      (GLV) are two parameters that provide quantitative measures for the amount of significant GCC&#xD;
      loss. GLV measures the average amount of GCC loss over the entire GCC map. FLV measures the&#xD;
      average amount of focal loss over the entire GCC map, it is the total sum of significant GCC&#xD;
      loss (in volume) divided by the map area. As such it provides a percent of significant tissue&#xD;
      loss for volume. FLV detects focal loss using a pattern deviation map to correct for overall&#xD;
      absolute changes [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis included comparison of numerical variables between the study groups was&#xD;
      done using Student t test for independent samples in normally distributed data and Mann&#xD;
      Whitney U test for independent samples in non-normal data. For comparing categorical data,&#xD;
      Chi square (2) test was performed. Exact test was used instead when the expected frequency is&#xD;
      less than 5. Within group comparison between superior and inferior GCC was done using McNemar&#xD;
      test. Agreement was tested using kappa statistic. Correlation between various variables was&#xD;
      done using Spearman rank correlation equation. All statistical calculations were done using&#xD;
      computer programs SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,&#xD;
      USA) version 15 for Microsoft Windows.&#xD;
