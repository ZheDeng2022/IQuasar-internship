    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of tremelimumab with or without&#xD;
      tissue cryoablation in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body. Tremelimumab binds to a protein called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein&#xD;
      4 (CTLA-4), which is found on the surface of T cells (a type of white blood cell).&#xD;
      Tremelimumab may block CTLA-4 and help the immune system kill cancer cells. Cryoablation is a&#xD;
      procedure that uses a hollow, thin tube called a cryoprobe to freeze and destroy cancer&#xD;
      tissue. It is not yet known whether tremelimumab with or without cryoablation is effective in&#xD;
      treating patients with kidney cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate safety of tremelimumab alone and in combination with cryoablation in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the longitudinal values for immunological variables (including cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation [CD]4+ ICOS+ T cells; effector to regulatory T cell ratio; absolute&#xD;
      lymphocyte count) following treatment with tremelimumab in patients with metastatic RCC, and&#xD;
      evaluate difference between combination cryoablation and tremelimumab in comparison to&#xD;
      tremelimumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the objective response rate and progression-free survival of patients&#xD;
      treated with tremelimumab with or without cryoablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes at weeks 1 and 5.&#xD;
      Within 4-6 weeks later, patients undergo surgery or biopsy. After surgery or biopsy, patients&#xD;
      receive tremelimumab IV every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 3 doses, and then every 12 weeks (Q12W) in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients undergo cryoablation and receive tremelimumab IV over 60 minutes at weeks 1&#xD;
      (2-6 days after cryoablation) and 5. Within 4-6 weeks later, patients undergo surgery or&#xD;
      biopsy. After surgery or biopsy, patients receive tremelimumab IV Q4W for 3 doses, and then&#xD;
      Q12W in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days, and&#xD;
      then every 6 months.&#xD;
