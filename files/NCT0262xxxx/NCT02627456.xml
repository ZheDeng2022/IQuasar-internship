    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria is still a health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa. Death rates are stable and have even&#xD;
      increased in some areas. There are malaria vaccines. However, researchers think repeated&#xD;
      immunizations with a vaccine called PfSPZ may work better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if PfSPZ is safe, tolerable, and effective against malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18 to 50 years who live in the Doneguebougou area in Mali&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will sign or fingerprint the consent form. They will take a survey to see how&#xD;
      well they understand the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have at least one ECG: Soft electrodes will be stuck to the skin. A machine&#xD;
      will record heart signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have HIV counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to a group. Groups will get a different strength doses. Groups&#xD;
      will get a different number of vaccines over different periods of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant develops a rash or injection site reaction, photographs may be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive an oral anti-malaria drug during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored for 3 to 6 months after the last vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that humans can be protected against malaria by repeated immunization with&#xD;
      radiation attenuated sporozoites. Traditionally, those sporozoites are administered by&#xD;
      exposing the vaccinee to at least 1000 bites of sporozoite infected irradiated mosquitoes, an&#xD;
      approach that is unsuitable for mass vaccination campaigns. Recently, Sanaria, Inc. developed&#xD;
      a process for manufacturing, in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs)&#xD;
      aseptic, purified, radiation attenuated cryopreserved sporozoites from a well characterized&#xD;
      isolate of P. falciparum (Hoffman et al., 2010). This product, which is called PfSPZ Vaccine,&#xD;
      can be administered by needle and syringe. Previous studies conducted by the Vaccine Research&#xD;
      Center and the Navy have established that IV administration of PfSPZ Vaccine can induce&#xD;
      sterile protection against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) with a homologous strain&#xD;
      of P. falciparum in up to 100% of malaria na(SqrRoot) ve individuals (Seder et al., 2013). A&#xD;
      recent study conducted as collaboration among the Malaria Research and Training Center (MRTC,&#xD;
      Mali), the Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology (LMIV) National Institute of&#xD;
      Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Sanaria, Inc. (Sissoko et al., unpublished) has&#xD;
      shown that sterile protection against naturally occurring malaria infection can be achieved,&#xD;
      but not at the level seen in the US nor at the level desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next logical step in an attempt to improve protective efficacy in the targeted endemic&#xD;
      population is to increase the PfSPZ Vaccine dose, increasing the interval between the first&#xD;
      and second doses to 8 weeks (as was done in WRAIR 2080 in the group receiving 3 doses of&#xD;
      4.5x105 PfSPZ), and reducing the numbers of doses to three. Additionally, in this study&#xD;
      design, we also can begin to understand how the standard controlled human malaria infection&#xD;
      (CHMI) model may be used in the field and start to explore the impact of such factors as&#xD;
      malaria co infection and drug treatment have on vaccine responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose escalation pilot study will focus on safety and tolerability of the PfSPZ&#xD;
      Vaccine. A defined number of subjects enrolled during the pilot study will also undergo&#xD;
      further evaluation, including randomization to receive or not receive drug treatment&#xD;
      immediately prior to each vaccination and examination of protective efficacy against&#xD;
      homologous CHMI via PfSPZ Challenge. The targeted dose (18x105 PfSPZ Vaccine), if safe and&#xD;
      tolerable, will be administered to a larger cohort in a double blind, randomized, placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial to examine the protective efficacy of the vaccine against naturally&#xD;
      occurring infection. PfSPZ Vaccinees (Arm 2) from the main study will be re enrolled the&#xD;
      following malaria transmission along with age, sex, and village matched controls (re enrolled&#xD;
      Arm 3, additional controls) to explore the duration of protection through another malaria&#xD;
      transmission season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from rural villages in Mali. The study will be conducted as&#xD;
      collaboration among MRTC, LMIV/NIAID, and Sanaria, Inc.&#xD;
