      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride and&#xD;
      berzosertib when given together with carboplatin in treating patients with ovarian, primary&#xD;
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come back (recurrent) and has spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body (metastatic). Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin and gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Berzosertib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Giving berzosertib with chemotherapy (carboplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride) may work&#xD;
      better in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer&#xD;
      compared to chemotherapy alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess safety and tolerability of the combination therapy carboplatin, gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride (gemcitabine), and berzosertib (M6620 [VX-970]) in adult women with platinum&#xD;
      sensitive recurrent high grade serous or high grade endometrioid ovarian, primary peritoneal&#xD;
      or fallopian tube cancer. (Phase I Dose Escalation/Safety Lead-in) II. Determine the dose of&#xD;
      the triple therapy to be used in the dose expansion cohort of the study. (Phase I Dose&#xD;
      Escalation/Safety Lead-in) III. Confirm the safety at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for&#xD;
      the addition of M6620 (VX-970) to carboplatin and gemcitabine in first or second recurrence&#xD;
      of platinum sensitive high grade serous or endometrioid ovarian, primary peritoneal or&#xD;
      fallopian tube carcinoma. (Expansion Cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if the MTD for the combination of carboplatin, gemcitabine and M6620 (VX-970)&#xD;
      improves the confirmed response rate in adult women with platinum sensitive recurrent high&#xD;
      grade serous or high grade endometrioid ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the impact of the MTD on overall survival (OS), duration of response, and&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTEGRATED CORRELATIVE STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Collection of specimens for biomarker studies to provide preliminary proof of mechanism.&#xD;
      Assess, in an exploratory fashion, whether the combination of gemcitabine and carboplatin&#xD;
      activates the ATR/CHK1 pathway at achievable concentrations and also whether M6620 inhibits&#xD;
      the activated pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether increased deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage as assessed by two&#xD;
      different multiplex assays correlates with response to combination therapy with M6620&#xD;
      (VX-970).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether mutations in homologous recombination repair genes correlate with&#xD;
      response to combination therapy with M6620 (VX-970).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To ascertain modulation of ATR autophosphorylation and other pharmacodynamic readouts for&#xD;
      ATR inhibition by M6620 (VX-970).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride and berzosertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and berzosertib IV over 60 minutes on days&#xD;
      2 and 9. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed high grade serous or endometrioid ovarian, peritoneal or&#xD;
             fallopian tube malignancy that is metastatic and for which curative measures do not&#xD;
             exist. The histology can be confirmed from tissue that was taken at the time of&#xD;
             diagnosis. A biopsy at the time of recurrence prior to enrollment on study is not&#xD;
             required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for&#xD;
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;= 20 mm (&gt;= 2 cm) with&#xD;
             conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm (&gt;= 1 cm) with spiral computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
             scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients enrolled in the expansion cohort will be required to have archival tumor&#xD;
             tissue available for analysis and be willing to have a tumor biopsy at baseline (after&#xD;
             registration and prior to starting study treatment), at cycle 1 day 2 and at cycle 2&#xD;
             day 2. Patients must have platinum sensitive disease and be in their first or second&#xD;
             platinum sensitive recurrence. Platinum sensitive disease is defined as recurrence&#xD;
             that occurred greater than six months after completion of their last line of platinum&#xD;
             based therapy. No non-platinum regimens allowed; prior therapy with PARP inhibitors as&#xD;
             well as bevacizumab is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No more than two prior platinum based regimens. One regimen is defined as the interval&#xD;
             of treatment from start of platinum based doublet to finish of that treatment course&#xD;
             for the initial therapy or for the recurrent disease episode. If the nonplatinum agent&#xD;
             is altered due to any reason other than disease progression, it counts as one regimen.&#xD;
             For example, if a patient started on carboplatin and paclitaxel but developed a taxol&#xD;
             reaction and was switched to carboplatin and Abraxane, this counts as one prior&#xD;
             regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric&#xD;
             trials&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])&#xD;
             =&lt; 2 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 50&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum pregnancy test result for females of child bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: The effects of M6620 (VX-970) on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
                  For this reason and because deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damage response (DDR)&#xD;
                  inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial may have&#xD;
                  teratogenic potential, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
                  adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
                  prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after&#xD;
                  completion of M6620 (VX-970) administration. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
                  suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should&#xD;
                  inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with platinum resistant disease or platinum sensitive disease that is past&#xD;
             the first or second recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering&#xD;
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier, excluding alopecia. Patients with treatment&#xD;
             related effects, such as peripheral neuropathy, that are grade 1 or less are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior exposure to gemcitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to M6620 (VX-970), carboplatin, gemcitabine or to these specific compounds&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  M6620 (VX-970) is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4; therefore, concomitant&#xD;
             administration with strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided. Because&#xD;
             the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly&#xD;
             consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or&#xD;
             minimize use of. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient&#xD;
             will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 (VX-970) as a DNA-damage&#xD;
             response (DDR) inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M6620 (VX-970), breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with M6620 (VX-970). These potential risks&#xD;
             also apply to the other agents used in this study, such as carboplatin and gemcitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Li Fraumeni syndrome are excluded from the study as M6620 (VX-970) is a&#xD;
             DDR inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Addition of bevacizumab to the treatment in this study is not allowed; if the treating&#xD;
             physician feels that the addition of bevacizumab is in the best interest of the&#xD;
             patient, the patient should be treated with an FDA approved regimen outside of the&#xD;
             present study&#xD;
