      The investigators prospectively evaluated in this study the efficacy and safety profiles of&#xD;
      afatinib as 3rd or 4th line treatment after prior failure to systemic chemotherapy and&#xD;
      first-generation EGFR-TKI under a Boehringer Ingelheim sponsored Compassionate Use Program&#xD;
      (CUP), with comparison of our historical cohort who received erlotinib after previous failure&#xD;
      to systemic chemotherapy and first-generation EGFR-TKI.&#xD;

      Study background The investigators prospectively evaluated the use of afatinib as 3rd or 4th&#xD;
      line treatment after progression to one line of first-generation EGFR-TKI therapy and at&#xD;
      least one line of systemic chemotherapy under this CUP. All patients had documented EGFR&#xD;
      activating mutations before the start of afatinib. Determination of EGFR mutation analysis of&#xD;
      all patients was described previously. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor biopsies before&#xD;
      starting 1st TKI therapy were retrieved. Briefly, tumor enrichment was performed by&#xD;
      micro-dissection under light microscopy. Genomic DNA was extracted using QIAmp DNA FFPE&#xD;
      Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#xD;
      amplification of EGFR exons 18 to 21 using intron-based primers and sequenced in both forward&#xD;
      and reverse directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Patients who had EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC with prior documented&#xD;
      objective response to first-generation TKI (gefitinib or erlotinib) for 6 months and prior&#xD;
      treatment of at least 1 line of systemic chemotherapy were eligible to join the CUP offered&#xD;
      by Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharma GmbH, Ingelheim, Germany. Patients who had received&#xD;
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antagonist but not anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody in&#xD;
      their previous courses of treatment, either alone or in combination with systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy were allowed to join this CUP. They all had baseline computed tomography scan of&#xD;
      the brain, thorax and abdomen with at least 1 evaluable lesion and adequate serum&#xD;
      hematological, hepatic and renal function as defined by LUX-Lung1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment The treating physicians then decided the starting dose of afatinib of either 50 mg,&#xD;
      40 mg or 30 mg once daily continuously. After commencement of afatinib, they had regular&#xD;
      clinical follow up every 2 weeks for 4 weeks then every 4 weeks until permanent&#xD;
      discontinuation of afatinib or death. They also had regular imaging with CT scan every 8-10&#xD;
      weeks for tumor response evaluation by Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST)&#xD;
      version 1.1 [16]. Treatment interruption was needed for those who developed grade &gt;= 3&#xD;
      adverse event until it was returned to grade 1 or less. Then afatinib could be resumed but at&#xD;
      a one lower dose level. Those who received afatinib 30 mg daily as the initial starting dose&#xD;
      would discontinue afatinib permanently if they developed grade &gt;=3 events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of efficacy and treatment-related toxicities All treatment-related toxicities were&#xD;
      collected and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)&#xD;
      version 4.0. Objective response (OR) included complete response and partial response while&#xD;
      disease control (DC) included complete response, partial response and stable disease&#xD;
      according to RECIST 1.1. Survival outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS, defined&#xD;
      as time from start of afatinib to first of date of objectively determined progressive disease&#xD;
      or death from any cause) and overall survival (OS, time from start of afatinib to date of&#xD;
      death from any cause). Time to progression (TTP) started from the date of afatinib&#xD;
      commencement to the date of objectively determined progressive disease. All these parameters&#xD;
      in those who received afatinib in this study were compared to a historical cohort of patients&#xD;
      who received erlotinib after prior failure to gefitinib and at least one line of systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy. All patients in the historical cohort received erlotinib at 150 mg once daily,&#xD;
      with the same treatment response evaluation, survival and toxicity assessment as for those&#xD;
      who received afatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Mann-Whitney U was used for comparison of non-parametric variables and&#xD;
      chi-square tests were performed for discrete variables. Kaplan-Meier methods with log-rank&#xD;
      tests were employed for comparison of survival outcomes and Cox proportional hazard models&#xD;
      were used for prognostic factors for PFS after afatinib or erlotinib in univariate and&#xD;
      multivariate analyses, with afatinib versus erlotinib, age, sex, performance status, smoking&#xD;
      status, histology, TTP for 1st TKI therapy, time interval between 1st TKI and afatinib or&#xD;
      erlotinib, TTP for all lines of prior chemotherapy, time interval between last chemotherapy&#xD;
      and afatinib or erlotinib as covariates. All statistical analyses were performed by&#xD;
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.&#xD;
