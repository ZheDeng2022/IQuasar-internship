  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High body weight is protective against hip and spine fracture, but has been found to increase&#xD;
      the risk of humerus, foot and ankle fracture. Increasing understanding of the actions of&#xD;
      adipokines on bone suggests that there may be complex effects on different aspects of bone&#xD;
      geometry and microarchitecture and that these effects may vary depending on whether&#xD;
      adipokines act directly on bone cells or through the central nervous system and between&#xD;
      cortical and trabecular compartments. Previous research is limited by the use of areal&#xD;
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans which may be inaccurate in obese populations due&#xD;
      to increased body thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of obesity on bone mineral density, bone&#xD;
      geometry, bone microarchitecture and bone strength of the hip, lumbar spine, distal radius&#xD;
      and tibia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, cross-sectional study of normal weight and obese individuals&#xD;
      matched by age, gender, height, postcode and smoking. The total number of subjects will be&#xD;
      240; men and premenopausal women ages 25 to 40 years and men and postmenopausal women ages 55&#xD;
      to 75 years. DXA, high-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT), quantitative&#xD;
      computed tomography (QCT) and finite element analysis will be used to assess bone structure&#xD;
      and strength. Biochemical markers of bone turnover and hormones related to bone metabolism&#xD;
      will also be measured in order to identify potential mediators of the effects of obesity on&#xD;
      bone structure and strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sub-study has been included to evaluate the interaction of fracture risk and cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk in obese and non-obese individuals. There is evidence of an interaction between bone&#xD;
      mineral density (BMD) and cardiovascular risk and test the hypothesis that there are common&#xD;
      pathways linking BMD and cardiovascular risk, including fat secretion of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines e.g. interleukin-1 and adipokines e.g. leptin and adiponectin. Ultrasound based&#xD;
      assessments of vascular function will be used to assess cardiac risk and relate these&#xD;
      measures to bone density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese individuals have lower circulating levels of 25OHD. This may be due to poor nutritional&#xD;
      intake, reduced sunlight exposure or the vitamin D being stored in fat tissue. The&#xD;
      investigators will measure levels of 25OHD in lean, overweight and obese men and women to&#xD;
      examine whether 25(OH)D is related to age or gender and whether low 25OHD in obesity affects&#xD;
      bone health in subsets of lean, overweight and obese participants of different ages.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, observational, cross-sectional, case-controlled study to determine&#xD;
      the effects of obesity on bone structure and strength. Cases will be obese individuals and&#xD;
      controls will be lean individuals. Overweight individuals will increase the applicability of&#xD;
      the vitamin D sub-study to the general population. Cases will be individually matched to&#xD;
      controls by gender, age, height, first part of postcode (e.g. S5, S10) and smoking, listed in&#xD;
      order of priority. Individually matched controls will reduce the influence of potential&#xD;
      confounding factors on the data collected. Blinding is not applicable to this study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants aged 25-40 years will attend for two visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 - Consent, questionnaire, anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist-to-hip&#xD;
      ratio (WHR), triceps skinfold), tympanic temperature, blood sampling, neuromuscular function&#xD;
      tests (chair stand test, narrow walk test and grip strength) Visit 2 - Anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements (height, weight), pregnancy test, measurement of supine abdominal thickness, hip&#xD;
      width measurement, DXA (whole body, spine, hip), HR-pQCT (tibia, radius), QCT (spine and&#xD;
      hip).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants aged 55-75 years will attend for three visits; visits 1 and 2 as for the younger&#xD;
      participants, and an additional visit to form the cardiovascular sub-study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 - Anthropometric measurements (height, weight), blood pressure, cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      measurements (abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), flow mediated dilatation (FMD), carotid&#xD;
      intima-media thickness (CIMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and ABPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the seasonality of vitamin D levels, the vitamin D sub-study must be completed in the&#xD;
      summer months. Participants who have completed the main study prior to August 2012 and have&#xD;
      given their consent to be contacted regarding future research will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in the vitamin D sub-study by telephone and subsequently sent written information about the&#xD;
      vitamin D sub-study. Volunteers will be invited to attend for one additional visit between&#xD;
      August 2012 and October 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future participants (those yet to consent to taking part in the main study) will be invited&#xD;
      to participate in the vitamin D sub-study prior to consenting to the main study. As vitamin D&#xD;
      levels are affected by seasonality, the substudy components can be completed at visit 1 of&#xD;
      the main study for participants who attend for their first study visit between August 2012&#xD;
      and October 2012. However, participants attending for visit 1 of the main study between&#xD;
      October 2012 and April 2013 will be invited to attend for an additional visit to complete the&#xD;
      vitamin D sub-study in summer/autumn 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the vitamin D sub-study will require a small blood sample to be taken and&#xD;
      the completion of diet and sun exposure questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of obesity on bone structure will be determined by comparing the measures of BMD,&#xD;
      bone microarchitecture and geometry in the obese study group with the lean group. The effects&#xD;
      of obesity on bone strength will be determined using Finite element analysis (FEA). Outcomes&#xD;
      from the neuromuscular function tests will be compared between the lean and obese groups to&#xD;
      determine the effect of obesity on lower extremity strength, balance, coordination and&#xD;
      flexibility. Hormones and bone turnover markers will be compared in lean and obese&#xD;
      participants and any associations between hormones and bone turnover markers and measures of&#xD;
      bone structure and strength will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between cardiovascular risk and BMD will be assessed by comparing the&#xD;
      measures of FMD, CIMT, PWV, AAC and ABPI in the obese sub-study group with the lean sub-study&#xD;
      group. The interactions between cardiovascular risk and fracture risk will be studies using&#xD;
      the surrogate imaging for atherosclerosis risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons of the levels of hormones, inflammatory markers and other biochemical factors&#xD;
      will be made between the lean and obese participants and tests will be made for associations&#xD;
      between these measures and measures of cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome in the main study will be mean difference in hip BMD between obese and&#xD;
      lean individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be mean difference in cross-sectional moment of inertia, cortical and&#xD;
      trabecular BMD, bone microarchitecture and geometry and neuromuscular function between lean&#xD;
      and obese individuals, association between BMD and cardiovascular risk and association&#xD;
      between body weight and circulating 25(OH)D.&#xD;
