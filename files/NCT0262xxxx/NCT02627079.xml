    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study will develop and test feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an&#xD;
      exercise motivation intervention using a 12-week smartphone-text messaging program tailored&#xD;
      to physical activity data retrieved from a Fitbit. Target population is 15 cancer survivors&#xD;
      and 15 patients actively undergoing cancer treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer survivors have substantial residual cardiometabolic risk due to the fact that they are&#xD;
      living longer and are exposed to the same lifestyle and environmental factors that have led&#xD;
      to the drastic increase in obesity and diabetes in Western societies over the last four&#xD;
      decades. In addition, survivors' cardiovascular health is significantly impaired due to&#xD;
      cancer treatment. Research has shown that physical activity improves quality of life in&#xD;
      cancer survivors, ameliorates treatment-related side effects reduces the risk of cancer&#xD;
      recurrence, and extends overall survival. Despite these advantages, most cancer patients are&#xD;
      sedentary. The early survivor period is a teachable moment to improve healthy behaviors.&#xD;
      Social Cognitive Theory argues that to change exercise behavior, we must increase behavior&#xD;
      change self-efficacy of participants (i.e., confidence), increase their outcome expectations&#xD;
      that changing their behavior will lead to better health, enhance motivation to exercise,&#xD;
      enhance their ability to regulate their behavior (self-regulation), teach them tangible&#xD;
      behavior change skills, and help them overcome barriers to behavior change. In this study&#xD;
      validated patient-reported outcomes will be performed at baseline and at 12 weeks - FACIT-F&#xD;
      to document general cancer symptoms with additional questions on fatigue, the Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory (BDI-II), and the modified Godin-Leisure Questionnaire as a measure of activity&#xD;
      level. The investigators will also perform baseline and 3 month weight / BMI and 6-minute&#xD;
      walk testing as a second well-validated objective measure of fitness. At enrollment and at 3&#xD;
      months, patients will be queried as to barriers to behavior change. At 3 months, patients&#xD;
      will be asked by 5-point Likert scale how helpful the program was in increasing their&#xD;
      physical activity. Six months after enrollment (+/- 4 weeks), level of physical activity and&#xD;
      use of Fitbit will be determined.&#xD;
