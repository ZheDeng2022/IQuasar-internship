  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to determine the effect of prophylactic treatment with&#xD;
      brimonidine/timolol fixed combination (Combigan®, Allergan; Dublin, IRL) or placebo therapy&#xD;
      (Refresh tears®, Allergan; Dublin, IRL) on long-term IOP measurements in patients receiving&#xD;
      serial intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg ranibizumab (0.05 mL) with six months follow-up.&#xD;
      Intraocular pressure measurements will be correlated with changes on ancillary testing&#xD;
      (Humphrey 24-2 visual field testing and optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the optic nerve&#xD;
      head (ONH). Our study would be the first large, prospective, randomized double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial to examine the relationship between anti-vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF) therapy and sustained ocular hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recent introduction of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents has&#xD;
      quickly progressed to become the standard of care for several ocular diseases. Between 2006&#xD;
      and 2010, anti-VEGF treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was&#xD;
      initiated in over 620 000 eyes of Medicare beneficiaries in the United States. This paradigm&#xD;
      shift in retinal therapy stems from evidence that VEGF regulates angiogenesis and vascular&#xD;
      permeability, processes which characterize the pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy and&#xD;
      AMD. Several large multicenter, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that patients&#xD;
      with neovascular AMD and clinically significant macular edema (CSME) benefit from frequent&#xD;
      intravitreal anti-VEGF injections, particularly with ranibizumab . Ranibizumab is a humanized&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody Fab fragment (IgG1) that inhibits all identified VEGF isoforms, including&#xD;
      VEGF165, VEGF121 and VEGF110.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rigorous study has consistently demonstrated a good relative safety profile for anti-VEGF&#xD;
      agents. While transient rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) is a known effect immediately&#xD;
      following intravitreal injection (IVI), sustained IOP elevation was not initially reported in&#xD;
      patients undergoing anti-VEGF therapy. It was not until post-hoc analysis of the MARINA ,&#xD;
      ANCHOR AND VIEW trials that a significant long-term effect on IOP from ranibizumab was&#xD;
      detected. However, there are increasing reports in the literature documenting this&#xD;
      phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bakri et al. reported a case series of ocular hypertension (OHT) (IOP ranging 30 - 50 mm Hg)&#xD;
      after 0.05 mL intravitreal ranibizumab, which persisted and required treatment. Kahook et al.&#xD;
      published a case series of six patients undergoing anti-VEGF therapy who developed persistent&#xD;
      OHT, two of whom had a prior diagnosis of glaucoma/glaucoma suspect. In a larger,&#xD;
      retrospective review of 215 patients being treated with IVI by Good et al., 6% of patients&#xD;
      required medical or laser treatment for sustained IOP elevation. Subgroup analysis revealed&#xD;
      that patients with a history of glaucoma had a substantially higher likelihood of&#xD;
      experiencing sustained IOP elevation, despite a lower median number of IVI than the&#xD;
      non-glaucoma group. In a retrospective study by Choi et al. , seven of 127 patients (5.5%)&#xD;
      developed sustained OHT in the study eye, whereas the fellow eye demonstrated stable IOP. Two&#xD;
      other large retrospective series have reported similar incidence of persistent IOP elevation,&#xD;
      and review of the literature reveals an incidence of 3.45% to 11.6% in patients with&#xD;
      neovascular AMD. Post-hoc analysis of a large, multi-center randomized clinical trial for&#xD;
      treatment of diabetic CSME found the ranibizumab group had a 3-fold increased risk of&#xD;
      sustained IOP elevation at 3 years compared to the sham-injection group. This study did not&#xD;
      enroll patients with a history of glaucoma/glaucoma suspect, thus could not define their risk&#xD;
      ratio. A prospective study of 217 eyes undergoing anti-VEGF IVI found that persistent IOP&#xD;
      elevation was a frequent outcome, and that the IOP peak was significantly correlated with the&#xD;
      number of injections. Further, patients with prior diagnosis of glaucoma/glaucoma suspect had&#xD;
      an incidence of 12.9% of sustained OHT, compared with 3.2% in the non-glaucoma subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of persistent ocular hypertension has not yet been elucidated, but may be&#xD;
      secondary to chemical damage to the trabecular meshwork from the anti-VEGF agents themselves,&#xD;
      or mechanically by micro-particle obstruction. Some studies indicate that the number of IVI&#xD;
      is an independent risk factor for the development of long-term ocular hypertension , and that&#xD;
      patients with pre-existing glaucoma are particularly vulnerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transient IOP elevation following anti-VEGF injection has been noted at 30 minutes&#xD;
      post-injection and rarely requires anterior chamber paracentesis for treatment . Though this&#xD;
      rise in IOP elevation is expected to return to baseline by 1-hour post-IVI, the long-term&#xD;
      consequences of this phenomenon are unknown. One proposed mechanism for this transient effect&#xD;
      on IOP is increased volume of intraocular contents after injection . Gismondi et al found a&#xD;
      significant relationship between shorter axial length and higher transient IOP following&#xD;
      intravitreal ranibizumab. One group designed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of preventative treatment for this short-term rise in IOP. Brimonidine/timolol fixed&#xD;
      combination (Combigan®, Allergan; Dublin, IRL) was administered twice a day on the day prior&#xD;
      to injection and on the day of treatment, and reduced the rapid increase in post-injection&#xD;
      IOP in a safe and effective manner. However, this study did not evaluate the incidence of&#xD;
      persistent OHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As IOP elevation is strongly linked with the development of glaucoma, this potential outcome&#xD;
      in patients undergoing anti-VEGF therapy warrants attention. The data published on this topic&#xD;
      to date is primarily comprised of retrospective chart reviews, case series, and post-hoc&#xD;
      analysis of the MARINA, ANCHOR and Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network 2010 and&#xD;
      VIEW trials. Many studies reveal inconsistent methodology in terms of IOP measurement and IVI&#xD;
      technique. Ultimately, there is no consensus on which factors may predispose patients to the&#xD;
      development of iatrogenic IOP elevation following anti-VEGF therapy. Further, prophylactic&#xD;
      treatment for sustained OHT has not been prospectively studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no guidelines for IOP monitoring in patients undergoing anti-VEGF&#xD;
      therapy. Our study aims to define a treatment algorithm for the monitoring and prophylaxis of&#xD;
      anti-VEGF-related iatrogenic ocular hypertension. This may also shed some light into the&#xD;
      possible mechanism of post-injection IOP spike. Further, our research may help identify a&#xD;
      subgroup of patients vulnerable to long-term sequelae as a result of this phenomenon.&#xD;
