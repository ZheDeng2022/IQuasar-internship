    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of radiation therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, or cancer that has&#xD;
      spread from the original (primary) tumor to the liver who also have impaired liver function&#xD;
      (liver damage caused by cirrhosis, chemotherapy, or surgery). Radiation therapy (RT) uses&#xD;
      high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. New methods of giving RT to the&#xD;
      liver may help control cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of high dose radiotherapy in patients who have liver tumors&#xD;
      (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]/cholangiocarcinoma/liver metastases from any primary) and who&#xD;
      have impaired liver function or low functional liver volume or who have received prior liver&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate 2 year local control with radiotherapy in these patients. II. To evaluate&#xD;
      tumor response, patterns of failure, and survival in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate imaging- and serum-based biomarkers in these patients, as correlates of&#xD;
      hepatic toxicity and tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week for a total of 15 or 25 fractions in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-8 weeks and then every 3-4&#xD;
      months for 2 years. Patients who progress during the two year follow-up period are followed&#xD;
      up every 6 months.&#xD;
