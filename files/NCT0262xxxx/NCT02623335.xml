      The investigators will perform a multi-site cluster randomized trial that uses a&#xD;
      stepped-wedged design to compare the effectiveness of a Question Prompt List (QPL)&#xD;
      intervention to usual care for patients considering high-risk vascular (peripheral, cardiac,&#xD;
      neuro) and oncologic operations. This 24-month study will use a time-dependent cluster&#xD;
      randomization plan within each of the five study sites: the investigators will randomly&#xD;
      assign time points for surgeons who perform high risk operations to cross over from usual&#xD;
      care to QPL intervention. Study staff will audiotape the conversation between the patient and&#xD;
      surgeon during one preoperative clinic visit; administer surveys to patients and family&#xD;
      members at 24 hours, 6 weeks and 12 weeks after that visit; and record surgical decisions,&#xD;
      treatments received and associated outcomes. The investigators will use stratified purposeful&#xD;
      sampling to identify a subset of patients in each study arm who have experienced serious&#xD;
      complications for qualitative interviews.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To answer the research question, &quot;Could a patient-driven approach that improves decision&#xD;
      making and informs postoperative expectations have more effectiveness than the current&#xD;
      surgeon-directed preoperative conversation?&quot; the investigators will conduct a multi-site&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of the question prompt list intervention (QPL) for high risk&#xD;
      surgery that will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the effectiveness of the intervention relative to usual care on the extent of&#xD;
           patient engagement in decision-making for high risk surgery. (Aim 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the effectiveness of the intervention relative to usual care on treatment choice&#xD;
           and on psychological well-being and post-treatment regret for patients and family&#xD;
           members. (Aim 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare the effectiveness of the intervention relative to usual care on interpersonal&#xD;
           and intrapersonal conflict relating to treatment decisions and subsequent treatments&#xD;
           received. (Aim 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goals of the study are to help patients and families:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. make treatment decisions aligned with their values and goals;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. anticipate and make sense of postoperative outcomes; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. experience less postoperative conflict about treatment of serious complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled surgeons will be grouped based on self-report of their clinic practices. &quot;Visit 1&#xD;
      Surgeons&quot; typically have a treatment decision making conversation with patients at their&#xD;
      initial new patient consult. For enrolled patients of these surgeons, we will audio-record&#xD;
      their first consult visit. &quot;Visit 2 Surgeons&quot; typically do not have treatment decision making&#xD;
      discussions at the initial visit- this discussion is generally delayed until a follow up&#xD;
      appointment, after additional testing or review of medical records. The return/second visit&#xD;
      of enrolled patients under the care of Visit 2 Surgeons will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a surgeon is in the usual care arm, patients will receive the current standard for&#xD;
      surgical decision-making. Once an enrolled surgeon has crossed into the intervention arm, the&#xD;
      research team will mail the QPL intervention to all of the surgeon's new consult patients&#xD;
      (for Visit 1 Surgeons) or returning/2nd consult patients (for Visit 2 Surgeons) about a week&#xD;
      prior to their scheduled consultation, regardless of study eligibility. The QPL intervention&#xD;
      includes the QPL intervention brochure, plus a letter from the surgeon encouraging its use&#xD;
      during the upcoming office visit. Eligible patients will be identified by clinic staff and&#xD;
      interested patients will be approached once they arrive in clinic (they will not receive&#xD;
      information about the study prior to their clinic appointment because this information could&#xD;
      interfere with the QPL intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the usual care arm will receive the current standard for surgical&#xD;
      decision-making. The investigators have observed that usual care includes informed consent&#xD;
      and a surgeon-directed deliberative phase in which surgeons present their own evaluation of&#xD;
      the trade-offs and goals of the proposed intervention. Although this deliberation occurs in&#xD;
      front of patients and families, assumptions about the value of specific outcomes are&#xD;
      surgeon-generated and not specifically linked to patient preferences. For these reasons, the&#xD;
      investigators believe comparing the intervention to usual care is suitable. In addition,&#xD;
      question prompt lists are currently available online and are not distributed by the surgeon.&#xD;
      Patients can obtain and use the lists if they so choose on their own (although most do not).&#xD;
      Additionally, question prompt lists have been shown to be safe and effective in previous&#xD;
      studies in similar but not identical clinical situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeons will be randomly assigned within each site to change from usual care to the QPL&#xD;
      intervention at different study wave time points. Prior to study start the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct step-wise randomization using a computer-generated randomization schedule to&#xD;
      determine the crossover wave timing among surgeons. Surgeon cross-over from usual care to&#xD;
      intervention will occur in one direction only and each within-site change will occur once&#xD;
      every four months. Surgical clinics will be contacted one month prior to intervention&#xD;
      implementation to confirm and execute implementation processes and to start mailing the QPL&#xD;
      intervention to patients with office visits scheduled on or after the first day of&#xD;
      intervention transition. A 2-week hiatus in data collection at the start of the cross over&#xD;
      will be instituted in the transition clinics to ensure patients in the intervention group&#xD;
      have had the opportunity to receive the intervention mailing. Surgeons who have crossed over&#xD;
      to the intervention group will be notified when the QPL intervention has been implemented in&#xD;
      their clinic and will be encouraged with bi-weekly email or text reminders to support patient&#xD;
      use of the question list during clinical encounters with patients discussing surgical&#xD;
      treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in both the usual care and intervention arms: Surgeons who perform high risk&#xD;
      operations and have agreed to participate will help to identify new or returning patients&#xD;
      (depending on their previously reported practice pattern) coming to an outpatient visit to&#xD;
      discuss a major surgical procedure. If a patient consents to the study, study staff will&#xD;
      audio record one conversation (T0) between the attending surgeon and patient and accompanying&#xD;
      family member. Study staff will meet with the patient prior to starting the audio recording&#xD;
      to obtain consent. If there is a family member present at the appointment and he or she would&#xD;
      like to participate in study activities, study staff will obtain consent from them as well.&#xD;
      If a resident/surgical trainee or additional family members and caretakers are present, study&#xD;
      staff will obtain verbal permission to audio record the resident and all others present.&#xD;
      Study staff will wait until the surgeon enters the room and then turn on the digital audio&#xD;
      recorder. Once the audio recorder has been turned on, the research team member will leave the&#xD;
      room and return once the meeting between the patient and surgeon is complete to terminate and&#xD;
      collect the audio recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will conduct follow-up phone calls to administer surveys to the patient and&#xD;
      family member (if they have enrolled) within 12-72 hours of the patient's audio-recorded&#xD;
      treatment decision-making visit (T1). After the visit with the surgeon, the patient's&#xD;
      treatment plan will be determined by chart review and confirmed with the surgeon or clinic&#xD;
      nurse. Administration of the second and third surveys (T2 and T3) will be linked to the&#xD;
      patient's treatment plan. For patients who are scheduled for surgery, surveys will be&#xD;
      administered via telephone to the patient and family member 1-2 (T2) weeks after surgery and&#xD;
      6-8 (T3) weeks after surgery. Based on previous study in this patient population and clinical&#xD;
      setting, the median time between the patient's preoperative visit with the surgeon and&#xD;
      surgery is 31 days. If the patient is unable to participate in study activities, enrolled&#xD;
      family members will still be asked to complete study activities. Patients who did not have a&#xD;
      family member enroll along with them and who are unable to participate in study activities&#xD;
      post-operatively will be considered lost to follow up. For patients who have non-operative&#xD;
      treatment; e.g., medical treatment (chemotherapy, pulmonary rehab) or observation (active&#xD;
      surveillance, no surgical procedure scheduled), study staff will administer surveys between 6&#xD;
      and 8 weeks (T2) and again between 12 and 14 (T3) weeks after the patient's audio-recorded&#xD;
      treatment decision-making visit with the surgeon. This will roughly approximate the time&#xD;
      frame for study activities for patients who have surgery. Patients and family members will&#xD;
      also be allowed to complete follow up surveys (T2 and T3) by web survey or mail, if they&#xD;
      prefer, though phone surveys will likely be the primary data collection method, based on&#xD;
      prior research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients of Visit 1 Surgeons will need additional testing (CT scan, PET scan, stress&#xD;
      test) before a treatment decision can be made. These patients and their family members will&#xD;
      complete the initial study activities (audio recording of the initial visit with a surgeon&#xD;
      (T0) and survey at 12-72 hours (T1)). Study staff will not audio record a second (return)&#xD;
      visit with the surgeon or repeat the post visit survey (T1). The second and third surveys&#xD;
      will be linked to the treatment decision after this second interaction with the surgeon: T2:&#xD;
      1-2 weeks postoperatively and T3: 6-8 weeks postoperatively, or T2: 6-8 and T3:12-14 weeks&#xD;
      after the second interaction with the surgeon for those who have non-operative treatment. In&#xD;
      some cases surgeons will telephone the patient after additional testing to develop a&#xD;
      treatment plan. Study staff will not audio record this interaction. Study staff will use&#xD;
      careful chart review and communication with the surgeon and/or his/her clinical staff for&#xD;
      these patients to accurately target the timing of subsequent study activities. After the&#xD;
      final survey is completed study staff will use chart abstraction to identify and record&#xD;
      treatments received and postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will use chart review immediately after the patient meets with the surgeon (T0)&#xD;
      and again after the final survey (T3) has been completed to record clinical data, treatments&#xD;
      received and outcomes of treatment. Study staff will also screen charts of enrolled patients&#xD;
      weekly in order to confirm treatment plan which may be unclear at the time of their&#xD;
      audio-recorded treatment decision-making visit and is critically important to timing of&#xD;
      subsequent data collection. Data collected will be limited to clinical information pertaining&#xD;
      to surgical care from audio-recorded treatment decision-making visit through to&#xD;
      administration of the final survey (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate Aim 3, the investigators will use a qualitative study design to compare&#xD;
      interpersonal and intrapersonal conflict between study arms as it relates to the phenomenon&#xD;
      of surgical buy in-when the surgeon believes that the patient has agreed to the operative&#xD;
      procedure as well as all possible postoperative care. Conflict between surgeons and patients&#xD;
      and/or family members about additional invasive procedures occurs in the uncommon setting of&#xD;
      serious postoperative complications but may be affected by the QPL intervention, which&#xD;
      includes questions about &quot;What happens if things go wrong?&quot; and specific question prompts&#xD;
      about advance directives. Thus, investigators will use stratified purposeful sampling to&#xD;
      identify a subset of patients who have experienced serious postoperative complications in&#xD;
      each study arm, as determined by chart review. Serious complications include prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization (more than 8 days postoperatively), prolonged length of stay in intensive&#xD;
      care (greater than 3 days), prolonged mechanical ventilation, myocardial infarction, major&#xD;
      cerebrovascular accident, new onset dialysis or death. Study staff will use chart review at&#xD;
      T3 (12-14 weeks, roughly 6 weeks after surgery) to identify patients who have had serious&#xD;
      complications and ask them and/or their family members to participate in a face-to-face&#xD;
      qualitative interview. The investigators are planning for 3-7 interviews at each study site&#xD;
      and anticipate no more than 10 at each site. Not all patients who consent to Aims 1 and 2 of&#xD;
      the study will participate in Aim 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients and family members who agree to be interviewed, a trained Qualitative&#xD;
      Interviewer will conduct the interview. The interviewer will meet the patient and family&#xD;
      member at a convenient and private location of their choosing for an in-person interview.&#xD;
      Patients and family members will have the choice to conduct the interview jointly or&#xD;
      separately. Study investigators have employed this technique in previous studies and&#xD;
      successfully interviewed study participants and family members in their homes or at the&#xD;
      medical center in a private room at the time of a follow up medical appointment. Interviews&#xD;
      will generally not be conducted over the telephone as this limits the ability of the&#xD;
      interviewer to respond to non-verbal cues. Interviews will last up to one hour.&#xD;

        <title>Patient Engagement in Decision Making Measured by Clinic Visit Transcript Coding for Number of and Types of Questions Raised</title>
        <description>Patient engagement in decision making was measured by coding the transcript for the patient's clinic visit, using a pre-defined coding scheme that focused on the number and types of questions raised in the audio-recorded treatment decision-making visit. The types of questions that were coded were options questions, expectations questions, risks questions and advance directive questions.</description>
