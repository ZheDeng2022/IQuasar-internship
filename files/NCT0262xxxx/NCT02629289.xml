  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for healthy participants. This study tests single dose of the research drug&#xD;
      HSP-130 against two existing approved drugs United States - approved Neulasta and European&#xD;
      Union-approved Neulasta.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 25 healthy participants in each of the six sequence groups. A total of 150&#xD;
      participants will be studied in one site in Australia. In addition to the 150 participants&#xD;
      included, alternate subjects will be asked to come to the site on the day prior to when&#xD;
      dosing is scheduled to begin. There will be 3 treatment options with 3 study dosing periods&#xD;
      (1, 2 and 3) and at least 56 days between each treatment. The subject once asked to take part&#xD;
      in the study will be assigned by chance (randomized) to one of the sequence groups as&#xD;
      mentioned above (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).&#xD;
