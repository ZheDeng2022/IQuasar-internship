  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the anti-inflammatory effect of high-dose&#xD;
      riboflavin supplementation on chronic plaque psoriasis. Psoriasis is a common chronic skin&#xD;
      disorder that affects over 4 million people. There is no cure for psoriasis and treatment is&#xD;
      directed at controlling patients' symptoms. Amongst patients with skin disease, there is&#xD;
      significant interest in using complementary alternative medicine and vitamins to treat their&#xD;
      disease. Previous human case reports suggest that riboflavin, commonly known as Vitamin B2,&#xD;
      is clinically effective for the treatment of psoriasis; however, they were not conclusive.&#xD;
      More recent human trials have shown that 400 mg of daily oral riboflavin is a safe and&#xD;
      well-tolerated medication to administer to humans. For the purpose of this study, the&#xD;
      riboflavin is used as an investigational drug.&#xD;

      The purpose of this investigation is to determine the anti-inflammatory effect of high-dose&#xD;
      riboflavin supplementation on chronic plaque psoriasis. Up to fifty volunteers with chronic&#xD;
      plaque psoriasis will be recruited for a double-blind, placebo-controlled 28 week prospective&#xD;
      study with cross-over of both the intervention and control groups at the 12 week time mark.&#xD;
      There will be a 4 week washout period when subjects crossover. Riboflavin will be dosed 400&#xD;
      mg by mouth daily versus placebo. Throughout the study the investigators will perform both&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory assessments to measure response.&#xD;
