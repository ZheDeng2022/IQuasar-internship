  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture surgery is a major world health care burden and concern, as it has a large and&#xD;
      increasing prevalence and carries very high patient mortality, disability and community&#xD;
      health care cost. As the commonest cause of mortality is from cardiac complications, and&#xD;
      cardiac disease is prevalent and frequently missed by standard care, we hypothesise that&#xD;
      earlier and more accurate diagnosis and treatment of cardiac pathology in this cohort will&#xD;
      lead to improved outcome. Focused cardiac ultrasound (FCU) is a new increasingly popular&#xD;
      technique used by doctors that enables earlier and more accurate diagnosis of cardiac&#xD;
      disorders that can be performed routinely before hip fracture surgery. Our preliminary data&#xD;
      of 64 patients demonstrated that routine FCU before surgery lead to a change in cardiac&#xD;
      diagnosis and management in 50% of patients requiring hip fracture surgery, which was&#xD;
      associated with a 50% reduction in mortality 12 months after surgery compared with controls.&#xD;
      It is therefore important for a large randomised trial to be performed to confirm or rebuke&#xD;
      these findings, as if true, would have a very large impact on health care and may also&#xD;
      improve health care and outcome in other high-risk surgical populations. The proposed pilot&#xD;
      study is a pilot study which aims to establish feasibility, safety, compliance and group&#xD;
      separation prior to commencing a definitive multicentre trial.&#xD;

      Aims and Hypotheses Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether routine preoperative focused cardiac ultrasound (FCU) leads to a&#xD;
           reduced composite outcome of death, major adverse cardiac events, and acute renal&#xD;
           failure (adverse composite outcome) 30 days after hip fracture surgery compared to&#xD;
           patients who do not receive preoperative FCU (current standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify the changes in team management of the patient due to FCU that are associated&#xD;
           with improved outcome, compared to current standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether routine preoperative FCU is more cost-effective than current&#xD;
           standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. FCU reduces adverse composite outcome by at least 20%, 30 days after hip fracture&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. FCU leads to changes in cardiac diagnosis, and subsequent changes to perioperative and&#xD;
           post-discharge management plans, which are associated with improved outcome compared to&#xD;
           current standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Routine FCU before hip fracture surgery is more cost-effective than current standard of&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying cardiovascular disease: Preoperative cardiac assessment, which enables improved&#xD;
      cardiac treatment and reduction of cardiac complications, is recommended by the American&#xD;
      Heart Association. However, cardiovascular disease is often unrecognised and under-diagnosed&#xD;
      in this age group because of frailty, general immobility, and the high frequency of poor&#xD;
      cognitive function including dementia, which inhibits accurate clinical assessment. Careful&#xD;
      cardiac assessment and treatment is often not undertaken because of the belief that surgery&#xD;
      should be performed urgently and a delay for cardiac investigations may worsen outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac risk factors for death after hip fracture surgery (cardiac failure, aortic stenosis,&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy) cannot be reliably diagnosed with&#xD;
      clinical examination and require echocardiography (FCU or transthoracic echocardiography&#xD;
      (TTE)). Although a pulmonary embolus cannot be reliably diagnosed with echocardiography, the&#xD;
      haemodynamic effects from a significant pulmonary embolus are readily seen (right ventricular&#xD;
      dilatation and failure). Currently, preoperative TTE is only used in selected patients, based&#xD;
      on the clinical assessment and the opinion of the clinician as to whether it is justified. If&#xD;
      the anaesthetist reviews the patient just prior to surgery and is concerned about&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, there is a lot of pressure to proceed with booked surgery due to the&#xD;
      current belief that early surgery saves lives, rather than to delay surgery for a TTE.&#xD;
      Treatment is therefore often based on &quot;best guess&quot; clinical assessment. This management&#xD;
      approach may lead to inadequate treatment with resultant hypotension, leading to organ&#xD;
      failure and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focused Cardiac Ultrasound (FCU): The conventional TTE investigation is ordered by the&#xD;
      treating doctor, performed by a technician and reported by a cardiologist or radiologist at a&#xD;
      later time. The TTE provides detailed information on structure and function of all of the&#xD;
      valves and chambers and is also referred to as diagnostic echocardiography. A TTE or other&#xD;
      complex cardiovascular investigation leads to delay, as the process of obtaining a TTE and&#xD;
      then waiting for the report may take days depending on resource availability. Any&#xD;
      echocardiography examination is a &quot;snapshot&quot; in time, and heart function can change between&#xD;
      the performance of the TTE and the commencement of surgery. A FCU utilises the same&#xD;
      echocardiography techniques as conventional TTE but is performed as a bedside test by the&#xD;
      treating doctor to answer a clinical question to aid clinical decision-making in real time.&#xD;
      It provides specific information relevant to perioperative care in time for acute&#xD;
      resuscitation and potentially life-saving decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A type of FCU, iHeartScanTM , that is specifically designed for critical and perioperative&#xD;
      care has been developed by the Ultrasound Education Group at The University of Melbourne. FCU&#xD;
      has been confirmed to be as accurate as comprehensive TTE for purposes of acute clinical&#xD;
      care. FCU has been endorsed by The American Society of Echocardiography and embraced by the&#xD;
      critical care community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The case for equipoise: The conventional approach to proceed to early surgery without delay&#xD;
      for cardiovascular investigations is contrary to the proof-of-concept data that preoperative&#xD;
      FCU may reduce mortality through the provision of better cardiovascular diagnostic&#xD;
      information, leading to management changes. The use of conventional TTE, however, causes&#xD;
      considerable delay to surgery, which may increase mortality risk. FCU has the advantage of&#xD;
      providing improved diagnosis without causing substantial delay to surgery, and can therefore&#xD;
      is additive to rather than competitive with current &quot;best practice&quot;. An economic analysis of&#xD;
      routine FCU has not been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility of the trial - the ECHONOF II trial In the preliminary study, feasibility of&#xD;
      routine FCU in hip fracture surgery was demonstrated, with more than one patient per week at&#xD;
      one centre. To determine feasibility of the proposed outcome randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) a pilot study of feasibility, safety, protocol compliance and group separation will be&#xD;
      conducted in 2016 at 4-5 sites across Australia, with the lead site at Royal Melbourne&#xD;
      Hospital. The pilot study analysis will include patients recruited who have 30-day data&#xD;
      available a in 2016, though data will continue to be collected out to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study protocol will be the same as the proposed (future) definitive clinical trial&#xD;
      , but the endpoints are aimed at assessing feasibility and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feasibility outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. the number of patients screened: recruited ratio &lt; 4:1&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. recruitment rate of 1 patient/week/centre&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. No harm to patients from performing FCU&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. No surgical delay &gt; 1 hour by waiting for FCU to be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Protocol Compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. FCU performed &lt; 24 hrs. of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Treating team notified of FCU result&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Follow up at all time points (unless death)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Incidence of comprehensive TTE in standard group before and after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Adverse complications adjudication performed by the adjudication committee&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Group separation&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Completion of preoperative and actual perioperative management plans in both groups&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Analysis for difference in diagnosis and management between groups: aim &gt; 20%&#xD;
                difference between groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research protocol Trial Design: A parallel group, randomised controlled, multicentre trial&#xD;
      with 1:1 allocation ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Patients presenting with isolated, primary, non-metastatic fractured neck of&#xD;
      femur, where surgery is expected within 48 hours after hospital admission will be recruited.&#xD;
      Patients with prior hip surgery on the affected side, or where the cause is likely to be due&#xD;
      to metastatic cancer, or where survival is unlikely in the 24 hours from admission will not&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings and Locations: teaching and regional hospitals in Australia with a high volume of&#xD;
      hip fracture surgery and the necessary equipment and expertise to perform FCU have agreed to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants randomised to the FCU group will receive a preoperative FCU&#xD;
      performed by an independent operator within 24 hours of planned surgery, following The&#xD;
      University of Melbourne iHeartScanTM protocol. Patients randomised to the standard care group&#xD;
      will not undergo FCU before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no restrictions on the treating team in either group determining what management&#xD;
      they will employ, including anaesthesia technique, surgical management, perioperative care&#xD;
      and preoperative investigations including comprehensive TTE by the cardiology department.&#xD;
      However the treatment of patients will be recorded, allowing comparison of the effect of FCU&#xD;
      on diagnosis and management between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will represent the standard of care in each of the participating hospitals.&#xD;
      This typically includes early surgery with minimal preoperative investigations. Some&#xD;
      patients, however, based on the clinical assessment of their treating doctors, will have&#xD;
      additional investigations such as comprehensive TTE, which could result in changes in&#xD;
      management including an associated delay in surgery. This trial will not interfere with the&#xD;
      standard of care management, and, once recruited, patients will remain in the standard of&#xD;
      care group even if they receive comprehensive TTE or have delayed surgery. Treatment in both&#xD;
      groups will be according to individual and institutional practice, working with the&#xD;
      diagnostic information available at the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: Randomisation codes will be in blocks using a web-based automatic enrolment&#xD;
      system to participating institutions in order to facilitate recruitment across different time&#xD;
      zones and out-of-hours cases. Patients will be stratified to severity of surgery (hip&#xD;
      replacement/hemiarthroplasty, or femoral fixation) and institution (tertiary referral, or&#xD;
      non-tertiary metropolitan/ regional hospitals). The randomisation sequence will be generated&#xD;
      using a computer random sequence generator for each strata in blocks of 10 to ensure close&#xD;
      balance of the numbers in each group at any one time during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment and implementation: The allocation sequence will be concealed by the&#xD;
      web-based enrolment system. The site research staff will recruit patients and organise an in&#xD;
      dependent practitioner to perform FCU (or not). The independent practitioner will receive the&#xD;
      allocation and whether to perform FCU or not, and place the completed or blank FCU form in a&#xD;
      sealed envelope. The treating doctors will first complete a management plan before opening&#xD;
      the envelope to obtain the completed or blank FCU form. The FCU form will then be placed in a&#xD;
      second sealed envelope which is not opened until the allocation sequence is revealed. The&#xD;
      research staff who will collect outcome data are not involved in patient recruitment and will&#xD;
      therefore be blinded to group allocation. The central trial monitor who adjudicates outcomes&#xD;
      with the assistance of 2 clinicians are also blinded to allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods: The Statistical Consulting Group (University of Melbourne), supervised&#xD;
      by team statistician Dr Sandy Clarke,will advise and supervise statistical methods, data&#xD;
      management, integrity, security and analysis. The primary outcome will be compared between&#xD;
      FCU and control groups using binary logistic regression, with the control group as the&#xD;
      reference category. The survival times will be analysed using Cox proportional hazards&#xD;
      regression. A pre-determined sub-group analysis will separate those with and without an&#xD;
      existing TTE in the previous 12 months. Relative risk of death will be analysed using Cox&#xD;
      proportional hazard regression. Patterns of management and relative risk (of death) will be&#xD;
      compared between groups using a two-sample t-test including sub-group analysis of pathology&#xD;
      identified by FCU (e.g., hypovolaemia, cardiac failure and aortic stenosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trial coordination: The trial will be managed through the Department of Surgery, The&#xD;
      University of Melbourne. This will include all aspects of trial control, data collation, and&#xD;
      site co-ordination. An independent committee including a statistician, clinical trial&#xD;
      monitor, clinician, and member of the Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee will&#xD;
      oversee trial safety and data integrity. The committee will perform a planned, blinded&#xD;
      interim analysis, after 50% recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint adjudication committee An end point committee consisting of a trial monitor and 2&#xD;
      clinicians, blinded to treatment allocation, will be established to adjudicate the non-fatal&#xD;
      cardiovascular events at 6 monthly intervals. This committee will also advise on event rate,&#xD;
      (blinded) group separation, feasibility and stopping rules.&#xD;
