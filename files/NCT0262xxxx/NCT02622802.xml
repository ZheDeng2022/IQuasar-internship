      The most important guideline for drug prescription concerning pregnant women is 'drugs should&#xD;
      be given only if the maternal benefits outweigh the potential risk to the fetus'. However,&#xD;
      poor data is available on maternal drug disposition and transfer through the placenta, so the&#xD;
      evidence available for decision making in clinical practice is weak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ex-vivo placenta perfusion model will be used to explore the mechanisms governing&#xD;
      differences between fetal and maternal drug exposure. The expression of placental&#xD;
      transporters and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes will be investigated in primary placenta cell&#xD;
      culture and placental biopsies from different gestational stages to learn how the placental&#xD;
      drug transfer and disposition is regulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators choose to examine the transfer of paracetamol, erythromycin and&#xD;
      azithromycin because these drugs are commonly used in human pregnancies and have different&#xD;
      metabolic pathways.&#xD;

      1. Background While many drugs are administered to pregnant women, only poor data exist to&#xD;
           determine a therapeutically optimal and safe drug treatment in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The general advise on the use of medicines in pregnancy is that you can only prescribe&#xD;
           drugs to pregnant women if the benefits for the mother outweigh the risks for the fetus.&#xD;
           The problem is that for most medicines safety data are lacking. Most drug effects are&#xD;
           dose dependent. So the first step to examine potential fetotoxicity is to test&#xD;
           transplacental transfer of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Placental transfer from the maternal to the fetal side occurs primarily via passive&#xD;
           diffusion, the physicochemical properties of drugs such as lipid solubility, polarity&#xD;
           and molecular weight primarily determine the rate of transfer across the placenta.&#xD;
           According to membrane permeability properties, low-molecular-weight, lipid-soluble,&#xD;
           unbound and unionized compounds can easily cross the human placenta. In addition, some&#xD;
           drugs are pumped across the placenta by various active transporters located on both the&#xD;
           fetal and maternal side of the trophoblast layer. The most important transporters are&#xD;
           P-glycoprotein (P-gp, encoded by the multidrug resistance (MDR)1 gene), Breast cancer&#xD;
           resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 1-3 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The transfer of foreign chemicals across the placenta can also be modified by metabolism&#xD;
           in the placenta itself. The human placenta contains multiple enzyme systems, like CYP2E1&#xD;
           and CYP3A4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim &amp; methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine fetal drug concentrations of paracetamol, erythromycin&#xD;
      and azithromycin by transplacental transport in an ex-vivo placenta perfusion model.&#xD;
      Simultaneously collected maternal and fetal drug plasma levels will be compared to assess&#xD;
      fetal drug levels based on maternal drug plasma levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the transporter and metabolizing activity of the trophoblast cells will be examined&#xD;
      in a primary human trophoblast culture, and expression of enzymes and transporters will be&#xD;
      evaluated at different gestational ages in human placenta biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medicines: The investigators choose to examine the transfer of paracetamol, erythromycin and&#xD;
      azithromycin because these drugs are commonly used in human pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the ORACLE trial, erythromycin is in Belgium the first choice treatment in patients&#xD;
      with preterm rupture of membranes, despite the fact that the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this&#xD;
      drug has been hardly studied in pregnant women. Erythromycin is unstable under acidic&#xD;
      conditions while azithromycin is a semi-synthetic macrolide, with a better gastro-intestinal&#xD;
      tolerability and tissue penetration than erythromycin and an excellent activity against&#xD;
      sexually transmitted pathogens, especially Chlamydia trachomatis. Because of these&#xD;
      characteristics more physicians start to switch to azithromycin even without PK data&#xD;
      available in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is used as first choice painkiller in pregnancy, but also for&#xD;
      this drug surprisingly few PK data are available.&#xD;
