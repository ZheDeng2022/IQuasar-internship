  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular endothelial growth factor is expressed in gastric cancer, and expression has been&#xD;
      associated with more aggressive clinical disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      expression has been noted in 51% of gastric cancer specimens in one series (versus no&#xD;
      expression in normal epithelium or superficial gastritis). Vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      expression in resected gastric cancer is associated with tumor recurrence and shorter&#xD;
      survival. Maeda et al. studied 95 gastric cancer patients following resection with curative&#xD;
      intent, and noted a significantly shorter survival in 34 patients whose tumor endothelium&#xD;
      expressed VEGF (as detected via immunohistochemistry) versus 61 patients without endothelial&#xD;
      VEGF expression (p&lt;0.05). Yoshikawa and colleagues observed similar survival differences in&#xD;
      resected gastric cancer patients based on levels of circulating (plasma) VEGF at time of&#xD;
      resection. Circulating VEGF is significantly higher in gastric cancer patients versus those&#xD;
      without neoplasia. Elevated circulating VEGF was also associated with shorter survival in a&#xD;
      European cohort undergoing gastric cancer resection; there was no survival beyond 30 months&#xD;
      in 24 patients with serum VEGF &gt;533 pg/mL versus a 30-month survival rate &gt;35% for 34&#xD;
      patients with VEGF levels below this threshold (p&lt;0.0001, log-rank test). Recently, Jüttner&#xD;
      and colleagues noted reduced survival following R0 resection in gastric cancer patients whose&#xD;
      tumors expressed VEGF-C or VEGF-D, with the most robust association between expression and&#xD;
      reduced survival for patients whose tumors expressed both VEGF-C and VEGF-D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational inhibition of VEGF Receptor 2 in gastric cancer xenografts (TMK-1 cell line)&#xD;
      is associated with reduced tumor growth. DC101 therapy in this model is associated with&#xD;
      significant reductions in tumor vascularity (as measured by CD-31 expression) and increases&#xD;
      in endothelial and tumor apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the REGARD and RAINBOW studies are consistent with the idea that tumor-&#xD;
      related angiogenesis contributes to the pathophysiology of gastric cancer and demonstrate the&#xD;
      ability of ramucirumab to represent an improvement in the care of patients with gastric&#xD;
      cancer whose disease has progressed after prior chemotherapy.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has histologically or cytologically confirmed gastric carcinoma, including&#xD;
             gastric adenocarcinoma or GEJ adenocarcinoma. (Patients with adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
             distal esophagus are eligible if the primary tumor involves the GEJ.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has metastatic disease or locally recurrent, unresectable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient has measureable or evaluable disease as determined by standard computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging. Examples of evaluable,&#xD;
             nonmeasurable disease include gastric, peritoneal, or mesenteric thickening in areas&#xD;
             of known disease, or peritoneal nodules that are too small to be considered measurable&#xD;
             by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1) (48).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient has experienced disease progression during treatment or within 4 months&#xD;
             after the last dose of first-line therapy for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acceptable prior chemotherapy regimens for this protocol are combination&#xD;
                  chemotherapy regimens that include platinum and/or fluoropyrimidine components&#xD;
                  (acceptable prior platinum agents are cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin;&#xD;
                  acceptable prior fluoropyrimidine agents are 5-FU, capecitabine, or S-1).&#xD;
                  Regimens including a third agent, such as an anthracycline or a taxane, are&#xD;
                  acceptable provided a fluoropyrimidine and/or a platinum were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recurrence during or within 6 months of completion of adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
                  (capecitabine, 5-FU, or TS-1) will be considered as first-line chemotherapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. The patient is ≥18 years of age.&#xD;

             the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-&#xD;
             CTCAE), Version 4.03, of all clinically significant toxic effects of prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, or hormonal therapy (with the exception of&#xD;
             alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS)&#xD;
             score of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient has adequate hepatic function as defined by a total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
             (25.65 µmol/L), and aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3.0&#xD;
             times the upper limit of normal (ULN; or 5.0 times the ULN in the setting of liver&#xD;
             metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient does not have:&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  cirrhosis (any degree) and a history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinically&#xD;
                  meaningful ascites resulting from cirrhosis. Clinically meaningful ascites is&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. The patient has adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine ≤1.5 times&#xD;
             the ULN, or creatinine clearance (measured via 24-hour urine collection) ≥40 mL/minute&#xD;
             (that is, if serum creatinine is &gt;1.5 times the ULN, a 24-hour urine collection to&#xD;
             calculate creatinine clearance must be performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The patient's urinary protein is ≤1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA; if urine&#xD;
             dipstick or routine analysis is ≥2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must&#xD;
             demonstrate &lt;1000 mg of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in this protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The patient has adequate hematologic function, as evidenced by an absolute neutrophil&#xD;
             count (ANC) ≥1000/µL, hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (5.58 mmol/L), and platelets ≥100,000/µL.&#xD;

         14. The patient must have adequate coagulation function as defined by international&#xD;
             normalized ratio (INR) ≤1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤5 seconds above&#xD;
             the ULN (unless receiving anticoagulation therapy). Patients on full-dose&#xD;
             anticoagulation must be on a stable dose (minimum duration 14 days) of oral&#xD;
             anticoagulant or low molecular weight heparin. If receiving warfarin, the patient must&#xD;
             have an INR ≤3.0 and no active bleeding (that is, no bleeding within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             first dose of protocol therapy) or pathological condition present that carries a high&#xD;
             risk of bleeding (for example, tumor involving major vessels or known varices).&#xD;
             Patients on anticoagulation therapy with unresected primary tumors or local tumor&#xD;
             recurrence following resection are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. If the patient has received prior anthracycline therapy as part of his or her&#xD;
             first-line regimen, the patient is able to engage in ordinary physical activity&#xD;
             without significant fatigue or dyspnea (equivalent to New York Heart Association Class&#xD;
             I function) (49).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Because the teratogenicity of ramucirumab is not known, the patient, if sexually&#xD;
             active, must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or using effective contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier methods).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. The patient is able to provide informed written consent.&#xD;
