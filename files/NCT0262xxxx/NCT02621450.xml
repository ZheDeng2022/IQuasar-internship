  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End stage renal disease (ESRD) is related with increased cardiovascular mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity. Hypertension (HT) is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disorder among&#xD;
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of this study going to investigate the effectivity of&#xD;
      low-sodium dialysate on the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) levels detected by&#xD;
      ABPM and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) in patients undergoing sustained hemodialysis&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study will be included 46 patients who had creatinine clearance levels less than&#xD;
      10 ml/min/1.73 m2 and had been on chronic HD treatment for at least one year. After the&#xD;
      enrollment stage, the patients will be allocated low-sodium dialysate or standard-sodium&#xD;
      dialysate for six months via computer-generated randomization.&#xD;

      Patient Selection The present study is a single-center, randomized controlled and double&#xD;
      blinded trial. The patients going to enroll for this study had creatinine clearance less than&#xD;
      10 ml/min/1.73 m2 and had been on intermittent HD treatment for at least one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria for the present study are masking or white coat hypertension, heart&#xD;
      failure, cardiomyopathies, acute coronary syndromes, chronic ischemic heart disease, acute or&#xD;
      chronic liver disease, endocrine or pulmonary diseases, valvular heart diseases,&#xD;
      malignancies, active urinary tract infections, hemoglobin levels below 8 g/dL, and&#xD;
      hypotension tendency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty-four patients going to enroll for eligibility and after the initial assessment. Clinic&#xD;
      and laboratory profiles of the patients including cause of renal disease, history of HT and&#xD;
      antihypertensive treatments going to record by systematic review of the patient files. After&#xD;
      the enrollment stage, the patients going to allocate low-sodium dialysate or standard sodium&#xD;
      dialysate for 6 months via computer-generated randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They going to dialyze three times a week with synthetic polysulfone (Hollow-fiber, Low Flux,&#xD;
      KUF&lt;20, 1.6 m2) membrane, each session lasting 4 hours with bicarbonate dialysate (with&#xD;
      33mmol/L concentration) and 300-350 ml/min blood-flow. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol All patients going to assess before and 6 months after the study. Before&#xD;
      initiating the study, all patients were dialyzed with 140 mEq/L sodium concentration. In the&#xD;
      low-sodium dialysate group, the dialysate sodium concentration going to reduce from 140 to&#xD;
      137mEq/L. To eliminate the acute effects of hemodialysis on the parameters measured, baseline&#xD;
      and end-of-study measurements going to perform in non-dialysis day, 24 hours after the&#xD;
      mid-week session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambulatory blood pressure measurement Ambulatory BP measurement during 24-hour going to&#xD;
      perform using a Space Labs 90207 oscillometric method (Redmond, Washington, USA). The BP&#xD;
      measurements going to perform automatically from non-fistula arm. The confirmation of the&#xD;
      device going to check with the standard auscultator method in order to ensure that the&#xD;
      changes in BP values between the two methods did not exceed +5 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device going to set to achieve BP evaluation at 30-minute intervals during the night&#xD;
      (11:00 PM to 07:00 AM) and at 20-minute intervals during the day (07:00 AM to 11:00 PM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ''Nocturnal dipping'' going to define as a decrease of greater than 10% (when compared with&#xD;
      the daytime values) in the systolic or diastolic blood pressure at night. ''Non-nocturnal&#xD;
      dipping'' going to define as a decrease of less than 10% (when compared with the daytime&#xD;
      values) in the blood pressure parameters levels at night or did not decrease in the systolic&#xD;
      or diastolic blood pressure at night&#xD;
