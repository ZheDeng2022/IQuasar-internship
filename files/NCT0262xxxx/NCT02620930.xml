      DASAP-HF is an observational prospective single arm study. All patients will be treated&#xD;
      according to the standard care followed by each center. The protocol requires enrollment of&#xD;
      consecutive patients from each center, according to eligibility criteria. All patients must&#xD;
      sign the Patient Informed Consent (PIC) before the enrollment in the study. All patients,&#xD;
      after the enrollment phase, will be followed for 24 months. Approximately every 12 months a&#xD;
      clinical follow-up procedure should be performed in each patient. A sleep study will be done&#xD;
      in all patients at 1 month (or at 3 months) from the enrollment, in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      performance of the algorithm as a diagnostic tool in this population (primary objective).&#xD;
      During the 24 months follow-up period, all Adverse Events occurred in the study population&#xD;
      will be collected (HF hospitalizations, all-cause deaths, ventricular arrhythmias, etc.). At&#xD;
      the end of the 24 months follow-up, the incidence of clinical events will be evaluated as&#xD;
      well as its association with the Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) values calculated by&#xD;
      APNEA Scan algorithm (secondary objective).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart Failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries and a&#xD;
      major national and global health problem involving about 2% of the overall population and 10%&#xD;
      of the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A remarkably high proportion (around 50%) of stable optimally treated patients with HF and&#xD;
      systolic dysfunction experience persistent, moderate-to-severe breathing disorders both&#xD;
      during nighttime e during short-term laboratory recording.Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) is&#xD;
      associated with transient hypoxia and increased sympathetic activity. Both factors could&#xD;
      worsen Left Ventricular Ejection Function (LVEF) or increase serious arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosing and treating apnea may become a relevant issue in the management of HF patients .&#xD;
      Prognostic stratification of congestive HF is an important objective in patient management.&#xD;
      Many prognostic stratification scores have been suggested, however none has gained extensive&#xD;
      acceptance. Variables used to generate stratification scores must be simple, clinically&#xD;
      relevant, and readily obtainable. Furthermore, they must correlate to clinical events, such&#xD;
      as hospitalization, Implant Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) intervention and mortality. ICD&#xD;
      interventions are known to correlate with prognosis, and should thus be included among the&#xD;
      end-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been demonstrated to positively affect SA by&#xD;
      reducing the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). The recently developed implantable ventilation&#xD;
      sensor which allows automated detection of advanced breathing disorders may provide not only&#xD;
      the possibility to closely track the benefit of treatment but also provide further insights&#xD;
      into the pathophysiological mechanisms linking Central Sleep Apnea (CSA) to HF. Given that&#xD;
      the automated detection of sleep disordered breathing has been only performed in a limited&#xD;
      cohort of patients with preserved LVEF requiring pacemaker (PM) implantation for standard&#xD;
      bradycardia indications, one aspect requiring clarification is the assessment/validation of&#xD;
      the performance of the automated detection in patients with HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RDI is used to assess the severity of sleep apnea based on the total number of complete&#xD;
      cessations (apnea) and partial obstructions (hypopnea) of breathing occurring per hour of&#xD;
      sleep. These pauses in breathing must last for 10 seconds and are associated with a decrease&#xD;
      in oxygenation of the blood. In general, the RDI can be used to classify the severity of&#xD;
      disease (mild 5-15, moderate 15-30, and severe greater than 30). An implanted pacing device&#xD;
      with a respiratory sensing function may provide clinically useful diagnostics and treatment&#xD;
      for sleep-related breathing disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the APNEA Scan algorithm in&#xD;
      patients implanted with an ICD or CRT-D device endowed with the APNEA Scan algorithm. Primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of RDI value calculated by APNEA Scan&#xD;
      algorithm, as a binary discriminator of severe Sleep Apnea (SA) as detected by the&#xD;
      gold-standard sleep study. Secondary objective of the study is to assess the incidence of&#xD;
      clinical events after 24 months of enrollment and investigate its association with the RDI&#xD;
      values calculated by APNEA Scan algorithm.&#xD;
