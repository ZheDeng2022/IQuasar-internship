  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, open-label, single-center pilot study to assess the&#xD;
      safety, feasibility, and efficacy of Stem Cell Educator therapy for the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with Type 1 Diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our previous work demonstrated that human cord blood-derived multipotent stem cells (CB-SCs)&#xD;
      are a unique type of stem cell identified from human cord blood, distinct from other stem&#xD;
      cell types including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The&#xD;
      stem cells and harnessed some of their unique properties with Stem Cell Educator therapy by&#xD;
      using CB-SCs in a closed-loop system that circulates a patient's blood through a blood cell&#xD;
      separator, briefly co-cultures the patient's lymphocytes with adherent CB-SCs in vitro, and&#xD;
      returns the &quot;educated&quot; lymphocytes (but not the CB-SCs) to the patient's circulation . This&#xD;
      treatment leads to global immune modulations and immune balance as demonstrated by clinical&#xD;
      data and animal studies. The Stem Cell Educator therapy may revolutionize the clinical&#xD;
      treatment of diabetes and other immune-related diseases through CB-SCs' immune education and&#xD;
      induction of immune balance, without the safety and ethical concerns associated with&#xD;
      conventional stem cell-based approaches&#xD;
