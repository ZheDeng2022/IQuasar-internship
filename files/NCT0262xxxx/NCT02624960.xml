    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label controlled study that will assess the safety&#xD;
      and performance of the Accucinch System to induce left ventricular reverse remodeling and&#xD;
      reduce the severity of functional mitral regurgitation in symptomatic adult patients with&#xD;
      mitral regurgitation and left ventricular remodeling due to dilated cardiomyopathy (ischemic&#xD;
      or non-ischemic etiology), who are of high operative risk.&#xD;
