  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of 2 starting doses of&#xD;
      ponatinib compared to nilotinib in patients with imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (CML) in chronic phase (CP).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized study to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of 2 starting&#xD;
      doses of ponatinib as a treatment for CP-CML compared to nilotinib. Eligible patients must&#xD;
      have chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML), be resistant to first-line imatinib&#xD;
      treatment and have received no other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).&#xD;

    <measure>Major molecular response (MMR)</measure>
    <time_frame>By 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BCR-ABL is a fusion gene, a gene formed when pieces of chromosomes 9 and 22 break off and trade places. The ABL gene from chromosome 9 joins to the BCR gene on chromosome 22, to form the BCR-ABL fusion gene. Transcription is the first step of gene expression, in which a particular segment of DNA is copied into RNA (mRNA) by the enzyme RNA polymerase. MMR is the proportion of patients achieving achieving a ratio of ≤0.1% BCR ABL to ABL transcripts on the international scale (≤0.1% BCR-ABL/ABL[IS]) at any time within 12 months after randomization.</description>
