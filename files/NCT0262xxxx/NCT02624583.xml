  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ramadan fasting (RF) has been shown to be associated with vascular and metabolic disorders&#xD;
      including glycemic control and lipid profile. It may also alter pharmacologic properties of&#xD;
      some medications. Many patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and under Clopidogrel&#xD;
      insist to observe the fasting and taking the risk of altering the pharmacologic proprieties&#xD;
      of this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of RF on clopidogrel resistance in patients at&#xD;
      high cardiovascular risk with particular interest to patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involved three separate assessment visits in each year: 1) the last week before&#xD;
      Ramadan (Pre-R) which represented the baseline period; 2) the last week of Ramadan (R); 3)&#xD;
      and during the last week of the month following Ramadan(Post-R). Each patient served as his&#xD;
      own control and was required to take the prescribed clopidogrel dose daily and chart the&#xD;
      intake in a dosing diary. The duration of fasting was approximately 12 h from sunrise to&#xD;
      sunset(the time of abstinence from food) during a 30 day period. The assessment in each of&#xD;
      the three visits involved clinical exam and blood sampling for hematologic and metabolic&#xD;
      tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body weight and height were performed by a well-trained staff member. Weight was measured&#xD;
      while the subjects were minimally clothed without shoes using digital scales and recorded to&#xD;
      the nearest 0.1 kg. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as body weight (kg) divided by&#xD;
      squared height in meters (m2). Physical examination was carried out in all participants&#xD;
      including systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, and heart rate. The visit is&#xD;
      completed by a questionnaire on diet beginning 2 days before the blood sampling. No special&#xD;
      nutritional regimen was applied to the participants during the study. All subjects were&#xD;
      encouraged to continue their usual lifestyle and activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of hypoglycemic (symptomatic and non-symptomatic) and hyperglycemic episodes&#xD;
      requiring emergency department (ED) admission was recorded within the three periods of the&#xD;
      study. Hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose &lt;3.5 mmol/l. Compliance to current treatment&#xD;
      (clopidogrel, oral hypoglycemic agents,statins...) was assessed by the attending physician&#xD;
      based on interview and pill count. Venous blood samples were collected from the enrolled&#xD;
      participants during the three time points. The time of blood sampling in the study was 9-10&#xD;
      a.m., at which all participants were fast. For the purpose of the study,we asked our patients&#xD;
      to take clopidogrel treatment as late as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As Ramadan month during the study period has coincided with summer season,clopidogrel was&#xD;
      generally taken between midnight and1 am. We added this detail in the paper..&#xD;

    <description>the platelet reactivity to clopidogrel is assessed by the 'Verify Now P2Y12' point-of-care assay .&#xD;
Results are reported as P2Y12 reaction units (PRU); the lower the PRU value, the higher the platelet aggregation inhibition by clopidogrel.&#xD;
High platelet reactivity after clopidogrel (clopidogrel resistance) was defined at two cutoff values (PRU≥235 and ≥ 208).</description>

    <description>An automated analyzer (Beckman Coulter DXC 600, UK) measured the concentrations of biochemical parameters using the appropriate reagents.&#xD;
The total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) were determined using an enzymatic colorimetric method. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations were determined by immuno-inhibition. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated using the Friedewald formula: LDL-C (mmol/L) =TC - HDL-C - TG: 2.2.</description>
