  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids have been extensively examined in many published&#xD;
      studies, and these benefits have been observed in patients with a diversity of conditions and&#xD;
      diseases, including cardiovascular disease (e.g. atrial fibrillation, atherosclerosis,&#xD;
      thrombosis, inflammation, sudden cardiac death, etc.), age-related cognitive decline,&#xD;
      periodontal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. These fatty acids may also be beneficial to&#xD;
      healthy individuals, in terms of preventative health benefits. The balance between omega-6&#xD;
      long chain fatty acids and their omega-3 counterparts is important in health maintenance. An&#xD;
      omega-6:omega-3 ratio of 1:1 or 2:1 is recommended for optimal health, yet the average ratio&#xD;
      in the North American population is estimated to be as much as 10:1 or even 20:1. A 2014&#xD;
      study of the dietary habits of U.S. adults revealed that, in general, North Americans do not&#xD;
      meet the recommended omega-3 fatty acid intake from foods alone. Supplementation may need to&#xD;
      be considered, in order to help this population meet their daily needs. Both the Academy of&#xD;
      Nutrition and Dietetics and the American Heart Association suggest a prudent approach in&#xD;
      recommending an increased intake of omega-3 fatty acids. Although both organisations&#xD;
      recommend a preference for obtaining omega-3 fatty acids through fish consumption, both also&#xD;
      recognise that supplementation may also be required in order to meet target values,&#xD;
      particularly in at-risk populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several omega-3 fish oil supplements exist on the market each with their own ratios of EPA&#xD;
      and DHA and are available in varying forms including ethyl ester and high triglyceride forms.&#xD;
      Differences in product formulation have been shown to have varying health effects.&#xD;
