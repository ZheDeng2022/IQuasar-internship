      The main aim of the WESTCOR study is to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  investigate the ability of two high sensitive cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays to&#xD;
           diagnose acute coronary syndrome and predict prognosis in different patient populations&#xD;
           (e.g. gender, age and co-morbidity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to validate the suggested 1 hour protocol for rule in and rule out of acute coronary&#xD;
           syndrome for two hs-cTn assays in an unselected chest pain population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate different biomarkers ability to predict long term prognosis after&#xD;
           hospitalization for chest pain&#xD;

      The WESTCOR-study will include patients presenting to the Emergency Department of Haukeland&#xD;
      University Hospital and Stavanger University Hospital with symptoms indicative of acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome. 1500 patients will be included at Haukeland University Hospital and 400 at&#xD;
      Stavanger University Hospital. The two locations use different high sensitive troponin assays&#xD;
      (i.e. hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI (Abbott Diagnostics) for routine diagnostic of coronary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1900 patients will be sampled and hs-cTnT or hs-cTnI (as applicable) will be measured at&#xD;
      admission, after one (2/3 of the cohort), three hours and after 8-12 hours. Clinicians will&#xD;
      be blinded to the results of the hs-cTn assay that is not used as routine assay locally.&#xD;
      Final diagnosis will be made by two independent cardiologists based on all available clinical&#xD;
      information and results of the routine tests. The ability to diagnose or exclude MI ACS, and&#xD;
      MACE at different sampling points in different patient populations will be compared for&#xD;
      different biomarkers. 1500 patients will have a sample 1 hour after admission. The clinicians&#xD;
      will be blinded to the results of this sample (both hs-cTn assays). The ability of the&#xD;
      one-hour sample to diagnose or exclude myocardial infraction (MI), ACS and MACE will be&#xD;
      compared between biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be invited to take a follow-up sample 3 months after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will further be followed for 1-5 years through national registers and the&#xD;
      prognostic value of hs-cTn concentrations and dynamics as well as other biomarkers, will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
