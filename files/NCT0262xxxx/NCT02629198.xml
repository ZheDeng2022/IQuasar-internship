  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is current interest in the role of vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of many&#xD;
      chronic diseases, including osteoporosis, cancer and neurological disease. The majority of&#xD;
      vitamin D in the UK comes from the action of sunlight on skin, and very little from dietary&#xD;
      sources. Half of the adult United Kingdom (UK) population have vitamin D insufficiency&#xD;
      (according to the Institute of Medicine definition). There are still several important&#xD;
      unknowns, including what the optimum levels of vitamin D are, and whether the same intake of&#xD;
      vitamin D is appropriate for all sections of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low 25(OH)D and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) have been observed in people with high&#xD;
      adiposity (obesity), and the summer rise in vitamin D is blunted in obesity. The potential&#xD;
      causes of low 25(OH)D levels include an inadequate supply of vitamin D (by reduced sunlight&#xD;
      exposure or poor nutrition), the large pool size of adipose tissue or increased metabolic&#xD;
      clearance rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure metabolites of vitamin D and the kinetics of 25(OH)D using&#xD;
      stable isotope techniques in lean, overweight and obese men, women and children to establish&#xD;
      whether age, gender and obesity affect vitamin D metabolism and clearance rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If low 25(OH)D in obesity is related to poorer skeletal health and is due to increased&#xD;
      clearance of 25(OH)D or large pool size, then total requirements, and hence supplementation&#xD;
      requirements, would be larger for obese people than for lean people.&#xD;

      Part 1: Measurement of vitamin D and metabolites (adults and children) Circulating levels of&#xD;
      vitamin D metabolites are influenced by calcium intake, so participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a seven day diet diary before the first vitamin D measurement. Measured vitamin D is&#xD;
      influenced by vitamin D binding protein, lipids and inflammatory cytokines, so the&#xD;
      investigators will include and correct for these measurements.&#xD;

      lipids and creatine kinase (CK), PTH, insulin-like growth factor -1 (IGF-1), creatinine,&#xD;
      calcium, albumin, phosphate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Measurement of vitamin D clearance rate (adults only) Kinetic studies will be&#xD;
      perturbed by acute changes in vitamin D (most likely to be caused by sunlight exposure on a&#xD;
      sunny day), and so the studies will all be conducted in the autumn, winter, and early spring&#xD;
      when sunlight in Sheffield will not be strong enough to deliver large doses of vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration and sampling protocol for the kinetics study has been developed by&#xD;
      statisticians at the Sheffield School of Health and Related Research (ScHaRR) in&#xD;
      collaboration with the Medical Research Council Human Nutrition Unit, based on modelling from&#xD;
      their previous use of the stable isotope tracer method.&#xD;

      and weight&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of obesity on vitamin D metabolites will be determined by regression models of BMI&#xD;
      and vitamin D measurements corrected for age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of obesity on vitamin D kinetics will be determined by modelling metabolic&#xD;
      clearance rate on age, gender and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' previous data from the 'Effects of obesity on bone structure and strength'study&#xD;
      (STH 15688) and the 'Body weight and bone' study (STH16199) will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      relationships between vitamin D metabolism and body fat distribution, bone density and&#xD;
      structure, and bone biochemistry.&#xD;

        The total study sample will consist of 136 participants (112 adults and 24 children) who&#xD;
        are lean, overweight or obese. Participants will be drawn from two previous studies; 'The&#xD;
        effects of obesity on bone structure and strength' (STH 15688) and 'Body weight and bone'&#xD;
        (STH16199), in which their body composition, bone strength and biochemistry have been&#xD;
        documented in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants from the previous studies will be invited to participate, and recruitment&#xD;
        will continue until 112 adults and 24 children across a range of body weights have been&#xD;
        recruited.&#xD;
