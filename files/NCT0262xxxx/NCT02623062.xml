  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in China to provide evidence for inclusion in applications to&#xD;
      competent authorities that the Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachet is effective&#xD;
      in managing the symptoms of heartburn and acid regurgitation in patients with&#xD;
      gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomised, double blind, two arm, parallel group, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe and frequent GERD symptoms. After signing&#xD;
      a written informed consent, patients will undergo a screening period of up to 7 days.&#xD;
      Patients who satisfy the study entry requirements within 7 days of consent, will be&#xD;
      randomised to receive either Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachets (20ml four&#xD;
      times daily) or matching placebo sachets (20ml four times daily),for a 7- day treatment&#xD;
      period. At the beginning and end of the treatment period, patients will be required to&#xD;
      complete the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, at the end of the 7 (-1 day to +2 days) day treatment period, patients will be&#xD;
      required to complete the Overall Treatment Evaluation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary diagnosis: Current evidence of symptomatic GERD/NERD that comply with the&#xD;
             Montreal definition of GERD/Nonerosive Esophageal Reflux Disease (NERD). GERD is a&#xD;
             condition which develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome&#xD;
             symptoms and/or complications. The concept of NERD is preserved in the typical reflux&#xD;
             syndrome without esophageal injury, while reflux esophagitis falls under the category&#xD;
             of esophageal syndromes with esophageal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  GERD status: patients will be recruited by the Investigator from out-patient clinics,&#xD;
             hospital database or those who respond to the advertising. Patients must have a GERD&#xD;
             history of frequent episodes of GERD-related symptoms during the last 3 months, and&#xD;
             must have had troublesome heartburn and/or regurgitation of at least moderate&#xD;
             intensity on at least 4 days during the week before the start of screening.&#xD;
