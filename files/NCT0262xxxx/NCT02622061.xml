  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, single visit clinical investigation involving patients with known PCD&#xD;
      vs. age matched healthy volunteers. This study involves 1 visit which will last one (1) to&#xD;
      two (2) hours. Participants (and parent as applicable) will be asked for their consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study. A brief medical history will be recorded, including information&#xD;
      such as age, gender, height, weight, race, current medications and living environment. If the&#xD;
      participant is a PCD patient, they will also be asked about their disease history. Prior to&#xD;
      performing the nasal measurements, participants will receive instructions from study&#xD;
      personnel and have the opportunity to practice. All participants will have a brief nasal exam&#xD;
      and will also have to blow their nose before starting the measurements. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to perform nasal nitric oxide measurements using the tidal breathing method followed by&#xD;
      the velum closed with expiration against resistance method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the feasibility and capability of the NIOX VERO to&#xD;
      discriminate participants with PCD from those that are healthy. Information collected in this&#xD;
      study will help researchers understand more about the diagnosis of and identification of&#xD;
      patients with PCD.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Male and female patients 5 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Anatomically, is able to complete the nasal NO measurements in both nostrils.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Cohort 1 - PCD Patients: Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of PCD from one of&#xD;
             the PCD diagnostic centres based on clinical phenotype PLUS diagnosis made by at least&#xD;
             1 of the following (the specifics about how diagnosis was made must be documented in&#xD;
             their medical file):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A nasal biopsy or scraping showing a hallmark PCD defect such as, an outer (+/-&#xD;
                  inner) dynein arm defect, microtubule defect, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A genetic test positive for bi-alleilic mutations in a known PCD-causing gene&#xD;
                  associated with the diagnosis of PCD (e.g., ARMC4, C21orf59, CCDC39, CCDC40,&#xD;
                  CCDC65, CCDC164, CCDC103, CCDC114, CCDC151, CCNO, DNAAF1 (LRRC50), DNAAF2 (KTU),&#xD;
                  DNAAF3, DNAH5, DNAH11, DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAL1, DYX1C1, HEATR2, HYDIN, LRRC6, MCIDAS,&#xD;
                  NME8 (TXNDC3), ODA/IDA, OFD1, RPGR, RSPH3, RSPH4A, RSPH9, SPAG1, ZMYND10), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  EU Centres Only: A low nasal NO (determined by a chemiluminescent analyser) plus&#xD;
                  either:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  at least 2 separate occasions with 'hallmark' changes on high-speed video&#xD;
                       microscopy, or&#xD;
