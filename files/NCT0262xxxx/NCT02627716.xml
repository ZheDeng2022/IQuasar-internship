  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Joint Crisis Plan = SOS Plan is a reference to a particular form of psychiatric advance&#xD;
      directive which involves the patient, the healthcare team, their relatives and a third party&#xD;
      caregiver as intermediary for the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of the SOS Plan (JCP) in terms of the&#xD;
      reduction in hospitalisations within 18 months of its development by comparison to the&#xD;
      standard psychiatric care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators' proposal is that SOS Plan's are regularly reassessed every 6 months&#xD;
      and again where there is an unplanned psychiatric readmission that lasts beyond two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single blind multicentre randomised trial with parallel control groups.&#xD;

      Effectiveness study of a psychiatric care strategy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Single blind multicentre randomised trial with parallel control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SOS Intervention Group: benefits from the SOS Plan in addition to the usual follow-ups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Control&quot; Group: receive no additional intervention (only receive the routine&#xD;
           follow-ups)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of the SOS Plan (JCP) in terms of the reduction in&#xD;
           hospitalisations within 18 months of its development by comparison to the standard&#xD;
           psychiatric care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. the cumulative length of hospitalisations (in days) in the two years following the&#xD;
                development of the SOS plan&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. the type of hospitalisation (voluntary or compulsory)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. the number of hospitalisations for a given subject&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. the number of crisis situations that may require the use of the SOS Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. the clinical condition of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. the patient with the most responses to the SOS Plan in socio-demographic terms&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. the patient satisfaction in using the SOS Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. the decisional autonomy during treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. the quality of the therapeutic alliance&#xD;
&#xD;
            10. the length of the meeting to develop the SOS Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
            11. the quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
            12. the medico-economic impact&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXECUTION OF PRACTICAL RESEARCH :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The inclusion visit will be completed apart from a period of acute psychiatric&#xD;
           decompensation, while the patient is capable of consenting to treatment. The inclusion&#xD;
           visit will be completed within a hospital department before the patient is finally&#xD;
           released from hospitalisation or during an outpatient follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This involves placing the patient on the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) to&#xD;
           ensure that the patient's clinical condition allows him to consent to treatment. A score&#xD;
           above 95 excludes the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator also outlines the study and schedules visits. The patient then signs&#xD;
           both the information letter and informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A urine pregnancy test will be carried out on women of childbearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomisation will be performed by a member of the SOS regional-referral team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in the SOS Intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preparatory interview with an SOS regional referrer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SOS Plan development meeting in the presence of the patient, the treating psychiatrist,&#xD;
           one or more relatives, and an SOS regional referrer&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in the control group: tracking the continuation of psychiatric care according to&#xD;
      the standard care terms&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 ) Follow-up visits: for the two groups: 4 visits M6, M12, M18, M24 At each visit: meeting&#xD;
      with an independent regional SOS assessor blind to allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both of the groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the clinical condition: placement on the PANSS scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of psychiatric hospitalisations, types of hospitalisation, duration of&#xD;
           hospitalisation since the last visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satisfaction assessment (numeric scale), of the therapeutic alliance (WAI), of&#xD;
           decision-making autonomy (API), of quality of life (SF-36)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the SOS Intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Updating the SOS Plan after each relapse that leads to an unscheduled psychiatric&#xD;
           hospitalisation lasting more than two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Updating the SOS Plan every 6 months in the absence of hospitalisation&#xD;
