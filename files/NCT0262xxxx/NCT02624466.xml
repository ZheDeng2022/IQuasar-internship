  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffer from one of the most devastating diseases&#xD;
      in childhood resulting in a lifelong need for health care, and a 3 times decreased life&#xD;
      expectancy. In addition, they have important comorbidities that negatively impact on their&#xD;
      quality of life and integration in society, jeopardizing their future even after a potential&#xD;
      transplantation. Retention of uraemic toxins is accepted to play a major role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of the comorbid conditions, but studies in children are lacking. Furthermore,&#xD;
      there are currently no good tools to evaluate severity and monitor adequacy of treatment,&#xD;
      resulting in suboptimal management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall scientific objective of this four years UToPaed IWT-TBM project is to provide the&#xD;
      clinician with new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for the management of children with CKD,&#xD;
      based on the improved understanding of uraemic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this first part of UToPaed, the investigators will associate concentrations of a wide&#xD;
      variety of uraemic toxins with different comorbidities in CKD children, i.e. growth,&#xD;
      protein-energy wasting, quality of life, cardiovascular risk factors, circadian rhythm, sleep&#xD;
      quality, and psychosocial and neurocognitive functioning (i.e. cross-sectional and&#xD;
      longitudinal). The toxins of which concentrations are best correlated with comorbidities&#xD;
      during the progress of CKD and eventually have representative kinetics (UToPaed - part 2:&#xD;
      Kinetic analysis) will be selected as markers. These markers will be, together with the&#xD;
      comorbidities, further tracked after interventions, i.e. starting on dialysis,&#xD;
      transplantation, changes in dialysis strategy (UToPaed - part 3 - intervention study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the validated kinetic models (UToPaed - part 2 and 3), an open access user-friendly&#xD;
      prediction simulator (PAEDSIM) based on patient characteristics and marker concentrations&#xD;
      will be developed to optimise and individualise the dialysis therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By providing clinicians with more advanced and appropriate tools to improve management of all&#xD;
      children with CKD, i.e. better assessment of the degree of renal dysfunction, better&#xD;
      determination of the ideal time to start renal replacement therapy, and more accurate&#xD;
      monitoring of dialysis adequacy, the investigators aim to improve neurocognitive and&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning (short term), growth, maturation into puberty, and social&#xD;
      integration (median term) and survival (long term).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational multicenter study in children (â‰¤ 18 years) with chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD) stage 2 to 5D with or without renal replacement therapy. In this study,&#xD;
      60 children with CKD stage 2 - 5 (without renal replacement therapy)(GROUP 1), 30 children&#xD;
      with CKD stage 5D treated with peritoneal dialysis (GROUP 2) and 30 children with CKD stage&#xD;
      5D treated with haemodialysis (GROUP 3) will be followed for a total duration of 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants are evaluated on their standard visit at the outpatient clinic every 3&#xD;
      months. At this visit, a blood sample for uraemic toxin concentration is withdrawn and&#xD;
      several co-morbidities (growth, protein-energy wasting, cardiovascular disease, quality of&#xD;
      life, psychosocial functioning, sleep, attention and executive functions) are assessed.&#xD;
      Anthropometric parameters, dietary assessment, stool evaluation, nail evaluation, office and&#xD;
      24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, echocardiography and questionnaires are used&#xD;
      to map out the several co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood analyses are performed to get the concentrations of a wide variety of uraemic toxins:&#xD;
      i.e. small water soluble solutes, middle molecules and protein-bound solutes. All blood&#xD;
      analyses within this project are performed in the Ghent University Hospital: i.e. urea,&#xD;
      creatinine, calcium, and phosphorus are determined in the routine laboratory of the Ghent&#xD;
      University Hospital using standard methods, while all other uraemic toxins are determined in&#xD;
      the laboratory of the Nephrology Section using ELISA and (in-house developed) HPLC/UPLC&#xD;
      techniques. For the protein-bound solutes two runs are needed to distinguish between total&#xD;
      and free fractions of the protein-bound solutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
