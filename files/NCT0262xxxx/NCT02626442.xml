    <textblock>
      The risk of stroke and vascular dementia is high in individuals who have had a prior stroke&#xD;
      or TIA, and in those who have vascular disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure,&#xD;
      abnormal cholesterol, diabetes or pre-diabetes. These vascular risk factors can improve with&#xD;
      exercise. This study will examine the impact of a 6 month, low intensity group exercise class&#xD;
      on fitness, walking, balance, and brain health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also collect fitness, walking, balance, and brain health outcome measures at&#xD;
      baseline and post all other MERCE exercise and robotics interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A major public health problem in aging is that about half of all stroke survivors have&#xD;
      significant cognitive problems, called vascular cognitive impairment, nondementia (VCIND) and&#xD;
      also a 10fold increased risk of going on to develop full dementia. Investigators at&#xD;
      University of Maryland and VA Maryland Exercise and Robotics Center of Excellence (MERCE)&#xD;
      have developed exercise programs for individuals that have suffered a disabling stroke that&#xD;
      improve cardiovascular fitness levels, walking function, balance, and can reverse impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance (prediabetic state) and non-insulin dependent diabetes in nearly 60% of&#xD;
      stroke patients. Our most recent randomized studies provide the first evidence that aerobic&#xD;
      exercise (cardiovascular) can improve selected aspects of cognitive function that typically&#xD;
      decline with aging, and can increase indirect measures of blood flow to the brain. All of&#xD;
      these findings provide hope that exercise can improve brain health by reducing recurrent&#xD;
      stroke including silent strokes (9/10 stroke are silent), and improving cognitive function.&#xD;
      Yet, no studies to our knowledge have shown that exercise training can improve these elements&#xD;
      of brain health in individuals that have had a minor stroke, silent strokes, or are at great&#xD;
      risk of stroke due to the presence of cerebrovascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension,&#xD;
      prediabetes, etc.). Research studies in this pilot clinical demonstration project are&#xD;
      designed to: 1) provide new insights into the potential role for exercise to improve brain&#xD;
      health in aging and after minor stroke or at risk for stroke by using advanced brain imaging&#xD;
      techniques; 2) extend our findings in exercise and brain health to a population with&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease, including those with less severe neurological deficits; those with&#xD;
      cerebrovascular risk factors, minor strokes, transient ischemic attack (neurological deficits&#xD;
      resolved, but still at high risk for further events), or silent strokes, which are extremely&#xD;
      common and predictive of developing cognitive decline and dementia. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators are dedicated to testing exercise programs that can reach out to the community.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose to use the same low intensity exercise class format that&#xD;
      the investigators already have implemented safely and effectively at County Senior Centers in&#xD;
      Maryland over the last 4 years for more disabled stroke patients, toward the training of&#xD;
      these minimally disabled or nondisabled older individuals with silent or minor&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease. The results of this study will lay the groundwork for community&#xD;
      partnering and broader dissemination providing exercise programs designed to preserve and&#xD;
      improve brain health for those at high risk of vascular disease and cognitive decline in&#xD;
      aging. The hypothesis is that a 6 month supervised exercise class will improve brain function&#xD;
      and cognitive function among individuals with cerebrovascular risk factors, minor stroke,&#xD;
      TIA, or silent stroke as indicated by measures before and after training of 1) written and&#xD;
      computer - based cognitive function (memory and thinking) and mood tests and 2) MRI pictures&#xD;
      of the brain to see if blood flow is increased or damage due to old strokes and aging is&#xD;
      reduced by the exercise training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with cerebrovascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), minor stroke&#xD;
      (nondisabling stroke in terms of community or home walking capability), TIA (warning stroke),&#xD;
      or silent stroke (seen by brain imaging, but no paralysis or obvious stroke signs or&#xD;
      symptoms) will be entered into a 6 month duration exercise class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial medical and neurological evaluation will be conducted by a credentialed Clinician to&#xD;
      assure that individuals are eligible and that they are medically and neurologically approved&#xD;
      for participation in a low intensity aerobic exercise class. All subjects will have approval&#xD;
      of their primary care provider, documenting their awareness and medical approval for their&#xD;
      patient to enter into a low to moderate exercise intensity class. This is the same medical&#xD;
      clearance that is already Institutional Review Board approved and is in use for the similar&#xD;
      exercise class for stroke and neurologic disability in Howard County Department of Aging&#xD;
      Senior Centers. Before starting the exercise, all subjects will be given a series of baseline&#xD;
      testing: 1) walking and balance tests to characterize their mobility performance capacity&#xD;
      (timed walks, Short Physical Performance Battery, Functional Reach, Berg Balance Test,&#xD;
      modified dynamic gait index, and 4 square stepping, 2) a 12 hour battery of written and&#xD;
      computer based cognitive function and mood tests and questionnaires, and 3) MRI that lasts&#xD;
      about 1 hour that includes pictures of the brain . All of these tests will be repeated at&#xD;
      midpoints (i.e., 3 months) and at the end of the training program (6 months, MRIs are&#xD;
      performed only at baseline and 6 months). The exercise class will consist of supervised&#xD;
      walking as well as bar and chair exercises to address upper and lower extremity function. The&#xD;
      class will occur 3 times per week for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals are instructed to perform select parallel exercises at home the remaining days of&#xD;
      the weeks and record activities in a homework logbook.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is being designed in a modular fashion to collect the same outcomes at baseline&#xD;
      and post all other MERCE exercise and robotics interventions.&#xD;
