  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study aims at assessing the impact of nab-paclitaxel on the clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and the health-related QoL (HRQoL) of this heavily burdened and difficult-to-treat&#xD;
      population. Notably, the data generated in the context of this study will serve as&#xD;
      complementary evidence to that of the tightly and strictly controlled pre-registration&#xD;
      clinical trial setting, which is of essential importance especially in patient populations&#xD;
      with diseases of complex and heterogeneous biology, such as breast cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients eligible for inclusion in this study have to meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients (18 years and older);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of MBC who have&#xD;
             failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard,&#xD;
             anthracycline containing therapy is not indicated;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients for whom the decision to prescribe therapy with nab-paclitaxel according to&#xD;
             the locally approved product's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) has already&#xD;
             been taken prior to their enrolment in the study; the assignment of the patient to&#xD;
             this therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance by the study protocol but falls&#xD;
             within current practice and the prescription of nab-paclitaxel is clearly separated&#xD;
             from the physician's decision to include the patient in the current study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able and willing to provide written informed consent and to comply&#xD;
             with the requirements of this study protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have signed an informed consent document;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to read, understand and complete the study specific&#xD;
             questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patient who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in&#xD;
        this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have initiated treatment with nab-paclitaxel more than 7 days prior to&#xD;
             their enrolment into the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that meet any of the contraindications to the administration of the study&#xD;
             drug according to the approved SmPC;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any investigational agent within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the&#xD;
             investigational agent (whichever is longer) before the commencement of therapy with&#xD;
             nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;
