  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is multicenter (up to 10 sites in India) phase IV Post-Marketing Study. The study&#xD;
      is designed to investigate the safety of Lipiodol® Ultra Fluid in association with surgical&#xD;
      glues used according to each site medical practice of vascular embolization. Subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled with the main condition that a procedure of vascular embolization using Lipiodol®&#xD;
      Ultra Fluid in association with surgical glues is part of their therapeutic/palliative&#xD;
      strategy for their disease. The vascular embolization using Lipiodol® Ultra Fluid in&#xD;
      association with surgical glue will be administered as study procedure. According to the&#xD;
      patient need and health status a second vascular embolization using Lipiodol® Ultra Fluid in&#xD;
      association with surgical glue may be considered by the investigator within the next 30 days&#xD;
      after the first one. In this case, this procedure will be considered as a second study&#xD;
      procedure. The per-procedure safety evaluation will be enabled by appropriate records of&#xD;
      safety events during the time frame of the procedure of vascular embolization using Lipiodol®&#xD;
      Ultra Fluid in association with surgical glues. Safety evaluation will be completed with&#xD;
      safety records within 30 +/-3 days after the embolization procedure. Efficacy evaluation will&#xD;
      rely on the level of lesion(s) obliteration after embolization compared to the pre-procedural&#xD;
      target level of obliteration. Exploratory descriptive statistical methods will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate safety and efficacy, using both the total population and subsets of subjects with&#xD;
      similar clinical conditions.&#xD;
