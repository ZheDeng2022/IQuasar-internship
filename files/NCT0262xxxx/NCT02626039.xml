  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Characterization of the driver mutations in an individual metastatic breast cancer patient is&#xD;
      critical for many reasons. Effective targeted therapies require identifying genomic&#xD;
      alterations in the tumoral tissue. The scarce efficacy of many currently available targeted&#xD;
      drugs may be due to the outbreak of resistant clones with different genotype that already&#xD;
      present at the initiation of therapy. It is well known the intra-tumor heterogeneity with&#xD;
      genetic and non-genetic factors considered as the origin of the tumor cell-clon composition.&#xD;
      The acquisition of multiple mutations (driver and passenger), altogether with the stage of&#xD;
      differentiation, according to the cancer stem cell hypothesis, confers to the tumor cells&#xD;
      clinically important properties, such as resistance to therapies and seeding abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, there is a current challenge in establishing whether the metastatic cells arise&#xD;
      from the most aggressive and dominant clone in the primary tumor or the metastasic tissue&#xD;
      diverges with substantial genetic changes very early in the evolution of the disease. Primary&#xD;
      and metastatic tumor may have a close clonal relationship or evolve in parallel and acquire&#xD;
      different genomic alterations. In the real life, it is plausible that both models coexist&#xD;
      with different predominance according to the tumoral tissue and etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes that breast cancer metastases and primary tumors could harbor&#xD;
      different genomic profiles related to genomic regions of interest in a clinically relevant&#xD;
      proportion of metastatic breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the genomic aberrations found in the metastatic breast cancer tissue could also be&#xD;
      detected in CTCs and circulating free DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If true, CTCs and circulating free DNA would be convenient, non-invasive, easily accessible&#xD;
      sources of genomic material for the analysis of mutations and other genomic aberrations.&#xD;
