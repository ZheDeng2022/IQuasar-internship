  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the&#xD;
      United States. The death rate from this disease, however, has been decreasing over the last&#xD;
      20 years. Early detection and removal of pre-malignant polyps is considered to be at the core&#xD;
      of this change. At the same time, polyp detection is highly dependent on an adequate bowel&#xD;
      preparation. Froehlich, et al., found that poor bowel preparation is associated with longer&#xD;
      colonoscopy times, more difficult procedures and a higher rate of incomplete procedures(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a Clear Liquid Diet is usually the prescribed diet in most bowel preparation&#xD;
      regimes, several studies have shown similar results with less restrictive diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the hypothesis that a Full Liquid Diet(FLD) is not inferior to a Clear Liquid&#xD;
      Diet(CLD), investigators plan to conduct a prospective, randomized trial, in order to compare&#xD;
      these dietary interventions. The investigators and endoscopists will be blinded to patient's&#xD;
      diet group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers aim to investigate if diet liberalization to a Full Liquid Diet(FLD) is&#xD;
      associated with similar bowel cleansing as compared with a Clear Liquid Diet(CLD).&#xD;
      Investigators will compare the performance of these dietary interventions regarding adenoma&#xD;
      detection rates(ADR), time to cecal intubation(TCI), and colonoscope withdrawal time. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators want to assess whether patient's Compliance and Satisfaction is&#xD;
      similar or superior in the experimental group vs the control group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if a Full Liquid Diet is not inferior to a Clear&#xD;
      Liquid Diet in preparation for Screening Colonoscopy. Based on the data presented above, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that a Full Liquid Diet will be better tolerated by participants&#xD;
      and will not adversely affect colonoscopy outcomes in terms of bowel cleansing(BC), adenoma&#xD;
      detection rate(ADR), time to cecal intubation(TCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study may help guide dietary interventions in preparation for Colonoscopy&#xD;
      in the Department of Defense(DOD) Military Treatment Facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between adequate colon cleansing and adenoma detection rate(ADR) has been&#xD;
      already established. Almost 25% of patients, however, have a poor bowel preparation at the&#xD;
      time of Colonoscopy(1). After reviewing 5832 colonoscopies, Froehlich, et al., found that&#xD;
      poor bowel preparation is associated with longer colonoscopy times, more difficult procedures&#xD;
      and a higher rate of incomplete procedures(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among other causes, bowel cleansing is affected by purgative selection and timing of&#xD;
      administration, compliance with recommended pre-procedural diet and compliance with purgative&#xD;
      administration. Recently, it has been found that the classically recommended clear liquid&#xD;
      diet(CLD) is not indispensable for adequate bowel prep. Stolpman, et. al, found that a&#xD;
      low-residue diet is non-inferior to clear liquid diet(CLD), in a group of 201 patients(3).&#xD;
      Similarly, Melicharkova, et al, found that the bowel cleansing efficacy of a low-residue&#xD;
      breakfast, the day before colonoscopy, was comparable with a clear liquid diet(CLD) in a&#xD;
      sample of 213 patients administered a low volume purgative in preparation for colonoscopy(4).&#xD;
      They also found a statistically significant difference in the level of patient's acceptance&#xD;
      of the low-residue diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group from South Korea, led by Dr. Jung Yoon, found similar rates of bowel cleansing in&#xD;
      patient undergoing afternoon colonoscopy, when offered Regular Diet(5). A study, in a small&#xD;
      study population, presented as an abstract at the American College of Gastroenterology&#xD;
      Conference in 2011, reported comparable bowel cleansing, polyp detection rate, and&#xD;
      colonoscopy times in patients allowed a full liquid diet before the procedure(6). Taken&#xD;
      together, these studies show that a clear liquid diet may not be necessary in order to obtain&#xD;
      a good bowel cleanse in preparation for colonoscopies performed in the outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clear liquid diet is still the recommended diet, however, before this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the diverse population served at Military Treatments Facilities across the United&#xD;
      States, and abroad, the investigators aim to investigate if diet liberalization to a Full&#xD;
      Liquid Diet(FLD) is associated with similar bowel cleansing as compared with a Clear Liquid&#xD;
      Diet(CLD). In addition, the investigators will compare the performance of these diets&#xD;
      regarding adenoma detection rates(ADR), time to cecal intubation(TCI), withdrawal time, and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted as a prospective, randomized trial. The investigators and&#xD;
      endoscopists will be blinded to patient's diet group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 50 y/o, or older, undergoing screening colonoscopy will be offered participation in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If written, informed consent is obtained, participants will be randomized to (A)Control Group&#xD;
      or (B) Study Group(in a 1:1 fashion). Study randomization will be performed by using serially&#xD;
      numbered envelopes containing instructions for CLD or FLD. The control group will be allowed&#xD;
      to have a Clear Liquid Diet the day before colonoscopy and the Study Group will be allowed to&#xD;
      have a Full Liquid Diet the day before colonoscopy. These envelopes will be prepared in&#xD;
      duplicates. One envelope will be provided to the participant and one envelope will be&#xD;
      maintained, sealed, by the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will complete a Bowel Preparation consisting of bisacodyl 10mg per mouth&#xD;
      x1(at noon, the day before colonoscopy) and 4L Polyethylene Glycol solution(split dose).&#xD;
      Subjects will drink 2 L of Polyethylene Glycol at 17:00 the day before colonoscopy and the&#xD;
      other 2 L at 04:00, the morning prior to colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will follow one of the diets described above, based on randomization, and will present&#xD;
      to the BAMC Gastroenterology Clinic for Colonoscopy. Before the procedure, subjects will be&#xD;
      administered a questionnaire in order to assess their compliance, tolerability and&#xD;
      satisfaction with the diet. Research team and Endoscopists will also be blinded to these&#xD;
      questionnaires until the data collection process has finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy will be performed in the usual fashion. Endoscopists will assess the level of&#xD;
      subject's colon cleansing by means of the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale(7). Time to Cecal&#xD;
      Intubation and Colonoscope Withdrawal Time will be documented, as is currently done at the&#xD;
      BAMC Gastroenterology Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenoma Detection Rates(number of screened patients with at least one adenoma divided by&#xD;
      total number of patients screened with colonoscopy) will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will compare Bowel Prep Quality/Colon Cleansing, Time to Cecal Intubation, ADR,&#xD;
      and Patient's Compliance and Satisfaction with the bowel preparation between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primarily, the investigators want to assess whether Bowel Prep Quality/Colon Cleansing and&#xD;
      ADR for the experimental group is non-inferior to Bowel Prep Quality and ADR for the control&#xD;
      group. In addition, the investigators will asses whether participant's Compliance and&#xD;
      Satisfaction is similar or superior in the experimental group vs the control group.&#xD;
