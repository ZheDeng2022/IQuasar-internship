      To compare the results associated with two different skin closure techniques in open&#xD;
      appendectomy. 200 patients were included after acute appendicitis diagnosis in emergency&#xD;
      department. They were grouped randomly into two groups: patients who would receive skin&#xD;
      closure with skin closure by an unique absorbable intradermic stitch (Group A) and another&#xD;
      that would receive a habitual technique consistent in non absorbable separated stitches&#xD;
      (Group B). General characteristics like gender, age, body mass index (IMC), comorbidities and&#xD;
      allergies were registered. Days of evolution (DOE) until surgery, use of antibiotics&#xD;
      previously, complicated or uncomplicated appendicitis, surgery time and wound complications&#xD;
      like skin infection, dehiscence, seroma or abscess were registered in each case too,&#xD;

      Registration number R2015-2301-6 by Local Committee on Ethics in Health Research and Social&#xD;
      Security Mexican Institute, Zone 03 General Hospital. The investigators conduct the study at&#xD;
      the Hospital General Regional No. 17 in Cancun, Quintana Roo. México. At time in which&#xD;
      General Surgery Department determined acute appendicitis diagnosis and prophylaxis&#xD;
      antibiotics administered with 3rd generation cephalosporin and Metronidazole, patients&#xD;
      receive information about the study and treatment options and informed consent were signed.&#xD;
      After this, patients were randomly assigned to one of two study groups. Group A receives a&#xD;
      skin closure with a unique absorbable suture intradermal stitch. Group B receives a skin&#xD;
      closure with habitual technique, consistent in separated stitch of a non-absorbable suture.&#xD;
      The surgical and skin closure techniques were standardized among eight surgeons who&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute appendicitis diagnosis was established by clinical history, physical exam and&#xD;
      laboratory test including blood count, glucose, urea, creatinine, general urinary exam and&#xD;
      clothing times. An Alvarado scale &gt;7 points or the surgeon opinion was diagnostic of&#xD;
      appendicitis. General information about the patients were recorded like gender, age, body&#xD;
      mass index (IMC), comorbidities and allergies were registered. Clinical history information&#xD;
      like DOE and previous antibiotics use were registered too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After explanation of the diagnosis and treatment options, the patients were informed about&#xD;
      this study, the objectives, implications, possible outcomes and complications. The patients&#xD;
      or legal tutor of the patients refer to understand the possible risk and consequences and if&#xD;
      they accept to be included in the study an informed consent was signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hour before skin incision a prophylaxis dose of a 3rd Generation Cephalosporin&#xD;
      (Cefotaxime) and Metronidazole were administered. According to a randomized list patients&#xD;
      were assigned to one of the two study groups previous to his/her skin incision. The surgical&#xD;
      and skin closure technique were standardized and verified by the protocol author previous to&#xD;
      the development of any appendectomy by the eight surgeons included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Rochy-Davis incision was performed in all cases and aspiration of purulent liquid when&#xD;
      required. Stump management with Halsted or Pouchet technique was done. Abdominal cavity was&#xD;
      cleaned only with gauze pads, no drain were placed. After aponeurosis closure with&#xD;
      Polyglactina 910 #1 continuous point, wound lavage with NaCl 0.9% solution was performed.&#xD;
      Dermis was closed with Polyglactina 910 #3-0. In Group A Polyglactina 910 # 3-0 intradermic&#xD;
      continuous point was done. In Group B skin closure with Nylon #3-0 separated stitches was&#xD;
      achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid diet was ingested 8 hours after surgery and progressed to normal if tolerated. In&#xD;
      cases of complicated appendicitis antibiotics were continued four to five days and for&#xD;
      uncomplicated appendicitis only by 2 days or until inflammatory systemic response signs were&#xD;
      absent. When diet was tolerated and systemic response signs were absent discharge was&#xD;
      accomplished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery incision was evaluated daily until discharge and in extern consult at 7 and 30 days&#xD;
      after surgery. In case of group B stitches removal were done at 10 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days of evolution (DOE) previous to appendicitis diagnose, use of antibiotics previously,&#xD;
      complicated or uncomplicated appendicitis, surgery time and wound complications like skin&#xD;
      infection, dehiscence, seroma or abscess were registered in each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database was performed and the statistical program SPSS version 22.0 for Mac IOS 7.0 was used&#xD;
      to perform statistical data analysis. Complications, surgical and general characteristics&#xD;
      were registered and compared between the groups using X2 test. A multivariate analysis was&#xD;
      performed for independent variables and the possible association with complications.&#xD;
