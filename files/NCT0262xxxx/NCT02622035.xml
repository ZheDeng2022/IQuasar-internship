      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are involved in testing new behavioral science methods and measures for future research&#xD;
      projects. In the course of these evaluations, we will also test research questions related to&#xD;
      parents psychological experiences and how these relate to the responses they have when they&#xD;
      encounter different types of communication about child health. We are testing multiple&#xD;
      research questions in the course of this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn about technologies and approaches to use in future research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Parents (fathers and mothers) of children between the ages of 3-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the main study, participants will do four tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 1: Before participants arrive for an in-person visit, they will answer questions online&#xD;
      about themselves, their child, and their thoughts and opinions related to health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 2: At the in-person visit, participants will watch a short scene from a movie and answer&#xD;
      some questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 3: At the in-person visit, participants will read information about a child health topic&#xD;
      and answer questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 4: At the in-person visit, participants will use a virtual reality-based buffet&#xD;
      restaurant simulation to make hypothetical food choices for their child...&#xD;
