      The purpose of this study is to build a database of results from a new test that measures&#xD;
      contrast sensitivity (the Spaeth-Richman Contrast Sensitivity Test (SPARCS)). Contrast&#xD;
      sensitivity is an important part of your ability to see. When contrast sensitivity decreases,&#xD;
      you are less able to see objects and detect motion. For instance, if you have decreased&#xD;
      contrast sensitivity, you might be less able to read, see in the dark, drive, hit a ball, or&#xD;
      walk safely. Decrease in contrast sensitivity leads to a decrease in quality of life.&#xD;

      Objective: To build a normative database for the Spaeth / Richman Contrast Sensitivity Test&#xD;
      (SPARCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Patients with glaucoma have diminished contrast sensitivity. SPARCS is a novel&#xD;
      test designed to determine the contrast threshold in the central 5 degrees of vision as well&#xD;
      as each of the 4 peripheral quadrants (superotemporal, superonasal, inferotemporal,&#xD;
      inferonasal). It is performed on a standard computer with at least 1024 x 768 monitor&#xD;
      resolution. The correct testing distance is 50 cm away from the computer screen. Appropriate&#xD;
      refractive correction is used. Testing is performed in a room with standardized lighting (85&#xD;
      cd / m2) and no windows in order to minimize glare and reflections. Testing is performed&#xD;
      monocularly with the non-tested eye covered by an eye patch. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      build a normative database for SPARCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Cross sectional observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Healthy volunteers will be recruited from the Wills Eye Institute after obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent following the principles of the Helsinki Convention. Approximately 320&#xD;
      people free of ocular disease will be recruited to form a portion of the normative database&#xD;
      for SPARCS. A goal of 20 subjects per decade of life (10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59,&#xD;
      60-69, 70-79, 80+) for both Caucasians and African Americans will be recruited. Other&#xD;
      ethnicities will also be recruited, though without specific recruitment goals. Future study&#xD;
      locations will help diversify the population of the normative database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After agreeing to participate in the study, subjects will be assessed to determine if they&#xD;
      qualify. Potential participants will be asked if they have any known eye diseases or&#xD;
      decreased vision. Best-corrected monocular visual acuities will be assessed using an ETDRS&#xD;
      visual acuity chart. A slit lamp examination will be performed to confirm good ocular health.&#xD;
      Subjects will be excluded if they have any apparent ocular disease that affects visual acuity&#xD;
      or visual function. For example, people with glaucoma, macular degeneration, or diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy will be excluded. Additional exclusion criteria includes: visual acuity 20/40 or&#xD;
      worse; cataract grade 2 3+ or worse; posterior capsular opacity grade 2 3+ or worse;&#xD;
      refractive error greater than +5 or -5 diopters; and incisional eye surgery within the prior&#xD;
      3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a person qualifies for the normative database, he or she will then take SPARCS. A&#xD;
      trained technician will position the patient to the correct testing distance, check room&#xD;
      lighting, and then explain the test. Subjects will be told to fixate on the central area and&#xD;
      when ready, click the central area once with a computer mouse. Vertical dark bars will&#xD;
      briefly appear in 1 of the 5 tested areas on the computer monitor. A subject will then move&#xD;
      the mouse to the area the image appeared and click it once. When the subject is ready for the&#xD;
      next image to appear, he or she will click again on the central area. Subjects are also&#xD;
      instructed to guess where the image appeared if unsure. Vertical square waves of varying&#xD;
      contrast levels will then continue to appear in a random pattern until threshold has been&#xD;
      reached for each area. After the testing algorithm has been completed, the test will&#xD;
      automatically end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each eye of an eligible subject will take the test twice after receiving instructions from a&#xD;
      technician. The technician will remain in the testing room the first two times SPARCS is&#xD;
      taken. A half hour later, the subject will then take SPARCS again without instructions from&#xD;
      the technician and without the technician being present in the room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean score and standard deviation of each area and the total score will be analyzed for&#xD;
      age, gender, race, and lens status. Spearman correlations will be used to examine continuous&#xD;
      variables and Kruskal-Wallis analysis for categorical measures. Test-retest repeatability&#xD;
      will be assessed using the Coefficient of Repeatability and the Intraclass Correlation&#xD;
      Coefficient.&#xD;
