  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate potential protein synthesis effects of whey protein&#xD;
      high in leucine compared to whey protein with normal leucin content in elderly patients in a&#xD;
      acute crossover setting. We will use the method of a 2 X 3 h tracer infusing protocol with&#xD;
      15Nphenylalanine along with blood samples and muscle biopsies.&#xD;

      Background: Improved muscle function/strength will enhance the quality of life of the more&#xD;
      frail elderly population. Dietary proteins and amino acids act as anabolic substrates in&#xD;
      muscles in elderly people. In particular the amino acid leucine is suggested to have an&#xD;
      impact on muscle protein synthesis. In collaboration with the Danish dairy company Arla Foods&#xD;
      we will use their conventional Whey protein and leucine enriched Whey protein in an acute&#xD;
      study on elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to examine the acute effects of supplementation with whey protein high in leucine&#xD;
      compared to whey protein with normal leucine content on muscle protein synthesis and protein&#xD;
      balance in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We include 10 elderly patients, age 60-85 years in a randomized crossover study. The&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited from the Osteoporosis Section at the Department of Endocrinology&#xD;
      at Aarhus University Hospital. The subjects are their own controls in 2 x 1 day interventions&#xD;
      A: whey protein high in leucine and B: whey protein with normal leucine content.&#xD;
      Interventions are conducted with a 4 week washout period between them. On the intervention&#xD;
      day postprandial protein synthesis rate will be measured over 2 X 3h using a tracer infusing&#xD;
      protocol with 15Nphenylalanine along with blood samples and muscle biopsies. For analyzing&#xD;
      steps of signaling in muscle protein synthesis initiated by leucine mammalian target of&#xD;
      rapamycin (mTor) and sites downstream from mTor is quantified using western blotting. Whole&#xD;
      body protein kinetics are calculated using the formula Q=i*Ei/Ep-i&#xD;
