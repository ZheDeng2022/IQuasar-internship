    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The remaining 12 subjects of the study will receive up to six IV doses of RNA CART123 cells.&#xD;
Subjects in Cohort 2 may be given lymphodepleting chemotherapy 4 days (+/- 1 day) prior to the first CART123 cell infusion (if ALC&gt; 500/uL).&#xD;
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy may be repeated before the fourth dose of RNA CART123 cells (if ALC&gt; 500/uL).&#xD;
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy includes a single dose of cyclophosphamide (1g/m2) Weight used for dosing will be the weight obtained prior to the apheresis procedure Cell numbers are based on CAR+ cells with CAR expression determined by flow cytometry Based on the product release criteria, at least 20% of the total cells will be RNA CART123 cells.&#xD;
Dosing will not be changed for changes in subject weight The indicated doses are +/- 20% to account for manufacturing variability.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects 18 years of age or older with AML with no available curative&#xD;
             treatment options using currently available therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a suitable stem cell donor available who may donate cells if the&#xD;
             subject needs to undergo allogeneic HCT. Donor may be matched or mismatched and must&#xD;
             be found to be suitable according to the institution's standard criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with second or subsequent relapse, any relapse refractory to salvage, or with&#xD;
             persistent disease after at least two lines of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Subjects with relapsed disease after prior allogeneic HCT (myeloablative or&#xD;
             non-myeloablative) will be eligible if they meet all other inclusion criteria and i.&#xD;
             Have experienced graft rejection (no evidence of donor cells by STR analysis on 2&#xD;
             occasions separated by at least 1 month), OR: ii. Donor cells are present but there is&#xD;
             no active GVHD, subject does not require immunosuppression and is more than 6 months&#xD;
             from transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have evaluable disease defined as &gt;5% blasts on marrow aspirate or&#xD;
             biopsy, extramedullary disease (CNS involvement is prohibited), or at least 20% blasts&#xD;
             in the peripheral blood within 2 weeks prior to enrollment. Note: subjects with second&#xD;
             or subsequent relapse are considered to have evaluable disease even without meeting&#xD;
             the above morphologic criteria if they are found to have persistent recurrent&#xD;
             disease-associated molecular or cytogenetic abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine &lt; 1.6 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALT/AST must be &lt; 5 x upper limit of normal unless related to disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl, unless subject has Gilbert's syndrome (â‰¤3.0 mg/dL);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 40% as confirmed by ECHO/MUGA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent is given.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women. The safety of this therapy on unborn children is not&#xD;
             known. Female study participants of reproductive potential must have a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test at enrollment. A urine pregnancy test will be performed within 48 hours&#xD;
             before infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of systemic steroids or immunosuppressant medications. Recent or&#xD;
             current use of inhaled steroids or physiologic replacement with hydrocortisone is not&#xD;
             exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute lymphocyte count &lt;500/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any uncontrolled active medical disorder that would preclude participation as&#xD;
             outlined.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with signs or symptoms indicative of CNS involvement. A CNS evaluation should&#xD;
             be performed as clinically appropriate to rule out CNS involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum&#xD;
             albumin, DMSO, and Dextran 40).&#xD;

             medical management, within 2 weeks of the Screening/Enrollment visit.&#xD;
