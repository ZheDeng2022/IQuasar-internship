      INTRODUCTION TO QUALITY IMPROVEMENT Quality Improvement (QI), defined as &quot;systematic and&#xD;
      continuous actions that lead to measurable improvement in health care services and the health&#xD;
      status of targeted patient groups&quot; (IOM 2014) has roots in the consumer industry as far back&#xD;
      as the 1920s. Data-driven structured process improvements have their origins in the consumer&#xD;
      industry, particularly motor vehicles, and Avedis Donabedian first described a model for&#xD;
      healthcare quality improvement in the 1960s which reflects the same process change model&#xD;
      utilised in the consumer industry: the key elements being structures, processes and outcomes.&#xD;
      Don Berwick and colleagues founded the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) in the&#xD;
      1990s, now a leading institution on QI worldwide. The QI approach or 'form' is structured and&#xD;
      uses specific QI tools, whereas its application or 'function' is varied depending on selected&#xD;
      process interventions and local context. Given the move towards rigorously improving quality&#xD;
      of health care worldwide, QI methodology is increasingly gaining popularity not only in&#xD;
      high-income settings but also in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) including South&#xD;
      Africa through Department of Health (DoH) commitments to improving quality of health care and&#xD;
      reducing disparities thereof.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVIDENCE BASE FOR QI Whereas QI is increasingly used worldwide including resource-rich&#xD;
      settings and resource-limited settings, there is a paucity of scientific evidence assessing&#xD;
      causal impact of QI on health outcomes, particularly the gold standard randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. Studies in resource-limited settings suggest a beneficial effect of QI on measured&#xD;
      healthcare outcomes however none assessed QI rigorously as a single intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GAPS IN THE PMTCT CASCADE AND INFANT NUTRITION Despite worldwide rollout of antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) and efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), there are still&#xD;
      large gaps in coverage with approximately 240,000 infants vertically infected with HIV&#xD;
      worldwide, 89% of whom were from the WHO Africa region. South Africa has a very high&#xD;
      prevalence of HIV, with a national average of 30% amongst antenatal care (ANC) clients. In&#xD;
      the Africa Centre Demographic Surveillance Area (DSA) located within the Hlabisa sub-district&#xD;
      of uMkhanyakude district, the HIV prevalence amongst females of reproductive age (15-49&#xD;
      years) ranged from 20-45% in 2011.KwaZulu-Natal province had the highest prevalence of HIV&#xD;
      amongst ANC clients of 37.4% in 2012. Furthermore, although KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) had the&#xD;
      highest rate of ART coverage amongst HIV-infected pregnant women eligible for ART, the&#xD;
      uMkhanyakude district in KZN had ART coverage of only 73% during the same period, far behind&#xD;
      the national target of 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown inadequate virologic suppression amongst HIV-infected pregnant and&#xD;
      breastfeeding (PBF) mothers, and inadequate repeat HIV testing of HIV-negative mothers during&#xD;
      the PBF period. Surveillance of PBF mothers in Kenya, Malawi and South Africa demonstrated an&#xD;
      HIV seroconversion rate of approximately 4%, illustrating the need to repeat HIV testing&#xD;
      through pregnancy and breastfeeding in order to minimize risk of MTCT. Moreover the rate of&#xD;
      virologic suppression amongst HIV-infected PBF women varied from 27% (in Kenya) to 72% in&#xD;
      Malawi in the same study, and underscores the importance of virologic monitoring to reduce&#xD;
      MTCT through virologic suppression. A study in Kenya demonstrated a repeat HIV testing rate&#xD;
      of approximately 23% in HIV negative mothers. Given the risk of seroconversion during PBF,&#xD;
      the World Health Organisation recommends repeat HIV screening during PBF in high prevalence&#xD;
      settings. Although SA has achieved a commendable reduction in MTCT to 2.7% in 2011 at 6 weeks&#xD;
      of age in line with the UNAIDS call for virtual elimination of MTCT by 2015, these gaps in&#xD;
      PMTCT coverage increase the risk of undetected maternal HIV seroconversion and inadequate&#xD;
      virologic suppression and therefore PMTCT achievements to date may be reversed without&#xD;
      adequate intervention. Furthermore, given the fertility rate of the population, an MTCT rate&#xD;
      of 2.7% with an antenatal HIV prevalence of 30% the number of new infant infections per year&#xD;
      in South Africa is concerning high. Preliminary data from the Africa Centre suggest that less&#xD;
      than 40% HIV-negative pregnant women undergo re-testing for HIV during pregnancy, whilst&#xD;
      approximately 10-20% on lifelong ART (initiated prior to or during the current pregnancy)&#xD;
      have virologic failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important component on the agenda for reducing maternal morbidity and mortality is&#xD;
      preventing unwanted pregnancies through better uptake of family planning methods. However&#xD;
      limitations to contraceptive uptake include lack of knowledge and lack of access in&#xD;
      resource-limited settings. According to UNFPA estimates, contraceptive prevalence in South&#xD;
      Africa is approximately 65% despite free access to most methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although replacement feeding of HIV-exposed infants might mitigate the risk of MTCT, in&#xD;
      resource-limited settings with unreliable access to safe drinking water the high risk of&#xD;
      childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia is associated with high rates of&#xD;
      mortality. As under 5 childhood mortality in these settings can be reduced significantly by&#xD;
      exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), the WHO recommends EBF for HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected&#xD;
      mothers, whilst the importance of ART and virologic suppression are further emphasised. These&#xD;
      recommendations are endorsed by the South African DoH however stigma associated with EBF by&#xD;
      HIV-infected mothers often becomes a barrier to uptake of EBF in general. South Africa had&#xD;
      the lowest rates of EBF in the world in 2012 at just 8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New South African DoH ART guidelines were implemented in January 2015, notably changing PMTCT&#xD;
      guidance to Option B+ (lifelong ART for all pregnant women regardless of CD4 count). HIV&#xD;
      screening every 3 months during PBF is also recommended due to the risk of seroconversions&#xD;
      given the high prevalence of HIV in South Africa. Furthermore, viral load (VL) testing of PBF&#xD;
      on ART is recommended, immediately for those already on ART prior to pregnancy and every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter (assuming VL results are &lt;1000 copies/mL); newly diagnosed PBF women should&#xD;
      receive a VL test 3 months after initiating ART and 6 monthly thereafter (assuming VL results&#xD;
      are &lt;1000 copies/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE CONTEXT OF ANTENATAL AND POSTNATAL CARE SERVICES The Africa Centre for Population Health&#xD;
      is located in the Hlabisa sub-district of uMkhanyakude district in rural KwaZulu-Natal South&#xD;
      Africa. The Africa Centre Demographic Surveillance Area (DSA) covers an area of 438 km2 and&#xD;
      is home to the Africa Centre Household Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS), covering&#xD;
      approximately 90,000 people from 11,000 households annually. The HDSS is a longitudinal&#xD;
      cohort from the early 2000s and collects individual and household information on mortality,&#xD;
      fertility, migration, health status and socio-economic data. This provides a nuanced&#xD;
      understanding of the study population and enables linking of datasets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 7 primary healthcare clinic (PHC) facilities which are nurse-led in the DSA,&#xD;
      providing ANC, PNC and other medical services, and one local district hospital (Hlabisa&#xD;
      hospital) which offers some tertiary care services including routine and emergency obstetric&#xD;
      care. The number of deliveries occurring in Hlabisa sub-district is estimated at about 3000&#xD;
      per annum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local hospital also provides medical doctor support to the PHCs when available. As part&#xD;
      of the National Strategic Plan to improve quality of healthcare services, the DoH has rolled&#xD;
      out District Clinical Specialist Teams (DCST) including a family physician, paediatrician,&#xD;
      anaesthetist, midwife and obstetrician. However the success of staff recruitment to the DCST&#xD;
      has been varied. Finally, a local scoping study (unpublished data) of healthcare staff&#xD;
      demonstrated gaps in training, supervision and retention of staff with consequent impact on&#xD;
      healthcare worker motivation and performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY HYPOTHESIS AND JUSTIFICATION Given the nature of overstretched health services, gaps in&#xD;
      the PMTCT cascade and infant nutrition illustrated above, a QI intervention is considered&#xD;
      most appropriate for optimising clinic processes and therefore healthcare outcomes. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that through a real time data-driven approach, process outcomes can be&#xD;
      continuously monitored, thereby motivating long term sustainability of changes in clinical&#xD;
      practice and improving provider and patient satisfaction with services. Furthermore, QI is a&#xD;
      strategy the South African DoH is committed to, as part of improving quality of health&#xD;
      services and has worked on several projects with the Centre for Rural Health (CRH),&#xD;
      University of KwaZulu-Natal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe this is the first study to causally assess the impact of QI on&#xD;
      specified health care outcomes, utilizing a randomised controlled trial (stepped-wedge) study&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
