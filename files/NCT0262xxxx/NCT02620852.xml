    <textblock>
      Most physicians still use a one-size-fits-all approach to breast screening in which all&#xD;
      women, regardless of their personal history, family history or genetics (except BRCA&#xD;
      carriers) are recommended to have annual mammograms starting at age 40. Mammograms benefit&#xD;
      women by detecting cancers early when they are easier to treat, but they are not perfect.&#xD;
      Recent news stories have discussed some of the potential harms: large numbers of positive&#xD;
      results that cause stressful recalls for additional mammograms and biopsies. With the current&#xD;
      screening approach, half of the women who undergo annual screening for ten years will have at&#xD;
      least one false positive biopsy. Potentially more important are cancer diagnoses for growths&#xD;
      that might never come to clinical attention if left alone (called &quot;overdiagnosis&quot;). This can&#xD;
      lead to unnecessary treatment. Even more concerning is evidence that up to 20% of breast&#xD;
      cancers detected today may fall into the category of &quot;overdiagnosis.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study compares annual screening with a risk-based breast cancer screening schedule,&#xD;
      based upon each woman's personal risk of breast cancer. The investigators have designed the&#xD;
      study to be inclusive of all, so that even women who might be nervous about being randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive a particular type of care (a procedure that is typical in clinical&#xD;
      studies) will still be able to participate by choosing the type of care they receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants in the risk-based screening arm, each woman will receive a personal risk&#xD;
      assessment that includes her family and medical history, breast density measurement and tests&#xD;
      for genes (mutations and variations) linked to the development of breast cancer. Women who&#xD;
      have the highest personal risk of developing breast cancer will receive more frequent&#xD;
      screening, while women with a lower personal risk would receive less frequent screening. No&#xD;
      woman will be screened less than is recommended by the USPSTF breast cancer screening&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this study is successful, women will gain a realistic understanding of their personal risk&#xD;
      of breast cancer as well as strategies to reduce their risk, and fewer women will suffer from&#xD;
      the anxiety of false positive mammograms and unnecessary biopsies. The investigators believe&#xD;
      this study has the potential to transform breast cancer screening in America.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For almost 30 years, annual mammograms for women over 40 have been a cornerstone of the US&#xD;
      strategy to reduce mortality from breast cancer. A number of advances in the understanding of&#xD;
      breast cancer biology, and screening in general, have led to calls to revise and improve&#xD;
      national screening strategies (Esserman et al., 2014). In 2009, the US Preventive Services&#xD;
      Task Force (USPSTF) introduced changes to screening guidelines, recommending that annual&#xD;
      mammograms for all women 40-75 be replaced by biennial screening for women ages 50-75, and&#xD;
      that screening in the 40's should be individualized by taking patient context into account,&#xD;
      including the patient's values regarding specific benefits and harms. Despite being based on&#xD;
      a thorough review of the scientific literature, these recommendations continue to spark&#xD;
      debate and scientific opinion on the effectiveness of annual screening is greatly divided. On&#xD;
      one hand the radiology and obstetrics/gynecology community argues that annual mammograms&#xD;
      starting at 40 reduce the rate of interval cancers. On the other hand, primary care&#xD;
      physicians and other specialists believe that annual screening results in more&#xD;
      false-positives and unnecessary treatment and that a more targeted approach could result in&#xD;
      fewer false-positives and less over-diagnosis without increasing the number of interval&#xD;
      cancers. In fact it has been estimated that half of women will receive a false-positive&#xD;
      recall over 10 years of annual screening and that as many as 20% of all breast cancers might&#xD;
      be overdiagnosed. Since 2009 this debate has intensified, paralyzing the system and thwarting&#xD;
      any efforts to change or improve screening. The end result is that women are frustrated and&#xD;
      confused, and some have stopped screening altogether.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a vastly improved understanding of breast cancer risk, the only criteria used to&#xD;
      establish a woman's screening recommendations is her age (and BRCA status if known), but&#xD;
      there are risk models available that incorporate personal and family history of breast&#xD;
      disease, endocrine exposures and breast density to assess breast cancer risk (Constantino, et&#xD;
      al., 1999; Parmigiani, et al., 1998; Tyrer, et al., 2004; Claus, et al., 2001; Ozanne, et&#xD;
      al., 2003). Most recently certain genetic mutations and common genetic variants (single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) have been confirmed predictors as well (Darabi, et al.,&#xD;
      2012). Therefore, advances in this understanding of breast cancer biology, risk assessment,&#xD;
      and imaging have enabled the creation of better tools and sufficient knowledge to replace the&#xD;
      one-size-fits-all approach to screening and to implement a new, personalized model; one that&#xD;
      provides recommendations on when to start, when to stop, and how often to screen that depend&#xD;
      upon well characterized measures of risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to test a transformational evidence-based approach to breast&#xD;
      screening that educates women about their actual risk, and tailors screening recommendations&#xD;
      to them as individuals. Within the Athena Breast Health Network, the study will compare&#xD;
      comprehensive, patient-centered risk-based screening to annual screening for women starting&#xD;
      at age 40. The comprehensive risk assessment is based on a widely accepted risk model, the&#xD;
      Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium model, that includes endocrine exposures, family&#xD;
      history and breast density, with additional genomic risk factors that include rare and&#xD;
      uncommon major breast cancer susceptibility alleles as well as more common and recently&#xD;
      validated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can, cumulatively, contribute&#xD;
      significantly to a woman's individual risk. The study's personalized approach will recommend&#xD;
      an age to start and stop screening as well as a frequency based upon individual risk. Women&#xD;
      of highest risk will receive greater surveillance than those of lowest risk where the lower&#xD;
      bound is the USPSTF recommended guidelines. In this manner, the study will focus the most&#xD;
      effort on those most likely to develop the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In close collaboration with patient advocates, the study has been designed as a 5-year,&#xD;
      preference-tolerant, 65,000 patient, randomized controlled trial of risk-based versus annual&#xD;
      screening. Individuals uncomfortable with the potential to be assigned to a particular arm in&#xD;
      the randomized cohort can participate in the self-assigned observational cohort, an example&#xD;
      of the pragmatic approach taken. Total accrual is anticipated to be 100,000 women across both&#xD;
      cohorts. A broad group of stakeholders have participated in crafting this approach, including&#xD;
      advocates, payers, the entire range of medical specialists and primary care providers and&#xD;
      researchers involved with breast cancer screening across the entire Athena Network,&#xD;
      technology partners, the Office of the President at the University of California, and&#xD;
      policy-making organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes that risk-based screening will be an improvement over annual screening&#xD;
      because it will be as safe, less morbid, enable more cancer prevention, less stressful and&#xD;
      more readily accepted by women as a result of an improved understanding of their personal&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Athena Breast Health Network was established across the 5 University of California&#xD;
      medical centers to develop a new, harmonized approach to breast cancer prevention, screening&#xD;
      and treatment. Athena is among the few centers in North America to use technology to&#xD;
      integrate risk assessment into breast screening. The investigators have developed a cadre of&#xD;
      &quot;breast health specialists&quot; who provide women with counseling and support around risk and&#xD;
      prevention. There are currently 100,000 registered Athena participants, with 30,000 new&#xD;
      patients per year and growing with the addition of Sanford Health, one of the largest rural&#xD;
      health networks in the country. The primary research mission of Athena is to address issues&#xD;
      requiring a population-based approach and translate solutions to clinical practice. Athena is&#xD;
      uniquely positioned to address the screening controversy and provide women with renewed&#xD;
      confidence in decisions about their breast health. Risk-based screening for breast cancer is&#xD;
      exactly the advanced, evidence-based approach to medicine described in the NIH and FDA's&#xD;
      &quot;Path to Personalized Medicine&quot;. If these hypotheses prove to be correct, this study will be&#xD;
      able to establish a clear justification for its use, and provide a framework for widespread&#xD;
      implementation that will benefit women across the country.&#xD;
