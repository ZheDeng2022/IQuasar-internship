    <textblock>
      Haemophilia A is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of factor VIII&#xD;
      (FVIII). Patients with severe hemophilia A have a FVIII plasma concentration less than1 IU/dL&#xD;
      and experience spontaneous and trauma-induced bleeds. Joint bleeds lead to hemophilic&#xD;
      arthropathy resulting in progressive disability. Patients with moderate hemophilia (FVIII&#xD;
      level between 1-5 IU/dL) are characterized by fewer hemarthroses, usually trauma-induced, and&#xD;
      a decreased likelihood of developing arthropathy. This clinical observation led to the use of&#xD;
      prophylactic FVIII infusions to convert patient´s bleeding phenotype from severe to moderate&#xD;
      with the result of decreasing or preventing arthropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic regimens may be effective when based on standard fixed-dose protocols (that&#xD;
      assumes one approach fits all patients) or phenotypic dosing determined by bleeding patterns,&#xD;
      but do not protect all patients with severe haemophilia from joint damage caused by&#xD;
      spontaneous or activity-triggered bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individualized treatment in haemophilia A takes into consideration all available information&#xD;
      about the patient, not only his phenotypic bleeding pattern. Some of the factors that&#xD;
      contribute to the observed interpatient variability include baseline or residual FVIII&#xD;
      activity, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the replacement factor, the individual's level&#xD;
      of physical activity and perceived risk of traumatic bleeding, the presence or absence of&#xD;
      joint disease, presence of comorbidities and adherence to the dosing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identify and analyze cause(s) of poor bleeding control in patients on prophylaxis treatment&#xD;
      and study the clinical impact of a &quot;personalized pilot program&quot; with a 1 year follow up to&#xD;
      act on the specific causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe PK parameters in patients on prophylaxis treatment with Advate®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analyze differences in PK parameters in non-controlled vs well controlled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify causes of poor clinical outcome in non-controlled patients. Patients'&#xD;
           individual variables that influence bleeding risk will be studied (individual PK,&#xD;
           bleeding pattern, joint status, physical activity, life style and patient's adherence).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study the improvement in clinical outcomes (ABR and Joint status) of a 1 year&#xD;
           Personalized Prophylaxis Program that acts specifically on the previously identified&#xD;
           causes of bleeding in non-controlled patients (named: short half-life, high bleeding&#xD;
           pattern, joint damage, high risk physical activity, active life style and poor patient's&#xD;
           adherence).&#xD;

      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is standard prophylaxis effective for all hemophilia A patient?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which are the causes for poor clinical response in some patients on prophylactic&#xD;
           treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can differences in PK impact the clinical outcome and effectiveness of prophylaxis?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For a given group of poor controlled patients in standard prophylaxis, may personalized&#xD;
           prophylaxis improve clinical outcome when acting on the specific cause(s)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Background &amp; Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemophilia A is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of factor VIII&#xD;
      (FVIII). Patients with severe hemophilia A have a FVIII plasma concentration less than1 IU/dL&#xD;
      and experience spontaneous and trauma-induced bleeds. Joint bleeds lead to hemophilic&#xD;
      arthropathy resulting in progressive disability. Patients with moderate hemophilia (FVIII&#xD;
      level between 1-5 IU/dL) are characterized by fewer hemarthroses, usually trauma-induced, and&#xD;
      a decreased likelihood of developing arthropathy. This clinical observation led to the use of&#xD;
      prophylactic FVIII infusions to convert patient´s bleeding phenotype from severe to moderate&#xD;
      with the result of decreasing or preventing arthropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic regimens may be effective when based on standard fixed-dose protocols (that&#xD;
      assumes one approach fits all patients) or phenotypic dosing determined by bleeding patterns,&#xD;
      but do not protect all patients with severe haemophilia from joint damage caused by&#xD;
      spontaneous or activity-triggered bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individualized treatment in haemophilia A takes into consideration all available information&#xD;
      about the patient, not only his phenotypic bleeding pattern. Some of the factors that&#xD;
      contribute to the observed interpatient variability include baseline or residual FVIII&#xD;
      activity, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the replacement factor, the individual's level&#xD;
      of physical activity and perceived risk of traumatic bleeding, the presence or absence of&#xD;
      joint disease, genotype, presence of comorbidities and adherence to the dosing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PK response to FVIII varies between patients and this has important clinical implications&#xD;
      for treatment. Although PK is affected by patient characteristics, this relationship is too&#xD;
      weak to infer a result for an individual and, if required, PK must be measured. An important&#xD;
      determinant of the efficacy of prophylaxis is the length of time an individual spends with a&#xD;
      low level of coagulation factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the existing International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)&#xD;
      guidelines measurement of PK in clinical practice requires in adult patients a total of 8&#xD;
      samples (5 in children) to be taken over a period of 48 h. It requires significant commitment&#xD;
      in time from the patient, and family and overnight hospital admission may be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bayesian estimation method uses a population PK model based on FVIII levels from a large&#xD;
      population of patients as a mathematical/ statistical framework to estimate the PK in an&#xD;
      individual patient from minimal data. Several studies employed this technique for FVIII in a&#xD;
      limited number of patients. Using this strategy, a patient´s coagulation factor half-life may&#xD;
      be calculated from two or three time points, reducing the inconvenience to the patient, the&#xD;
      discomfort of venipuncture and the cost of sample handing and assays. This methodology can&#xD;
      facilitate measurement of PK in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge of the individual's PK response to the replacement factor helps to determine both&#xD;
      the dosing level as well as the frequency of administration needed to achieve optimal levels&#xD;
      of the deficient hemostatic factor. In particular, achieving ideal peak levels helps reduce&#xD;
      the risk of bleeding related to repetitive physical activity, whereas minimizing the time&#xD;
      spent at trough levels below 1 IU/dL helps to reduce breakthrough bleeding events . The&#xD;
      effect of patient´s FVIII half-life will potentially have a significant impact of&#xD;
      prophylactic regimens, whereas changing the frequency of dosing and increasing the dose/kg of&#xD;
      FVIII has a smaller effect on the through level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different trough levels may be targeted, depending on circumstances: higher levels may be&#xD;
      desired to manage target joints, highly active patients, or those more prone to bleeding;&#xD;
      alternatively, lower levels may be allowed in a patient who has not bled for a long time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Last studies demonstrated that the utility of prophylaxis dose tailoring with individual PK&#xD;
      with similar results than phenotypic dosing but with fewer infusions, and maybe, this option&#xD;
      could increase treatment adherence. Besides, the PK monitoring could be more cost-effective&#xD;
      dosing compared to standard dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to prophylaxis regimens is another patient-specific factor that influences plasma&#xD;
      levels and bleeding risk. There are two definitions of adherence in haemophilia, adherence as&#xD;
      the percentage of infusions within a specified dose range (adherence to dose) and the&#xD;
      percentage of weeks without missed doses (adherence to frequency). Different studies showed&#xD;
      that bleedings rate was higher in nonadherent patients, being older patients more likely to&#xD;
      miss doses. Strategies to improve adherence would be expected to decrease the number of&#xD;
      bleeds, whereas poor adherence make PK dose tailoring irrelevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of sparse blood sampling and Bayesian analysis for measuring pharmacokinetics, and for&#xD;
      the use of this information to tailor doses in prophylaxis has been previously reported.&#xD;
      Clinical implementation of these methods with all the available information of the patient&#xD;
      (bleeding pattern, joint status, genetic mutation, adherence, etc.), is lacking. Exploratory&#xD;
      studies on the use of PK tailored prophylaxis are required to establish the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of this approach. This procedure could allow individualization of treatment by the&#xD;
      routine determination of individual pharmacokinetics in the clinic, potentially making&#xD;
      prophylaxis more cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identify and analyze cause(s) of poor bleeding control in patients on prophylaxis treatment&#xD;
      and study the clinical impact of a &quot;personalized pilot program&quot; with a 1 year follow up to&#xD;
      act on the specific causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe PK parameters in patients on prophylaxis treatment with Advate®&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analyze differences in PK parameters in non-controlled vs well controlled patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify causes of poor clinical outcome in non-controlled patients. Patients'&#xD;
           individual variables that influence bleeding risk will be studied (individual PK,&#xD;
           bleeding pattern, joint status, physical activity, life style and patient's adherence).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study the improvement in clinical outcomes (ABR and Joint status) of a 1 year&#xD;
           Personalized Prophylaxis Program that acts specifically on the previously identified&#xD;
           causes of bleeding in non-controlled patients (named: short half-life, high bleeding&#xD;
           pattern, joint damage, high risk physical activity, active life style and poor patient's&#xD;
           adherence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of subject participation: One year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total number of subjects to be enrolled: 25-30 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific details of Treatment/Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, open-label, observational study will be performed at the Hospital&#xD;
      Universitari i Politecnic La Fe in Valencia, Spain. This study will include patients with&#xD;
      severe and moderate haemophilia A in prophylactic treatment with rFVIII (Advate®).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The study will start with the determination of individual PK by sparse blood sampling&#xD;
           (2-3 blood samples) and Bayesian analysis (using myPKFiT Medical Device). The PK&#xD;
           parameters of the cohort of patients in prophylaxis with Advate® will be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients will be divided in two groups according to the clinical outcome (Bleeding&#xD;
           Episodes) in the previous year:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Well controlled patients: Patients with an adequate disease control with the&#xD;
                routine clinical practice (AJBR≤2, non-severe ABR≤5 and severe ABR≤2) (Ministerio&#xD;
                de Sanidad, Servicios Sociales e Igualdad. Gobierno de España; 2012)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Poor controlled patients: Patients with poor disease control, based on the&#xD;
                international guidelines: AJBR&gt;2, ABR&gt;2 for severe BE or ABR &gt;5 for non-severe BE&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Differences in PK parameters in these 2 groups will be analyzed and compared adjusting&#xD;
           by age and weight:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Half-life (h) b. Clearance (dl/h) c. Volume on steady state (L) d. Time to FVIII&#xD;
           level below 1% (h)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Non-controlled patients will be studied and interviewed to identify causes of poor&#xD;
           disease control. Patients' individual variables that influence bleeding risk will be&#xD;
           studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Individual PK parameters (See bullet point 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Bleeding pattern: Haemophilia Severity Score&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Joint status (Gilbert score and HJHS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Physical activity: Category Risk 1, 2 or 3&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Patient's adherence: Adherence index (AI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After identifying in each patient the individual cause(s) of poor bleeding control, a&#xD;
           &quot;Pilot Program on Personalized Prophylaxis&quot; will be designed to act on the specific&#xD;
           factors that may cause bleeding despite prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Shorter half-life compared to Advate PK Population (graph displayed in myPKFiT)&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Prophylaxis will be adjusted to individual PK using the recommendation of myPKFiT&#xD;
                Medical Device*.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patients with bleeding phenotype: HSS &gt;0.79 (for severe HA) or HSS&gt;0.47 (for&#xD;
                moderate HA)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Prophylaxis will be adjusted to increase through level according to bleeding&#xD;
                     phenotype*&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Patients with joint damage and at least one target joint (at least score of 3 in&#xD;
                the Gilbert scale and /or at least score of 3 in the Pettersson scale and/or&#xD;
                Chronic synovitis evidenced by ultrasound.) • Prophylaxis will be adjusted to&#xD;
                increase through level according to Joint status*&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Physical activity: Category &gt;1&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Prophylaxis will be adjusted to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Match the day of physical activity with the day of infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increase through level according to physical activity*&#xD;
&#xD;
           e. Patient's with poor adherence:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Monthly sessions together with the psychologist and pharmacist of the HTC will be&#xD;
           scheduled to address adherence issues. myPKFiT displayed graphs will be used to explain&#xD;
           availability and elimination of FVIII from the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
           *All these dose adjustments will be made not only based on clinical data, but also based&#xD;
           on the knowledge and experience of the responsible physician of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Using a prospective design, patients will be studied during 12 months following the start&#xD;
      of the &quot;Personalized Prophylaxis Program&quot;. Patient´s clinical state will be assessed at least&#xD;
      2 times per year (normally 2-4 visits per year depending on disease severity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AJBR and ABR (severe, non-severe, spontaneous or traumatic bleeding episodes) will be&#xD;
           collected at month 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Joint status, Gilbert and HJS will be measures at month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adherence index (AI) will be calculated at month 12&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quality of Life will be measures at month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  This study will be conducted without significant changes in medical treatment of&#xD;
                patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The study is currently in approval process by the local Clinical Research&#xD;
                     Ethics Committee and will be conducted in accordance with the declaration of&#xD;
                     Helsinki and its amendments. An informed consent will be obtained from the&#xD;
                     patients included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed with the R software (version 3.2.2). Data will be&#xD;
      described with the mean, standard deviation, median and interquartile range for quantitative&#xD;
      variables and relative and absolute frequencies for categorical variables. P-values &lt; 0.05&#xD;
      will be considered statistically significant. For all the analyses, the Institution's&#xD;
      Biostatistical Unit will support this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-parametric statistical method (Wilcoxon test) will be used for simple comparisons&#xD;
      between PK parameters of both groups of patients (clinically controlled and uncontrolled with&#xD;
      prophylaxis treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of time below 1 IU/dL, Vss, Cl and half-life on annual bleeding rates (ABR and&#xD;
      AJBR) will be analyzed by multivariate analyses in both groups. Multivariate analysis on&#xD;
      annual bleeding rates (as a dependent variable) will be performed separately for each of the&#xD;
      potential factors associated with bleed rate such as PK parameters, physical activity,&#xD;
      adherence to treatment schedule and quality of life. In all instances a regression model&#xD;
      utilizing the negative binomial distribution will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annualized FVIII consumption and rates of treatment related AEs for each prophylaxis group&#xD;
      will be compared using a Mann-Whitney U-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of 25-30 patients has been calculated to provide 90% power to detect a mean&#xD;
      treatment difference of four ABR or AJBR episodes with two-sided a = 0.05, assuming a&#xD;
      standard deviation (SD) of 6 ABR or AJBR episodes in six months. The sample size assumed an&#xD;
      ABR variance of at least that observed for compliant subjects in a previous study. Sample&#xD;
      size has been calculated using NQUERY, version 5.0, module MOT 1-1 (Statistical Solutions,&#xD;
      Saugus, MA, USA).&#xD;
