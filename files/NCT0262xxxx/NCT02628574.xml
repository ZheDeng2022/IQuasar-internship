  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in 5 parts (Parts A, B, C, D and E).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monotherapy Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects ≥18 years with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled in the study. Monotherapy dose&#xD;
      escalation will be performed in Part A. Cycle 1 data from each cohort will be evaluated for&#xD;
      safety and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) prior to dose escalation. Subjects will be&#xD;
      assigned to a cohort in the order screening is completed. Dose will depend upon the cohort in&#xD;
      which a patient is enrolled and cohorts will be dosed consecutively by ascending dose. Once&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been identified, an&#xD;
      expanded cohort will be enrolled (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects ≥18 years with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive TRX518 in combination with gemcitabine (Part C), pembrolizumab (Part D), or nivolumab&#xD;
      (Part E). Dose escalation will be performed for each part (Part Cesc, Part Desc, Part Eesc)&#xD;
      and Cycle 1 data from each cohort will be evaluated for safety and dose-limiting toxicities&#xD;
      (DLTs) prior to dose escalation. Subjects will be assigned to a cohort in the order screening&#xD;
      is completed. Dose will depend upon the cohort in which a patient is enrolled and cohorts&#xD;
      will be dosed consecutively by ascending dose. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or&#xD;
      maximum administered dose (MAD) has been identified, an expanded cohort will be enrolled&#xD;
      (Part Cexp, Part Dexp, Part Eexp).&#xD;
