  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subclinical atherosclerosis is identified in roughly 2/3rd of otherwise healthy young adults.&#xD;
      How much physical activity is required to prevent progression of subclinical atherosclerosis?&#xD;
      In the 85% of healthy younger Canadian men and women who do NOT perform the recommended 150&#xD;
      min/week of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) as recommended, is it&#xD;
      reasonable to aim for a lower regimen of light physical activity (LPA) despite the absence of&#xD;
      supporting literature, or to the contrary should the investigators insist on achieving MVPA?&#xD;
      In this perspective, MoMA provides a unique opportunity to determine whether LPA vs. MVPA is&#xD;
      necessary to limit subclinical atherosclerosis progression in inactive otherwise healthy&#xD;
      adults. Resolving such unknowns should inform strategies to prevent decades of silent disease&#xD;
      progression leading to future morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains rampant in developed regions, topping the list of causes&#xD;
      of mortality leading to 29% of all deaths. In addition to mortality, the economic impact of&#xD;
      morbidity and hospitalization related to CVD costs Canadians over $22.2 billion every year.&#xD;
      By far the leading cause of CVD is atherosclerosis defined as a thickening of the arterial&#xD;
      wall with fatty deposits. Therefore, atherosclerosis is the underlying mechanism behind the&#xD;
      #1 cause of mortality and morbidity in developed regions. Autopsy studies performed in&#xD;
      healthy casualties of the Korean, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan Wars revealed that&#xD;
      atherosclerosis is present in up to 78% of young men before their 30th birthday, even in the&#xD;
      absence of traditional risk factors (high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, obesity). Prevention&#xD;
      of atherosclerosis and its silent progression towards clinical events decades later should&#xD;
      therefore become a priority in all young adults. A potentially powerful avenue of&#xD;
      cardiovascular prevention lies in the reduction of subclinical atherosclerosis progression in&#xD;
      younger adults through physical activity. Unfortunately, only 15% of Canadians meet the&#xD;
      current recommendations for 150min/week of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity&#xD;
      (MVPA). In response to the observation that Canadians simply don't find time for/or do not&#xD;
      appear to value current recommendations, it was suggested that even light-intensity physical&#xD;
      activity (LPA) might improve biomarker levels compared to a sedentary lifestyle. It appears&#xD;
      that in the face of failed attempts to convince Canadians to perform 150min/week of MVPA,&#xD;
      expectations towards LPA have been lowered despite the absence of convincing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MoMA is a randomized controlled trial to study the effects of two doses of physical activity&#xD;
      on subclinical atherosclerosis burden progression; 270 inactive men and women aged 18-40&#xD;
      years without CVD or risk factors will be enrolled. At baseline, risk factors, physical&#xD;
      activity level and nutritional habits will be measured through validated questionnaires;&#xD;
      blood work and anthropometric parameters measurements will be performed (markers of&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk); fitness level will be assessed through treadmill test and&#xD;
      accelerometer; magnetic resonance imaging of carotid atherosclerosis, liver and adipose&#xD;
      tissue will be performed.&#xD;
