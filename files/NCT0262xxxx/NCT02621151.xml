  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is to assess the efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK3475) added to concurrent radiation&#xD;
      and gemcitabine in the management of patients with muscle-invasive urothelial cancer who are&#xD;
      not candidates for or decline radical cystectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the addition of immune checkpoint inhibition with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 inhibitor, to chemo-radiation therapy to the bladder may work to&#xD;
      both increase eradication of local tumor as well as distant micrometastases through&#xD;
      heightened immune surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the lack of a previous phase I trial establishing the safety of this combination&#xD;
      (pembrolizumab, gemcitabine, and radiation therapy (RT)), an initial safety lead-in cohort of&#xD;
      3 to 6 patients is enrolled for assessing dose-limiting toxicities. Similar to the Phase I&#xD;
      3+3 design, if there is no or only one patient in that cohort experiencing a dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity, the trial continues to the Phase II part to enroll additional 48 patients for&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation.&#xD;
