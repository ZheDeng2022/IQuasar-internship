             with cytarabine/anthracycline based chemotherapy, with or without a tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             inhibitor. *Refractory to induction therapy is defined as never achieving CR, CRi or&#xD;
             CRp (according to International Working Group criteria) after one line of intensive&#xD;
             regimen for AML (re-induction, consolidation and/or transplant allowed) including at&#xD;
             least one cytarabine containing induction block with a total dose no less than&#xD;
             700mg/m² per cycle and 3 days of an anthracycline with or without a TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             or&#xD;
&#xD;
             **First relapse is defined as untreated hematologic relapse (according to&#xD;
             International Working Group criteria) after one line of intensive regimen for AML&#xD;
             (re-induction, consolidation and/or transplant allowed) including at least one&#xD;
             cytarabine containing induction block with a total dose no less than 700mg/m² per&#xD;
             cycle and 3 days of an anthracycline with or without a TKI that induced a CR/CRi/CRp.&#xD;
             Subjects are allowed to receive induction, consolidation, transplant and/or&#xD;
             maintenance prior to achieving their first CR/CRi/CRp.&#xD;
