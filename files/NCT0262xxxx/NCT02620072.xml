    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from an autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta&#xD;
      cells. The process of autoimmune destruction is identified by circulating islet&#xD;
      autoantibodies to beta cell antigens, and is mediated by a lack of immunological&#xD;
      self-tolerance. Self-tolerance is achieved by T cell exposure to antigen in the thymus or&#xD;
      periphery in a manner that deletes autoreactive effector T cells or induces regulatory T&#xD;
      cells. Immunological tolerance can be achieved by administration of antigen under appropriate&#xD;
      conditions. Evidence is now emerging in humans that these approaches may be effective in&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis and allergy. Administration of oral&#xD;
      insulin in multiple islet autoantibody-positive children offers the potential for inducing&#xD;
      immunological tolerance to beta cells and thereby protect against further development&#xD;
      progression to type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a disease that predominantly affects children. T1D is preceded by&#xD;
      islet autoimmunity, which often starts in early childhood and which has a peak incidence at&#xD;
      around 1 to 2 years of age. Previous studies show that multiple islet autoantibodies indicate&#xD;
      a point of limited return in the path to T1D. Every year, around 10% of multiple islet&#xD;
      autoantibody positive children progress from islet autoantibody positivity to symptomatic&#xD;
      T1D. Thus, therapy and intervention is needed to change the inevitable path to insulin&#xD;
      dependence. Treated should be initiated early when most beta cells are still intact and when&#xD;
      the autoimmune process is less advanced may be more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of oral insulin in multiple islet autoantibody-positive children offers the&#xD;
      potential for immunological tolerance against beta cells and thereby protect against&#xD;
      progression to T1D. Previous studies in rodents had indicated that mucosal administration of&#xD;
      insulin is effective in inducing regulatory immune responses that can prevent autoimmune&#xD;
      diabetes. Mouse studies indicated that the dose of oral insulin is important. In human&#xD;
      studies oral insulin administration shows an excellent safety profile, without adverse side&#xD;
      effects at doses between 2.5 and 7.5 mg per day (1-3). The administration of oral insulin&#xD;
      (7.5 mg per day) to prediabetic ICA and IAA positive first degree relatives of T1D patients&#xD;
      within the DPT-1 study showed no significant beneficial effect in the intention to treat&#xD;
      analysis. A sub-analysis of the data, however, showed significant benefit in those relatives&#xD;
      with higher titer IAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pre-POINT study, the first primary autoantigen vaccination dose-finding study in which&#xD;
      children with high genetic risk for type 1 diabetes were administered insulin orally daily&#xD;
      tested doses (2.5 mg; 7.5 mg; 22.5 mg and 67.5 mg) showed five of six children exposed to a&#xD;
      dose of 67.5 mg insulin had evidence of an antibody or T cell response to insulin. The&#xD;
      response differed to the typical responses seen in children who develop diabetes in that the&#xD;
      antibody responses were of weak affinity and the T cell responses had a preponderance of&#xD;
      cells with regulatory T cell phenotypes (37). These results are also encouraging from a&#xD;
      safety viewpoint and indicate that oral exposure to insulin at doses that are approximately&#xD;
      equivalent to efficacious doses in rodents may promote tolerance in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary prevention study using 7.5 mg oral insulin administered daily is currently&#xD;
      conducted by the TrialNet Study Group, and includes the Forschergruppe Diabetes, Klinikum&#xD;
      rechts der Isar der Technischen Universität München as a study site. Autoantibody,&#xD;
      normoglycemic subjects aged 3 to 45 years are treated with oral insulin. In this currently&#xD;
      conducted trial there have been no safety issues reported thus far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active substance for oral application is human insulin, synthesized in a special&#xD;
      non-disease-producing laboratory strain of Escherichia coli bacteria that has been&#xD;
      genetically altered by the addition of the gene for human insulin production (Lilly&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA). The physical, chemical and pharmaceutical&#xD;
      properties of the human insulin have been well documented by the manufacturer. Oral Insulin&#xD;
      will be applied as a capsule containing 7.5 mg of the active substance together with filling&#xD;
      substance cellulose and a dose escalation to 67.5 mg of the active substance together with&#xD;
      filling substance cellulose. After ingestion, most of the insulin will be degraded by gastric&#xD;
      acids. Enteric delivery and systemic availability is therefore unlikely and efficacy of&#xD;
      active insulin is likely to be restricted to the oral mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fr1da Insulin Intervention Study intends doses for oral application at 7.5 mg and 67.5 mg&#xD;
      per day. The aim of the study is to determine whether daily administration of up to 67.5 mg&#xD;
      insulin to young children aged 2 years to 12 years with multiple islet autoantibodies alters&#xD;
      the immune responses to insulin over an intervention period of 12 months and whether an&#xD;
      altered immune response is associated with protection from developing dysglycemia or diabetes&#xD;
      and whether oral insulin treatment reduces the rate of progression to dysglycemia or&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune response to oral insulin treatment has not yet been demonstrated to indicate&#xD;
      protection from disease. To address this, the Fr1da Insulin Intervention Study included&#xD;
      dysglycemia as a co-primary outcome in the trial, through novel data indicating that&#xD;
      dysglycemia is a valid outcome on the path to type 1 diabetes. Once such dysglycemia is&#xD;
      present in multiple autoantibody positive subjects, there is an average time of 2 years to&#xD;
      clinical symptomatic diabetes.&#xD;

    <description>Immune response measures will be salivary IgA antibodies to insulin, blood CD4+ T cell responses to insulin, and autoantibodies to insulin.
