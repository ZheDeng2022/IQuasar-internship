    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with high risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)&#xD;
      unresponsive to Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) therapy and who are considered ineligible for&#xD;
      or have refused to undergo radical cystectomy, will receive pembrolizumab therapy. The&#xD;
      primary study hypothesis is that treatment with pembrolizumab will result in a clinically&#xD;
      meaningful response.&#xD;
