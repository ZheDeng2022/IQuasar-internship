    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of cashew nut consumption on traditional and emerging markers&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and determines the usable energy content of a serving of&#xD;
      cashew nuts for accurate food labelling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cardioprotective effects of nuts have been well documented in the scientific literature;&#xD;
      however, most of the research has been done with almonds, walnuts, and pistachios, while&#xD;
      studies with cashew nuts are lacking. In addition to the cardiovascular literature, our&#xD;
      recent studies measuring the metabolizable energy of nuts have demonstrated that the measured&#xD;
      energy value of almonds, pistachios, and walnuts is lower than that predicted using the&#xD;
      Atwater factors. However, the measured energy value of cashew nuts is unknown. There are two&#xD;
      distinct aims of this study - determining the effects of cashew nut consumption on risk&#xD;
      factors of CVD, and determining the energy value of cashew nuts in the human diet. The&#xD;
      cardiovascular effects of cashew nuts will be determined by measuring both traditional and&#xD;
      emerging risk factors. The metabolizable energy value of cashew nuts will be calculated based&#xD;
      on the chemical composition and energy content of the consumed diet and excreta. This will&#xD;
      provide a better estimate of the energy value than simply calculating energy value based on&#xD;
      Atwater factors.&#xD;
