  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-dose rate brachytherapy (HDRB) used as monotherapy is emerging as an alternative to&#xD;
      Low-Dose Rate brachytherapy (LDRB) with excellent PSA-progression free survival as high as&#xD;
      90-100% for favorable prostate cancer at a median follow-up of 3-5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HDRB has many advantages over LDRB such as prospective dosimetry not impacted by setup&#xD;
      errors, organ motion and prostate swelling during treatment delivery. In addition, HDRB&#xD;
      causes less acute and late urinary toxicity compared with LDRB. Acute urinary retention can&#xD;
      lead to prolonged catheterization, pericatheter urine leakage, urinary tract infection and&#xD;
      Trans-Urethral Resection of the Prostate resulting in diminished quality of life (QOL) and&#xD;
      increased psychological distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the investigators' phase II randomized study is to evaluate the differences in&#xD;
      QOL in the urinary domain between patients with favourable intermediate risk or extensive&#xD;
      low-risk prostate cancer treated with LDRB and HDRB at 3 months using the Expanded Prostate&#xD;
      Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) QOL scores. The 3 months cut-off endpoint has been chosen since&#xD;
      HDRB-induced urinary toxicity subsides at 12 weeks compared to 12 months with LDRB. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives include: bowel and sexual domain EPIC scores and International Prostate Symptom&#xD;
      Score. The absolute PSA nadir and a prostate biopsy at 36 months will be reported to assess&#xD;
      local control.&#xD;

      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the differences in QOL in the urinary domain between patients treated with&#xD;
      Low-Dose Rate Brachytherapy (LDRB) and High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy (HDRB) at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare LDRB vs. HDR as related to the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite&#xD;
           (EPIC) score in the bowel and sexual domain at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate differences in urinary function using the IPSS which, will be filled in by&#xD;
           the patient at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To report acute and long-term urinary, sexual and gastro-intestinal toxicity using the&#xD;
           Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 at each patient's&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To report the dose to the bladder neck defined as 5 mm around the Foley catheter from&#xD;
           the bottom of the Foley balloon to the prostatic urethra with a volume of at least 2 cc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess local control by performing prostate rebiopsy after radiotherapy at 36 months&#xD;
           to assess treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The absolute Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA) nadir value will be reported as a&#xD;
           secondary objective by PSA measurements every 6 months after the procedure.&#xD;
