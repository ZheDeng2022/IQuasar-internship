  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection can be efficiently controlled by antiretroviral therapy (ART), with in 2013&#xD;
      nearly 85 % of patients having a suppressed viremia, but HIV cannot, however, be eradicated&#xD;
      with ART alone [1]. Overall, HIV has moved from a fatal to a chronic disease provided&#xD;
      treatment is maintained life-long. Despite major improvement in antiretroviral drugs in terms&#xD;
      of efficacy, tolerability and simplicity, life-long therapy is still associated with drug&#xD;
      toxicity. Several drugs or drug classes, which have historically saved lives since 1996 and&#xD;
      are currently widely used such as protease inhibitors and nucleosides analogues, are&#xD;
      associated with long-term toxicities and increased incidence of comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, worldwide there is an approximated 10 millions of HIV infected patients under&#xD;
      cART. This number should increase in the next years, as most recent guidelines recommend&#xD;
      earlier therapy given the benefits in terms of disease progression and prevention of&#xD;
      transmission. Because of the increasing number of patients who will be under cART in the&#xD;
      future, the cumulative ART toxicity, the difficulties to access ART in some areas of the&#xD;
      world, the fatigue expressed by patients about ART and the cost issues, there is an urgent&#xD;
      need to search for HIV CURE. To date, only two cases of sterilizing HIV cure were reported so&#xD;
      far: the famous &quot;Berlin Patient&quot; after two homozygous Delta32-CCR5 bone-marrow grafts for an&#xD;
      acute leukemia [2], and the Mississipi baby after very early initiation of cART 31 hours&#xD;
      after delivery [3]. However those cases of sterilizing HIV cure remain exceptional and the&#xD;
      alternative objective of a functional HIV cure appears to be more realistic, though still&#xD;
      described in rare groups of patients like Elite controllers (EC) and post treatment&#xD;
      controllers (PTC) patients. In addition new and complex therapeutic strategies are currently&#xD;
      proposed to try purging the HIV reservoirs, but none of them proved so far able to reach this&#xD;
      goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the objective of finding a Cure to HIV [4] requires first to better understand the&#xD;
      basic mechanisms of the persistence of HIV reservoirs in the population of&#xD;
      chronically-infected fully-suppressed HIV+ patients in order to define future therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extremely low levels of HIV reservoirs are achievable in some chronically-infected patients&#xD;
      durably controlled with cART. Despite the multiplicity and heterogeneity of factors governing&#xD;
      the persistence of HIV reservoirs, such low levels of HIV reservoirs seem necessary, though&#xD;
      probably not sufficient, to reach the status of functional cure defined by virus control in&#xD;
      the absence of treatment. The mechanisms associated with these low HIV reservoirs in chronic&#xD;
      treated infection are unknown but might involve a low immune activation and inflammatory&#xD;
      environment, and deleterious HIV mutations. Understanding those mechanisms will provide novel&#xD;
      clues for future strategies aiming at obtaining an HIV Cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of RESACHRON Study is to define in chronically infected patients with&#xD;
      suppressed viremia, cART and extremely low levels of HIV reservoirs, the viral and cellular&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying the persistence, the size and the distribution of these HIV reservoirs&#xD;
      among the various CD4 T cell-subpopulations via a comprehensive analysis using innovative&#xD;
      highly miniaturized and complementary immunological and virological assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our first hypothesis is that HIV reservoirs persist even in patients with low to undetectable&#xD;
      HIV-DNA in the total PBMCs, and can be detected ex vivo or give rise to HIV production in&#xD;
      some CD4 T cells subsets due to the mean 10-fold enrichment in peripheral blood TCM and TTM&#xD;
      cells. The sorting of the various sorted CD4 TN, TCM, TTM, TEM and other key subsets will&#xD;
      thus allow to test whether and in which subset:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the virus genome is intact or contains deletions interfering with its replicative&#xD;
           capacity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HIV production can be induced in vitro after distinct activation signals,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. HIV transcripts are detectable ex-vivo,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Low immune activation and inflammatory environment is associated with these extremely&#xD;
           low HIV reservoirs levels by testing a series of plasma pro-inflammatory molecules&#xD;
           together with cell surface activation markers and intra-cellular transcriptional&#xD;
           signatures .&#xD;
