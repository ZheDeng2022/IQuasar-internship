  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravitreal injection of up to 2 mg of infliximab has proved to be safe in animal models&#xD;
      (rabbits and primates). These studies have shown no evidence of intraocular inflammation or&#xD;
      toxicity by clinical, electrophysiological, and histopathological examination for up to 90&#xD;
      days even with 3 repeated monthly injections. However, the study conducted by Rassi et al was&#xD;
      the only one to report the development of severe intraocular inflammation in one eye out of&#xD;
      12 rabbit eyes at 90 days following 3 intravitreal injections (2mg monthly). Unfortunately,&#xD;
      clinical studies conducted on patients, so far, have raised serious concern about its safety&#xD;
      and adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These clinical studies have shown various and inconsistent results in terms of the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of intravitreal infliximab. These studies were conducted on patients with refractory&#xD;
      as well as naïve cases of age related macular degenerations choroidal neovascularization (AMD&#xD;
      CNV), diabetic macular edema (DME), central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), angiomatous&#xD;
      malformations, pseudophakic macular edema, and uveitis. The doses used ranged from 0.5mg to&#xD;
      2mg. The initial study by Theodossaidis et al in 2009 did not report any intraocular&#xD;
      inflammation in 3 patients receiving 2 intravitreal injections of 1 and 2 mg for refractory&#xD;
      AMD CNV with 7 months follow up period.(8) Later several clinical studies have reported&#xD;
      severe intraocular inflammation following intravitreal injections of infliximab in&#xD;
      non-uveitic patients.These collected data have initiated a call for cautious use of&#xD;
      intravitreal infliximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, studies investigating intravitreal infliximab in uveitis patients have&#xD;
      shown improvement in vision, reduction in macular thickness on optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (OCT), and reduction in inflammation. In this study, we have investigated the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of 3 consecutive intravitreal infliximab injections (1 mg/0.05 mL, 6 weeks apart) in&#xD;
      carefully selected group of patients with refractory uveitis in Behcet's disease.&#xD;

      Approval of the study was obtained from the hospital's ethical committee. The study design&#xD;
      and methodology followed the tenets of Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were provided&#xD;
      with written informed consent and received a thorough explanation of the study design, aims,&#xD;
      and the off-label use of infliximab, its potential risks, and benefits. This is a prospective&#xD;
      non-comparative interventional study. The study was conducted on 20 eyes of 20 patients with&#xD;
      refractory posterior uveitis in Behçet's disease who received 3 consecutive intravitreal&#xD;
      injections of infliximab (1 mg/0.05 ml) 6 weeks apart. Behçet's diseases was diagnosed based&#xD;
      on the International Criteria for Behçet's Disease (ICBD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were subjected to the following initial examinations: best-corrected visual acuity&#xD;
      (BCVA) measurement; slit-Lamp examination; measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) by Goldman&#xD;
      applanation tonometry; dilated fundus examination by indirect ophthalmoscope; and slit-lamp&#xD;
      biomicroscopy including vitritis grading (0-4) and presence or absence of vasculitis,&#xD;
      retinitis and papillopathy. Patients also had the following at baseline: fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography (FFA), ERG, and central foveal thickness (CFT) OCT (Stratus III OCT; Carl Zeiss,&#xD;
      Dublin, CA). Grading of vitritis was as follows: Grade 0: Good view of NFL (nerve fibre&#xD;
      layer), Grade +1: clear optic nerve &amp; vessels but hazy NFL, Grade +2: optic nerve &amp; vessels&#xD;
      are hazy, Grade +3: view of optic nerve only, and Grade +4: no optic nerve view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up clinical examinations were at day 1, and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 18. Each follow&#xD;
      up visit included: BCVA, slit-Lamp examination, IOP, dilated fundus examination with grading&#xD;
      of vitritis (0-4), and presence or absence of vasculitis, retinitis or papillopathy. CFT OCT,&#xD;
      and ERG were done at 4, 12 and 18 weeks. FFA was done at the discretion of the examiner and&#xD;
      not at every post-injection evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intravitreal dose of infliximab used in this study is 1mg/0.05ml. Animal studies have&#xD;
      shown intravitreal infliximab in doses up to 2mg is safe clinically, and by&#xD;
      electrophysiological and histopathological examinations. These findings were maintained for 3&#xD;
      months with 3 monthly injections. However, in clinical trial severe intraocular inflammation&#xD;
      was elicited with even a single low dose of 0.5mg in non-uveitic eyes. Since the 1 mg dose&#xD;
      was shown to be effective in controlling inflammation in one study, we decided to use this&#xD;
      dose and avoid the 1.5mg and the 2mg doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug preparation: A vial containing 100 mg of commercially available infliximab powder&#xD;
      (Remicade Janssen Pharmaceutical Egypt) was reconstituted with 5 mL of sterile water, and&#xD;
      0.05 mL of this solution (1mg of infliximab) used for each patient and placed in a tuberculin&#xD;
      syringe using aseptic techniques. The remaining syringes will be kept in a sterile package at&#xD;
      2-8ºC for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection technique: The eye was prepared in a standard fashion using 5% povidone-iodine, an&#xD;
      eyelids speculum to stabilize the eyelids, and the injection of 1mg (0.05 mL) was performed&#xD;
      3.5mm to 4 mm posterior to the limbus, through the infero-temporal pars plana with a 30-gauge&#xD;
      needle under topical anesthesia. After the injection, retinal artery perfusion is checked and&#xD;
      patients were instructed to administer topical antibiotics for 3 days. All patients were&#xD;
      given detailed post-injection instructions and asked to call promptly if any pain or&#xD;
      significant changes in vision occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were seen on follow ups and repeated injections were given at 6 weeks intervals if&#xD;
      re-injection criteria were met: 1) No evidence of significant ERG changes, 2) No evidence of&#xD;
      adverse effects to the drug, 3) Signs of anatomical and/or functional improvement during the&#xD;
      first 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Data were statistically described in terms of mean ± standard deviation&#xD;
      (±SD), median and range, or frequencies (number of cases) and percentages when appropriate.&#xD;
      Comparison of numerical variables between the study groups was done using Freidman's test&#xD;
      with Conover test for paired (matched) samples as posthoc multiple 2-group comparisons. For&#xD;
      comparing categorical data, Chi square (±2) and McNemar tests were performed. GCC was done&#xD;
      using McNemar test. Agreement was tested using kappa statistic. Correlation between various&#xD;
      variables was done using Spearman rank correlation equation. P values less than 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered statistically significant. All statistical calculations were done using computer&#xD;
      program SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)&#xD;
      version 15 for Microsoft Windows Stats Direct statistical software version 2.7.2 for MS&#xD;
      Windows, StatsDirect Ltd., Cheshire, UK.&#xD;
