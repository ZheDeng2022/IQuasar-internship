  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to ascertain the effectiveness of tailored, peer based&#xD;
      sleep health education and social support in increasing adherence rates to recommended&#xD;
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) evaluation and treatment among blacks at risk of Obstructive&#xD;
      Sleep Apnea.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which disproportionately affects blacks (31% vs. 10%, whites),&#xD;
      is a critical, preventable and/or treatable disease potentially causing increased&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes (e.g., obesity, diabetes, hypertension, stroke,&#xD;
      arrhythmia, and chronic heart failure). Improving sleep may have direct effects in reducing&#xD;
      CVD risk,2 enhancing brain functions, and increasing workplace productivity. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      our focus groups suggest that most at-risk blacks are unaware of OSA symptoms or its related&#xD;
      morbidity. Thus, it is imperative to address poor adherence among blacks with OSA, if we are&#xD;
      to reduce health disparities associated with CVD outcomes between blacks and whites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized study with a total of 6 sites recruiting; 3 will serve as controls and 3&#xD;
      that will be intervention. Group A participants (Intervention group) will receive health&#xD;
      education from a trained Peer Health Educator and Group B participants (Control group) will&#xD;
      meet with a salon worker, barbershop worker, or church Health Ministry group leader.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to use a sleep diary and wear a home sleep test device to measure&#xD;
      sleep for 7 days. They will be followed for 12 months.&#xD;
