  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective is to determine the dietary requirement of protein for strength and endurance&#xD;
      exercise trained (more than 4 months training experience) individuals between 18 - 30 years&#xD;
      of age using the indicator amino acid oxidation (IAO) method. This study will be the first to&#xD;
      determine the required quantity of protein need per day in strength- and endurance trained&#xD;
      young adults using the IAO method.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The adequacy of the protein dietary requirement for strength (ST) and endurance (ET) exercise&#xD;
      trained individuals has been a subject of considerable debate for many years and, at present,&#xD;
      there is a discrepancy between those who establish dietary protein requirements for healthy&#xD;
      adults and those issuing guidelines for athletes. Despite past nitrogen balance studies&#xD;
      suggesting a greater protein requirement in ST and ET athletes, the Institute of Medicine&#xD;
      (2005) recommends &quot;no additional dietary protein for healthy adults undertaking resistance or&#xD;
      endurance exercise&quot;. Current protein and amino acid (AA) requirement estimates for adults are&#xD;
      based on nitrogen balance data which are considered to be flawed due to several&#xD;
      methodological problems including the use of single linear regression for analyzing nonlinear&#xD;
      data and an over/underestimation of nitrogen intake and excretion, respectively. To overcome&#xD;
      these problems, the indicator amino acid oxidation technique (IAO) was developed for&#xD;
      determination of dietary AA or protein requirements. The IAO method is based on the concept&#xD;
      that when dietary protein is inadequate, all AA, including the indicator AA, will be&#xD;
      oxidized. With increasing total protein intake, oxidation of the indicator AA will decrease.&#xD;
      Once the requirement is met, there is no further change in the oxidation of the indicator AA&#xD;
      and the inflection or 'breakpoint' is the estimated requirement. A mixed-effects change-point&#xD;
      regression analysis to F13CO2 (label tracer oxidation in 13CO2 breath) in response to graded&#xD;
      amounts of protein will be utilized to over come the limitations of linear regression&#xD;
      previously used with nitrogen balance. These protein requirement measures using the IAO has&#xD;
      not been carried out on ST or ET individuals previously so this will be the first study to do&#xD;
      so. The results of this study will help determine the optimal protein requirement in ST and&#xD;
      ET athletes which is important not only for athletes but also for older individuals whose&#xD;
      loss of muscle mass has been linked to a variety of health concerns.&#xD;

    <description>Oxidation of ingested L-[1-13C] phenylalanine (µmol . kg-1 . h-1) to 13CO2 (µmol . kg-1 . h-1) in response to graded intakes of protein will be measure and after determination of a plateau in oxidation curve (using change point regression analysis), break point will be defined as g/kg/d protein requirement.</description>

    <description>a repeated measures design will be used on each athlete receiving eight graded intakes of protein on separate days in the form of AA in random order ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 g/(kg/d). Three baseline samples of breath and urine will be collected at 60, 45 and 30 min before the stable isotope is given orally. During a period of 150 to 270 min. after stable isotope ingestion, 5 breath and urine samples (every 30 min) will be collected to determine an isotopic plateau in breath and urine. The rate of release of 13CO2 from the oxidation of L-[1-13C] phenylalanine (F 13CO2) in breath will be measured and a breakpoint analysis will determine total protein requirement</description>
