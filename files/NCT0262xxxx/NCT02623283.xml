  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically dental health of Scottish children had been poor for many years. Evidence form&#xD;
      clinical trials of fluoride toothpaste identified a route to improving prevention. Those who&#xD;
      had poor dental health used fluoride toothpaste infrequently at home. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesised that this disadvantage could be overcome by supplying toothpaste to&#xD;
      disadvantaged families and supervising child toothbrushing at school. In 1997, 534 children&#xD;
      5.3 years were recruited in 12 primary schools in Tayside; randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      groups - test group followed a home-to-school toothbrushing programme with fluoride&#xD;
      toothpaste; control group: usual care. Children in test group were provided with toothbrushes&#xD;
      and toothpaste (1,000ppmF as sodium monofluorophosphate) for home use; also brushed their&#xD;
      teeth school daily. After 2 years, children participating in the supervised brushing&#xD;
      programme developed significantly less caries (tooth decay).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permission was given for longitudinal follow up of children and dental records. The original&#xD;
      intervention lasted 30 months and children were re-examined at 36 months after baseline, 48,&#xD;
      60 and 84 months. At 84 month examination, 77% were available, found prolonged benefits of&#xD;
      brushing programme. This was 4.5 years after the end of the programme; children were aged&#xD;
      11.5 years. At age 14 years, 6.5 years after intervention end, 65% of children were&#xD;
      reexamined; benefit was still evident at 20-26% less caries experience. However, there had&#xD;
      been greater subject loss and insufficient funds available to undertake a more individual&#xD;
      followup of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since then, records have been followed; up-to-date contact details identified. Using this new&#xD;
      data, the investigators seek to reconsent the participants, now aged 23 to invite them to&#xD;
      attend a followup dental examination. This study has the potential to provide unique&#xD;
      information on longterm costs and benefits of a home-to-school toothbrushing programme.&#xD;

      Participants on the original trial will be sent an information letter and information leaflet&#xD;
      and consent form in the post. The letter will provide contact details for the chief&#xD;
      investigator (CI) should they wish to discuss the study before making a decision about&#xD;
      whether they would like to take part. The letter will ask participants to complete the&#xD;
      informed consent form and return it to the Chief Investigator in the pre-paid envelope&#xD;
      provided. If participants do not respond to the first letter a second will be sent two weeks&#xD;
      later. No further letters will be sent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent form will ask participants to give details of which days and times are most&#xD;
      convenient for them to attend an appointment (evening and weekend appointments will be&#xD;
      offered). The letter will advise people that attendance does not replace their usual dental&#xD;
      care visits. For those who do not have a dentist and wish to find one, appropriate advice and&#xD;
      assistance will be provided by the CI, or a member of the Dental Team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who return their consent forms will be contacted by telephone by a member of the&#xD;
      NHS Tayside dental team to arrange an appointment at a time convenient to them. If&#xD;
      participants are unable to travel to the two centres (Broxden Dental Centre in Perth or Kings&#xD;
      Cross Dental Department in Dundee) they may be offered a home visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When participants attend for their appointment they will be asked to confirm their consent&#xD;
      verbally. Dr Morag Curnow (the same dentist that examined the participants when they were in&#xD;
      School on the original toothbrushing trial) or another appropriately trained Dentist (named&#xD;
      on the study delegation log) will conduct a short dental examination, recording the presence&#xD;
      of plaque on anterior teeth and the caries status of each tooth surface using dental lighting&#xD;
      and fibre-optic transillumination. The examining dentist will be unaware of which study group&#xD;
      the adults belonged to when they were child participants in the trial. Participants will also&#xD;
      be asked to complete oral health related questionnaires. Questionnaires will be analysed by a&#xD;
      statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to give consent for their dental records to be accessed using&#xD;
      health service records to record dental treatment history. Consent will be recorded in&#xD;
      writing. Approval has already been provided by Information Services Division (ISD), NHS&#xD;
      National Services Scotland to access the dental treatment records.&#xD;
