  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human papilloma virus (HPV) is known to be an important cause of cervical and anal&#xD;
      cancers. Studies on patients who have received a solid organ transplant (such as a liver or&#xD;
      kidney transplant) have suggested the risk of HPV-related cancers may be higher in this&#xD;
      population. The HPV vaccine, Gardasil®, has been approved for use in males and females by&#xD;
      Health Canada. In studies on healthy subjects this vaccine is nearly 100% effective at&#xD;
      preventing infections from HPV serotypes that are in the vaccine. These serotypes,&#xD;
      representing different viral strains, are known to cause 70% of cervical cancers and 90% of&#xD;
      genital warts. The vaccine was also shown to be very safe and well tolerated in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Transplant patients are at higher risk of HPV related complications and cancers. As&#xD;
      a result transplant experts have recommended this vaccine for use in their patients; however&#xD;
      there have been no studies looking at the response to vaccination or safety of this vaccine&#xD;
      in solid organ transplant recipients. Our objective is to study the immune response and side&#xD;
      effects of Gardasil® in children who have received kidney or liver transplants. We will study&#xD;
      this by comparing immune responses to the vaccine in healthy adolescent females compared to&#xD;
      female liver and kidney transplant recipients. We will be recruiting females ages 12-19, as&#xD;
      the province of Ontario funds the vaccine for this group. We will evaluate the transplant&#xD;
      subjects for side effects after they receive the vaccine. Our hypothesis is that transplant&#xD;
      recipients will have lower immunogenicity than healthy controls.&#xD;

      1. Hypothesis The Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, Gardasil®, will likely provide&#xD;
           protection in solid organ transplant patients against the vaccinated strains with lower&#xD;
           immunogenicity rates compared to healthy controls. We expect higher levels of immune&#xD;
           suppression to influence immunogenic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective Primary: To evaluate the immunogenicity of the recombinant HPV vaccine,&#xD;
           Gardasil®, in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients compared to controls, as well&#xD;
           evaluate for clinical risk factors associated with lower responses in transplant&#xD;
           recipients. Immunogenicity will be assessed through geometric mean titres (GMT) as well&#xD;
           as seroconversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary: To evaluate the safety of Gardasil® in transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Disease HPV is known to predispose to cervical, anal, and a variety of head and neck&#xD;
           cancers in both healthy adults and in those who are immunocompromised, including those&#xD;
           who have received solid organ transplants. An estimated 3 million women in Canada are&#xD;
           infected with HPV. Peak incidence occurs within 5-10 years of first sexual experience&#xD;
           and adolescent females represent the largest cohort affected by HPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Vaccine In 2006 the Food and Drug Administration approved the quadravalent&#xD;
           recombinant HPV vaccine, Gardasil®, which targets strains 16 and 18 as well as 6 and 11,&#xD;
           which are responsible for 70% of cervical cancer cases and 90% of genital warts,&#xD;
           respectively. Health Canada has recently approved Gardasil® for use in females' aged&#xD;
           9-45 years and males 9-26 years. Gardasil® has been shown in numerous clinical trials to&#xD;
           be effective in the management of HPV by preventing vaccine sub-type related infections&#xD;
           and precancerous lesions. Gardasil® is regarded as generally safe and well tolerated&#xD;
           based on reported adverse events through government databases in the United States, as&#xD;
           well as analyses by independent researches. The bivalent HPV vaccine, Cervarix®, also&#xD;
           appears safe and effective in preventing cervical cancer, however the data are less&#xD;
           robust and there would be no protection against genital wart strains. Long term benefits&#xD;
           of HPV vaccination are unknown, however models have predicted both a significant&#xD;
           mortality benefit by preventing cases of cervical cancer7 and overall&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness; particularly if the vaccine is administered to girls under the age&#xD;
           of twelve.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3 HPV in Transplant Patients Due to the prominent role of cell-mediated immunity in&#xD;
           HPV, transplant recipients are felt to be at increased risk of infection leading to&#xD;
           extensive or frequent warts, and increased incidence of skin and anogenital&#xD;
           malignancies. Skin cancers are the most common malignancy affecting patients post&#xD;
           transplantation. Anogenital cancer incidence is estimated to be 30-100 times greater in&#xD;
           transplant patients compared to the general population. HPV is a preventable cause of a&#xD;
           large number of these malignancies, suggesting that a vaccine could potentially thwart&#xD;
           some of the morbidity and mortality experienced by transplant recipients. Furthermore,&#xD;
           studies have suggested that organ transplant patients are more likely to be infected&#xD;
           with HPV as well as develop secondary neoplasias. For these reasons vaccinating this&#xD;
           population against HPV has the potential for significant long-term benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Methods 4.1 Design We are proposing a prospective observational study by evaluating the&#xD;
           serological response for the vaccine covered HPV serotypes; 6, 11, 16, and 18. This&#xD;
           study will take advantage of routine, provincially funded population based vaccination&#xD;
           program, and patients will receive the vaccine in the study that healthy adolescents&#xD;
           receive at school in grades 7 or 8. Study subjects will be identified using the liver&#xD;
           and kidney transplant clinical database and control subjects will be identified through&#xD;
           the Hospital for Sick Children adolescent medicine clinic. A letter of introduction will&#xD;
           be sent to the families. Consent will be obtained by the transplant nurse or physician&#xD;
           known to the patient. Transplant subjects will undergo baseline and post-immunization&#xD;
           serology to evaluate both GMT as well as to document seroconversion response to the&#xD;
           vaccine. Gardasil® will be funded through the province of Ontario. Controls will receive&#xD;
           their vaccine through the adolescent clinic, schools, or Toronto Public Health clinics&#xD;
           in the community as per the recommended schedule. At recruitment attempt will be made to&#xD;
           draw baseline serology status, vaccinate, and then collect post-immunization serology to&#xD;
           document seroconversion. However, to facilitate recruitment for controls that have&#xD;
           documented receipt of three doses of the vaccine these children will be recruited for&#xD;
           post-vaccination serology only to compare GMTs. Control vaccines will also be funded by&#xD;
           the province of Ontario and administered in accordance with Health Canada standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Investigational Agent&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2.1 Vaccine storage and characteristics Gardasil® (Merck Canada Inc), the Quadravalent&#xD;
      Human papillomavirus (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) Recombinant Vaccine, was selected for this study&#xD;
      for its efficacy and safety data in healthy subjects, being publically funded by the province&#xD;
      of Ontario, and it provides protection for 4 HPV serotypes. Gardasil® should be stored&#xD;
      refrigerated 2-8 degrees Celsius, should not be frozen and remain protected from light. The&#xD;
      total time outside of refrigerator should not to exceed 72 hours. Vaccines will be stored&#xD;
      compliant with the division 5 Canadian regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2.2 Administration of vaccine Gardasil® vaccine is recommended to be administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly in deltoid or thigh at a dose of 0.5ml at 0, 2, and 6 months. While every&#xD;
      effort will be made to keep the aforementioned schedule, studies support some flexibility in&#xD;
      the schedule. The 2nd dose will be administered at least 1 month after the 1st, but not more&#xD;
      than 9 months. The 3rd dose can be administered 3 months following the second dose, but not&#xD;
      more than 1 year following the first dose. All 3 doses must be administered within a 1 year&#xD;
      period to be included in analysis. Subjects will be monitored for 15 min post-vaccination for&#xD;
      any adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Sample Size The study will be powered based on GMT immunogenicity. Based on this primary&#xD;
      outcome, we wish to compare serum titres in transplant patients compared with controls. The&#xD;
      sample size calculation is based on 90% power and 95% confidence and the assumption that a&#xD;
      HPV vaccination will result in protective titres in 80% of transplant patients compared to&#xD;
      100% of controls. A sample size of approximately 75 transplant recipients and 75 controls&#xD;
      will therefore be preferred to detect a significant difference, however recruitment of at&#xD;
      least 50 participants in each group is acceptable. Recruitment will take place over a 6 month&#xD;
      period, resulting in a total study duration of approximately 12 months, up to a maximum of 18&#xD;
      months accounting for possible delays in vaccine administration up to 1 year from end of&#xD;
      recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4. Analysis In the primary analysis of immunogenicity, the GMTs will be summarized for&#xD;
      transplant recipients and compared with controls. The proportions of subjects achieving&#xD;
      protective GMTs, as defined previously, will be compared using Chi-square or Fishers' exact&#xD;
      test as appropriate. Means will be compared using Students t-test or a non-parametric&#xD;
      procedure will be used to compare medians, as appropriate. Subjects and controls will be&#xD;
      evaluated as a head-to-head comparison. For controls serology will be interpreted relative to&#xD;
      time from last dose given. The investigators will use a multivariate analytic procedure to&#xD;
      examine the effects of several independent variables with immunogenicity as the dependent&#xD;
      variable. These independent variables are ones that could be potentially associated with&#xD;
      differences in immune responsiveness (e.g., the interval between transplantation and vaccine&#xD;
      administration). Other variables include the following: age; type of organ transplanted;&#xD;
      presence or absence of graft rejection; type of immune suppression (e.g., use of anti-T&#xD;
      lymphocyte therapy); immune globulin therapy; cytomegalovirus infection and disease;&#xD;
      Epstein-Barr virus infection and disease; presence of bacterial opportunistic infections,&#xD;
      concurrent diseases, steroid doses, and total lymphocyte count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary analysis will capture and describe the adverse effects among transplant&#xD;
      recipients through telephone calls at 48 hours and 7 days utilizing the Public Health Ontario&#xD;
      adverse event reporting form&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5 Data Safety Monitoring Board and Research Ethics The study will be done with the approval&#xD;
      of the institution's Research Ethics Board. In addition, although we have no reasons to&#xD;
      anticipate problems with this vaccines in transplant patients, we will establish a Data&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Board that will review emerging data that relate to any major or&#xD;
      catastrophic events that are temporally associated with the vaccine (even in the absence of&#xD;
      obvious causality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5.1 Early Termination or Withdrawal Subjects and/or parents/legal guardians have the right&#xD;
      to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The investigator also has the right to&#xD;
      withdraw subjects from the study if it is in the best interest of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject withdrawal criteria are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal of informed consent (subject's decision to withdraw for any reason)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious adverse event which, in the opinion of the investigator, indicates that&#xD;
           continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any clinical adverse event or inter-current illness which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
           investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best&#xD;
           interest of the subject (ex. Participants who develop symptoms of hypersensitivity after&#xD;
           receiving the first or second dose of Gardasil® will be withdrawn from the study and&#xD;
           will not receive further doses of Gardasil®)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject non-adherence with the vaccine administration schedule defined above In the&#xD;
           event a subject is withdrawn due to an Adverse Event, this will be recorded and subjects&#xD;
           will continue to be followed until these events are resolved or stabilized, if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5.2 Adverse Events All adverse events will be reported to the Hospital for Sick Children&#xD;
      Research Ethics Board according to the Hospital for Sick Children's adverse event reporting&#xD;
      requirements. All serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions to the study medication will be&#xD;
      reported to Health Canada within 15 calendar days or for death or life-threatening events,&#xD;
      within 7 calendar days. In the latter case, a follow-up report must be filed within 8&#xD;
      additional calendar days. Adverse reactions will be managed according to the Hospital for&#xD;
      Sick Children's standard clinical management practices.&#xD;
