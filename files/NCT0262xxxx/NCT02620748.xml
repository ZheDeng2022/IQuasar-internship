  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of the early administration of&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) Tranexamic acid (TA) on perioperative bleeding (as defined by measured&#xD;
      intraoperative estimated blood loss (EBL), change in pre and post-operative hemoglobin (Hb),&#xD;
      and frequency of blood transfusions) in women undergoing a myomectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide about 25% of women will develop uterine leiomyomas. Most myomas are asymptomatic&#xD;
      however 20 to 25% of women with myomas develop symptoms, such as heavy menstrual bleeding,&#xD;
      requiring treatment. For women failing medical management and desiring to preserve fertility&#xD;
      and/or their uterus, surgical removal of fibroids (myomectomy) is the major option.&#xD;
      Myomectomy is associated with both short and long-term complications, most significantly,&#xD;
      hemorrhage and need for conversion to hysterectomy in 2% of cases, need for a blood&#xD;
      transfusion in up to 20% of cases, prolonged postoperative stay, and can be potentially&#xD;
      life-threatening. As such, various treatments have been suggested to decrease blood loss&#xD;
      during myomectomy including pharmacologic manipulation of the coagulation cascade using&#xD;
      agents such as tranexamic acid (TA). Despite the many described methods to reduce&#xD;
      intraoperative bleeding, massive hemorrhage during myomectomy remains a significant challenge&#xD;
      to gynecologic surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TA is a synthetic lysine derivative with antifibrinolytic activity that helps prevent clot&#xD;
      break down. It is currently clinically used widely to stop heavy menstrual bleeding and many&#xD;
      of the investigators' myomectomy patients are taking oral TA around the time of surgery.&#xD;
      Systematic reviews of randomized control trials (RCTs) including over 25,000 patients of&#xD;
      tranexamic acid in elective surgery showed that it reduced the risk of a blood transfusion by&#xD;
      34% (relative risk (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.70) without an increased&#xD;
      risk in venous thrombus embolus (VTE) or other adverse perioperative outcomes (Henry, 2011).&#xD;
      Only one RCT has studied the use of TA during gynecologic surgery. This study was a&#xD;
      randomized double blind placebo controlled trial of intravenous TA 10 mg/kg (maximum 1g)&#xD;
      versus placebo during myomectomy procedures. Although there was a 63 ml decrease in&#xD;
      postoperative blood loss (p&lt;0.01), no significant difference was found between the two groups&#xD;
      in terms of perioperative blood loss, change in hemoglobin, or rate of allogeneic blood&#xD;
      transfusions. Further studies are needed with different dosing administration to confirm the&#xD;
      true role of TA in the reduction of blood loss during myomectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a difference is seen, the results of future publications would directly impact clinical&#xD;
      care locally and abroad, as few methods currently exist to prevent hemorrhage during&#xD;
      myomectomy procedures.&#xD;
