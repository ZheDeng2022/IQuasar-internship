  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to measure pain during PRK postoperative period, comparing placebo&#xD;
      with the association of codeine phosphate 30 mg and paracetamol 500 mg for 72h after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind, prospective, randomized study involving 80 eyes of 40 patients&#xD;
      (paired design), who underwent photorefractive keratectomy at hospital das Clínicas da&#xD;
      Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil. The main outcome was the&#xD;
      evaluation of pain by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 24h post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who had PRK as their chosen technique to correct their refractive errors were&#xD;
      recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients had to be older than 20 years, with an spherical component between -1.00 and -5.00,&#xD;
      with or without astigmatism, a cylindrical component up to 1.5D, spherical anisometropia of&#xD;
      less than or equal to 0.75D, cylindrical anisometropia of less than or equal to 0.5D, stable&#xD;
      refraction errors (maximal variation of 0.5D in the spherical or cylindrical component during&#xD;
      1 year) and amenable to follow-up for at least seven (7) days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria included the presence of active disease of allergic, inflammatory or&#xD;
      infectious nature, in the ocular surface or its attachments; previous ocular history&#xD;
      (pathology, surgery or ocular trauma); best corrected visual acuity less than 20/25);&#xD;
      autoimmune disease, or immunosuppression or Diabetes Mellitus; pregnancy and lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same surgeon (VPBP) performed all procedures. Patients' eyes were operated at two-week&#xD;
      intervals, and the treatment order (placebo or codein/paracetamol) was randomized for each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distribution of the continuous variables was assessed visually by constructing&#xD;
      histograms. Due to moderately symmetrical feature of the data, parametric approaches were&#xD;
      used, following the guidelines of Fagerland.18 Data were presented as mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD) or mean (95% confidence interval), as appropriate. Counts and percentages were&#xD;
      used to summarize binary variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention effect was estimated by the difference between the average of the group&#xD;
      treated eyes (μtreatment) and the mean of the control eyes group (μcontrol). In other words,&#xD;
      the effect of treatment was estimated by the variable Δ where Δ = μtreatment - μcontrol. The&#xD;
      statistical approach considered the paired nature of the study (&quot;paired-eye design&quot;)&#xD;
      following the recommendations of Armstrong et al. 19 Specifically, Δ was calculated taking&#xD;
      into account the correlation between the pair of eyes. Covariates were included in the models&#xD;
      of multiple linear regression, which were adjusted for age, gender (1 = male, 0 = female) and&#xD;
      ancestry (0 = white 1 = brown and 2 = black). These models were built with a robust estimator&#xD;
      of the variance, which incorporates the intra-patient correlation of the pair of eyes.20&#xD;
      Furthermore, due to the characteristic of repeated measurements (1h, 24h, 48h and 72h), for&#xD;
      each variable, the p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons by the method of Holm-&#xD;
      Šidák. 21,22 The relative magnitude of the variation of the treatment effect over time was&#xD;
      examined by analysis of variance (ANOVA ) one-way repeated measures. This evaluation&#xD;
      explicitly asks whether longitudinally, the effect of treatment, i.e., the magnitude of Δ is&#xD;
      the same over time (H0 : Δ1h Δ24h = = = Δ48h Δ72h ). A Huynh-Feldt correction was applied.&#xD;
      When statistically significant, ANOVA models were followed by post-hoc tests (paired student&#xD;
      t test) to detect differences between specific times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential predictors of the magnitude of the treatment effect were investigated having as the&#xD;
      dependent variable Δ and the explanatory variables age, gender, ancestry, fractional error&#xD;
      group (1 = -3 to -5, 0 = -1 to -3) and sequence of the treatment. No corrections were applied&#xD;
      for multiple testing in the exploration of predictors of the magnitude of the treatment&#xD;
      effect, since they were considered exploratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P values of the post-hoc tests were also adjusted for multiple comparisons using the&#xD;
      Holm-Šidák method. The α significance level for all analyzes was 5%. The software used was&#xD;
      Stata 13.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX , USA).&#xD;
