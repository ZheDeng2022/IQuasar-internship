  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation Phase Ib clinical trial in 18 patients with newly diagnosed Stage&#xD;
      I-IV ER+/HER2- breast cancer, with the primary cancer in place. These patients have not&#xD;
      received prior therapy for their breast cancer and intend to undergo surgery after four&#xD;
      cycles of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label study, and investigators and subjects are not blinded to the treatment.&#xD;
      The reason for using an open-label study design is because this is a dose-escalation trial,&#xD;
      and the investigators need to determine the potential toxicity before a decision can be made&#xD;
      to continue the dose escalation procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assignment of patients will not be randomized, as this is a dose-escalation trial.&#xD;

      Palbociclib (Ibrance®) is an orally active highly selective reversible inhibitor of&#xD;
      cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and CDK 6. Faslodex® (Fulvestrant) is a potent anti-estrogen&#xD;
      drug that binds and degrades estrogen receptors (ERs). Interim results from the Phase 3 trial&#xD;
      (Study PALOMA-3) have shown that combination of palbociclib and Faslodex increases&#xD;
      progressive-free survival (PFS) from 3.8 to 9.2 months in patients with metastatic estrogen&#xD;
      receptor positive (ER+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) breast&#xD;
      cancer that progressed during or after anti-endocrine therapy (Turner et al. 2015). The&#xD;
      palbociclib/Faslodex combination was found to be well tolerated. Additionally, there is&#xD;
      growing data indicating that this combination can be safely and effectively administered up&#xD;
      front in anti-endocrine therapy-naive patients in the neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gedatolisib (code name PF-05212384, formerly known as PKI-587) is an intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP) competitive, highly selective and potent inhibitor of pan-class&#xD;
      I isoform phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3-K) and mammalian target of&#xD;
      rapamycin (mTOR) (Fry et al. 2004). Preclinical and first-in-human studies have shown a&#xD;
      manageable safety profile with predictable toxicity for this class of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activation of the PI3-K/Akt/mTOR/p-S6 pathway has been associated with endocrine resistance&#xD;
      in ER+ breast cancer. There is ample evidence that inhibition of this pathway, in combination&#xD;
      with anti-hormonal therapy, increases PFS (Baselga et al. 2012). There is also clinical&#xD;
      evidence that combination therapy targeting all three pathways is feasible, safe and&#xD;
      effective (Sweeney et al. 2014). The advantage of Gedatolisib is its potential to inhibit&#xD;
      signaling through different PI3-K isoforms. Also important is the fact that once a week&#xD;
      administration may be as effective, but less toxic, than chronic oral dosing. If&#xD;
      hyperglycemia is a surrogate for effective PI3-K/Akt/mTOR/p-S6 inhibition, once weekly dosing&#xD;
      of Gedatolisib would appear to accomplish equivalent degrees of hyperglycemia as chronically&#xD;
      oral dosing and with less toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative or neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy, once reserved for patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer in whom the goal was to render large breast cancers operable, has&#xD;
      become increasingly common due to the improvement in disease-free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival. Historically, the endpoint of pathological Complete Response (pCR) in neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy against ER+/HER2- breast cancer has been of limited value. However, new targeted&#xD;
      agents, with higher response rates, have the potential to use pCR assessment as a strong&#xD;
      clinical endpoint in drug development. Given the systemic response rate in previously treated&#xD;
      Stage 4 breast cancer patients, the expectation will be a similar high rate of pathological&#xD;
      improvement which can lead to greater use of targeted agents in the neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the potential of better pathological improvement, the advantage of clinical&#xD;
      studies involving neoadjuvant therapy is that they can provide response information in&#xD;
      patients that are treatment-naïve. This type of clinical trial can also be used to assess&#xD;
      cellular and molecular changes with serial biopsies while on neoadjuvant therapy, which can&#xD;
      aid in development of companion tissue and/or imaging biomarkers, and further the development&#xD;
      of preclinical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, this investigation assesses the safety and efficacy of the combination of&#xD;
      Gedatolisib, palbociclib and faslodex in the neoadjuvant setting in previously untreated&#xD;
      patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer. Being the first clinical trial using this combination&#xD;
      in neoadjuvant setting, one of the main objectives for the current trial is to determine the&#xD;
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Gedatolisib when used in combination with palbociclib and&#xD;
      faslodex. Subsequent Phase II clinical trials will be conducted to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the Gedatolisib/palbociclib/faslodex combination, with the dose of Gedatolisib&#xD;
      being the MTD determined from the current trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
        A. Stage I-IV, with primary cancer in place, non-inflammatory invasive breast cancer&#xD;
        confirmed by core needle or incisional biopsy (excisional biopsy is not allowed):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the disease is ER+ (defined as ER expression &gt;10% of invasive cancer cells according&#xD;

          -  the disease is previously untreated for breast cancer, operable and intend to undergo&#xD;
             surgery for her disease (e.g., a mastectomy or lumpectomy) after completion of&#xD;
             neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the disease must be measurable, defined as clinically or radiographically measureable&#xD;
             target lesion in the breast that is ≥1 cm in diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the disease cannot be axillary disease only (i.e., no identifiable tumor in the breast&#xD;
             that is ≥1 cm on physical exam or radiographic study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the disease can be multi-centric or bilateral disease, provided the target lesion&#xD;
             meets the above eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  breast cancer patients with lobular and luminal histology will be included. However,&#xD;
             patients with lobular histology should not be more than a quarter of the total number&#xD;
