      Background: Maternal and child under-nutrition is the underlying cause of death for millions&#xD;
      across the globe. Anemia during pregnancy is among the leading nutritional disorders with&#xD;
      serious short and long term consequences to both the mother and fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Examine the effect of dietary diversity on maternal anemia, nutritional status and&#xD;
      key pregnancy outcomes of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A prospective cohort study design, involving a total of 432 eligible pregnant women,&#xD;
      in their second antenatal care visit was conducted between August 2014 to March, 2015. The&#xD;
      individual dietary diversity Score (IDDS) was used as the exposure variable to select, enroll&#xD;
      and follow the mothers. Epi-data, SPSS and STATA software are used to enter and analyze the&#xD;
      data. Chi-square test, independent 't'-test, and GLM are used to calculate risk, association&#xD;
      and differences between key variables at P &lt; 0.05&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrient intake, food choices, and dietary diversity are the key determinants of nutritional&#xD;
      status and associated health outcomes in human beings. When people eat a variety of foods,&#xD;
      they are more likely to meet their needs for a wide range of essential nutrients. Yet for&#xD;
      many poor people across the globe, dietary diversity is very low, and the daily diet is&#xD;
      dominated by one main staple food. Poorly diversified monotonous foods, originating from&#xD;
      plant sources are typical characteristics of the diets most peoples in low income countries,&#xD;
      particularly the in sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary diversity is a measure of the number of individual foods or food groups consumed in a&#xD;
      given time period. Particularly, the Individual Dietary Diversity Score (IDDS) is a useful&#xD;
      proxy measure of the nutritional quality of an individual's diet and a reflection of nutrient&#xD;
      adequacy. It can be triangulated with other food-related information to contribute towards&#xD;
      providing a holistic picture of the food and nutrition status of an individual and can be&#xD;
      used as a simple and quick indicator of the micronutrient adequacy of a diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal and child under-nutrition is considered as the underlying cause of 3â€¢5 million&#xD;
      annual deaths, and responsible for the overall increase in disease burden of the low and&#xD;
      middle-income countries. As child health and pregnancy outcomes are largely influenced by&#xD;
      maternal dietary practices, in nutritionally deprived populations, maternal nutrition is&#xD;
      identified as a strong predictor of poor pregnancy outcomes including low birth weight (LBW),&#xD;
      still birth and pre-term deliveries. Furthermore, not only the nutritional status, but also&#xD;
      anthropometric, biochemical, behavioral and other characteristics of the mother has also been&#xD;
      strongly associated with pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anemia during pregnancy is among the leading maternal nutritional problem associated with a&#xD;
      number of poor pregnancy outcomes. Globally, over 42% of pregnant women were identified as&#xD;
      anemic and nearly 60% of this anemia is assumed to be due to iron deficiency in non-malarias&#xD;
      areas, and 50% in malaria areas.(16). The prevalence, complications, severity and associated&#xD;
      risks of anemia among pregnant and lactating mothers in the low and middle income countries&#xD;
      are alarmingly high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethiopia is a sub-Saharan African country with unacceptably high level of maternal and&#xD;
      neonatal mortality rates. The prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes; low birth weight,&#xD;
      preterm and still birth in the country are also very high. Contrarily, there is paucity of&#xD;
      evidence regarding the problem and solutions to undertake. Only very few cross-sectional&#xD;
      studies have investigated the level and determinants of maternal anemia and prenatal&#xD;
      outcomes. Given the dynamic physiology of pregnancy, these cross-sectional studies are&#xD;
      ill-equipped to address the problem occurring naturally. Hardly that the available studies&#xD;
      also analyzed the association between of maternal dietary diversity practices and anemia with&#xD;
      subsequent pregnancy outcomes. There is also inconsistency of the findings of these studies&#xD;
      in the magnitude and predictors identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore; this study examined the association between of maternal dietary diversity&#xD;
      practices during pregnancy with anemia and subsequent adverse pregnancy outcomes: low birth&#xD;
      weight, preterm and still birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and study area. A prospective cohort design was employed to select, enroll,&#xD;
      categorize and follow pregnant mothers from second antenatal care visit to the end of&#xD;
      delivery, in eight randomly selected health centers of four rural districts, in Ethiopia. The&#xD;
      Zone is divided into four agro-climatic areas mainly due to variation in altitude. It is&#xD;
      dominantly characterized by moderately cool (40 %) and cool (34 %) agro-climatic zones, while&#xD;
      the remaining 1/4th accounts moderately warm (20%) and cold (6%) temperature zones. Arsi Zone&#xD;
      is one of the surplus producing areas in Ethiopia, with very few food insecure households.&#xD;
      Recent studies has showed that majority of the rural population has inadequate or moderate DD&#xD;
      practices and only less than 10% of the same practiced high (3,27,28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Sample size was calculated using a Open Epi Kelsey statistical software . The&#xD;
      following assumptions were taken into consideration: a 95 % two-sided significance level, 80%&#xD;
      power, a one to one ratio of exposed to unexposed and 23% anemia among exposed (mothers with&#xD;
      inadequate dietary diversity) and a predicted 10% lower rate of anemia among unexposed&#xD;
      mothers. This yielded a total of 196 per each arm and a total of 392 pregnant women. Adding&#xD;
      to allow a 10% drop-out rate during the study, some 216 pregnant women per category or a sum&#xD;
      of 432 women as the final sample for the study was calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Procedure Pregnant mothers were recruited and enrolled to the study during the&#xD;
      second trimester of pregnancy with gestational age ranging between 24 - 28 weeks. They were&#xD;
      also followed from the time enrollment to final end of pregnancy or delivery for documenting&#xD;
      remaining maternal and fetal outcomes. The timing for enrollment at second trimester of&#xD;
      pregnancy was based on previous studies in Ethiopia showed the fact that rural pregnant&#xD;
      mothers visit health facilities for antenatal care lately during the second or third&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy. Though formal enrollment to the study is made in the second visit,&#xD;
      relevant obstetric, anthropometric and biochemical data from medical records for those&#xD;
      mothers who initiated antenatal visits earlier during the first trimester of pregnancy were&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was the maternal DD score used as a main criteria to recruit, enroll and follow these&#xD;
      mothers by their respective study categories. Pregnant mothers were categorized either to the&#xD;
      adequate dietary diversity ''adequate'' or inadequate dietary diversity ''inadequate'' groups&#xD;
      in a one to one ratio based on the individual dietary diversity scores (IDDS). Mothers having&#xD;
      IDDS of &lt; 4 were categorized to the inadequate while those having 4 - 9 IDDS were assigned to&#xD;
      the adequate group (Figure. 1). During analysis; however, the adequate group was&#xD;
      re-categorized into moderate and high dietary diversity sub-groups as it covers a wide range&#xD;
      of IDDS from four to nine. All classification and categorization was strictly based on the&#xD;
      recommendations of recent FAO's guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria To select appropriate study subjects, criteria like&#xD;
      selecting a pregnant women who are willing to stay in the study throughout the whole course&#xD;
      of pregnancy and visit same health center for the antenatal and delivery care services were&#xD;
      used. Additional criteria used are weather the pregnant mother has lived for at least six&#xD;
      months in the study area or not, if she has previous known medical, surgical or obstetric&#xD;
      problems were taken into account for inclusion or exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food Consumption (Dietary intake) According to FAO's latest and revised guidelines techniques&#xD;
      and methods for measuring household and individual dietary diversity, a qualitative recall of&#xD;
      all foods consumed by the women during the previous 24-h period was performed during two&#xD;
      distinct seasons (pre-harvest of the main harvest season, which occurs commonly between&#xD;
      August to October and the peak harvest season, November - January). A total of four 24-hours&#xD;
      visit were completed for each mother on monthly basis starting from enrollment to delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each woman involved in the study was asked to recall all the dishes, snacks, or other foods&#xD;
      she had eaten during this period, regardless of whether the food was eaten inside or outside&#xD;
      the compound. The woman was also asked to spontaneously describe her food consumption without&#xD;
      any probes. It was after collecting all spontaneous responses that she is prompted to be sure&#xD;
      that no meal or snacks had been forgotten. Next, a detailed list of all the ingredients of&#xD;
      the dishes, snacks, or other foods mentioned, was collected from either the person in charge&#xD;
      of their preparation or directly from the woman being interviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary diversity scores Dietary diversity score (DDS) was defined as the number of food&#xD;
      groups consumed over a period of 24h. The diet was classified according to nine food groups&#xD;
      as recommended by FAO, which included: (1) cereals, roots and tubers; (2)vitamin-A-rich&#xD;
      fruits and vegetables; (3)other fruit; (4) other vegetables; (5) legumes and nuts; (6) meat,&#xD;
      poultry and fish; (7) fats and oils; (8) dairy; and (9) eggs. Other remaining items such as&#xD;
      tea, sugar and sweets were not used in DDS calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary diversity scores were calculated by a tally of food groups consumed by the responding&#xD;
      pregnant mothers. After the respondent recalls all the foods and beverages consumed as&#xD;
      described above, data collectors (midwifes at the health centers) underlined the&#xD;
      corresponding foods in the list under the appropriate food group writing &quot;1&quot; in the column&#xD;
      next to the food group if at least one food in this group has been consumed. If the food is&#xD;
      not listed in any group, it was written in the margin and discussed later with the&#xD;
      investigator or immediate supervisors assigned to oversee the data collection activity.&#xD;
      Though happened rarely, mothers were also asked about the ingredients and food substances of&#xD;
      which the diet consumed when a mixed diet consumption was found. This was settled based on&#xD;
      agreed upon classification that was selected ahead of data collection, and sometimes&#xD;
      consulting for investigators or supervisors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry The anthropometric measurements were performed using the standardized&#xD;
      procedures recommended by WHO. Pregnant women were weighed to the nearest 100 g on electronic&#xD;
      scales with a weighing capacity of 10 to 140 kg. Their height was measured to the nearest mm&#xD;
      with portable devices equipped with height gauges (SECA 206 Body meter) locally calibrated&#xD;
      and standardized. The mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) of the left arm was measured to the&#xD;
      nearest mm with a non-stretch measuring tape. Women with unreliable measurements due to a&#xD;
      physical handicap were excluded from all analyses using anthropometric measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemoglobin : Hemoglobin level was taken twice, during the initial antenatal care visit by the&#xD;
      midwives in the health center to document baseline data which is part of the standard&#xD;
      practice. Hemoglobin levels were also collected at term (fourth antenatal care visit). It was&#xD;
      measured using HemoCue (AB Leo Diagnostics, Sweden) at the laboratories of the health&#xD;
      centers. Before potential use of the of hemoglobin levels obtained for analysis, we made&#xD;
      adjustments based on WHO recommendations (34) for altitudes of each district.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gestational age: Gestational age was estimated by midwives in the health center, from the&#xD;
      last menstrual period (LMP) and fundal palpation during antenatal care which is also verified&#xD;
      at delivery. Records on gestational age were taken five times; at baseline (ANC 1), enrolment&#xD;
      (ANC 2), third and four ANC visits and at delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation to cases and controls: A mother is assigned to either the adequate or the&#xD;
      inadequate group based on consistency of dietary diversity practices across the four visits&#xD;
      considered. She will be to a group if remained to fall in that category in three of the four&#xD;
      visits or showed at most one shift. Otherwise, considered incomplete and eliminated from&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential sources and controlling for Bias : Anticipating the fact that the major source of&#xD;
      bias could be due to key variables like major socio-demographic and economic factors and&#xD;
      intake /compliance to iron folic acid supplements. To control this, random allocation and&#xD;
      post enrollment analysis was made and to check differences across study these groups.&#xD;
      Controlling of these variables was also made during data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Ascertainment: The outcomes measured include: maternal anemia level, low birth&#xD;
      weight, pre-term birth and still birth. Maternal anemia during pregnancy was ascertained by&#xD;
      the hemoglobin levels at baseline and term. Birth weight recorded by the midwives immediately&#xD;
      after birth in the study health centers to the nearest 10g,. Still birth and pre-term birth&#xD;
      were also ascertained by the same professionals at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other information, data on maternal characteristics such as age, education, reproductive&#xD;
      history and morbidity were collected. Information on the household's composition,&#xD;
      expenditures and other socioeconomic, environmental and health indicators were also&#xD;
      documented&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Study tools (questionnaires and others) were adopted from other studies and&#xD;
      pre-tested on 5% of similar population but where the actual study was not conducted.&#xD;
      Accordingly, relevant obstetric and nutritional data were collected using these tools by&#xD;
      twenty four well trained midwives working permanently in the antenatal care service provision&#xD;
      units of respective health centers. Over two third (seventeen) of these nurses were diploma&#xD;
      holders and the remaining had first degree in health sciences. All of them had at least four&#xD;
      years of work experience in the same unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A five days training on participant selection process, enrollment, follow-up and data&#xD;
      collection tool was given to all of these midwives involved in the data collection and&#xD;
      supervision process. In each of the health centers selected, one supervisor (usually head of&#xD;
      the health center) was assigned to oversee the data collection. The investigator frequently&#xD;
      traveled to the health centers from enrollment to final data collection, at least once every&#xD;
      other week in each facility from the start of data collection to final outcome ascertainment&#xD;
      and completion of data collection activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to beginning data collection, the questionnaire was adapted to the local survey context&#xD;
      by appropriate translation into local languages (Afan Oromo and Amharic) and adaptation of&#xD;
      the food lists of the standard questionnaire to reflect locally available foods. It is also&#xD;
      agreed on a common meaning and translation of terms used to describe key concepts. The most&#xD;
      appropriate food group classification were based on foods which can be classified into more&#xD;
      than one food groups. Mixed dishes were dis-aggregated in order to record all of the&#xD;
      individual components in their respective food groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participating women were approached by the midwives verbal consent was obtained&#xD;
      after proper explanation on study procedures for enrollment and follow - up. During&#xD;
      subsequent visit, all relevant data were collected as the data collection guide prepared by&#xD;
      the investigator to be used by the data collecting midwives at the health centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations. The study was approved by Ethics Committees of both the Addis Ababa&#xD;
      University, College of Natural Sciences as well as the Regional Health Bureau. A formal and&#xD;
      official cooperative letter was written hierarchal from the region to the zonal health office&#xD;
      and then to , district to health centers and finally to Kebeles (villages). Prior to&#xD;
      undertaking interviews, written consent was obtained from all mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis. Data entry was performed with Epi-data statistical software. Data&#xD;
      quality was maintained by quality checks during both data collection and entry (double entry)&#xD;
      and further cleaning. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS Statistics&#xD;
      (version 20.0). Exploratory data analysis techniques were used to uncover the distribution&#xD;
      structure of the study variables and identify outliers or unusually entered values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distribution of continuous variables was tested for normality using Smirnov - Kolmogrov test.&#xD;
      Variables not assuming normal distribution were transformed to log distribution before actual&#xD;
      analysis is made. Independent 't'-test was used to test for mean differences between the&#xD;
      different dietary diversity groups. General linear model and Chi-square test or Fisher exact&#xD;
      test were used to test for independence in distribution of categorical variables (demo-&#xD;
      graphic characteristics, categorized nutritional variables, and dietary intake) between study&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
