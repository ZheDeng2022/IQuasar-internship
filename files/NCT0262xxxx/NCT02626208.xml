    <textblock>
      This clinical trial investigates a new vaginal delivery system made of silicone rubber,&#xD;
      containing Nestorone®, a 19-nor progesterone derivative and a low dose of serum estradiol&#xD;
      (E2). The investigators plan to evaluate one-month data on the serum estradiol (E2) levels of&#xD;
      three different contraceptive vaginal rings that contain a fixed dose of NES and escalating&#xD;
      doses (75 µg/day, 100 µg/day, or 200 µg/day) of estradiol as the basis for selecting a CVR&#xD;
      for a larger contraceptive efficacy trial.&#xD;

      This dose-finding study aims to evaluate serum estradiol levels with use of contraceptive&#xD;
      vaginal rings releasing Nestorone® and escalating doses of estradiol in normal cycling women.&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate one-month data on the serum estradiol (E2) levels of&#xD;
      three different contraceptive vaginal rings containing a fixed dose of Nestorone® (NES) and&#xD;
      escalating doses of estradiol as the basis for selecting a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR)&#xD;
      dose for a contraceptive efficacy trial. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of three different estradiol doses of a NES- E2 CVR on progesterone levels, bleeding and side&#xD;
      effects during one month of use and to evaluate the effects of a hormone-free internal on&#xD;
      bleeding patterns. Nestorone serum levels will further be measured as an indication of&#xD;
      compliance with the continuous use of the ring.&#xD;

             reinfection, e.g. multiple sex partners, untreated partner, and whether such subjects&#xD;
             can be included. In accordance with PI/medical designee assessment and local standards&#xD;

         12. Known or suspected current alcoholism or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Elevated serum fasting clinical chemistry values or complete blood count (CBC) values&#xD;
             designated clinically significant by the investigator or medically qualified&#xD;
             sub-investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Uncontrolled thyroid disease.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         21. Cystoceles or rectoceles or other anatomical abnormality that would preclude use of a&#xD;
             vaginal ring.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Planning to undergo major surgery during study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Severe constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Use of liver enzyme inducers or inhibitors on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
