  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the tolerability of two polyglycan food&#xD;
      ingredients, GOS and GLOS, at two different levels in healthy human subjects. The comparator&#xD;
      in this study will be Inulin FOS, a commercially available glycan supplement.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be able to give written informed consent,&#xD;

          1. Are less than 18 and greater than 40 years of age,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Females are pregnant, lactating or wish to become pregnant during the study. Female&#xD;
             subject is currently either of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,&#xD;
                  including any female who is post-menopausal or any female who is surgically&#xD;
                  sterilized (via documented hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation). (For&#xD;
                  purposes of this study, postmenopausal is defined as one year without menses), OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  child bearing potential, the subject is eligible to enter and participate in this&#xD;
                  study if she is not lactating and has a negative urine pregnancy test at the&#xD;
                  screening visit, visit 2 and upon completion of the study at visit 7. The subject&#xD;
                  must also agree to one of the following methods of contraception: i. Complete&#xD;
                  abstinence from intercourse two weeks prior to administration of study,&#xD;
                  throughout the clinical trial, until the completion of follow-up procedures or&#xD;
                  for two weeks following discontinuation of the study medication in cases where&#xD;
                  subject discontinues the study prematurely. (Subjects utilizing this method must&#xD;
                  agree to use an alternate method of contraception if they should become sexually&#xD;
                  active and will be queried on whether they have been abstinent in the preceding 2&#xD;
                  weeks when they present to the clinic for the Final Visit.) or, ii. has a male&#xD;
                  sexual partner who is surgically sterilized prior to the Screen Visit and is the&#xD;
                  only male sexual partner for that subject or, iii. sexual partner(s) is of the&#xD;
                  same gender or, iv. Oral or implant contraceptives (either combined or&#xD;
                  progestogen only) with double-barrier method of contraception consisting of&#xD;
                  spermicide with either condom or diaphragm. (Women of child-bearing potential&#xD;
                  using an oral contraceptive in combination with a double-barrier method of&#xD;
                  contraception are required to continue to use this form of contraception for 1&#xD;
                  week following discontinuation of study medication) or, v. Use of double-barrier&#xD;
                  contraception, specifically, a spermicide plus a mechanical barrier (e.g. male&#xD;
                  condom, female diaphragm). The subject must be using this method for at least 1&#xD;
                  week following the end of the study or, vi. Use of any intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
                  with published data showing that the highest expected failure rate is less than&#xD;
                  1% per year. The subject must have the device inserted at least 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
                  the first Screen Visit, throughout the study, and 2 weeks following the end of&#xD;
                  the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Are hypersensitive to any of the components of the test product,&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Are currently taking probiotic or prebiotic supplements, or have taken them in the&#xD;
             past 28 days,&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Unwilling to avoid probiotics/prebiotics supplements for the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has taken antibiotics in the previous 3 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have a significant acute or chronic, unstable and untreated disease or any condition&#xD;
             which contraindicates, in the investigators judgement, entry to the study,&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject is a smoker,&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject has a history of drug and/or alcohol abuse at the time of enrolment,&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Having a condition or have taken a medication that the investigator believes would&#xD;
             interfere with the objectives of the study, pose a safety risk or confound the&#xD;
             interpretation of the study results;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Individuals who, in the opinion of the investigator, are considered to be poor&#xD;
             attendees or unlikely for any reason to be able to comply with the trial,&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects may not be receiving treatment involving experimental drugs,&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. If the subject has been in a recent experimental trial, these must have been completed&#xD;
             not less than 60 days prior to this study,&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Have a malignant disease or any concomitant end-stage organ disease.&#xD;
