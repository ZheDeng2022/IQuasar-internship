  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor and clopidogrel are FDA-approved drugs for inhibition of platelet hyper-reactivity&#xD;
      in certain clinical situations. The platelet inhibition and patient outcomes (PLATO) trial&#xD;
      showed that in patients with acute coronary syndromes, ticagrelor significantly reduced the&#xD;
      primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke), all-cause mortality&#xD;
      and cardiovascular mortality compared to clopidogrel. It has been suggested that in addition&#xD;
      to its anti-platelet effects, ticagrelor has additional unique effects, including&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects that are not shared by clopidogrel. In the present study the&#xD;
      investigators will assess whether ticagrelor, as compared to clopidogrel, increases serum&#xD;
      levels of 15-epi-lipoxin A4, a potent endogenous anti-inflammatory mediator.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel, ticagrelor and prasugrel are routinely used for platelet inhibition in addition&#xD;
      to aspirin in patients after acute coronary syndromes. The platelet inhibition and patient&#xD;
      outcomes (PLATO) trial showed that in patients with acute coronary syndromes, ticagrelor&#xD;
      significantly reduced the primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or&#xD;
      stroke), all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality compared to clopidogrel. On the&#xD;
      other hand, when compared with clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes with&#xD;
      scheduled percutaneous coronary intervention, prasugrel therapy did not affect overall&#xD;
      mortality despite the fact that it was associated with significantly reduced rates of&#xD;
      ischemic events, including stent thrombosis, but with an increased risk of major bleeding,&#xD;
      including fatal bleeding. This may suggest that ticagrelor possesses additional (pleiotropic)&#xD;
      effects besides platelet inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have recently shown that pioglitazone increases 15-epi-lipoxin A4 blood&#xD;
      levels in patients. The investigators have recently found that in the rat, ticagrelor&#xD;
      increases tissue levels of 15-epi-lipoxin A4 in the heart, aorta and kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is plausible that some of the favorable effects of ticagrelor seen in the clinical studies&#xD;
      are mediated via the anti-inflammatory effects of 15-epi-lipoxin A4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      15-epi-lipoxin A4 is a potent anti-inflammatory and inflammation-resolving mediator derived&#xD;
      from arachidonic acid. Several studies have suggested that ticagrelor has anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties in various animal models. In the present study the investigators will assess if&#xD;
      ticagrelor increases blood 15-epi-lipoxin A4 levels at doses used in patients.&#xD;
