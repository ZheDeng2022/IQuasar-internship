    <measure>Proportion of Eyes With Monocular Visual Acuity Better Than 20/40</measure>
    <time_frame>7 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Monocular visual acuity was assessed using distance Snellen visual acuity. Visual Acuity data was dichotomized such that 'response=1' if a subjects has 20/40 or better and 'response=0' if subject has worse than 20/40. The proportion of eyes with 20/40 or better was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Proportion of Eyes With Absolute Rotation Less Than or Equal to 10 Degrees</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minutes Post Insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute rotation was measured using a slit lamp. Absolute rotation measured at 15-minute post insertion was categorized into a binary outcome as 'response=1' if the absolute rotation is less than or equal to 10 degrees or 'response=0' otherwise. The proportion of eyes with absolute rotation less than or equal to 10 degrees was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Eyes With Lens Stability With Blink Within 5 Degrees</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minutes Post Insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Lens stability with blink was measured using a slit lamp. The rotational stability of the lens during a series of normal (unforced) blinks was measured for both eyes. The data was dichotomized as 'response=1' if the lens stability was less than or equal to 5 degrees or 'response=0' otherwise. The proportion of eyes with rotational stability of 5 degrees or lower was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Subject Eyes With Acceptable Lens Fit</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minute Post Insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of contact lens fit was assessed via slit lamp and was reported as a binary response as Acceptable or Unacceptable. The proportion of eyes with acceptable fit was reported.</description>

             this clinical protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must be a habitual toric contact lens wearer. Habitual wearer is defined&#xD;
             as someone who wears toric lenses for at least 6 hours a day, 5 days a week for the&#xD;
             past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject's vertex corrected spherical component of their distance refraction must be&#xD;
             between -1.50 Diopters Sphere (DS) to -4.00 DS (inclusive) in each eye.&#xD;

        <description>Lens stability with blink was measured using a slit lamp. The rotational stability of the lens during a series of normal (unforced) blinks was measured for both eyes. The data was dichotomized as 'response=1' if the lens stability was less than or equal to 5 degrees or 'response=0' otherwise. The proportion of eyes with rotational stability of 5 degrees or lower was reported.</description>
