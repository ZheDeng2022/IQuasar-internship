  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      prophylactic emicizumab treatment in participants previously treated with episodic or&#xD;
      prophylactic bypassing agents. Episodic bypassing agent participants will be randomized in a&#xD;
      2:1 fashion to receive emicizumab prophylaxis (Arm A) versus no prophylaxis (Arm B) and will&#xD;
      be stratified across Arms A and B according to the number of bleeds they experienced over the&#xD;
      last 24 weeks prior to study entry (less than [&lt;] 9 or greater than or equal to [&gt;/=] 9&#xD;
      bleeds); Arm B participants will have the opportunity to switch to emicizumab prophylaxis&#xD;
      after at least 24 weeks on-study. Prophylactic bypassing agent participants will switch to&#xD;
      emicizumab prophylaxis (Arm C) from the start of the trial; enrollment will be extended for&#xD;
      24 weeks after the last participant has enrolled in Arms A or B or until approximately 50&#xD;
      participants have enrolled in Arm C, whichever occurs first. Episodic bypassing agent&#xD;
      participants who previously participated in the non-interventional study BH29768&#xD;
      (NCT02476942) who were unable to enroll in Arms A or B, or participants on prophylactic&#xD;
      bypassing agents who were unable to enroll in Arm C, prior to their closure will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to enroll in Arm D. Like participants in Arms A and C, Arm D participants will&#xD;
      receive emicizumab prophylaxis from the start of the trial. All participants will continue to&#xD;
      receive episodic bypassing agent therapy to treat breakthrough bleeds, preferably with&#xD;
      recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa).&#xD;

    <measure>Model-Based Annualized Bleed Rate (ABR) for Treated Bleeds, Arm A: Emicizumab Versus Arm B: No Prophylaxis</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 24 weeks (median [min-max] efficacy observation periods in Arm A vs. Arm B: 29.29 [0.1-48.9] weeks vs. 24.14 [23.0-26.0] weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of treated bleeds over the efficacy period was assessed as an annualized bleed rate (ABR) using a negative binomial (NB) regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times. Treated bleeds were defined as a bleed that was directly followed by a hemophilia medication reported to be a &quot;treatment for bleed&quot;. The 72-hour rule was implemented: two bleeds of the same type and at the same anatomical location were counted as one bleed if the second bleed occurred within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were excluded. For participants whose dose was up-titrated, the efficacy period ended the day before the first day on the up-titrated dose.</description>

    <description>Haem-A-QoL questionnaire has been developed and used in hemophilia A participants. As a hemophilia-specific questionnaire, this measure assesses very specific aspects of dealing with hemophilia. This questionnaire consists of items pertaining to 10 domains specific to living with hemophilia. The 10 domains are: physical health, sports and leisure, school and work, dealing with hemophilia, family planning, feeling, relationships, treatment, view of yourself, and outlook for the future. The total score for each domain range from 0 to 100 with lower scores reflective of better quality of life. Physical Health domain score is reported (range 0 to 100, with lower scores reflective of better physical health).</description>

    <description>The Haemo-QoL-SF contains 35 items, which cover nine domains considered relevant for the children's health-related quality of life (physical health, feelings, view of yourself, family, friends, other people, sports and school, dealing with hemophilia and treatment). Items are rated with five respective response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always. Haemo-QoL-SF total score range from 0 to 100, where lower scores reflect better health-related quality of life. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to treatment. Because participants in Arm B switched from episodic bypassing agents to start receiving emicizumab prophylaxis after Week 24, the timepoints for Arm B (Emi) are expressed relative to first emicizumab dose; baseline for Arm B (Emi) is the same as Week 25 for Arm B (Control).</description>

    <description>Investigators sought information on adverse events (AEs) at each contact with participants. The WHO toxicity grading scale was used for assessing AE severity (i.e., intensity of an AE); any AEs not specifically listed in the WHO toxicity grading scale were assessed for severity according to the following grades: Grade 1 is mild; Grade 2 is moderate, Grade 3 is severe; Grade 4 is life-threatening; and Grade 5 is death. Regardless of severity, some AEs may have also met seriousness criteria. The terms &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; are not synonymous; severity and seriousness were independently assessed for each AE. For participants whose emicizumab dose was up-titrated, only data before up-titration is included. aPCC = activated prothrombin complex concentrate; Hypersens.= hypersensitivity</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 113 participants were enrolled in this study: 109 participants prior to the primary completion date plus a further 4 participants to Arm D of the study after the primary completion date. Participants in Arm A and Arm B were randomized in a 2:1 ratio; participants in Arm C and Arm D were enrolled without randomization.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Arm A: 1.5 mg/kg Emicizumab QW</title>
          <description>Participants who were receiving episodic treatment with bypassing agents prior to study entry and were randomized to study Arm A started to receive emicizumab prophylaxis. Emicizumab was administered at a loading dose of 3 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) once a week (QW) subcutaneously (SC) for the first 4 weeks followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg emicizumab QW SC up to the end of study.

          <description>Participants who were receiving episodic treatment with bypassing agents prior to study entry and were randomized to study Arm B continued with their prior episodic treatment regimen for the first 24 weeks of the study; they did not receive emicizumab prophylaxis during that time. After completing at least 24 weeks on study, participants in Arm B were allowed to switch to emicizumab prophylaxis (as described for Arm A) up to the end of study.

          <description>Participants who were receiving episodic treatment with bypassing agents prior to study entry and were randomized to study Arm B continued with their prior episodic treatment regimen for the first 24 weeks of the study; they did not receive emicizumab prophylaxis during that time. After completing at least 24 weeks on study, participants in Arm B were allowed to switch to emicizumab prophylaxis (as described for Arm A) up to the end of study.

        <title>Model-Based Annualized Bleed Rate (ABR) for Treated Bleeds, Arm A: Emicizumab Versus Arm B: No Prophylaxis</title>
        <description>The number of treated bleeds over the efficacy period was assessed as an annualized bleed rate (ABR) using a negative binomial (NB) regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times. Treated bleeds were defined as a bleed that was directly followed by a hemophilia medication reported to be a &quot;treatment for bleed&quot;. The 72-hour rule was implemented: two bleeds of the same type and at the same anatomical location were counted as one bleed if the second bleed occurred within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were excluded. For participants whose dose was up-titrated, the efficacy period ended the day before the first day on the up-titrated dose.</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline up to 24 weeks (median [min-max] efficacy observation periods in Arm A vs. Arm B: 29.29 [0.1-48.9] weeks vs. 24.14 [23.0-26.0] weeks)</time_frame>

          <description>The number of treated bleeds over the efficacy period was assessed as an annualized bleed rate (ABR) using a negative binomial (NB) regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times. Treated bleeds were defined as a bleed that was directly followed by a hemophilia medication reported to be a &quot;treatment for bleed&quot;. The 72-hour rule was implemented: two bleeds of the same type and at the same anatomical location were counted as one bleed if the second bleed occurred within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were excluded. For participants whose dose was up-titrated, the efficacy period ended the day before the first day on the up-titrated dose.</description>

        <description>The number of all bleeds over the efficacy period was assessed as an annualized bleed rate (ABR) using a negative binomial (NB) regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times. All bleeds included both treated bleeds (with coagulation factors) and non-treated bleeds.

        <title>Model-Based Annualized Bleed Rate (ABR) for Treated Joint Bleeds, Arm A: Emicizumab Versus Arm B: No Prophylaxis</title>
        <description>The number of treated joint bleeds over the efficacy period was assessed as an ABR using a negative binomial (NB) regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times. Treated joint bleeds were defined as treated bleeds in a joint associated with unusual sensation (aura) in a joint, in combination with another symptom: swelling/warmth, pain/decreased range of motion (RoM), or difficulty moving the joint. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were excluded.</description>

        <title>Intra-Participant Comparison of the Model-Based Annualized Bleed Rate (ABR) for All Bleeds in Arm C: Emicizumab Versus Previous Prophylactic Bypassing Agents</title>
        <description>This was an intra-participant comparison of the annualized bleed rates (ABRs) for all bleeds in Arm C participants who had previously received prophylactic bypassing agents during the non-interventional study (NIS) BH29768 (NCT02476942) (Arm C NIS) prior to entry in this study versus emicizumab prophylaxis during this study (Arm C). The number of all bleeds over the efficacy period was assessed as an ABR using a negative binomial (NB) regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times. All bleeds included both treated bleeds (with coagulation factors) and non-treated bleeds. The 72-hour rule was implemented: two bleeds of the same type and at the same anatomical location were counted as one bleed if the second bleed occurred within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were excluded. For participants whose dose was up-titrated, the efficacy period ended the day before the first day on the up-titrated dose.</description>

        <title>Model-Based Annualized Bleed Rate (ABR) for Treated Target Joint Bleeds, Arm A: Emicizumab Versus Arm B: No Prophylaxis</title>
        <description>The number of treated target joint bleeds over the efficacy period was assessed as an annualized bleed rate (ABR) using a negative binomial (NB) regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times. Treated target joint bleeds included treated (with coagulation factors) joint bleeds in a target joint, defined as a joint in which greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 3 treated joint bleeds occurred during the last 24 weeks prior to study entry. The 72-hour rule was implemented: two bleeds of the same type and at the same anatomical location were counted as one bleed if the second bleed occurred within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were excluded. For participants whose dose was up-titrated, the efficacy period ended the day before the first day on the up-titrated dose.</description>

        <description>Treated bleeds: a bleed for which coagulation factors were administered. All bleeds included both treated and non-treated bleeds. Treated spontaneous bleeds: treated bleeds with no known contributing factor (e.g., trauma, surgery). Treated joint bleeds: treated bleeds in a joint associated with unusual sensation (aura) in a joint, in combination with another symptom: swelling/warmth, pain/decreased range of motion (RoM), or difficulty moving the joint. Treated target joint bleeds: treated joint bleeds in a target joint, defined as a joint in which greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 3 treated joint bleeds occurred during the last 24 weeks prior to study entry. For all types of bleeds: the 72-hour rule was implemented, and bleeds due to surgery/procedure and bleeds after up-titration were excluded.</description>

        <title>Hemophilia-Specific Quality of Life (Haem-A-QoL) Questionnaire Physical Health Score at Week 25 in Adult Participants (&gt;/=18 Years Old), Arm A: Emicizumab Versus Arm B: No Prophylaxis</title>
        <description>Haem-A-QoL questionnaire has been developed and used in hemophilia A participants. As a hemophilia-specific questionnaire, this measure assesses very specific aspects of dealing with hemophilia. This questionnaire consists of items pertaining to 10 domains specific to living with hemophilia. The 10 domains are: physical health, sports and leisure, school and work, dealing with hemophilia, family planning, feeling, relationships, treatment, view of yourself, and outlook for the future. The total score for each domain range from 0 to 100 with lower scores reflective of better quality of life. Physical Health domain score is reported (range 0 to 100, with lower scores reflective of better physical health).</description>

        <title>European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Visual Analog Scale Score at Week 25, Arm A: Emicizumab Versus Arm B: No Prophylaxis</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized, participant-rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L includes 2 components: the EQ-5D-5L health state profile (descriptive system) and the EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog Scale. The Visual Analogue Scale is designed to rate the participant's current health state on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst imaginable health state and 100 represents the best imaginable health state.</description>

        <title>Hemophilia-Specific Quality of Life - Short Form (Haemo-Qol-SF) Questionnaire Total Score at Baseline and Week 25 in Adolescent Participants (12-17 Years Old)</title>
        <description>The Haemo-QoL-SF contains 35 items, which cover nine domains considered relevant for the children's health-related quality of life (physical health, feelings, view of yourself, family, friends, other people, sports and school, dealing with hemophilia and treatment). Items are rated with five respective response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, and always. Haemo-QoL-SF total score range from 0 to 100, where lower scores reflect better health-related quality of life. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to treatment. Because participants in Arm B switched from episodic bypassing agents to start receiving emicizumab prophylaxis after Week 24, the timepoints for Arm B (Emi) are expressed relative to first emicizumab dose; baseline for Arm B (Emi) is the same as Week 25 for Arm B (Control).</description>

        <description>The number of bleeds over the efficacy period was assessed as an ABR using a negative binomial (NB) regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times. Treated bleeds: a bleed for which coagulation factors were administered. All bleeds included both treated and non-treated bleeds. Treated spontaneous bleeds: treated bleeds with no known contributing factor (e.g., trauma, surgery). Treated joint bleeds: treated bleeds in a joint associated with unusual sensation (aura) in a joint, in combination with another symptom: swelling/warmth, pain/decreased range of motion (RoM), or difficulty moving the joint. Treated target joint bleeds: treated joint bleeds in a target joint, defined as a joint in which greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 3 treated joint bleeds occurred during the last 24 weeks prior to study entry. For all types of bleeds: the 72-hour rule was implemented, and bleeds due to surgery/procedure and bleeds after up-titration were excluded.</description>

          <description>The number of bleeds over the efficacy period was assessed as an ABR using a negative binomial (NB) regression model, which accounts for different follow-up times. Treated bleeds: a bleed for which coagulation factors were administered. All bleeds included both treated and non-treated bleeds. Treated spontaneous bleeds: treated bleeds with no known contributing factor (e.g., trauma, surgery). Treated joint bleeds: treated bleeds in a joint associated with unusual sensation (aura) in a joint, in combination with another symptom: swelling/warmth, pain/decreased range of motion (RoM), or difficulty moving the joint. Treated target joint bleeds: treated joint bleeds in a target joint, defined as a joint in which greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 3 treated joint bleeds occurred during the last 24 weeks prior to study entry. For all types of bleeds: the 72-hour rule was implemented, and bleeds due to surgery/procedure and bleeds after up-titration were excluded.</description>

        <title>Long-Term Efficacy of Emicizumab: Median Calculated Annualized Bleed Rates (ABR) for Treated Bleeds, All Bleeds, Treated Spontaneous Bleeds, Treated Joint Bleeds, and Treated Target Joint Bleeds, All Enrolled Participants</title>
        <description>The number of bleeds over the efficacy period was calculated as: ABR = (number of bleeds/number of days during the efficacy period) x 365.25. Treated bleeds: a bleed for which coagulation factors were administered. All bleeds included both treated and non-treated bleeds. Treated spontaneous bleeds: treated bleeds with no known contributing factor (e.g., trauma, surgery). Treated joint bleeds: treated bleeds in a joint associated with unusual sensation (aura) in a joint, in combination with another symptom: swelling/warmth, pain/decreased range of motion (RoM), or difficulty moving the joint. Treated target joint bleeds: treated joint bleeds in a target joint, defined as a joint in which greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 3 treated joint bleeds occurred during the last 24 weeks prior to study entry. For all types of bleeds: the 72-hour rule was implemented, and bleeds due to surgery/procedure and bleeds after up-titration were excluded.</description>

        <description>The number of treated bleeds over the efficacy period was calculated as: ABR = (number of bleeds/number of days during the efficacy period) x 365.25. Treated bleeds: a bleed for which coagulation factors were administered. The 72-hour rule was implemented: two bleeds of the same type and at the same anatomical location were counted as one bleed if the second bleed occurred within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were excluded. For participants whose dose was up-titrated, the efficacy period ended the day before the first day on the up-titrated dose.</description>

        <title>Long-Term Efficacy of Emicizumab: Median Calculated Annualized Bleed Rates (ABR) for Treated Bleeds Per 12-Week Intervals Over Time, All Enrolled Participants</title>
        <description>The number of treated bleeds over the efficacy period was calculated as: ABR = (number of bleeds/number of days during the efficacy period) x 365.25. Treated bleeds: a bleed for which coagulation factors were administered. The 72-hour rule was implemented: two bleeds of the same type and at the same anatomical location were counted as one bleed if the second bleed occurred within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were excluded. For participants whose dose was up-titrated, the efficacy period ended the day before the first day on the up-titrated dose.</description>

            <title>All Participants: 1.5 mg/kg Emicizumab QW</title>
            <description>This analysis set included all enrolled participants on the study. For Arm B, it only included participants starting after Week 24 on study when they crossed over to first receive prophylactic treatment with emicizumab. Emicizumab was administered at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg/week SC for the first 4 weeks followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg/week SC up to the end of study. Participants continued to receive bypassing agent therapy to treat breakthrough bleeds, with rFVIIa and/or aPCC.</description>

          <title>Long-Term Efficacy of Emicizumab: Median Calculated Annualized Bleed Rates (ABR) for Treated Bleeds Per 12-Week Intervals Over Time, All Enrolled Participants</title>
          <description>The number of treated bleeds over the efficacy period was calculated as: ABR = (number of bleeds/number of days during the efficacy period) x 365.25. Treated bleeds: a bleed for which coagulation factors were administered. The 72-hour rule was implemented: two bleeds of the same type and at the same anatomical location were counted as one bleed if the second bleed occurred within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were excluded. For participants whose dose was up-titrated, the efficacy period ended the day before the first day on the up-titrated dose.</description>
          <population>All enrolled participants; for Arm B, it only includes participants who switched to emicizumab prophylaxis after having completed the first 24 weeks on study with no prophylaxis. The number analyzed includes participants with available data over each interval.</population>

        <title>Long-Term Efficacy of Emicizumab: Mean Calculated Annualized Bleed Rates (ABR) for All Bleeds Per 12-Week Intervals Over Time, All Enrolled Participants</title>
        <description>The number of all bleeds over the efficacy period was calculated as: ABR = (number of bleeds/number of days during the efficacy period) x 365.25. All bleeds included both treated bleeds (with coagulation factors) and non-treated bleeds. The 72-hour rule was implemented: two bleeds of the same type and at the same anatomical location were counted as one bleed if the second bleed occurred within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were excluded. For participants whose dose was up-titrated, the efficacy period ended the day before the first day on the up-titrated dose.</description>

        <population>All enrolled participants; for Arm B, it only includes participants who switched to emicizumab prophylaxis after having completed the first 24 weeks on study with no prophylaxis. The number analyzed includes participants with available data over each interval.</population>

            <title>All Participants: 1.5 mg/kg Emicizumab QW</title>
            <description>This analysis set included all enrolled participants on the study. For Arm B, it only included participants starting after Week 24 on study when they crossed over to first receive prophylactic treatment with emicizumab. Emicizumab was administered at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg/week SC for the first 4 weeks followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg/week SC up to the end of study. Participants continued to receive bypassing agent therapy to treat breakthrough bleeds, with rFVIIa and/or aPCC.</description>

        <title>Long-Term Efficacy of Emicizumab: Median Calculated Annualized Bleed Rates (ABR) for All Bleeds Per 12-Week Intervals Over Time, All Enrolled Participants</title>
        <description>The number of all bleeds over the efficacy period was calculated as: ABR = (number of bleeds/number of days during the efficacy period) x 365.25. All bleeds included both treated bleeds (with coagulation factors) and non-treated bleeds. The 72-hour rule was implemented: two bleeds of the same type and at the same anatomical location were counted as one bleed if the second bleed occurred within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were excluded. For participants whose dose was up-titrated, the efficacy period ended the day before the first day on the up-titrated dose.</description>

        <population>All enrolled participants; for Arm B, it only includes participants who switched to emicizumab prophylaxis after having completed the first 24 weeks on study with no prophylaxis. The number analyzed includes participants with available data over each interval.</population>

            <title>All Participants: 1.5 mg/kg Emicizumab QW</title>
            <description>This analysis set included all enrolled participants on the study. For Arm B, it only included participants starting after Week 24 on study when they crossed over to first receive prophylactic treatment with emicizumab. Emicizumab was administered at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg/week SC for the first 4 weeks followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg/week SC up to the end of study. Participants continued to receive bypassing agent therapy to treat breakthrough bleeds, with rFVIIa and/or aPCC.</description>

        <title>Long-Term Efficacy of Emicizumab: Mean Calculated Annualized Bleed Rates (ABR) for Treated Spontaneous Bleeds Per 12-Week Intervals Over Time, All Enrolled Participants</title>
        <description>The number of treated spontaneous bleeds over the efficacy period was calculated as: ABR = (number of bleeds/number of days during the efficacy period) x 365.25. Treated spontaneous bleeds were defined as treated (with coagulation factors) bleeds with no known contributing factor (e.g., trauma, surgery). The 72-hour rule was implemented: two bleeds of the same type and at the same anatomical location were counted as one bleed if the second bleed occurred within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were excluded. For participants whose dose was up-titrated, the efficacy period ended the day before the first day on the up-titrated dose.</description>

        <population>All enrolled participants; for Arm B, it only includes participants who switched to emicizumab prophylaxis after having completed the first 24 weeks on study with no prophylaxis. The number analyzed includes participants with available data over each interval.</population>

            <title>All Participants: 1.5 mg/kg Emicizumab QW</title>
            <description>This analysis set included all enrolled participants on the study. For Arm B, it only included participants starting after Week 24 on study when they crossed over to first receive prophylactic treatment with emicizumab. Emicizumab was administered at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg/week SC for the first 4 weeks followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg/week SC up to the end of study. Participants continued to receive bypassing agent therapy to treat breakthrough bleeds, with rFVIIa and/or aPCC.</description>

        <title>Long-Term Efficacy of Emicizumab: Median Calculated Annualized Bleed Rates (ABR) for Treated Spontaneous Bleeds Per 12-Week Intervals Over Time, All Enrolled Participants</title>
        <description>The number of treated spontaneous bleeds over the efficacy period was calculated as: ABR = (number of bleeds/number of days during the efficacy period) x 365.25. Treated spontaneous bleeds were defined as treated (with coagulation factors) bleeds with no known contributing factor (e.g., trauma, surgery). The 72-hour rule was implemented: two bleeds of the same type and at the same anatomical location were counted as one bleed if the second bleed occurred within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were excluded. For participants whose dose was up-titrated, the efficacy period ended the day before the first day on the up-titrated dose.</description>
        <time_frame>1-12, 13-24, 25-36, 37-48, 49-60, 61-72, 73-84, 85-96, 97-108, 109-120, 121-132, 133-144, 145-156, 157-168, 169-180, 181-192, 193-204, 205-216, 217-228, and 229-240 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>All enrolled participants; for Arm B, it only includes participants who switched to emicizumab prophylaxis after having completed the first 24 weeks on study with no prophylaxis. The number analyzed includes participants with available data over each interval.</population>

            <title>All Participants: 1.5 mg/kg Emicizumab QW</title>
            <description>This analysis set included all enrolled participants on the study. For Arm B, it only included participants starting after Week 24 on study when they crossed over to first receive prophylactic treatment with emicizumab. Emicizumab was administered at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg/week SC for the first 4 weeks followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg/week SC up to the end of study. Participants continued to receive bypassing agent therapy to treat breakthrough bleeds, with rFVIIa and/or aPCC.</description>

        <title>Safety Summary of the Overall Number and Percentage of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event, Severity Assessed According to the WHO Toxicity Grading Scale</title>
        <description>Investigators sought information on adverse events (AEs) at each contact with participants. The WHO toxicity grading scale was used for assessing AE severity (i.e., intensity of an AE); any AEs not specifically listed in the WHO toxicity grading scale were assessed for severity according to the following grades: Grade 1 is mild; Grade 2 is moderate, Grade 3 is severe; Grade 4 is life-threatening; and Grade 5 is death. Regardless of severity, some AEs may have also met seriousness criteria. The terms &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; are not synonymous; severity and seriousness were independently assessed for each AE. For participants whose emicizumab dose was up-titrated, only data before up-titration is included. aPCC = activated prothrombin complex concentrate; Hypersens.= hypersensitivity</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline until study completion (median [min-max] safety observation period for all participants: 133.97 [0.1-249.1] weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Safety Population: All treated participants grouped by their assigned treatment. For Arm B, data collected while receiving episodic bypassing agents (no prophyalxis) for the first 24 weeks and 1.5 mg/kg emicizumab QW after Week 24 are reported separately under 'Arm B (Control): No Prophylaxis' and 'Arm B (Emi): 1.5 mg/kg Emicizumab QW', respectively.</population>

            <description>Participants who were receiving episodic treatment with bypassing agents prior to study entry and were randomized to study Arm A started to receive emicizumab prophylaxis. Emicizumab was administered at a loading dose of 3 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) once a week (QW) subcutaneously (SC) for the first 4 weeks followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg emicizumab QW SC up to the end of study.

          <population>Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluable population included all participants who received at least one dose of emicizumab and had at least one post-dose emicizumab concentration result. The number analyzed includes participants with PK samples at each timepoint.</population>

      <desc>Safety Population: All treated subjects grouped by treatment (including after up-titration). For Arm B, data collected with episodic bypassing agents (no prophyalxis) for first 24 weeks and with 1.5 mg/kg emicizumab QW after Week 24 are reported separately under Arm B (Control): No Prophylaxis and Arm B (Emi): 1.5 mg/kg Emicizumab QW, respectively.</desc>

          <description>Participants who were receiving episodic treatment with bypassing agents prior to study entry and were randomized to study Arm A started to receive emicizumab prophylaxis. Emicizumab was administered at a loading dose of 3 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) once a week (QW) subcutaneously (SC) for the first 4 weeks followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg emicizumab QW SC up to the end of study. Participants continued to receive bypassing agent therapy to treat any breakthrough bleeds.</description>

          <title>Arm B (Control): No Prophylaxis</title>
          <description>Participants who were receiving episodic treatment with bypassing agents prior to study entry and were randomized to study Arm B continued with their prior episodic treatment regimen for the first 24 weeks of the study; they did not receive emicizumab prophylaxis during that time. The safety data reported here represents data collected from all Arm B participants during the first 24 weeks of 'no prophylaxis'; safety data from Arm B participants who switched to emicizumab after Week 24 are reported separately under Arm B (Emi): 1.5 mg/kg Emicizumab QW.</description>

          <description>This arm includes Arm B participants who switched to emicizumab prophylaxis after completing at least 24-week no prophylaxis. Emicizumab was administered at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg/week SC for the first 4 weeks (after at least 24 weeks) followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg/week SC up to the end of study. Data reported represents data collected during emicizumab treatment only.</description>

          <description>Participants who were receiving prophylactic bypassing agents prior to study entry were enrolled in Arm C to receive prophylactic emicizumab. Emicizumab was administered at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg QW SC for the first 4 weeks followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg emicizumab QW SC up to the end of study. Participants continued to receive bypassing agent therapy to treat any breakthrough bleeds.</description>

Emicizumab was administered at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg QW SC for the first 4 weeks followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg emicizumab QW SC up to the end of study. Participants continued to receive bypassing agent therapy to treat any breakthrough bleeds.</description>
