  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delayed cord clamping (DCC) has been a subject of extensive research for the last couple of&#xD;
      years. Based on published data, numerous neonatal benefits have been suggested such as&#xD;
      increased hemoglobin and ferritin levels both at birth and longer term. Available systematic&#xD;
      reviews of DCC versus early cord clamping (ECC) reveal that it may also contribute to other&#xD;
      neonatal outcomes including polycythemia and hyperbilirubinemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review published nearly 10 years ago regarding late umbilical cord clamping revealed only 4&#xD;
      studies which as a second objective assessed whether the time of cord clamping was associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of polycythemia and hyperbilirubinemia during the first week of life.&#xD;
      Two studies reported that neonates with DCC had bilirubin levels &gt;15 mg/dl. No information is&#xD;
      provided on what hour of life the bilirubin levels were measured exactly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized control study the investigators would like to determine if delayed cord&#xD;
      clamping or cord milking during labor increases the risk of hyperbilirubinaemia (requiring&#xD;
      phototherapy) in term infants.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators feel that published results regarding 'jaundice&quot; and &quot;jaundice needing&#xD;
      phototherapy' (associated with DCC) may be misleading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, no information is offered about how &quot;clinical jaundice &quot;was assessed on examination.&#xD;
      The absence of jaundice is not an indication of the absence of hyperbilirubinemia. Estimation&#xD;
      of the degree of hyperbilirubinemia based solely on clinical examination can lead to errors.&#xD;
      The absence or the severity of jaundice is not predictive of subsequent severe&#xD;
      hyperbilirubinemia. A recent study revealed that the nurses' predischarge assessment of&#xD;
      jaundice extent was only moderately correlated with bilirubin concentration and was similar&#xD;
      in black and nonblack infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review published nearly 10 years ago regarding late umbilical cord clamping revealed only 4&#xD;
      studies which as a secondary objective which assessed whether the time of cord clamping was&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of polycythemia and hyperbilirubinemia during the first&#xD;
      week of life. Two studies reported that neonates with DCC had bilirubin levels &gt;15 mg/dl. No&#xD;
      information is provided on what hour of life the bilirubin levels were measured exactly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, guidelines to treat jaundice have changed over time and none of the studies mention&#xD;
      what threshold was used for administering phototherapy. No information is given if, staff&#xD;
      responsible for phototherapy administration was blinded to the type of cord clamping&#xD;
      intervention. Potential confounders such as isoimmune hemolytic disease, symptoms of sepsis&#xD;
      (significant lethargy, temperature instability), asphyxia, G6PD, acidosis, albumin &lt;3 g/L&#xD;
      were not included in the analysis. Also another important factor such feeding policy at the&#xD;
      time of bilirubin measurement wasn't mentioned in neither of the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of all mentioned above confounders in available studies has lead the&#xD;
      investigators to conduct a blinded randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postnatal hyperbilirubinemia is universal and manifests as newborn jaundice in over 60-80% of&#xD;
      all newborns. If left untreated hyperbilirubinemia may progress to excessive levels that can&#xD;
      be associated with evident bilirubin neurotoxicity. Jaundice is the most common clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis in neonatal medicine. Elevated bilirubin concentrations may occur due to increased&#xD;
      bilirubin production (breakdown of heme moiety of hemoglobin) and/or delayed bilirubin&#xD;
      elimination (hepatic and intestinal) as well as by a unique neonatal phenomenon of&#xD;
      enterohepatic reabsorption of bilirubin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that late cord clamping benefits expand beyond the neonatal period. A meta&#xD;
      -analyses estimated a significant 47% reduction in the risk of anemia and 33% reduction in&#xD;
      risk of having deficient iron stores at ages 2 to 3 months in the delayed cord clamping&#xD;
      group. These pooled results are based on two small studies, and despite a significant number&#xD;
      of patients lost to follow up (40%), these results agree with a large randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to understand whether evidence based benefits of DCC (such as increase of&#xD;
      hemoglobin, improved iron status, and decreased risk of infant anemia) may also contribute to&#xD;
      less favorable neonatal outcomes. This trial will aim to assess if delayed cord clamping&#xD;
      truly increases the risk of hyperbilirubinaemia requiring phototherapy or even exchange&#xD;
      transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total feto-placental blood volume is about 120 ml/kg of fetal weight. At birth, the&#xD;
      distribution of blood between fetus and placenta is roughly at a ratio of 2:1. Increasing&#xD;
      placental transfusion to at least three minutes leads to a larger infant blood volume (ratio&#xD;
      5:1).The rate of placental transfusion is markedly influenced by the position of the&#xD;
      delivered infant. From at least 10 cm above to at least 10 cm below the level of the&#xD;
      placenta, infants receive the maximum possible amount after at least three minutes of birth .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that studied delayed cord clamping in&#xD;
      vaginally born, healthy, term infants differed in clamping time and infant position before&#xD;
      clamping and there is still no consensus about the time required for a sufficient amount of&#xD;
      blood to be transfused from the placenta to the baby. The above mentioned trials showed that&#xD;
      placental-neonate blood flow significantly increases after DCC by showing higher packed cell&#xD;
      volume or hemoglobin concentration in the first 24 hours after birth compared with immediate&#xD;
      clamping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis, investigators have decided to delay cord clamping in the intervention&#xD;
      group to 3 minutes and place the baby 10 cm above the placental, as it seems most efficient&#xD;
      based on the available literature. At all births (spontaneous vaginal deliveries and&#xD;
      caesarian sections) a member of the recruitment team will be present. He will inform the&#xD;
      midwife or obstetrician about the allocated intervention and measure the time from the&#xD;
      delivery of the shoulders to the cord clamping. If cord milking will be the allocated&#xD;
      intervention, the recruiter will supervise the midwife, or obstetrician preforming the&#xD;
      procedure, and count out loud the number of times the cord has been milked. During vaginal&#xD;
      deliveries midwifes will be asked to maintain the infant at least 10 cm above the uterus&#xD;
      until the cord is clamped. In case of caesarian sections the baby will be placed on the&#xD;
      mother's laps and swaddled in sterile towels to prevent heat loss. In the early cord clamping&#xD;
      group, the recruiter will inform the midwife or obstetrician when 30 seconds have passed. In&#xD;
      the delayed clamping group, the recruiter will inform the midwife or obstetrician after 3&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If cord milking will be applied the baby will be placed below the level of the placenta,&#xD;
      between the mother's thighs (during a vaginal delivery) or at the side of the mother swaddled&#xD;
      in sterile towels (during a caesarian delivery). Based on available literature, before&#xD;
      starting the trial investigators piloted this procedure[13]. They checked that about two&#xD;
      thirds of the umbilical cord will be present for milking both during a vaginal and caesarian&#xD;
      delivery. If the cord was milked once we were able to transfer approximately 10 ml of blood&#xD;
      to the neonate. Following this, and under the assumption that the cord vein will be rapidly&#xD;
      refilling itself, investigators assume that milking the cord four times will give us 40 ml of&#xD;
      blood [13]. A member of the delivery team (vaginal delivery) or operating team (caesarian&#xD;
      delivery) will hold the cord at the level of the introitus or cesarean wound, and milk the&#xD;
      cord four times towards the neonate counting out loud. The cord will be clamped after the&#xD;
      forth milking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choice of comparator In spite of available studies which advocate for delayed cord clamping,&#xD;
      it is still infrequently used in labor wards throughout the world[28]. According to the new&#xD;
      guidelines early cord clamping-ECC is defined as cord clamping at less than 60 seconds after&#xD;
      the delivery. The available meta-analyses comparing early versus late cord clamping include&#xD;
      studies which significantly vary in defining ECC. The majority of trials define ECC as&#xD;
      clamping within the first 10 seconds, other describe ECC as immediate clamping. Only one&#xD;
      trial extended ECC to be as long as 60 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new 2010 ILCOR (International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation) guidelines advocate for&#xD;
      DDC, stating that cord clamping should be delayed for at least 1 min from the complete&#xD;
      delivery of the baby. Investigators have chosen this definition, as the ILCOR committee&#xD;
      provides an international consensus and evidence based guidelines on emergency care, which&#xD;
      are widely accepted among neonatologist throughout the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECC is part of active management of labour. Active management usually involves the clinician&#xD;
      intervening in the process through three interrelated processes: the administration of a&#xD;
      prophylactic uterotonic drug; cord clamping and cutting at ≤60 seconds after delivery; and&#xD;
      controlled traction of the umbilical cord. These interventions are aimed at reduction in the&#xD;
      risk of postpartum haemorrhage. However, ECC eliminates the possibility of additional blood&#xD;
      flowing from the placenta to the newborn, and deprives the baby from numerous profits such as&#xD;
      receiving extra amounts of iron. This potential additional amount of iron prevents iron&#xD;
      deficiency during the first year of life in infants born with delayed cord clamping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis Neither delayed cord clamping nor cord milking during labor does not&#xD;
      increase significantly the risk of hyperbilirubinaemia in comparison to early cord clamping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of trial design The trail is designed as a randomized controlled, observer&#xD;
      blinded trial with 3 parallel groups and a primary endpoint of hyperbilirubinemia requiring&#xD;
      phototherapy. Randomization will be performed as block randomization with a 1:1:1 allocation.&#xD;
      The experiment is designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of delayed cord clamping and cord&#xD;
      milking group in comparison to early cord clamping group regarding the incidence of&#xD;
      bilirubinemia treated with phototherapy in neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of study settings The study will be carried out in the Princess Anne's Hospital&#xD;
      in Warsaw, Poland. This is a level III teaching hospital with approximately 3500 (1000 &lt; 37&#xD;
      weeks of gestation) deliveries per year and 63 neonatal beds. It is also a referral center&#xD;
      for gestational and pre-gestational diabetes as well as pregnancy induced hypertension.&#xD;
      Having access to high risk mothers will augment the population of small for gestation infants&#xD;
      (SGA), and infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) in the study. SGA and IDM have an increased risk&#xD;
      for hyperbilirubinemia, thus the presence of the above patients will improve the&#xD;
      generalizability of the study population. The local protocol on cord clamping has not yet&#xD;
      been adjusted to the new ILCOR guidelines, but labour ward staff are willing to implement new&#xD;
      procedures. This should improve trail recruitment and adherence.&#xD;
