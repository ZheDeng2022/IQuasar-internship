  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Sample size：Seventy two cases will be enrolled in breast milk group, 144 cases in&#xD;
           formula milk group, 72 cases each in commercially available formula subgroup and Friso&#xD;
           formula subgroup with 36 cases each in every hospital (18 males and 18 females).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Observation period：Observational period will maintain 12 weeks. Infants of breast milk&#xD;
           group are fed with breast milk before inclusion and during the trial process. In the&#xD;
           formula milk groups, if subjects were fed with other formula instead of commercially&#xD;
           available formula and Friso formula before inclusion, then a wash-out period of no more&#xD;
           than 2 weeks is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Random method: In commercially available formula subgroup and Friso formula subgroup,&#xD;
           infants will be included randomly. Random allocation sequence is generated in six trial&#xD;
           centers by the editorial department of Chinese Journal of Evidence-Based Pediatrics,&#xD;
           included infants are chosen and their information including name, gender, their parents'&#xD;
           name and telephone is reported to the editorial department of Chinese Journal of&#xD;
           Evidence-Based Pediatrics via WeChat. Then group division information is acquired, the&#xD;
           tested commercially available formula and Friso formula are given out to infants&#xD;
           accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Match of the breast milk group: Infants with purely breast milk-fed will be chosen.&#xD;
           Infants'gender and body weight (±5%) of breast matched with milk-fed group commercially&#xD;
           available formula subgroup and Friso formula subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Blinding method: Subjects, doctors and nurses know which formula is given. Personals in&#xD;
           charge of assessing stool character and ery secretion, and data analysis, are blind to&#xD;
           the information of group division.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Data records, monitoring and management 6.1 Data records 6.1.1 Original records:&#xD;
           Subjects' follow-up care cards are original files in this clinical trial which is in&#xD;
           duplicate copies. One copy should be saved in hospital. Original records shall be&#xD;
           traceable. Each researcher must strictly follow the principle of GCP and ensure that he&#xD;
           will record any observation and discovery in the follow-up care card and case report&#xD;
           form (CRF), all data are consistent, no optional changes are allowed. If any correction&#xD;
           is needed, the original record must not be changed, researchers can only add extra&#xD;
           descriptions and explain the reason, the correction needs to be signed and dated by&#xD;
           researchers who make it.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.1.2 Case report form(CRF): Each in triplicate, it will be delivered to sponsors, main&#xD;
           institutions of clinical research and participating institutions of clinical research.&#xD;
           According to the principle of GCP, subjects' name should not appear in order to ensure&#xD;
           their privacy. Subjects' name must be filled in the initials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All of the choices&quot;□&quot; will be marked&quot;×&quot;. If some inspection items are not examined or&#xD;
           missed for some reason, it should be filled in: not examined. If the specific formula&#xD;
           dosage is unknown, it should be filled in: unknown. When filled in the numbers, it&#xD;
           should be filled in all □. If digits are not enough, it should be filled on right side.&#xD;
           If left side is empty, it should be filled by 0. No null terms or missing items are&#xD;
           allowed. Researchers must ensure that all data must be consistent with the original&#xD;
           record.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If modifying, researchers should draw a horizontal line in the middle of the original&#xD;
           record text, sidenote to modify, and then sign the modifier's name and the date. He must&#xD;
           not smear or cover the original record.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.1.3 Data Record of subjects' guardian: It should be recorded according to the items&#xD;
           and their definitions in the designed CRF chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.1.4 Extremum principles: The data, deviating significantly or outside the acceptable&#xD;
           range clinically, must be verified. Clinical doctors must make the necessary&#xD;
           instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.1.5 Data registration and preservation: Every time after the follow-up visit,&#xD;
           researchers should record the required information in the case report sheet timely.&#xD;
           After the end of each subjects' observed period, researchers should accurately record&#xD;
           relevant information from original records in the form of data in the CRF within 7 days.&#xD;
           CRF, informed consent and other documents should be examined and signed by the project&#xD;
           leader, then saved in the archive office of institution. If a problem is found, it&#xD;
           should be timely dealt with and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2 Data monitoring Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Evidence-Based Pediatrics will&#xD;
           be in charge of data monitoring of the clinical trial. CJEBP will provide data&#xD;
           monitoring of the clinical trial to FrieslandCampina regularly in at middle experiment&#xD;
           stage and later experiment stage. During the trial, CJEBP will investigate 6 research&#xD;
           centers for their quality of practice at least one time, without any announcement in&#xD;
           advance. The monitoring subjects include child care doctors, nurses and guardians of&#xD;
           subjects enrolled in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2.1 Child care doctors: monitor the quality of explaining the research to subjects'&#xD;
           guardians and the informed consent signing; Random of distribution; The accurate&#xD;
           measurement of body length, weight and head-circumference; judgement of gut intolerance;&#xD;
           record of stool frequency, pictures of stools and eye secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2.2 Nurses: motor the accuracy of the measuring equipment; the correctness of the&#xD;
           measuring method; the rightness of data recording (mean value of 2 measurements); the&#xD;
           management of trial formula (reception time, check-up, distribution subjects, date and&#xD;
           signature, recycling subjects, date, quantity of the rest formula and signature).&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2.3 Guardians of subjects enrolled in this trial: randomly inspect 1-2 guardians,&#xD;
           investigate whether mixed feeding or mixed with other brand formula feeding exists; the&#xD;
           usage of trial formula; regularity of follow-up visits; taking photos of fresh stools&#xD;
           and eye secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.3 Data management 6.3.1 Buildup, test and data entry of WeChat client: According to&#xD;
           the project of the CRF，administrators will establish WeChat client, test and modify this&#xD;
           client, and enter data after ensuring the accuracy of this client. Every researcher in&#xD;
           each hospital uploads the measured data to administrators by WeChat client on the day he&#xD;
           completes one case observation and measurement. In order to ensure the accuracy of the&#xD;
           data, administrators should compare data uploaded by WeChat client with the original&#xD;
           CRF. Subjects' guardians will upload photos of stool character and eye secretion to&#xD;
           administrators by WeChat client at 3 points of follow-up time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.3.2 Generation and correction of doubt, quality control(QC) and database shutdown:&#xD;
           After completing data input and comparison, data administrators will verify the&#xD;
           reliability, integrity and accuracy of data according to requirements of clinical trial&#xD;
           scheme. If he finds loss of content or logic contradiction or filling in wrong or&#xD;
           uncertain data, clinical monitors will send it to clinical trial centers in the form of&#xD;
           data question table (DQF). Researchers will give answers to questions as soon as&#xD;
           possible and reply. Data administrators will modify, confirm and correct data according&#xD;
           to researchers' answers. After solving all of problems, quality control personnels will&#xD;
           check the quality of database according to QC plan. Then he will close the database&#xD;
           after check.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.3.3 Data check, lock and transmit blindly: Data administrators submit data management&#xD;
           reports, and require a meeting about data-check blindly attended by principal&#xD;
           investigator, statistical analyst, data administrators, monitors, and sponsors. Check&#xD;
           data blindly, sign blindly data-check resolution after meeting, lock in the database;&#xD;
           locked data will be analyzed by personnels of statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Statistic analysis 7.1 General principles: All of the statistical tests must be&#xD;
           two-sided tests, P&lt;0.05 is considered to be statistically significant difference for all&#xD;
           tests. Mean, median, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, 25% and 75% quintile are used&#xD;
           for statistical description of measurement data. Count data or level data is described&#xD;
           by frequency ( percentage).&#xD;
&#xD;
           SAS9.1.3 statistical software is used for statistical analysis. 7.2 Analysis of missing&#xD;
           cases: List cases number of inclusion, completion and falling off. Loss rate and&#xD;
           comparison between groups should be analyzed by Chi-square test and Fisher's exact&#xD;
           probability method.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.3 Evaluation of effectiveness: Measurement data of indexes(Growth rate of height,&#xD;
           weight and head circumference at 4,8,12 week, defication frequency) should be analyzed&#xD;
           by normality test firstly. If data conforms to normal distribution, the comparation&#xD;
           between formula milk group (commercially available formula subgroup and Friso formula&#xD;
           subgroup) and breast milk group should be analysed by One-Way ANOVA method. LSD method&#xD;
           is used for multiple comparisons. If data does not conform to normal distribution, then&#xD;
           Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test is used. A level of significance is α=0.05 (two-tailed).&#xD;
           Frequency data of indexes ( incidence of constipation at 4,8,12 week, eyes secretion) is&#xD;
           recorded as cases or percentage. If theoretical frequency &lt;5 or total observed frequency&#xD;
           &lt;30, Fisher's exact probability method is used; otherwise Chi-square test is used. A&#xD;
           level of significance is α=0.05 (two-tailed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Quality control Standardized operation procedures should be established in all of&#xD;
           research process.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.1 Qualification of research institution: Research institution must be community health&#xD;
           service centers qualified for baby healthy check-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.2 Qualification of researchers: The researchers need GCP training and work under the&#xD;
           guidance of senior professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.3 Trial quality control measures: ①Before the start of clinical trials, researchers&#xD;
           (including nurses) must receive training for measurement of height, weight and head&#xD;
           circumference; ②check measurement bed before measurement everyday. Researchers must&#xD;
           compare scale on plastic flexible rule with that on standard steel rule and change&#xD;
           plastic flexible if error &gt;0.1cm. ③The pictures of the feces and eyes will be&#xD;
           independently scored by 2 specialists under the condition of unknowing the group. ④The&#xD;
           specialist must be responsible for experimental formula, counter locked, storage at room&#xD;
           temperature away from light. The remaining experimental formula will be stored&#xD;
           separately, registering number. At the end of trial, the remaining experimental formula&#xD;
           will be sent back to sponsor.⑤Monitor: Monitor will be appointed by sponsor, ensuring&#xD;
           subjects' interests during period of trial. Trial record and data report must be true,&#xD;
           accurate, complete and correct, ensuring that trial must comply with both approved plan&#xD;
           and Relevant laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Definition and management of adverse events 9.1 Definition of adverse events: adverse&#xD;
           events are defined as those occur after a patient or a subject in a clinical study&#xD;
           receives a tested product, the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship&#xD;
           with the test products. Adverse events are the diseases or signs or symptoms that occur&#xD;
           during the course of the study (including abnormal laboratory findings). Adverse events&#xD;
           can be serious or not serious, may or may not cause the subjects to withdraw from the&#xD;
           study. All adverse events must be recorded, and the relationship between the product and&#xD;
           the product is evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2 Information collection of adverse events: researchers must know and record the following&#xD;
      information concerning adverse events: subjects and date, description of the event, source of&#xD;
      report, the suspected products, continuous time, frequency, extent, severity, measures taken,&#xD;
      results and complications, the relationship with tested products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3 Extent of adverse events: Mild: symptoms were not obvious, only slightly harmful to&#xD;
      health. Middle: the symptoms are obvious, but can be tolerated, without immediate treatment.&#xD;
      Serious: it is hard to bear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.4 Severity of adverse events: Serious adverse events refer to the follwing adverse events&#xD;
      which appear at any of the dosage: leading to death, threatening life , need to be&#xD;
      hospitalized or hospitalization has been prolonged, resulting in permanent or significant&#xD;
      disability and loss of function, congenital anomalies or birth defects, or other significant&#xD;
      medical events. Not serious: Those events can not be defined as serious adverse events are&#xD;
      not serious events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.5 Unexpected or expected serious adverse events: Researchers must assess whether the&#xD;
      adverse events be expected to occur or not. Expectation is evaluated by Safety Officer&#xD;
      Medical which base on the current knowledge and existing product information. An unexpected&#xD;
      adverse event is one that the nature, severity, frequency are inconsistent with conditions of&#xD;
      the study and ( or) product information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All suspected adverse events related to the tested products, as well as serious adverse&#xD;
      events that are not expected to be serious are considered to be SUSARs (suspicious unexpected&#xD;
      serious adverse event). SUSAR need to be reported to the management authority or independent&#xD;
      ethics committee in a very short time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Chinese food and Drug Administration report of adverse reactions and and&#xD;
      regulations of drug supervision, any new or serious adverse reactions of any drug must be&#xD;
      reported within 15 days, any deaths must be reported immediately. Fax: +86-10-67184591,&#xD;
      Email: report@adr.gov.cn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.6 Relationship with the tested product: Medical institutions will evaluate the relationship&#xD;
      between adverse events and the tested product according to the following standards. ①&#xD;
      unrelevant: there is evidence proving that adverse events are caused by other reasons. For&#xD;
      example, adverse events are obviously caused by the disease, adverse events are consistant&#xD;
      with effects or adverse reactions of the drugs, or adverse events had already existed before&#xD;
      using the tested product research. ② Not likely to be relevant: it seems to have a&#xD;
      time-relationship with the use of tested product, but the occurrence of adverse events can be&#xD;
      explained by other reasons. ③Probably relevant: it seems to have a time-relationship with the&#xD;
      use of tested product, and adverse events seem to have a causal relationship with the&#xD;
      product. ④ Surely relevant: it seems to have a time-relationship with the use of tested&#xD;
      product, and no other reasons can explain the occurrence of adverse events. Adverse events&#xD;
      diminish or disappear after stopping using tested products, and symptoms occur once again&#xD;
      with the use of tested products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.7 report and record: ①serious adverse events: clinical safety management must be informed&#xD;
      by fax or scaning within 24 hours, regardless of whether the event is related to the tested&#xD;
      product. When it's the first time to report, or each time when SAE needs modification,&#xD;
      researchers need to complete serious adverse events spreadsheet in the eCRF, The spreadsheet&#xD;
      will be automaticly sent to clinical safety manager xt211311@aliyun.com in the form of email.&#xD;
      All serious adverse events are also required in the eCRF spreadsheet severity column to&#xD;
      choose &quot;serious&quot;. ②Not serious adverse events: all not serious adverse events must be&#xD;
      recorded on the eCRF's adverse events page.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.8 follow-up visits: All serious adverse events should be followed up until the outcome of&#xD;
      the event. The researchers need to inform the clinical safety manager of any follow-up&#xD;
      information within 24 hours, such as changes in diagnosis, results, the date of remission,&#xD;
      the termination of treatment, and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If serious adverse events persist after discontinuation of the study, follow-up is required.&#xD;
      In addition, when adverse events occur, if it's necessary to further evaluate the causal&#xD;
      relationship between adverse events and the tested product, then all the examinations and&#xD;
      laboratory results must be recorded in the case report form or attached document. Within 30&#xD;
      days after the last use of the study product, the SAE also needs to be reported in the same&#xD;
      way within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.9 Inform: The sponsor is responsible for the safety evaluation of the tested product. The&#xD;
      sponsor must promptly inform all researchers, observational hospitals and regulatory&#xD;
      authorities of any discoveries that are likely to affect subjects' safety, influence study&#xD;
      process, change the ethics committee's attitude to approve or agree that research continues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.10 Report: The sponsor must accelerate reporting to all investigators, observational&#xD;
      hospitals, IRB (S) /IEC (s) and management authorities (if necessary) about all serious and&#xD;
      suspicious unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This accelerated report needs to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, and ICH&#xD;
      guidelines on the management of clinical safety data: standards of accelerated reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor should submit all latest progress and staged reports of security to management&#xD;
      authorities, according to applicable regulatory requirements&#xD;
