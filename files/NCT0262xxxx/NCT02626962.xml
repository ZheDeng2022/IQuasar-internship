  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single-arm study of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in subjects with&#xD;
      previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma. Previous studies with&#xD;
      immunotherapy have shown promising results and this synergistic combination was very&#xD;
      effective in other tumors. This study will allow for further characterization of the safety&#xD;
      and clinical activity of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in subjects with uveal melanoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uveal melanoma is a rare disease, accounting for 0.1% of all cancer deaths. This disease&#xD;
      arises from melanocytes of the uveal tract and is the most common primary intraocular tumor&#xD;
      in adults, with an incidence estimated at 0.6 per 100,000 persons/year in the Western&#xD;
      population and seems to have remained stable over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastases in uveal melanoma appear in 6.5%-35% of the patients during the first decade. The&#xD;
      clinical and metastatic behavior differs from cutaneous melanoma because of its initially&#xD;
      purely hematogenous dissemination and its tendency to metastasize to the liver. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the liver is almost a &quot;sentinel lymph node&quot; for uveal melanoma, because it is affected in 95%&#xD;
      of patients and it is the sole site of metastasis in most cases. This specific ocular-hepatic&#xD;
      tropism remains unexplained. When liver metastases develop, the prognosis is poor and life&#xD;
      expectancy is reduced to less than 6 months in the absence of treatment. Only few prognostic&#xD;
      factors for survival have been identified. Age, short time interval to metastases&#xD;
      development, and tumor burden in the liver have shown a negative impact on survival, whereas&#xD;
      patients diagnosed at regular follow-up survive significantly longer, probably due to the&#xD;
      earlier diagnosis. Several loco-regional treatment options can be considered if metastases&#xD;
      are confined to the liver, including partial hepatic resection or radiofrequency ablation.&#xD;
      Curative resection is possible in only a small fraction of patients due to the number,&#xD;
      location or size of the metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic chemotherapy is usually unsuccessful in metastatic uveal melanoma and results were&#xD;
      recently reviewed showing an Overall Response Rate of 4,6 %with 95% CI 3.3-6.3%. There is no&#xD;
      proof that conventional chemotherapy prolongs survival with most studies reporting OS between&#xD;
      5 and 12 months. Most therapies are derived from the experience extrapolated from cutaneous&#xD;
      melanoma. Only few chemotherapeutic regimens have been studied in phase II trials such as&#xD;
      bleomycin /vincristine/ lomustine /dacarbazine (BOLD), fotemustine,9-nitrocamptothecin,&#xD;
      temozolomide, bendamustine, gemcitabine/treosulfan, cisplatin/gemcitabine/treosulfan, and&#xD;
      dacarbazine/treosulfan with poor results that range from 0 to 15% response rate and less than&#xD;
      12 months overall survival with first line therapy. A phase III trial randomizing patients to&#xD;
      chemotherapy or Best Suportive Care (BSC) is not expected to be performed because of&#xD;
      difficulty in recruiting due to the low incidence of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the other hand, the best understanding of the biology of cancer disease has allowed us to&#xD;
      identify pathways that are important in mechanisms of proliferation, survival or&#xD;
      dissemination. Recently Guanine Nucleotide-Binding Protein G (GNAQ) gene oncogenic mutation&#xD;
      has been identified in close to 50% of primary uveal melanomas. The emergence of newer agents&#xD;
      that target this or other pathways (such as selumetinib, sunitinib, imatinib, vorinostat,&#xD;
      antiangiogenics) have resulted in multiple small studies that up to date have failed to show&#xD;
      a clear superiority against chemotherapy. To summarize, patients with metastatic uveal&#xD;
      melanoma should be included in clinical trials evaluating other options with newer agents&#xD;
      with potentially less toxicity and greater efficacy than conventional chemotherapy.&#xD;
