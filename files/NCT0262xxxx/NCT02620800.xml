      The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety and potential benefit of metronomic&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil in combination with nab®1-paclitaxel, bevacizumab, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Phase 1 portion of the study is an open-label study enrolling subjects with metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma who have not previously received systemic chemotherapy at any time&#xD;
      as treatment for pancreatic cancer (including adjuvant chemotherapy), except low dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy administered as a radiosensitizer concomitant with radiotherapy and to determine&#xD;
      the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of metronomic 5-FU in&#xD;
      combination with nab-paclitaxel, bevacizumab, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled in cohorts of 6 subjects. There will be no dose escalation. Dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicities will be assessed in cycle 1. If there is an incidence of ≥2 of 6 subjects&#xD;
      experiencing a DLT, the dose will be de-escalated to the next lower dose. Based on the&#xD;
      totality of the data, the investigators may advise the Sponsor to evaluate additional&#xD;
      subjects at any of the dose levels. Upon Sponsor agreement, if additional subjects are&#xD;
      enrolled at any dose level, DLT evaluation will occur at that same ratio (if ≥ 4 of 12&#xD;
      subjects, or ≥ 6 of 18 subjects experience a DLT, the dose will be de-escalated).&#xD;
      Approximately 12-24 subjects will be enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study, dependent&#xD;
      on the number of dose levels examined and the number of subjects enrolled at each dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will continuously be evaluated by incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events&#xD;
      (TEAEs) by the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and severity&#xD;
      according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI&#xD;
      CTCAE) Version 4.03 (v4.03).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2 part of the study is to determine if the combination of metronomic 5-FU,&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel, bevacizumab, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin at the RP2D defined in Phase 1&#xD;
      achieves a clinically meaningful improvement in 1 year survival rate over the historical&#xD;
      control. Approximately 60 subjects are planned to be enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may remain on treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal&#xD;
      of consent, physician decision, or death. The anticipated duration of the study (including&#xD;
      Phase 1, Phase 2 and follow-up) is approximately 4 years.&#xD;

      of consent, physician decision, or death. The anticipated duration of the study (including&#xD;
      Phase 1, Phase 2 and follow-up) is approximately 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the Phase 1 portion of the study, a decision not to proceed with the Phase&#xD;
      2 portion was taken by the Sponsor. The decision to terminate the study after Phase 1 was not&#xD;
      based on any safety concerns that posed an unacceptable risk for this patient population and&#xD;
      no safety issues have been identified.&#xD;
