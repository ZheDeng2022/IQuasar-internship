  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test MUSTCOOL, a home-based self-monitoring and self-management&#xD;
      ulcer prevention intervention for patients with newly healed chronic venous leg and diabetic&#xD;
      foot ulcers. Almost 90% of ulcers recur within 3 months of healing. During the six-month&#xD;
      randomized clinic trial, skin temperature will be monitored daily, a maintenance dose of&#xD;
      cooling gel pack or placebo will be applied three times weekly to the affected skin, and a&#xD;
      bolus dose of cooling will be applied for 5 consecutive days if skin temperature becomes&#xD;
      elevated. Outcomes on the incidence of leg ulcer recurrence, pain, physical activity and&#xD;
      quality of life will be measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized control trial is to test a patient directed self-monitoring and&#xD;
      self-management intervention aimed at preventing the recurrence of chronic venous leg and&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers using skin temperature and cryotherapy (cooling). This MUSTCOOL study is&#xD;
      a novel ulcer prevention strategy for patients at highest risk for developing chronic ulcers;&#xD;
      those with a previous history. The aims are to compare a cooling treatment to a placebo to&#xD;
      determine the outcomes on ulcer recurrence, pain, physical activity and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with newly healed chronic ulcers will be invited to participate in MUSTCOOL's two&#xD;
      component intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. self monitoring skin temperature over targeted &quot;hot spots&quot; daily with an infrared&#xD;
           thermometer; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. maintenance cooling with a cooling pack (or placebo pack) placed over the &quot;hot spot&quot;&#xD;
           three times each week for 30 minutes. If the temperature of the &quot;hot spot&quot; becomes&#xD;
           elevated 2Â°F above baseline (average of 30 days of daily temperature readings) for 2&#xD;
           days in a row, a bolus regimen of 5 consecutive daily, 30 minute applications of the&#xD;
           cooling or placebo pack will be implemented. The safety and side effects will be&#xD;
           monitored, however, there have been no reported adverse events reported in our previous&#xD;
           cryotherapy studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed as a chronic ulcer prevention intervention that targets the&#xD;
      remodeling phase, the final repair process of healing after chronic ulcer closure. The skin&#xD;
      environment is particularly vulnerable to ulcer recurrence due to a persistent aberrant&#xD;
      inflammatory state. The previous research conducted by the study team has demonstrated that&#xD;
      cooling this skin reduces the abnormal metabolic activity, protecting it against ulcer&#xD;
      recurrence. Recent advancements in infrared technology allow us to take images of the affect&#xD;
      skin to identify the area that has the highest temperature or vulnerable &quot;hot spot&quot;. These&#xD;
      &quot;hot spots&quot; will be self monitored by patients with newly healed ulcers in the home with an&#xD;
      infrared thermometer that date and time stamps each reading. The study's outcomes on physical&#xD;
      activity will be evaluated with an accelerometer. It is hypothesized that by improving the&#xD;
      skin environment and reducing pain, patients will more likely be physically active and have&#xD;
      better quality of life, all measurable goals for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prevention strategy will be evaluated over six months in 180 patients, 90 of whom will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive the cooling pack and 90 the placebo. The goal is to test this&#xD;
      non-pharmacological, non-invasive clinical intervention as a tailored self-management&#xD;
      strategy to prevent chronic ulcer recurrence. It will also determine alleviation of symptoms&#xD;
      such as pain, and the debilitating effects on physical activity and quality of life.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Mean Scores on Quality of Life Measured With the VEINES QOL/Sym Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion at 6 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study-Quality of life/Symptoms (VEINES QOL/Sym) Questionnaire was used to evaluate quality of life. A sum score is provided as an overall quality of life score for both the QOL and Sym portions of the questionnaire. This instrument was used only for the VLU groups because it is a disease-specific measure. Of the 26 items in the questionnaire, 25 items are combined to create a summary score (VEINES-QOL). One item which asks about the time of day the leg problem is most intense, question 2, provides only descriptive information and is not scored. A subset (symptoms score) of ten of these items, questions 1a to 1i and 7, is used to create a symptom score (VEINES-Sym). For both the VEINES-QOL and VEINES-Sym scores, high values indicate better outcomes. VEINES-QOL scores can be compared only to other members of the same sample. Each set of VEINES-QOL scores will have a mean T-score = 50.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Severity and Intensity Pain Scores Measured With the Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion at 6 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) scale is reported as an average score. BPI rapidly assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning for intensity and Pain Intensity and Pain Interference. Pain Intensity is measured in four categories: worst, least, on average, and currently, while Pain Interference is measured in 7 categories: mood, work, general activity, walking, relationships, enjoyment of life, and sleep. The patient rates each of these on a scale from 0-10, 10 being excruciating pain intensity and a complete interference in their life. Subscores are determined by averaging over the 4 intensity items for the severity subscore and over the 7 interference items for the interference subscore; possible total scores range from 0 to 10. Higher scores indicate worse intensity and severity.</description>

        <title>Change in Mean Scores on Quality of Life Measured With the VEINES QOL/Sym Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study-Quality of life/Symptoms (VEINES QOL/Sym) Questionnaire was used to evaluate quality of life. A sum score is provided as an overall quality of life score for both the QOL and Sym portions of the questionnaire. This instrument was used only for the VLU groups because it is a disease-specific measure. Of the 26 items in the questionnaire, 25 items are combined to create a summary score (VEINES-QOL). One item which asks about the time of day the leg problem is most intense, question 2, provides only descriptive information and is not scored. A subset (symptoms score) of ten of these items, questions 1a to 1i and 7, is used to create a symptom score (VEINES-Sym). For both the VEINES-QOL and VEINES-Sym scores, high values indicate better outcomes. VEINES-QOL scores can be compared only to other members of the same sample. Each set of VEINES-QOL scores will have a mean T-score = 50.</description>

          <title>Change in Mean Scores on Quality of Life Measured With the VEINES QOL/Sym Questionnaire</title>
          <description>The Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study-Quality of life/Symptoms (VEINES QOL/Sym) Questionnaire was used to evaluate quality of life. A sum score is provided as an overall quality of life score for both the QOL and Sym portions of the questionnaire. This instrument was used only for the VLU groups because it is a disease-specific measure. Of the 26 items in the questionnaire, 25 items are combined to create a summary score (VEINES-QOL). One item which asks about the time of day the leg problem is most intense, question 2, provides only descriptive information and is not scored. A subset (symptoms score) of ten of these items, questions 1a to 1i and 7, is used to create a symptom score (VEINES-Sym). For both the VEINES-QOL and VEINES-Sym scores, high values indicate better outcomes. VEINES-QOL scores can be compared only to other members of the same sample. Each set of VEINES-QOL scores will have a mean T-score = 50.</description>

        <title>Changes in Severity and Intensity Pain Scores Measured With the Brief Pain Inventory</title>
        <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) scale is reported as an average score. BPI rapidly assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning for intensity and Pain Intensity and Pain Interference. Pain Intensity is measured in four categories: worst, least, on average, and currently, while Pain Interference is measured in 7 categories: mood, work, general activity, walking, relationships, enjoyment of life, and sleep. The patient rates each of these on a scale from 0-10, 10 being excruciating pain intensity and a complete interference in their life. Subscores are determined by averaging over the 4 intensity items for the severity subscore and over the 7 interference items for the interference subscore; possible total scores range from 0 to 10. Higher scores indicate worse intensity and severity.</description>

          <title>Cooling Gel Pack - Venous Leg Ulcer</title>
          <description>A cooling pack was applied to affected leg skin where an ulcer was recently healed for 30 minutes three times a week (preventive maintenance). Participants self monitored skin temperature of affected skin daily to detect elevation and cooled the affected skin daily for 5 consecutive days (bolus) if the skin temperature became elevated 2Â°F above the baseline.&#xD;
Cooling gel pack: Individuals self monitored temperature of skin over a recently healed venous leg ulcer with a dermal thermometer. A cooling gel pack was applied to skin of recently healed venous leg ulcers for 30 minutes 3 times a week for six months. If the temperature of this skin site increased and stayed elevated 2Â°F above the usual temperature of that site, the individual cooled the skin 5 consecutive days and continued to monitor skin temperature.</description>
