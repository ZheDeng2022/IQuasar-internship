      The general aim of this study is to define the response to hypoxic challenge in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes. The investigation will provide response for different questions that are central&#xD;
      for explaining the development of complications in diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have patients with diabetes an impaired reaction to adapt to hypoxia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what consequence has hypoxia challenge on respiratory and on cardiovascular regulation&#xD;
           in patients with diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what consequence has diabetes on the angiogenetic response to hypoxia&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Complications of diabetes represent the main concern for modern diabetes therapy, and it has&#xD;
      become a priority to further characterise the pathophysiological mechanisms of these&#xD;
      complications to ensure the development of novel rational therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the prolonged exposure of tissues to hyperglycaemia is the primary causative factor&#xD;
      for chronic diabetes complications, it has recently become increasingly evident that hypoxia&#xD;
      also plays an important role in all diabetes complications . A low tissue concentration of&#xD;
      oxygen in diabetes is the consequence of several mechanisms (e.g., deficient blood supply&#xD;
      because of micro- and macro-vascular disease , poor local oxygen diffusion because of local&#xD;
      oedema, or as the result of increased oxygen consumption).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive responses of cells to hypoxia are mediated by Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 (HIF),&#xD;
      which is a heterodimeric transcription factor that is composed of and subunits, which are&#xD;
      both constitutively expressed in mammalian cells. The regulation of HIF activity is&#xD;
      critically dependent on subunit degradation in normoxia. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1 is&#xD;
      stabilised, binds to HRE (hypoxic responsive elements) and up-regulates a gene series that is&#xD;
      involved in angiogenesis, glycolytic energy metabolism, cell proliferation, and survival,&#xD;
      which enables cells to adapt to reduced oxygen availability. It is estimated that that more&#xD;
      than 800 genes are direct HIF targets . HIF-1 is central for expression of multiple&#xD;
      angiogenic growth factors (reviewed by[6]), endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) recruitment .&#xD;
      Recently, it has been proposed that microRNAs (ex. mir210) also mediate some HIF-1 functions&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several pieces of evidence point to a defective response of diabetic tissues to hypoxia. An&#xD;
      impaired hypoxia response is present in all tissues investigated in diabetic animal and&#xD;
      diabetic patients. Hyperglycaemia directly represses HIF stability and function at multiple&#xD;
      levels, a mechanism that is not completely understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An impaired reaction to hypoxia in diabetes might have important consequences in acute&#xD;
      hypoxic challenges as acute heart infarction, stroke, limb ischemia but also in subtle&#xD;
      regulation of cardiovascular and respiratory system as a consequence of autonomic neuropathy&#xD;
      with potential severe prognostic effect on late cardiovascular events . Interventional&#xD;
      studies have addressed the cardiovascular responses to intermittent hypoxia (IH) compared&#xD;
      with normoxia exposure in patients with diabetes . However in order to establish the&#xD;
      appropriateness of the cardiovascular reaction to hypoxia in diabetes it is a need to&#xD;
      investigate the cardiorespiratory responses towards IH in patients with diabetes compared&#xD;
      with matched non diabetic control subjects. Moreover it is essentially to establish the&#xD;
      angiogenetic response in the same experimental design. The hypothesis for this study is that&#xD;
      both the cardiorespiratory reaction mediated through autonomic nervous system and&#xD;
      angiogenetic response are impaired in patients with diabetes as a consequence of an impaired&#xD;
      HIF reaction as seen in other tissues .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to study the effect of intermittent hypoxia (IH) that will consists of&#xD;
      five hypoxic periods (13% O2 inspired fraction of oxygen) each lasting 6 min, with five&#xD;
      normoxic intervals of same duration in 15 patients with type 1 diabetes without clinical&#xD;
      signs of neuropathy and in 15 non diabetic controls matched for sex, BMI, age. The study will&#xD;
      be performed during one day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will be obtained in the morning of each testing day at least 2 h after&#xD;
      breakfast. Subjects are advised to abstain from caffeinated beverages for 12 h and from&#xD;
      alcohol for 36 h prior to testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure and heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation will be continuously measured.&#xD;
      In case of a decrease in oxygen saturation 80% or the occurrence of symptoms, hypoxia would&#xD;
      have been discontinued until oxygen levels reached at least 80%. A technician will regulate&#xD;
      and control the breathing periods under supervision of a medical doctor in a way that the&#xD;
      intervention could not be observed by any patient. Thereafter, three measurement sessions&#xD;
      will be performed: immediately after (t2), after 3 h (t3), and after 6 h (t4). After t2, each&#xD;
      patient will obtaine an individual meal according to diet requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular and respiratory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) and hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) will be&#xD;
      evaluated to determine respiratory system activity. All patients will be tested in the supine&#xD;
      position in a silent room at comfortable temperature. Before participants will be connected&#xD;
      to a rebreathing circuit through a mouthpiece with an antibacterial filter, spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing of room air at rest will be performed for4 min in order to obtain baseline data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each condition, the investigators will perform continuous measurement of oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SaO2) by a pulse oximeter and end-tidal CO2 (CO2-et) using a capnograph connected&#xD;
      to a mouthpiece. Recordings of electrocardiogram will be performed by chest leads, and&#xD;
      continuous noninvasive blood pressure will be recorded using the cuff method. A heated Fleish&#xD;
      pneumotachograph will be connected to a differential pressure transducer and inserted in&#xD;
      series to the expiratory component of the rebreathing system to measure airway flow. For&#xD;
      measurement of the response to hypoxia, the participants will be connected to a rebreathing&#xD;
      circuit inducing progressive decrease in SaO2 while maintaining CO2-et values at constant&#xD;
      levels, until SaO2 will reach 80%, and measuring breath-to-breath changes in minute&#xD;
      ventilation. The response to hypercapnia will be evaluated by ventilatory changes induced by&#xD;
      progressive increase in CO2-et levels (up to 13 mmHg above resting levels), while SaO2 will&#xD;
      be maintained 98% by oxygen at very low flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular autonomic function will be determined performing four tests according to&#xD;
      recent guidelines: deep-breathing, 30:15 ratio, Valsalva maneuver and systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      response to standing. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy will be defined as the &quot;presence of&#xD;
      two or more abnormal tests&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of chemoreflex sensitivity: The slope of the linear regression line of minute&#xD;
      ventilation versus SaO2 or CO2-et indicates in each case the chemoreflex sensitivity to&#xD;
      hypoxia or hypercapnia. In the hypercapnic test, the point at which the ventilation start to&#xD;
      increase indicates as ventilator recruitment threshold to CO2 (VRT- CO2). VRT- CO2 will be&#xD;
      identified by interpolating the ventilation/CO2-et plot by a fourth-order polynomial&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of baroreflex sensitivity: The baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) will be measured&#xD;
      during spontaneous breathing at each measurement session. Since previous studies did not&#xD;
      document a better performance of one method over the others, the investigators will calculate&#xD;
      the average of seven different methods: positive and negative sequences, the a-coefficient in&#xD;
      the low- and high-frequency bands and its average, the transfer function technique, and the&#xD;
      ratio of SDs of R-R interval and systolic blood pressure variabilities. Besides BRS, SD of&#xD;
      the R-R interval (SDNN) will be applied to determine a global index of heart rate&#xD;
      variability. This selection is done based on the fact that normal distribution is more&#xD;
      pronounced in this variable compared with other indices of variability (e.g., variance). The&#xD;
      Hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) and hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR), baroreflex&#xD;
      sensitivity (BRS) will be evaluated before (t1), immediately after (t2), 3 h (t3), and 6 h&#xD;
      (t4) after IH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The angiogenetic potential will be evaluated at the same endpoints by measuring in serum&#xD;
      relevant cytokines that are gene targets for HIF-1 (i.e. VEGFA, SDF-1a, erythropoietin etc).&#xD;
      The direct response of HIF signaling will be evaluated by the serum levels of mir210 which&#xD;
      exclusively regulated by HIF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The absolute endothelial precoursor cell account (EPC) response will be evaluated at the same&#xD;
      time points by FACS analysis of the number of CD34+/CD133+/KDR +&#xD;
