  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare safety and efficacy of reduced-intensity conditioning&#xD;
      and myeloablative conditioning regimens prior to HSCT in high-risk AML/MDS pediatric and&#xD;
      young adult patients. This study investigates the use of two novel conditioning therapies for&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The primary focus of both the investigators'&#xD;
      myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning regimens is to reduce overall toxicity so&#xD;
      that pediatric and young adult patients with high-risk AML/MDS with significant pretransplant&#xD;
      comorbidities who would have been ineligible to proceed to HSCT previously can now receive&#xD;
      potentially life-saving treatment.&#xD;
