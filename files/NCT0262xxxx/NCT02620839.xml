    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the best dose and side effects of alpelisib and cisplatin in&#xD;
      treating patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) positive solid tumor malignancies.&#xD;
      Alpelisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving alpelisib and cisplatin may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with solid tumor malignancies.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose of alpelisib in&#xD;
      combination with weekly cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate and median progression-free survival with the&#xD;
      treatment combination in HPV positive (+) solid tumor malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the safety profile of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive alpelisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14 or 1-21, and cisplatin&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 8, or days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

             the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sexually active males should use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 16&#xD;
        weeks after the final dose of study treatment and should not father a child in this period,&#xD;
        but may be recommended to seek advice on conservation of sperm. A condom is required to be&#xD;
        used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming&#xD;
        pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and through at least 16&#xD;
        weeks after the final dose of study treatment. Highly effective contraception is defined as&#xD;
        either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
        subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation&#xD;
        methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception].&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
        hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case&#xD;
        of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by&#xD;
        follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the&#xD;
        absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study subjects, the vasectomized male&#xD;
        partner should be the sole partner for that patient].&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use a combination of the following (both a+b):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) Barrier methods of&#xD;
        contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal&#xD;
        foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not allowed&#xD;
        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have had 12&#xD;
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age&#xD;
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
        (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For women with therapy-induced amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of FSH&#xD;
        and/or estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH)&#xD;
        agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for induction of ovarian&#xD;
        suppression.&#xD;
