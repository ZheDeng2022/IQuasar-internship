  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 1 in 6 deliveries in KKH are induced with prostaglandins. Inpatient induction can be a&#xD;
      lengthy process especially when cervical priming is required. Although mechanical method of&#xD;
      induction of labour (IOL) is established, its use in Singapore is uncommon. Systematic&#xD;
      reviews comparing mechanical method against pharmacological and surgical IOL showed that&#xD;
      mechanical method has similar efficacy with lower risk profile. As IOL is a common obstetric&#xD;
      procedure, a revisit on the techniques is warranted. A multi-centre randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial concluded that both cervical ripening balloon and prostaglandin are effective and&#xD;
      complementary methods for IOL in uncomplicated singleton pregnancies, but did not examined&#xD;
      the effects of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to evaluate the adverse events in the 12 hours after CRB or 1st&#xD;
      prostaglandin insertion, its efficiency in term singleton IOL in Singapore context and test&#xD;
      the acceptability of women in Singapore in using the CRB as an alternative method of&#xD;
      induction of labour while using a non-incremental balloon filling regime. Currently, there is&#xD;
      no efficient method of induction that can be used safely in an outpatient setting. Through&#xD;
      this study, the investigators hope to show that there are no major adverse events in the 12h&#xD;
      after patients are induced with CRB, this potentially supports outpatient IOL with CRB which&#xD;
      can reduce hospitalisation and medical costs. A non-incremental balloon filling regime will&#xD;
      decrease time delays and may increase patient satisfaction during its use in induction of&#xD;
      labour.&#xD;

      This is a prospective cohort randomised controlled trial conducted at the KK Women's and&#xD;
      Children's Hospital (KKH) and University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NICE guidelines on induction of labour defined uterine hyperstimulation as contractions more&#xD;
      than 5 in 10 mins for more then 20 mins or contractions lasting more than 2 mins in duration.&#xD;
      A retrospective study involving prostaglandin induction of labour showed that&#xD;
      hyperstimulation occurred in 5.8% of cases. The sample size is calculated based on a 4.8%&#xD;
      reduction in hyperstimulation in all induction of labour by CRB. At a level of significance&#xD;
      of 5%, 80% power, 200 patients in each arm is required. Preliminary study by Tan TL et al had&#xD;
      a dropout rate of 4.6%. Hence the proposed sample size is 420.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to collaborate on a multi-centre trial with the University Malaya&#xD;
      Medical Centre. In which, each centre will recruit 210 patients for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of the participants is achieved with third party sealed envelope allocation.&#xD;
      210 envelopes containing CRB allocation and another 210 identical envelopes containing&#xD;
      prostin allocation will be prepared by a third party. The 420 envelops will be shuffled&#xD;
      according to a computer randomisation code after sealing and labelled with a randomization&#xD;
      allocation number from 1 to 420. The 210 envelops will then be handed to the each centre's&#xD;
      PI, and will be kept in the clinical store on labour ward together with the stock of CRB and&#xD;
      prostin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, it is not possible to blind the allocation to the investigator or the patient.&#xD;
      The investigator however has no part in observing any adverse events, the CTGs should be&#xD;
      interpreted by the attending clinician and vet by team to avoid missing abnormal CTG. The&#xD;
      patient herself will have to report contractions and pain scores and satisfaction scores with&#xD;
      validated standard pain and satisfaction assessment tools to minimise the potential bias. The&#xD;
      allocation will also be omitted from the database so as to blind the analyst in order to&#xD;
      prevent manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no additional clinic visit or labour ward admission required by the study. The&#xD;
      potential patient receiving subsidized obstetric care who require elective IOL at term will&#xD;
      be will be identified by doctors and clinical research coordinator in the subsidized clinic&#xD;
      or labour ward or obstetric subsidized wards, and screened accordingly with inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Pregnant women aged 21 - 40 years old, singleton pregnancy, no major&#xD;
      fetal anomaly, planned induction of labour at 37+0 weeks to 41+6 weeks gestation, vaginal&#xD;

&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Spontaneous labour at start of planned induction, Bishop score &lt;6 and&#xD;
      cervical dilatation &gt;=3 cm at start of induction, confirmed rupture of membrane, abnormal CTG&#xD;
      at start of induction, caesarean section delivery is indicated, scarred uterus such as&#xD;
      previous caesarean section, malpresentation in labour, patient withdraw consent to&#xD;
      participate in the trial. Latex allergy, severe asthma and glaucoma.&#xD;
