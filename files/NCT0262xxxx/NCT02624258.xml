  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot open-label study to estimate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of intravenously&#xD;
      administered, RNA electroporated autologous T cells expressing CD19 chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptors expressing tandem TCRζ and 4-1BB (TCRζ /4-1BB) costimulatory domains (referred to&#xD;
      as &quot;RNA CART19&quot;) in Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) patients. Subjects will be treated with IV&#xD;
      administration of RNA anti-CD19 CAR T cells for a total of six doses over 3 weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 10 evaluable patients. Evaluable patients are those who have received&#xD;
      at least 1 of the 6 RNA CART19 doses at the protocol-specified level. Important safety data&#xD;
      can be collected even if a patient receives only one RNA CART19 dose. Subjects (n = 10) will&#xD;
      receive up to six IV doses of 8x105-1.5x106 RNA CART19 cells/kg/dose for subjects&lt;80kg and&#xD;
      1x108 RNA CART19 cells/dose (±20%) for subjects ≥80kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RNA CART19 doses and mid-treatment single dose cyclophosphamide will be administered on&#xD;
      Mondays, Wednesdays or Fridays. Dosing can be initiated on any of those days. Subjects will&#xD;
      be infused in a staggered fashion at two week intervals; that is, the next subject cannot be&#xD;
      infused prior to two weeks since the last infusion of the previous subject.&#xD;
