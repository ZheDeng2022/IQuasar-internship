    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-titration trial to study the efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of oral cochleate amphotericin B (CAMB) in the treatment of mucocutaneous&#xD;
      candidiasis infections in patients who are refractory or intolerant to standard non&#xD;
      intravenous therapies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients aged 18 to 75 years with mucocutaneous candidiasis (esophageal, oropharyngeal, or&#xD;
      vulvovaginal) who are refractory or intolerant to standard non-intravenous therapies will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Patients will initially be treated in a short-term dose titration period, where the&#xD;
      dose may be increased in patients that do not respond clinically. Patients who do not respond&#xD;
      clinically to the highest dose of drug will discontinue the protocol. Patients that respond&#xD;
      to treatment and tolerate the study medication will be eligible to enter a long-term&#xD;
      extension (up to 36-months).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a clinical diagnosis of at least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent OPC for greater than 2 weeks documented on at least one occasion by KOH or&#xD;
             fungal stain and confirmed by mycological culture to be azole resistant within the&#xD;
             previous 6 months and/or intolerance to standard non intravenous therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EC associated with clinical symptoms of retrosternal pain, odynophagia, and/or pain&#xD;
             with swallowing and documented by esophageal biopsy or visualization with culture&#xD;
             documenting azole resistance within the previous 6 months and/or intolerance to&#xD;
             standard non-intravenous therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent VVC for greater than 2 weeks as documented by presence of vaginal symptoms&#xD;
             and a positive wet mount showing Candida structures and confirmed by a vaginal culture&#xD;
             positive for Candida with azole resistance within the previous 6 months and/or&#xD;
             intolerance to standard non intravenous therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is expected to survive for &gt; = 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to have samples stored for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to use highly effective contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Contraception: Because the effects of CAMB on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
                  unknown, sexually active patients of childbearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
                  highly effective contraception as outlined below before study entry and for the&#xD;
                  duration of study participation. Females of childbearing potential must have a&#xD;
                  negative pregnancy test result before receiving CAMB. During the course of the&#xD;
                  study, if a patient becomes pregnant or suspects they are pregnant, then they&#xD;
                  should inform the study staff and their primary care physician immediately.&#xD;
                  Acceptable forms of contraception are:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Intrauterine device (IUD) or equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Hormonal contraceptives (eg, consistent, timely and continuous use of&#xD;
                       contraceptive pill, patch, ring, implant, or injection that has reached full&#xD;
                       efficacy prior to dosing). If the patient uses contraceptive pill, patch, or&#xD;
                       ring, then a barrier method (eg, male/female condom, cap, or diaphragm plus&#xD;
                       spermicide) must also be used at the time of potentially reproductive sexual&#xD;
                       activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Be in a stable, long-term monogamous relationship, per PI assessment, with a&#xD;
                       partner that does not pose any potential pregnancy risk, eg, has undergone a&#xD;
                       vasectomy at least 6 months prior to first dose of study agent or is of the&#xD;
                       same sex as the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Have had a hysterectomy and/or a bilateral tubal ligation or both ovaries&#xD;
                       removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to any AMB product or any component of CAMB (eg, phosphatidylserine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have evidence of systemic fungal infections requiring intravenous antifungal therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women, and women intending to become pregnant during the study&#xD;
             period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had a concomitant medical condition that could interfere with study drug evaluation or&#xD;
             that is a contraindication to the proposed investigational treatment based upon known&#xD;
             agent safety profile or toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had any of the following laboratory abnormalities at the screening visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine Transaminase (ALT), Aspartate Transaminase (AST) and Alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
                  (ALP) &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin level &gt; 2.5 times the ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine level &gt; 2 times the ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count less than 500 cells/microliter&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Potassium level less than or equal to 3.5 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to Day 0 (Baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recent history (past 12 months) of drug or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of intravenous AMB products within 1-week of start of study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of non-intravenous AMB products (such as oral AMB swishes) within 72 hours prior&#xD;
             to start of study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving potassium supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition the investigator believes would interfere with the patient s&#xD;
             ability to provide informed consent, comply with study instructions, or which might&#xD;
             confound the interpretation of the study results or put the subject at undue risk.&#xD;
