  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate patients' experience of awake surgery of the brain. Patients&#xD;
      therefore must suffer a disease that makes the technique of awake craniotomy necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In more detail, the investigators are performing this study in order to investigate the&#xD;
      influence of fear on pain perception during surgery for patients undergoing awake surgery for&#xD;
      lesions within the brain. In the event of finding a correlation between fear of the surgery&#xD;
      and intraoperative pain perception, the investigators aim to reduce possible fear beforehand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional goal of the investigators is to identify psychological consequences of awake&#xD;
      craniotomy timely and admit patients to an adequate therapy if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no changes regarding the actual treatment of the disease. In case of a consent,&#xD;
      the patient will receive questionnaires at three timepoints: 1. day before surgery. 2. third&#xD;
      day after surgery. 3. at 3-6 months postoperatively at the outpatient clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit of participating in this study is the possibility of detecting psychological&#xD;
      consequences of awake craniotomy at an early stage. If required, patients will then receive&#xD;
      treatment timely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no additional risks. Theoretically there is only a data risk after analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are free to decide if they want to participate within this study. There are no&#xD;
      changes in the actual treatment if patients deny participation. In case of participation,&#xD;
      patients have the right to quit at any time with no reasoning at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study investigators are collecting health-related data. If patients quit before&#xD;
      the study end, data will still be used in pseudonymized form. After 10 years, data will be&#xD;
      destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of participation the only duty for the patient is to fill out the questionnaires at&#xD;
      the above mentioned three time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conduct this study based on all rules of law regarding data protection.&#xD;
      Investigators only use the collected data in relation to this study. All investigators are&#xD;
      under obligation to secrecy.&#xD;

      ETHICAL AND REGULATORY ASPECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Conduct of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research project will be carried out in accordance to the research plan and with&#xD;
      principles enunciated in the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki (DoH), the&#xD;
      Essentials of Good Epidemiological Practice issued by Public Health Switzerland (EGEP), the&#xD;
      Swiss Law and Swiss regulatory authority's requirements as applicable. The EC and regulatory&#xD;
      authorities will be informed about project start and termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Project Leader of this Project Leader initiated Trial acknowledges his responsibilities&#xD;
      as both the Investigator and the Project Leader.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk categorisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk category A: Enroled patients are not exposed to additional risks, as intraoperative&#xD;
      mapping of brain functions using electrical stimulation in awake patients is actually&#xD;
      considered the gold standard of treatment in intracerebral lesions in the immediate vicinity&#xD;
      or within eloquent brain regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Committee (EC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the project will be conducted, the project plan, the proposed participant information&#xD;
      and consent form as well as other project-specific documents shall be submitted to a&#xD;
      competent Ethics Committee (EC). The regular end, premature end or interruption of the&#xD;
      research project is reported to the EC within 90 days upon completion of the project (HRO&#xD;
      Art. 22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Information and Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive ongoing recruitment through investigator(s) in daily clinical practice&#xD;
      (consultations). The subjects will receive the consent form with an address and phone number&#xD;
      indicated where further questions regarding the study can be discussed directly with the&#xD;
      project leader. This will take place at least one week before the hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant privacy and safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Project Leader affirms and upholds the principle of the participants' right to dignity,&#xD;
      privacy and health and that the project team shall comply with applicable privacy laws.&#xD;
      Especially, anonymity of the participants shall be guaranteed when presenting the data at&#xD;
      scientific meetings or publishing them in scientific journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual participant medical information obtained as a result of this research project is&#xD;
      considered confidential and disclosure to third parties is prohibited. Participant&#xD;
      confidentiality will be further ensured by utilising identification code numbers to&#xD;
      correspond to medical information in the computer files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For data verification purposes, authorised representatives of the Project Leader, a competent&#xD;
      ethics committee may require direct access to parts of the medical records relevant to the&#xD;
      project, including participants' medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early termination of Project&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Project Leader (and any competent authority) may terminate the project prematurely&#xD;
      according to certain circumstances (insufficient participant recruitment, change of project&#xD;
      leader or any other reason that would prevent the project execution according to the research&#xD;
      plan). The premature end or interruption of the research project would be reported to the EC&#xD;
      within 90 days upon completion of the project (HRO Art. 22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendments, Changes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant changes to the project plan would be communicated to relevant parties (e.g.,&#xD;
      investigators, EC). The Project Leader would submit to the EC any application documents,&#xD;
      which are affected by the change. At the same time, the project leader would provide&#xD;
      information on the reasons for the change. Substantial amendments are only implemented after&#xD;
      approval of the EC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative mapping of brain functions using electrical stimulation in awake patients has&#xD;
      been proven to be a safe technique that enables increased tumor removal while preserving the&#xD;
      functional status of the patients. Former studies reported that the conscious experienced&#xD;
      procedure is generally well tolerated and psychological sequelae due to awake craniotomy seem&#xD;
      to be rare (Milian et al., 2014). Fear, anxiety and pain are the most commonly seen phenomena&#xD;
      intraoperatively (Milian et al., 2014). It is also known that fear and anxiety may aggravate&#xD;
      pain perception (Keefe et al., 2001). The investigators hypothesize that patients with less&#xD;
      preoperative anxiety experience less intraoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the research Project&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential postoperative psychological sequelae could be considered and affected patients&#xD;
      could benefit of early recognition and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk-Benefit Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enroled patients are not exposed to additional risks, as intraoperative mapping of brain&#xD;
      functions using electrical stimulation in awake patients is actually considered the gold&#xD;
      standard of treatment in intracerebral lesions in the immediate vicinity or within eloquent&#xD;
      brain regions. Potential postoperative psychological sequelae could be considered and&#xD;
      affected patients could benefit of early recognition and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of research and general project design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research project in which health-related personal data is collected. Data will be&#xD;
      pseudonymized. Prospective, monocentric, descriptive, cohort study. Overall study duration&#xD;
      will be about one year. Patients are recruited at the investigators in daily clinical&#xD;
      practice, which can be days to weeks prior to surgery. Once the surgery is started the study&#xD;
      duration for each patient will last 6 months post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized questionnaires will be completed by the selected patients as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1st day preoperatively: MMSE, NRS-anxiety, HADS-D, PDS-1, BPI, PHQ-D, BDI. Intraoperatively:&#xD;
      NRS for anxiety and pain at three timepoints during surgery: before skin incision, after&#xD;
      removal of the bone flap, after tumor resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3rd day postoperatively: HADS-D, PHQ-D, PDS-1, BPI, NRS for pain. 6 months postoperatively at&#xD;
      the outpatient clinics: PHQ-D, BDI, HADS-D, PDS-1, BPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive ongoing recruitment through investigator(s) in daily clinical practice&#xD;
      (consultations). The subjects will receive the consent form with an address and phone number&#xD;
      indicated where further questions regarding the study can be discussed directly with the&#xD;
      project leader. This will take place at least one week before the hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of minimising bias&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of validated questionnaires. Blinding is not necessary as there are no&#xD;
      randomized/different therapies offered. Additional factors to be considered as they influence&#xD;
      primary and secondary endpoints: Assessment of gender and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a non-interventional, monocentric cohort study. The scores which will be&#xD;
      analysed as primary and secondary endpoints are in general not assumed to follow a normal&#xD;
      distribution. Differences in the raw (untransformed) scores and for changes of the scores&#xD;
      over time, will be described by descriptive statistics. The hypotheses of the primary and&#xD;
      secondary endpoints described below, will not be examined by any statistical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that intraoperative pain perception, measured by the NRS, in&#xD;
      patients with less preoperative fear and anxiety must be lower. The scores listed as&#xD;
      secondary endpoints are hypothesized not to change between pre- and post-operative&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the expected sample size is not large enough to carry out a statistical test with adequate&#xD;
      power, no hypothesis testing will be carried out for this study. The evidence for differences&#xD;
      in the scores of the primary and secondary endpoints will be discussed based on the&#xD;
      descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is of descriptive nature, i.e., to assess the conscious&#xD;
      experience and experience and psychological consequences of awake surgery among the patient&#xD;
      collective at the Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen (Kantonsspital St. Gallen, KSSG). The number&#xD;
      of included patients is governed by the duration of the study, which is planned to be one&#xD;
      year. Within this year it is expected that around 20 patients, recruited at the KSSG, will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical criteria of termination of Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no statistical criteria, which would trigger early termination of this trial,&#xD;
      as long as the data gathering process is not impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following measures will be reported: mean, standard deviation, 95% confidence interval,&#xD;
      median, 1st and 3rd quartile, minimum, and maximum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further the same descriptive statistics will be reported for patient characteristics on&#xD;
      continuous scale (e.g. age) and percentages will be reported for categorical variables (e.g.&#xD;
      gender). The Spearman rank correlation, which is a non-parametric measure for correlations,&#xD;
      for the same scores measured at different occasions, will be reported for the scores in the&#xD;
      primary and secondary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Datasets to be analysed, analysis populations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis population includes all eligible patients which were recruited in the study.&#xD;
      Patients will be included in the analysis if they have included any of the questionnaires.&#xD;
      Characteristics of patients which did not meet the inclusion criteria will be reported&#xD;
      separately. If a patient has a missing value, or missed a follow-up visit, only the observed&#xD;
      measurements will be included and no data imputation will be applied. This implies that the&#xD;
      data will be analysed according to the intention to treat principle, which should not be&#xD;
      problematic as no intervention is planned in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Essentially no subgroup analyses are planned but under the assumption of equal group sizes, a&#xD;
      descriptive analysis of the examined scores for subgroups of gender and age will complement&#xD;
      the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be displayed for the NRS score and for the changes in the NRS&#xD;
      score between the pre-operative and intra-operative and the pre-operative and post-operative&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the measures of the secondary analysis (PHQ-D, BDI, MMSE, HADS-D, PDS-1 and BPI)&#xD;
      descriptive statistics for each measurement occasion and for the changes in the measures will&#xD;
      be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interim analysis is planned. The duration of the study will be one year. However, interim&#xD;
      analyses are possible if requested by the investigator, as the data will be analysed with&#xD;
      descriptive statistics only and no intervention is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deviations from the original statistical plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deviations from the planned statistical analysis will be documented and justified in the&#xD;
      final statistical report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of missing data and drop-outs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have not submitted any of the questionnaires will be excluded from the analysis.&#xD;
      However, patient characteristics for patients submitting and not or only partially submitting&#xD;
      questionnaires will be compared to determine if there are any statistically significant or&#xD;
      clinically relevant differences between the two groups. This may affect how the results of&#xD;
      the study should be interpreted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data handling and record keeping / archiving&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be recorded in an excel-file, only accessible by authorised personnel, such as&#xD;
      Werner Surbeck, Hejrati Nader. The questionnaires will be saved by Werner Surbeck in his&#xD;
      locked bureau during the study. On the Case Report Forms (CRF) and other project specific&#xD;
      documents, subjects are not identified by their names, but by a unique subject number (UPN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality, Data Protection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project data will be handled with uttermost discretion and is only accessible to authorized&#xD;
      personnel who require the data to fulfil their duties. On the CRFs and other project specific&#xD;
      documents, subjects are not identified by their names, but by a unique subject number (UPN).&#xD;
      UPN will not consist of initials of the subjects or their date of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UPN will be distributed to all subjects to whom the questionnaires will be given and used&#xD;
      from this moment on exclusively. Subject identification list will be compiled and stored by&#xD;
      Dr W. Surbeck in an Excel sheet only on his personal laptop secured by a strong password. A&#xD;
      regular backup of the subject identification list will be stored on a Universal Serial Bus&#xD;
      (USB) device by Dr Surbeck and locked securely in his office. All alterations in the list&#xD;
      will be done by Dr W. Surbeck exclusively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coding&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the CRFs and other project specific documents, subjects are not identified by their names,&#xD;
      but by a unique subject number (UPN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Archiving and Destruction&#xD;
&#xD;
      All trial data, including documents necessary for patient identification and post-trial care,&#xD;
      will be archived for a minimum of 10 years upon premature- or trial termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANNNOUNCEMENTS AND REPORTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of serious announcements, they will be performed according to Art. 21 (HFV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINATION POLICY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication of results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication of the study results is planned. An acknowledgement to the Clinical Trials Unit&#xD;
      (CTU) St. Gallen is enclosed in any publication that will result from this study. The study&#xD;
      will be registered at clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FUNDING AND SUPPORT&#xD;
&#xD;
      No funding necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INSURANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of study-related damage or injuries, the public liability insurance of the&#xD;
      Sponsor (i.e. the Kantonsspital St. Gallen) provides compensation, except for claims that&#xD;
      arise from wilful misconduct or gross negligence.&#xD;
