      Migraine affects 15% of Western Australians and is a leading cause of suffering and&#xD;
      disability in our community (1,2). Research suggests that inflammation of the brain's&#xD;
      coverings (meninges) by nerve cell inflammation and the release of 'free radicals', is a&#xD;
      cause of migraine. N-acetylcysteine, Vitamin E and Vitamin C are powerful anti-oxidants&#xD;
      (free-radical scavengers) that reduce brain inflammation and nerve activity. It is therefore&#xD;
      possible these anti-oxidants could reduce the number and severity of migraines. We will study&#xD;
      90 subjects to see if a combination of N-acetylcysteine 600 mg, Vitamin E 250 IU and vitamin&#xD;
      C 500 mg (NEC) taken twice daily for 3 months, will reduce migraine attacks. This safe&#xD;
      vitamin-based therapy has never been studied and if effective, will play an important role in&#xD;
      migraine prevention.&#xD;

      Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migraine affects 15% of Western Australians and is a leading cause of suffering and&#xD;
      disability in our community. Research suggests that inflammation of the brain's coverings&#xD;
      (meninges) by nerve cell inflammation and the release of 'free radicals', is a cause of&#xD;
      migraine. N-acetylcysteine, Vitamin E and Vitamin C are powerful anti-oxidants (free-radical&#xD;
      scavengers) that reduce brain inflammation and nerve activity. It is therefore possible these&#xD;
      anti-oxidants could reduce the number and severity of migraines. We will study 90 subjects to&#xD;
      see if a combination of N-acetylcysteine 600 mg, Vitamin E 250 IU and vitamin C 500 mg (NEC)&#xD;
      taken twice daily for 3 months, will reduce migraine attacks. This safe vitamin-based therapy&#xD;
      has never been studied and if effective, will play an important role in migraine prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because migraine is a complex neuro-vascular-inflammatory disorder with a 'cascade' of steps,&#xD;
      there are many potentially targets for drug prophylaxis. Research highlights the importance&#xD;
      brain neuro-inflammation mediated by Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) and Substance P&#xD;
      (SP), and oxygen and nitrogen free radical species (FRS) (eg. nitric oxide [NO]) in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of migraine. Increased levels of NO and CGRP were found in the jugular venous&#xD;
      blood migraineurs and NO produces cerebral vasodilation, which is a key step in migraine&#xD;
      generation. Furthermore, FRS activate the trigeminal-cervical nucleus (TCN) which is the main&#xD;
      centre of nociceptive (pain) sensitization in headaches-Sumatriptan blocks this process&#xD;
      accounting for some of its anti-migraine effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-oxidants such as N-acetylcysteine (NAc), Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) (VitC) and Vitamin E&#xD;
      (alpha-tocopherol) (VitE) are potent FRS 'scavengers', which means they could be used to&#xD;
      prevent migraine. Two small non-randomised trials suggested that antioxidants reduced&#xD;
      migraine frequency and disability. Like sumatriptan, NAc reduces activation of the TCN by NO,&#xD;
      also neuro-inflammation in brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease. VitC and VitE reduced&#xD;
      NO levels in mice and VitC enhanced the neuro-inhibitory effects of gamma amino butyric acid&#xD;
      in the central nervous system-This mechanism could conceivably interrupt 'spreading cortical&#xD;
      activation' which is the first step in the migraine cascade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migraineurs have an increased risk of developing an analogous neuro-inflammatory disorder,&#xD;
      Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS); increased plasma levels of SP, CGRP and FRS were found&#xD;
      in patients with these conditions. CRPS responds to treatment with NAc and VitC. A&#xD;
      meta-analysis found that combined (but not single-agent) anti-oxidant therapy (CAT) was safe&#xD;
      and effective in treating chronic pancreatitis, an inflammatory pain disorder similar to both&#xD;
      CRPS and migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We previously proposed that migraine be considered a form of 'CRPS of the brain' which&#xD;
      therefore (like CRPS) may also respond to CAT. Literature review confirmed this theory has&#xD;
      not yet been explored. We will therefore test the hypothesis that twice-daily administration&#xD;
      of a combination of NAC 600 mg, VitE 250 IU and VitC 500 mg (NEC) for 12 weeks, will&#xD;
      significantly reduce migraine frequency. If proven effective, NEC will be an inexpensive,&#xD;
      accessible and safe treatment for managing the burden of migraine in the Western Australian&#xD;
      community&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental hypothesis Twice-daily administration of NEC (NAc 600 mg, VitE 250 IU and VitC&#xD;
      500 mg) for 12 weeks significantly reduces migraine frequency in patients who experience&#xD;
      two-to-eight migraines per month, compared with a placebo-control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Study design is based on guidelines for migraine clinical trials of the&#xD;
      International Headache Society (IHS) 2013. It will be a clinically-pragmatic,&#xD;
      proof-of-concept investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design: Prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two parallel-group&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Males and females from 18 to 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Convenience sample of migraine patients attending general practice clinics,&#xD;
      neurology clinics linked to UNDA Sydney and pain clinics (Joondalup Health Campus); via&#xD;
      Headache Australia, Chronic Pain Australia, UNDA and Fremantle Hospital Research Foundation&#xD;
      websites, and newspaper advertising, as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NB: Subjects stabilised on one migraine prevention drug were not excluded from the study,&#xD;
      because cessation and washout of drugs would hinder recruitment and retention and does not&#xD;
      reflect 'real-life' clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation The population for an adequately powered RCT was calculated from data of&#xD;
      similar studies in migraine prevention (30-35). It is estimated that 60% of subjects in the&#xD;
      active study group and 30% in the placebo-control group will report a 'positive outcome' (≥&#xD;
      30% reduction in headache frequency, from baseline). With 80% power and p&lt;0.05, the study&#xD;
      population for this RCT is 84 subjects. An interim proof-of-concept (pilot) analysis will be&#xD;
      performed when 40 subjects (20 in each group) complete the study, based on guidelines for&#xD;
      pilot studies by Lancaster et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects: 84 subjects in total, 42 in each study group. Active study group (n=42)&#xD;
      and placebo-control group (n=42).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and blinding: Computer randomization of subjects will be in 'blocks' of 10, as&#xD;
      per IHS migraine trial guidelines. Subjects, researchers and data analysts will be blinded. A&#xD;
      pharmacist will dispense active (NEC) and sham trial drugs and maintain records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 16 weeks (112 days, or four months) total; four weeks baseline study phase&#xD;
      (for stabilization and baseline measurements); 12 weeks active study phase. Start: January 1,&#xD;
      2016. Finish: January 1, 2017.&#xD;
