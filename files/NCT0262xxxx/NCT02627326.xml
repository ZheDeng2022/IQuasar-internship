      The aim of this prospective randomized controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of chlorhexidine intracanal medicament along with periodontal treatment in&#xD;
      concomitant endodontic periodontal lesions with communication in terms of periodontal&#xD;
      healing. Forty-seven patients were randomly divided into: group 1: conventional endodontic&#xD;
      treatment with open flap debridement (OFD after 3 month of endodontic treatment) were&#xD;
      performed, in group 2: endodontic treatment with 2% chlorhexidine gel (CHX) as an intracanal&#xD;
      medicament placed in root canals and after 3 month OFD were performed. Primary outcome&#xD;
      variables included probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level and bleeding on probing.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment decision-making and prognosis of endodontic-periodontal lesion is primarily&#xD;
      dependent on the diagnosis of the specific endodontic or periodontal disease. Although the&#xD;
      treatment of endodontic and periodontal lesions arouse a lot of confusions and speculations.&#xD;
      Wherein, endodontic-periodontal combined lesion is a clinical dilemma because making a&#xD;
      differential diagnosis and deciding a prognosis are difficult. Also, the success of such&#xD;
      lesions depends on the elimination of both of these disease processes as the endodontic&#xD;
      therapy results in healing of the endodontic component of involvement while the prognosis of&#xD;
      tooth would finally depend on the healing of the periodontal structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional studies also reported negative influence on the periodontal healing in&#xD;
      presence of infected root canal system, after providing periodontal treatment. However, in&#xD;
      addition to this, the outcome of endodontic treatment may be affected if the root canal&#xD;
      filling is placed while there is still a periodontal infection present that communicates with&#xD;
      the root canal system since cross-seeding through the apical or lateral foramina is possible.&#xD;
      Despite thorough cleaning and disinfection of the root canal system during endodontic&#xD;
      treatment, bacteria from the periodontal lesion may re-invade the root canal system since&#xD;
      root canal fillings do not seal canals completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elimination of microorganisms from infected root canal is a complicated task involving&#xD;
      the use of various instrumentation techniques, irrigation regimens and intracanal&#xD;
      medicaments. Gomes et al observed that 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) showed maximum zone of&#xD;
      inhibition against porphyromonas gingivalis, enterococcus faecalis, actinomyces viscosus and&#xD;
      candida albicans followed by a combination of calcium hydroxide and CHX, and least with&#xD;
      calcium hydroxide alone. A clinical study carried out by zamany et al showed that 2% CHX&#xD;
      solution used as a final irrigant, significantly decreased bacterial loads in root canal.&#xD;
      Additional advantages of chlorhexidine are its retentive character in root canal dentin and&#xD;
      its relatively low toxicity and its effect on periodontal healing has been well known. Based&#xD;
      on these observations, it may be hypothesized that intracanal medicament may act as a&#xD;
      controlled released drug which could be used as an adjunct to periodontal surgical therapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the present study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of chlorhexidine&#xD;
      intracanal medicament along with periodontal surgical therapy on periodontal healing in&#xD;
      concomitant endodontic and periodontic disease with communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS:&#xD;

           eligibility, written and verbal informed consent was obtained from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly allocated to one of the two treatment groups according to a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization list. It was ensured that neither the investigator nor the&#xD;
      patient was aware of the treatment protocol at the time of patient allocation. From each&#xD;
      patient only one tooth was selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (n = 23 teeth/23 patients), endodontic treatment (ET) and full mouth scaling and root&#xD;
      planing (SRP) were performed simultaneously. After 3 months of commencement of endodontic&#xD;
      therapy, periodontal surgical treatment in the form of open flap debridement (OFD) was&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (n = 24 teeth/24 patients), endodontic treatment (ET) and full mouth scaling and root&#xD;
      planing (SRP) were started simultaneously. After biomechanical preparation of root canal, CHX&#xD;
      intracanal medicament was placed in root canal from pulp chamber to apex for 3 months&#xD;
      (replacing every month). After 3 months, open flap debridement (OFD) was performed in the&#xD;
      respective tooth and medicament was changed and placed further for 3 months (replacing every&#xD;
      month). Obturation was done after 3 months of OFD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Data Collection: Endodontic evaluation - Pulp sensibility testing was performed with&#xD;
      a combination of heat test (heated gutta-percha), cold test (Endo-Frost, Coltene, Whaledent)&#xD;
      and electric pulp test (Digitest D626D, Parkell electronics, New York). Teeth not responding&#xD;
      to both thermal and electric test were considered non vital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic evaluation - Radiographs with paralleling cone technique were taken with&#xD;
      standardized exposure parameters (70kvp, 3.5mAs, and 0.2 seconds) by single operator using&#xD;
      dental x-ray machine .&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERIODONTAL EXAMINATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL PARAMETERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full mouth indices recorded at baseline Plaque index (Silness and Loe) (PI) Gingival index&#xD;
      (Loe and Silness) (GI) Bleeding on probing (BOP) Probing pocket depth (PPD) Clinical&#xD;
      attachment level (CAL) Site specific ( endo- perio involved tooth) indices Plaque index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gingival index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relative Probing pocket depth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relative clinical attachment loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding on probing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tooth mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relative gingival marginal level Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, 3&#xD;
           months, 6 months and 9 months. Each of the tooth was assessed at four sites&#xD;
           (mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, midlingual) for PI and GI and six sites&#xD;
           (mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, midlingual, distolingual) for PPD,&#xD;
           CAL, BOP during full mouth complete periodontal examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERIODONTAL NON SURGICAL PROCEDURE: All the patients enrolled for the study at the initial&#xD;
      visits undergo non surgical periodontal treatment in the form of scaling and root planing&#xD;
      (SRP) which was performed with ultrasonic scaler and hand instruments. SRP was completed in&#xD;
      two to three sessions along with education and motivation to maintain the health of&#xD;
      periodontium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONVENTIONAL ENDODONTIC PROCEDURE: Simultaneously along with non surgical periodontal&#xD;
      treatment, root canal treatment was performed by experienced endodontist using a standardized&#xD;
      protocol. The standard procedures for all cases included local anaesthesia (2% lidocaine with&#xD;
      1:80,000 epinephrine), rubber dam isolation, pulp extirpation and standard access cavity&#xD;
      preparation. After flooding the pulp chamber with 3% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl; Sainsbury&#xD;
      plc, London, UK), canal negotiation &amp; apical patency was achieved with #10 or #15K-files.&#xD;
      Coronal flare was created with # 2 and #3 Gates-Glidden drills (Dentsply Maillefer, Tulsa,&#xD;
      OK). Working length of each canal was established with Root-ZX apex locator (J Morita,&#xD;
      Irwine, CA) and verified with radiographs. Canal instrumentation was performed with K files&#xD;
      in a crown-down technique. The master apical file size was set at 3 sizes larger than the&#xD;
      first binding file at working length. Instrumentation was carried out in conjunction with&#xD;
      copious irrigation with 3% sodium hypochlorite using 27 gauge needles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group 1, lentulospiral was used to fill all canals with calcium hydroxide and tooth was&#xD;
      sealed with Intermediate Restorative Material and patients were scheduled for a second&#xD;
      appointment to obdurate the root canals within 10 days. At the next appointment, calcium&#xD;
      hydroxide paste was removed by using circumferential filing with Hedstrom-type files and&#xD;
      copious irrigation with 3% sodium hypochlorite followed by 5.0 mL 17%&#xD;
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and a final rinse of 5.0 mL of 3% sodium hypochlorite. The&#xD;
      canals were dried with sterile paper points and obturated by using lateral condensation&#xD;
      technique with gutta-percha and zinc oxide sealer and permanent filling was placed in form of&#xD;
      silver amalgam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group 2, 2% CHX gel was placed and filled in the root canal space up to apex using 27&#xD;
      gauge endodontic syringe after cleaning with 17% EDTA and saline and tooth was coronally&#xD;
      sealed with glass inomer cement (Version 2, Shofu, Kyoto, Japan). This intracanal medicament&#xD;
      was changed every 1 month for 6 months and after 6 months canals were obturated same as in&#xD;
      group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERIODONTAL SURGICAL PROCEDURE: 5% povidone iodine solution was used for extraoral antisepsis&#xD;
      and intraoral antisepsis. After achieving local anaesthesia (2% lidocaine with 1:80,000&#xD;
      epinephrine), buccal and lingual/palatal intracrevicular incision were made with BP blade&#xD;
      number 15 and full thickness mucoperiosteal flaps were reflected including neighbouring&#xD;
      teeth. Meticulous defect debridement and root planing was carried out using area specific&#xD;
      gracey curettes and scalers to remove all the granulation tissue and deposits. After&#xD;
      instrumentation, the root surface was washed with saline solution in attempt to remove any&#xD;
      remaining detached fragments from the defect and surgical field. After debridement&#xD;
      mucoperiosteal flaps was repositioned and secured by using 3-0 non absorbable black silk&#xD;
      surgical suture. The surgical area was protected and covered with non eugenol periodontal&#xD;
      dressing (coe pak, GC America Inc, USA) and post operative instructions were given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP: All parameters were re-evaluated and recorded at baseline, 3 month, 6 month and 9&#xD;
      month of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Data were found to be non-normally distributed. Intragroup differences&#xD;
      were analysed by Wilcoxan Signed Rank test. Intergroup comparison of measurements were&#xD;
      analysed by Mann-Whitney U test..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial correlation analysis was done to analyse the correlation between the type of&#xD;
      treatment provided and clinical variables (at the 9 months of follow up) after controlling of&#xD;
      potential confounders PI and age. All the variables that had shown a significant correlation&#xD;
      were included in logistic regression analysis. Models were adjusted for the co-variates. The&#xD;
      Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic was applied to verify the diagnosis of the goodness-of-fit&#xD;
      regression model employed. All statistical analyses were two tailed with significance level&#xD;
      at 0.05.&#xD;
