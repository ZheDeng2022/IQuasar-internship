      Purpose of Study (The Effect of Viscous Fiber on Glycemic Control (VF &amp; GC) in Individuals&#xD;
      with Diabetes Mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the World Health Organization, about 347 million individuals are living with&#xD;
      diabetes. (http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/diabetes/facts/en/, accessed on Nov. 23,&#xD;
      2015). Over the last decades, dietary fibers, namely dietary viscous fibers, have emerged as&#xD;
      a nutrition component that may improve the postprandial glycemic response and hence aid in&#xD;
      long term diabetes management. It is believed that supplementation with viscous fibers can&#xD;
      control blood glucose by increasing viscosity of the gastric digesta, hence delaying gastric&#xD;
      emptying and retarding entry of glucose into the bloodstream to result in a diminished&#xD;
      postprandial rise in blood glucose. (Chutkan et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the evidence of the relationship between viscous fibers and diabetes is mixed. The&#xD;
      systematic review method depends on combining data from many small studies in order to get a&#xD;
      pooled estimate of the true effect. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the fasting&#xD;
      glycemic and insulinemic effect of viscous fiber supplementation. We hope the findings of&#xD;
      this study will play a key role in developing the nutritional guidelines for individuals with&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background: Diet high in total dietary fiber content has been recommended for individuals&#xD;
      with diabetes mellitus. However, the effect of supplementing diet with viscous fiber such as&#xD;
      guar gum, beta glucan, psyllium, konjac, or other viscous fibers on glycemic and insulinemic&#xD;
      outcomes in individuals with diabetes mellitus is still controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To improve the evidence-based guidelines/ recommendations for diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      we will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effect of viscous fiber&#xD;
      supplementation on glycemic control endpoints in individuals with diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Cochrane handbook for systematic review of interventions will be used for planning&#xD;
      and conducting this meta-analysis. The reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting Items&#xD;
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be&#xD;
      searched using appropriate pre-determined search terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: All the included trials must be randomized, controlled, with duration of ≥ 3&#xD;
      weeks investigating the effect of supplementing diet with viscous fiber on glycemic control&#xD;
      outcomes in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Acute studies, non-randomized, not&#xD;
      appropriately controlled studies will be excluded. Both isocaloric and non-isocaloric will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Two independent reviewers will extract information about fiber type, sample&#xD;
      size, subject characteristics, dose, follow-up, composition of the background diets, and&#xD;
      statistical analyses. Mean±SEM values will be extracted for all outcomes. Standard&#xD;
      computation and imputation will be used to derive all missing variance data. Risk of bias and&#xD;
      study quality will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Grading of&#xD;
      Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: This meta-analysis will assess a set of outcomes related to glycemic control in&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes mellitus. These outcomes are: (1) glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c),&#xD;
      (2) fasting glucose (FG), (3) fasting insulin (FI), (4) fructosmine, and (5) Homeostasis&#xD;
      model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Pooled analysis will be conducted using the Generic Inverse Variance method.&#xD;
      Rand-effects models will be used even in the absence of statistical significant between-study&#xD;
      heterogeneity because they yield more conservative summary effect estimates in the presence&#xD;
      of residual heterogeneity. Heterogeneity will be assessed using Cochran's Q test and&#xD;
      quantified by the I2 statistic. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses will be used to explore&#xD;
      sources of heterogeneity. A prioir subgroup analyses include study design, does, fiber type,&#xD;
      follow-up (duration), baseline values, study quality, food matrix, and composition of the&#xD;
      background diet. The significance of subgroup analyses will be assessed using meta-regression&#xD;
      analyses. Publication bias will be assessed using the inspection of funnel plots and&#xD;
      application of Egger's and Begg's tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: Results will be shared through traditional, national, and&#xD;
      international scientific meetings and they will be submitted to high impact factor journals&#xD;
      for publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: We hope the results of this study will play a role in improving the guidelines/&#xD;
      recommendations for individuals with diabetes mellitus by raising the awareness towards&#xD;
      viscous fiber consumption among health providers, patients, and industry. Hopefully, this&#xD;
      study will aid in guiding future research in the dietary fiber field.&#xD;
