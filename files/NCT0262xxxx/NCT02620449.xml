  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn more about how common food additives can affect&#xD;
      phosphorus metabolism in people with normal kidney function and people with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disturbances in phosphate homeostasis are strongly associated with cardiovascular morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. High dietary phosphate intake plays a central role in the development of&#xD;
      disturbed phosphate metabolism and is common in persons consuming typical American diets rich&#xD;
      in processed and fast foods. An important reason for the high phosphate content of these&#xD;
      foods is the widespread use of phosphate-based food additives in the food supply. Phosphate&#xD;
      additives are heavily utilized by the food manufacturing industry to enhance the appearance,&#xD;
      taste and shelf-life of processed foods, accounting for as much as 50% of total phosphate&#xD;
      intake per day. Prior work from our group suggest that high phosphate additive intake has&#xD;
      serious cardiovascular consequences. We showed that phosphate excess induces heart disease&#xD;
      and inflammation in experimental studies, and associates with heart disease and death&#xD;
      independently of classic risk factors in epidemiology studies. Further, we showed that high&#xD;
      phosphate additive intake stimulates the secretion of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a&#xD;
      phosphate-regulatory hormone directly implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Together, these data strongly suggest that high phosphate additive intake promotes&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, with important potential implications for efforts to reduce&#xD;
      disparities in cardiovascular disease. This is because individuals with low socioeconomic&#xD;
      status have limited means to purchase healthy foods, resulting in excessive consumption of&#xD;
      processed foods rich in phosphate additives. Moreover, low income neighborhoods have a&#xD;
      disproportionately high prevalence of individuals with chronic kidney disease and black&#xD;
      individuals, both groups that have impaired ability to excrete excess phosphate. Together,&#xD;
      these data support our overriding hypothesis that high phosphate additive intake is a novel&#xD;
      target for reducing socioeconomic and racial disparities in cardiovascular. We will test this&#xD;
      hypothesis in detailed feeding studies of 80 individuals fed standardized meals with low&#xD;
      phosphate additive content for 6 weeks. We will investigate the impact of reducing phosphate&#xD;
      additive intake on changes in FGF23 levels, inflammatory markers and vascular function, and&#xD;
      test for effect modification by race and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The results of these&#xD;
      studies will help determine whether high phosphate additive intake is a modifiable risk&#xD;
      factor for disparities in cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
