  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent pain and joint stiffness after surgery may interfere with recovery and adversely&#xD;
      affect quality of life in up to 40% of patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
      There is growing evidence that inflammation as well as other medical and psychological&#xD;
      factors may be associated with osteoarthritis severity, progression, and associated pain&#xD;
      severity. This study aims to identify clinical, biological, and psychological factors that&#xD;
      contribute to and predict the development of these complications. Identification of such&#xD;
      factors may allow us to target preventative measures to the patients at highest risk of&#xD;
      persistent postoperative pain and joint stiffness.&#xD;
