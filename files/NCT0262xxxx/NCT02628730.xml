  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest condition affecting the rhythm of the heart.&#xD;
      Tablets to try to normalise the heart rhythm rarely work well. As a result, doctors have&#xD;
      devised a treatment called catheter ablation in which special wires are used to deliver heat&#xD;
      energy (called ablation lesions) on the inside surface of the heart. Unfortunately, in many&#xD;
      patients (almost 1 in 2), some of these ablation lesions recover, and this leads to AF&#xD;
      recurrence. Many of these patients then need a second procedure to deliver further ablation&#xD;
      at these recovered areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research has shown that monitoring of heat delivery with a factor called Ablation&#xD;
      Index may be useful in predicting which ablation lesions are less likely to recover.&#xD;
      Therefore, we aim to carry out AF ablation guided with Ablation Index (AI) and observe&#xD;
      whether this will be associated with better durability of ablation lesions, and thereby&#xD;
      better freedom from AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include patients with persistent AF, those whose AF episode(s) last for&#xD;
      longer than seven days. All patients participating in the study will undergo an initial&#xD;
      ablation treatment guided by ablation Index . All patients will undergo a repeat procedure&#xD;
      8-10 weeks after their initial treatment. Any gaps found during the second procedure will be&#xD;
      closed again by delivery of ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be issued with a simple to use handheld heart rhythm monitor, and asked&#xD;
      to make a 30-second recording of their heart rhythm each day and also whenever they have&#xD;
      symptoms. The monitor stores these recordings and they will be downloaded at review&#xD;
      appointments arranged 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the initial ablation&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

      The study is a prospective cohort study in 40 patients with Persistent AF. It will comprise&#xD;
      two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Active Group (AI guided ablation): An initial pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) procedure&#xD;
           will be performed guided by AI targets. All patients (regardless of AF recurrence) will&#xD;
           undergo a repeat EP study at 8-10 weeks to identify and re-ablate site(s) of PV&#xD;
           reconnection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Historical control group (Contact Force Guided Ablation): will be formed by the 40&#xD;
           patients enrolled to the repeat study arm of the PRESSURE study (ClinicalTrials.gov&#xD;
           Identifier: NCT01942408). All 40 patients underwent contact force-guided PVI followed by&#xD;
           a repeat EP study after 8-10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-points&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of patients with pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection seen at repeat EP study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of reconnected PVs seen at repeat electrophysiology (EP) study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of patients maintaining freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia for 12 months&#xD;
           (after an initial 12 week blanking period)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QOL 6 and 12 months after initial ablation, as quantified by the validated atrial&#xD;
           Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-life (AFEQT) and EQ-5D-5Lquestionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rates of major complications occurring within 60 days after a PVI procedure, measured in&#xD;
           composite numbers and percentage.&#xD;
