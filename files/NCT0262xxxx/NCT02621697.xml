    <textblock>
      Objectives: To evaluate the effects of eight weeks of cognitive motor training (dual task) in&#xD;
      the risk of falls, balance, independence in basic activities of daily living (BADL) and&#xD;
      handgrip in institutionalized elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The sample was divided in two groups: double task group (DTG), consists of five&#xD;
      elderly, undergoing a training consists of motor and cognitive activities and control group&#xD;
      (CG) consists of four seniors who underwent conventional kinesiotherapeutic training, based&#xD;
      on global stretching and strengthening exercises, both held in 16 sessions.&#xD;

      Experimental, prospective and quantitative study, whose sample was selected for convenience&#xD;
      in a long-term care institution for the elderly (LTCF) in the city of Uberaba - MG. The&#xD;
      volunteers were divided into two groups, named dual task group (DTG) consists of five&#xD;
      seniors, and control group (CG) consists of four elderly. All participants of both groups&#xD;
      answered a questionnaire with sociodemographic and economic characteristics of the sample.&#xD;
      Participants underwent a pre- and post evaluation containing vital signs parameters (blood&#xD;
      pressure, respiratory rate and heart rate), anthropometric data (weight and height) and&#xD;
      different tests to evaluate the balance, functional mobility, risk of falls, muscle strength&#xD;
      and independence to carry out basic activities of daily living. The performed tests were&#xD;
      Timed Up and Go (TUG) conventional, motor TUG and TUG cognitive, beyond Romberg test and&#xD;
      Sensitized Romberg, Berg Balance Scale, and modified Katz scale (with maintenance of the six&#xD;
      original activities of the scale, but with simulation to the performance of each task,&#xD;
      measuring the spent time).&#xD;
