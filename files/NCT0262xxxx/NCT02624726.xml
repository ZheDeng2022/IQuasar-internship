      Investigators propose to study the combination of m FOLFIRI plus Aflibercept in a Phase II&#xD;
      trial of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The promising results of aflibercept&#xD;
      derived from preclinical studies and from clinical trials conducted in patients with&#xD;
      refractory of recurrent to oxaliplatin-based 1st line treatment in patients with mCRC open&#xD;
      the field to explore such therapeutic approaches in the 1st line setting in combination with&#xD;
      the FOLFIRI regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer accounts for 8% of all malignant tumors in adults and is considered as a&#xD;
      major cause of cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although curative surgical resection&#xD;
      is possible in 70-80% of patients at diagnosis, almost half of them will develop local or/and&#xD;
      metastatic recurrence and will die of the disease with the liver been the most common site of&#xD;
      metastatic spread from CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combinations of infusional administrated 5-fluorouracil/Leucovorin with irinotecan or&#xD;
      oxaliplatin are accepted as the mainstay of first-line treatment and have increase the median&#xD;
      overall survival of patients with advanced CRC from 12 months to about 21-22 months. In&#xD;
      addition, resection for colorectal metastases (mainly in the liver), has become the standard&#xD;
      of care, for patients with limited metastatic disease confounded to the liver and currently&#xD;
      remains the only potentially curative therapy Aflibercept, also known as vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor (VEGF) Trap, is an angiogenesis inhibitor with a unique mechanism of action.&#xD;
      Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein that consists of portions of human VEGFR1 and&#xD;
      VEGFR2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1. This fusion&#xD;
      protein binds all forms of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A, as well as VEGF-B and&#xD;
      placental growth factor, additional angiogenic growth factors that appear to play a role in&#xD;
      tumor angiogenesis and inflammation. Aflibercept has been shown to bind VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and&#xD;
      placental growth factor (PlGF) with higher affinity than their native receptors. In vitro and&#xD;
      in vivo studies have shown that aflibercept can inhibit new vessel growth and tumor&#xD;
      vascularization in tumor models.&#xD;
