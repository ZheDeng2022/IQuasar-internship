  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine if treatment for recently acquired hepatitis C infection&#xD;
      (with or without HIV coinfection) can be shortened when treating with the interferon-free&#xD;
      therapy sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOF/VEL is a new treatment for hepatitis C called direct acting antiviral which targets the&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus replication cycle and has been shown in phase II studies in chronic HCV to&#xD;
      be highly effective (SVR12 &gt;95%) when given for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data has shown that treatment can be shortened when treating recently acquired HCV with&#xD;
      interferon containing treatments. It is not known whether treatment with SOF/VEL can be&#xD;
      shortened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to find out if treatment for 6 weeks with open-label SOF/VEL is equivalent to&#xD;
      treatment for 12 weeks with SOF/VEL in participants with recently acquired hepatitis C&#xD;
      infection. The project is a randomised study where both participants and investigators would&#xD;
      not find out the treatment duration of the participants until week 6 of treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, 3-4 million new HCV infections are estimated to occur annually. People who inject&#xD;
      drugs (PWID) represent one of the groups at highest risk of transmitting and acquiring&#xD;
      infection with the majority of new (60%) and existing (80%) infections in developed countries&#xD;
      occur in this population with HCV antibody prevalence estimated at 67% (60-80%). HIV-positive&#xD;
      men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) are another high risk group for HCV acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct acting antivirals (DAA) has changed the treatment landscape for individuals with&#xD;
      chronic HCV infection with interferon-free therapy offering high effectiveness and&#xD;
      tolerability, even in &quot;difficult-to-treat&quot; populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the burden of HCV-related disease among PWID and HIV-positive MSM, strategies to&#xD;
      enhance HCV assessment, treatment and prevention in these groups are urgently needed. Much of&#xD;
      what is known about the timing of treatment initiation, regimen choice and duration of&#xD;
      therapy in acute HCV infection comes from small observational studies and randomized&#xD;
      controlled (randomly assigned into one or other of the different treatment groups)trials in&#xD;
      selected populations with limited data on treatment in PWID and HIV co-infection. With recent&#xD;
      rapid advances in HCV treatments, management strategies for acute HCV will evolve rapidly&#xD;
      over the next few years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The REACT study will compare the efficacy and safety of open-label SOF/VEL administered for 6&#xD;
      or 12 weeks in individuals with recent HCV infection. Participants will be randomised into&#xD;
      receiving 6 weeks or 12 weeks treatment. Both investigators and participants will be blinded&#xD;
      to the treatment duration until week 6 of treatment. The role and activity of DAA regimens in&#xD;
      acute HCV infection requires evaluation, with the potential to be given as highly effective,&#xD;
      short course interferon-sparing regimens, maximising acceptability to patients, encouraging&#xD;
      uptake of treatment, limiting further transmission and preventing progression to chronic&#xD;
      liver disease.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>No individual participant data will be shared. The results of the project will be presented at scientific meetings, and published in peer reviewed scientific literature. Sharing of data generated by this project is an essential part of our proposed activities and will be carried out in several different ways. We plan to make our results available to the community of scientists interested in recently acquired hepatitis C, community organisations representing the affected communities and participants. We also welcome collaboration with others who could make use of data and samples.</ipd_description>
