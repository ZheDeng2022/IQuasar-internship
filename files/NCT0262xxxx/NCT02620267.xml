    <textblock>
      Individuals with schizophrenia have difficulties in functioning in the community. No one&#xD;
      really knows what factors determine how well patients manage in the real world. The purpose&#xD;
      of this pilot study is to try a new approach to improving a potential determinant of good&#xD;
      community functioning, namely how we process sounds. Specifically, we propose to examine the&#xD;
      benefit of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a new tool that is being developed&#xD;
      as a safe and non-invasive neurostimulation method, for improving processing of sounds.&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation involves placing a wet sponge electrode on the head&#xD;
      and one on the arm. Electrical current from a device powered by a 9-volt battery will flow&#xD;
      from one electrode to the other. A small portion of the current will pass through the skull&#xD;
      and stimulate the brain. This procedure is non-invasive and painless and it results in&#xD;
      increase or decrease of spontaneous neuronal firing in the brain. Neurons are brain cells&#xD;
      that send electrochemical messages to each other. Its safety and beneficial effect on mental&#xD;
      functions has been demonstrated in healthy individuals and several clinical populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if transcranial direct current stimulation can&#xD;
      effect how we process sounds.&#xD;

      Neurocognitive and social cognitive deficits are increasingly recognized as core features of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The severity of these deficits closely correlate to functional impairment and&#xD;
      patient outcomes in this population. Current pharmacological treatments do not address these&#xD;
      illness domains and psychosocial interventions that do are not consistently available.&#xD;
      Underlying these higher level cognitive domains are basic sensory processing deficits in the&#xD;
      auditory and visual realm that contribute to higher order dysfunction. Evidence of these&#xD;
      sensory defects are not readily apparent on clinical exam and are best appreciated using&#xD;
      functional imaging and electrophysiological measures. Interventions that remediate these&#xD;
      sensory deficits may lead to functional improvement as sensory level improvements may cascade&#xD;
      up to higher cognitive domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deficits in auditory processing are evidenced using EEG based event related potentials (ERP).&#xD;
      A robust measure of early auditory processing deficits in schizophrenia is the use of an&#xD;
      auditory oddball paradigm to elicit Mismatch Negativity (MMN). The MMN ERP is generated when&#xD;
      a rare deviant signal is detected in the context of a series of standards. The amplitude of&#xD;
      the MMN in schizophrenia patients is decreased compared to healthy controls which reflects a&#xD;
      deficit in detecting novel stimuli. This decreased auditory MMN has been shown to be closely&#xD;
      correlated with deficits in auditory emotion recognition tasks in subjects with schizophrenia&#xD;
      and patient functional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This deficit in early auditory processing is thought to be secondary to regions of cortical&#xD;
      hypoactivity. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive&#xD;
      neuromodulation technique that targets cortical regions with direct current and can either&#xD;
      increase or decrease cortical excitability depending on the polarity of the tDCS electrode.&#xD;
      The MMN network is composed of several generators that serve to process the auditory signal,&#xD;
      establish an auditory memory trace, and signal the appearance of the deviant signal. The&#xD;
      initial aim of this proposed study will be to determine if tDCS stimulation over the auditory&#xD;
      cortex can modulate early auditory processing as measured by the MMN response. Our second aim&#xD;
      will be to determine the effect of tDCS stimulation over the auditory cortex on performance&#xD;
      measures of auditory processing as assessed by a tone matching task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 Determine whether the early auditory processing network can be engaged and modulated by&#xD;
      tDCS of the superior temporal lobe, where the earliest generators of the network maybe&#xD;
      located, as assessed by changes in the auditory mismatch negativity ERP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1 Active tDCS stimulation of the superior temporal lobe will modulate the early&#xD;
      auditory processing network resulting in an effect measurable by amplitude changes in the&#xD;
      mismatch negativity ERP compared to control sham stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 Determine the effect of tDCS at the temporal generators on the early auditory&#xD;
      processing network as assessed by the tone matching task performance measure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2 Active tDCS stimulation of the temporal generators will modulate the early&#xD;
      auditory processing network resulting in a performance change on the tone-matching task&#xD;
      compared to sham control stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a within subject, cross over design counterbalanced for order of both&#xD;
      stimulation condition and post-stimulation measurement. All patients will receive anodal,&#xD;
      cathodal and sham stimulation targeted bilaterally to the superior temporal region&#xD;
      (unipolarity, dual-site stimulation). We do not have a directional prediction for the active&#xD;
      stimulations (anode and cathode) in terms of increasing or decreasing the amplitude of the&#xD;
      MMN ERP, but we do expect active stimulation to change the MMN ERP amplitude. Patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia will be randomly assigned to one of six block stimulation sequences&#xD;
      counterbalanced for order of stimulation condition. The goal will be to have complete and&#xD;
      usable data from 12 subjects, and thus up to 30 subjects will be enrolled to account for&#xD;
      screen failures and drop-outs. At the first visit, subjects will be screened, assessed, and&#xD;
      consented if they meet selection criteria. They will then be randomized to one of the&#xD;
      counterbalanced stimulation sequences and receive their first stimulation session followed by&#xD;
      EEG assessment and tone matching task. Subjects will return in one week for visit 2 and the&#xD;
      following week for visit 3. At visits 2 and 3, subjects will receive a tDCS session followed&#xD;
      by EEG and tone matching task assessment. All visits will be separated by at least 1 week to&#xD;
      washout the effect from the previous stimulation. Each patient will return for a total of 3&#xD;
      stimulation visits.&#xD;
