      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an experimental cancer vaccine for&#xD;
      mantle cell lymphoma a form of cancer of the white blood cells called lymphocytes. Although&#xD;
      standard treatments for lymphoma may achieve disease remission, none provides a cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with mantle cell lymphoma 18 years and older who have not been treated previously&#xD;
      with chemotherapy may participate in this study. Candidates will be screened for eligibility&#xD;
      with a medical history and physical examination. Other tests that may be required include&#xD;
      blood and urine tests; lung function studies; imaging tests such as magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging, computed tomography and X-rays; and biopsy (surgical removal of a small tissue&#xD;
      sample) of tumor, bone marrow, or other tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study will begin treatment with chemotherapy designed to reduce&#xD;
      disease to a minimum that is, to achieve remission or shrink the tumor as much as possible.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy will be administered on an outpatient basis over a period of around 12 to 18&#xD;
      weeks in 3-week cycles as follows: prednisone by mouth on days 1 through 5; etoposide,&#xD;
      doxorubicin and vincristine intravenously through (a vein) on days 1 through 5; and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide intravenously on day 5. Starting day 6, patients receive no chemotherapy for&#xD;
      16 days. In addition, an antibody called rituximab, which attaches to lymphoma cells and may&#xD;
      increase the effectiveness of the chemotherapy, will be given on day 1 of the cycle. Patients&#xD;
      will also receive a protein called G-CSF starting day 6 of the cycle and continuing until the&#xD;
      white blood cell count recovers or until day 19. G-CSF is naturally produced by bone marrow&#xD;
      and may boost the immune system. The chemotherapy drugs and rituximab are infused through a&#xD;
      vein by means of a lightweight portable pump, which patients are taught how to use. Patients&#xD;
      are also how taught how to give themselves G-CSF injections under the skin, similar to&#xD;
      insulin injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first vaccination will be given at least 3 months after chemotherapy ends and will be&#xD;
      repeated every 4 weeks for a maximum of 5 vaccinations. The vaccinations will be given in the&#xD;
      clinic. Patients will also receive daily injections of GM-CSF, a growth factor naturally&#xD;
      produced by bone marrow that can boost the immune system. These injections will be given the&#xD;
      day of the vaccination and for the next 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When vaccine therapy is completed, patients who were treated successfully will be followed&#xD;
      with periodic clinic visits for follow-up examinations and tests. Patients in whom the&#xD;
      lymphoma did not disappear entirely or who have a recurrence of disease will be advised of&#xD;
      further treatment possibilities.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mantle cell lymphoma presents a particular clinical challenge because it is aggressive&#xD;
           and incurable with chemotherapy. Thus, novel treatment approaches are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In follicular center cell lymphomas, another incurable disease, recent evidence suggests&#xD;
           that molecular complete remissions may be achieved following idiotype vaccination in&#xD;
           patients who have achieved minimal residual disease with combination chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These results suggest that idiotype vaccines may be able to induce a clinically&#xD;
           significant immune response against lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if EPOCH-R/idiotype vaccination is associated with a median progression-free&#xD;
           survival consistent with 36 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if rituximab affects generation of T-cell immunity against the idiotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare T-cell immunity using two different methods of isolating the idiotype&#xD;
           protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previously untreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. All stages of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymph node of greater than or equal to 2 cm accessible for biopsy/harvest or greater&#xD;
           than 1000/microl of circulating tumor cells in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the present study, we propose to investigate the efficacy of idiotype vaccine&#xD;
           treatment in previously untreated patients with mantle cell lymphomas. In order to&#xD;
           achieve minimal residual disease, patients will receive 6 cycles EPOCH chemotherapy and&#xD;
           rituximab (EPOCH-R) followed by 5 idiotype vaccine injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study has completed accrual of 26 patients and is only open for follow-up.&#xD;
