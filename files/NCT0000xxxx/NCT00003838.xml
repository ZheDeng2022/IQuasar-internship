  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The are a variety of cancerous diseases of the blood and bone marrow that can be potentially&#xD;
      cured by bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Diseases like leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple&#xD;
      myeloma are among the conditions that can be treated with BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients with these diseases can be treated with medical chemotherapy alone. However,&#xD;
      patients who relapse following chemotherapy are usually not curable with additional&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatments. The only option known to provide a potential cure if this occurs is&#xD;
      BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogenic transplants are cells collected from relatives of the patient. The transplant&#xD;
      requires additional high intensity chemotherapy and radiation in order to destroy cancerous&#xD;
      cells. In the process, many normal bone marrow cells are also destroyed. This is the reason&#xD;
      for transplanting stem cells. The stem cells help to build new functioning bone marrow, red&#xD;
      cells, white cells, and platelets. In addition, the immune cells from the donor are implanted&#xD;
      into the recipient s body and help to fight off infection and kill remaining cancerous cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the powerful doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy associated with&#xD;
      allogenic BMT have toxic side effects and often make BMTs too dangerous to attempt in many&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reduce the complications of BMT, and make it a safer available option for&#xD;
      patients with cancers of the blood and bone marrow, researchers have developed a new approach&#xD;
      to the BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers plan to use stem cells collected from the blood stream of patient s&#xD;
      relatives rather than from the bone marrow (blood progenitor/stem cell transplant). In&#xD;
      addition, researchers plan to use low doses of chemotherapy and no radiation therapy to&#xD;
      reduce side effects. The majority of the cancer killing effect will be the responsibility of&#xD;
      the stem cell transplant rather than the chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with malignant and non-malignant hematologic diseases including severe aplastic&#xD;
      anemia (SAA), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),&#xD;
      acute and chronic leukemias, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma (MM)&#xD;
      can now be cured by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). This curative effect has&#xD;
      been ascribed to the use of high dose chemo-radiotherapy and the anti-tumor or anti-bone&#xD;
      marrow effect of the allograft. Dose intensification of conditioning regimens in attempts to&#xD;
      reduce disease recurrence has been largely unsuccessful because of increased toxicity and&#xD;
      mortality. Indeed, most evidence now points to donor-derived T-cells as being the principal&#xD;
      modality leading to the complete eradication of both malignant and non-malignant host&#xD;
      hematopoietic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assumption that successful allogeneic BMT relies on the myeloablative effect of intensive&#xD;
      but hazardous chemo-radiotherapy has largely restricted this therapeutic modality to patients&#xD;
      with malignant or life-threatening hematologic disorders under the age of 55 years.&#xD;
      Treatment-related mortality increases substantially with age, prior intensive treatment with&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy, worsening performance status, and co-morbid medical conditions. An&#xD;
      unacceptable risk of death from conventional BMT renders many patients ineligible for what&#xD;
      may otherwise be curative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several in vitro studies have demonstrated the existence of donor-derived CD4 and CD8&#xD;
      positive lymphocytes with specific reactivity for the patient s leukemia. These cells provide&#xD;
      a potent graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. This GVL effect is best seen in patients with&#xD;
      CML relapsing after BMT, where a single infusion of donor lymphocytes has been shown to&#xD;
      induce complete remission. In addition to the potent anti-leukemia effect of these cells,&#xD;
      there is now strong evidence that donor T-cells are capable of completely eradicating&#xD;
      residual host hematopoietic cells in a non-myeloablative transplant setting&#xD;
      (graft-versus-marrow) leading to successful and complete donor hematopoietic engraftment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-myeloablative allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplants are currently being&#xD;
      investigated in phase I/II trials assessing engraftment efficacy and toxicity at a number of&#xD;
      transplant centers. Preliminary data, including our own experience with greater than 150&#xD;
      patients undergoing this type of procedure, have shown a high rate of complete donor&#xD;
      engraftment with a low toxicity profile. Two recent studies investigating non-myeloablative&#xD;
      allo-transplantation in standard risk patients revealed an extremely low rate of&#xD;
      transplant-related complications and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decreased risk of transplant-related complications associated with non-myeloablative&#xD;
      transplants expands the eligibility of transplant candidates as well as opens the possibility&#xD;
      to evaluate non-myeloablative regimens in patients at high risk for complications with&#xD;
      standard transplantation. Besides hematologic malignancies, allogeneic BMT has been shown to&#xD;
      be curative in a number of debilitating hematologic diseases which may behave in a relatively&#xD;
      indolent fashion, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and refractory anemia&#xD;
      (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS). However, the 30% risk of&#xD;
      treatment-related mortality (TRM) with standard myeloablative allotransplantation usually&#xD;
      precludes these patients from potentially curative therapy, because of concerns about&#xD;
      shortening life in patients with these disorders. In this protocol we investigate&#xD;
      non-myeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation in two groups&#xD;
      of subjects where standard allogeneic transplantation is considered to have unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Subjects with hematologic malignancies with factors putting them at high risk for&#xD;
      transplant related complications and mortality, including prior intensive chemo-radiotherapy&#xD;
      and co-morbid diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Subjects with hematologic diseases (both clonal and non-clonal) associated with&#xD;
      reasonable longevity not currently considered for allogeneic BMT because of prohibitive&#xD;
      procedural mortality with conventional BMT (enrollment closed October 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, eligible subjects are treated with an allogeneic PBSC transplant from an&#xD;
      HLA identical or single HLA antigen-mismatched family donor, using an intensive&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimen without myeloablation in an attempt to decrease the transplant&#xD;
      related toxicities while preserving the anti-malignancy and/or anti-host marrow effect of the&#xD;
      graft. The low intensity non-myeloablative conditioning regimen should provide adequate&#xD;
      immunosuppression to allow stem cell and lymphocyte engraftment. T-cell replete,&#xD;
      donor-derived, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized PBSCs will be used to&#xD;
      establish hematopoietic and lymphoid reconstitution. We will add back lymphocytes in&#xD;
      recipients with less than 100% donor T-cell chimerism in an attempt to prevent graft&#xD;
      rejection and enhance a graft-versus-malignancy effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is transplant related mortality (200 day survival). Other&#xD;
      end points include engraftment, degree of donor-host chimerism, incidence of acute and&#xD;
      chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), transplant related morbidity as well as&#xD;
      disease-free and overall survival.&#xD;
