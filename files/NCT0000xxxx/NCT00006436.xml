    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV-infected patients have a weakened immune system, and chemotherapy, which is used to&#xD;
           treat lymphoma, probably causes further damage to the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Limiting the amount of immune damage due to chemotherapy might decrease the number of&#xD;
           infections and the risk of developing cancer in the future in HIV-infected patients with&#xD;
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether reducing the total amount of chemotherapy using a specific&#xD;
           combination of drugs called EPOCH-R (etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine,&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide and rituximab) will rid the body of lymphoma quickly while decreasing&#xD;
           the risk of infections and future cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether the lymphoma will remain undetectable for at least one year if&#xD;
           treatment is stopped one cycle after the patient enters remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and HIV infection 4 years of age and older who have not&#xD;
      been treated previously with rituximab or cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receive EPOCH-R in 3-week treatment cycles for at least three and no more than&#xD;
           six cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The lymphoma is evaluated using CT and PET scans at the end of treatment cycles 2 and 3.&#xD;
           A bone marrow biopsy is repeated after cycle 2 if a biopsy was initially positive on&#xD;
           screening for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-HIV therapy is stopped before chemotherapy begins and is restarted when EPOCH-R&#xD;
           treatment ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are monitored for treatment response with blood tests and imaging scans at&#xD;
           baseline, when treatment ends, 2 months after treatment ends and then every 3 to 6&#xD;
           months for a total of 24 months following chemotherapy.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a study to investigate in a preliminary fashion the feasibility of short course&#xD;
      chemotherapy to participants with HIV-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HIV-NHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate if the paradigm for treatment can be successfully changed from a&#xD;
      standard of 6 cycles to one cycle beyond complete remission with 6 total allowable cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess with 90 percent probability that at least 50 percent of participants treated with&#xD;
      short-course EPOCH-R will be progression free at one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aggressive CD20 positive DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV+ serology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All stages (I-IV) of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG Performance status 0-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NHL previously untreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      May not be pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      May not have received previous rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be treated every three weeks with a combination of EPOCH and rituximab for&#xD;
      one cycle beyond CR/CRu by CT scan of all detectable tumors for a minimum of three and&#xD;
      maximum of six cycles. Following cycle 2, CT, positron emission tomography scans (PET), and&#xD;
      bone marrow biopsies (if initially positive) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the study, we will estimate whether the number of cycles can be reduced&#xD;
      using the paradigm. If the cumulative number of participants to relapse exceeds 25 percent by&#xD;
      6 months, the study will be closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the completion of chemotherapy, restaging will be performed 2 months following the&#xD;
      end of treatment, then every 3 months for one year, every 6 months for one year, then every&#xD;
      12 months until relapse, death, or loss to follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) will be given concurrently with treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effects of treatment approach on parameters of HIV disease, measurements of CD4&#xD;
      cells and viral loads will be made at baseline and at the completion of therapy, and then 2&#xD;
      months following the end of treatment, and then every 3-6 months for a total of 24 months&#xD;
      following chemotherapy.&#xD;
