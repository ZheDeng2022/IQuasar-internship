  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients whose parathyroid activity is elevated above normal are referred to as having&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism. This study will help researchers better understand the causes of&#xD;
      hyperthyroidism and to evaluate and improve methods for diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients diagnosed with or suspected of having hyperparathyroidism will be&#xD;
      selected to participate. In addition, patients with related conditions such as parathyroid&#xD;
      tumors, will also be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to provide blood and urine for testing to confirm their condition.&#xD;
      They will then be surgically treated by removal of the parathyroid gland(s)&#xD;
      (parathyroidectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with parathyroid tumors will undergo several diagnostic tests to determine the exact&#xD;
      location of the tumor as well as the tumor's activity. The tests may include; ultrasounds,&#xD;
      nuclear scanning, CT scans, MRI, and specialized blood testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sometimes parathyroidectomy leads to hypoparathyroidism. Options for treating the patients&#xD;
      after the surgical procedure will also be addressed. Calcium and Vitamin D supplements are&#xD;
      typically the mainstay of post parathyroidectomy therapy. Other potential treatments include&#xD;
      transplanting the parathyroid gland(s) to other areas of the body.&#xD;

      Precis: Patients with confirmed or suspected primary hyperparathyroidism or complications&#xD;
      therefrom (such as postoperative hypoparathyroidism) will be admitted for diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment. The principal diagnostic components are calcium in serum and urine, parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone in serum, and mutation tests on germline or tumor DNA. Patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe primary hyperparathyroidism will be treated. Treatment will be mainly by&#xD;
      parathyroidectomy. Other options are medications or no intervention. Patients with a&#xD;
      hyperparathyroid syndrome may be managed for their extraparathyroid features. Preoperative&#xD;
      testing to localize parathyroid neoplasm(s) will be used usually and with more extended&#xD;
      methods in cases with prior neck surgery. Preoperative tumor localization tests will be&#xD;
      selected according to clinical indications from the following: ultrasound,&#xD;
      technetium-thallium scan, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration for parathyroid hormone assay, selective arteriogram, selective venous&#xD;
      catheterization for parathyroid hormone assay. Options for management of postoperative&#xD;
      hypocalcemia include calcium, vitamin D analogs, parathyroid autografts and synthetic&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone. Research specimens may consist of blood or tumors.&#xD;

    <description>The purpose of this study is to understand the causes of primary hyperparathyroidism, to evaluate and improve methods for diagnosis and treatment, and to provide insight into the mechanisms of normal parathyroid function. Hereditary causes of primary hyperparathyroidism will be characterized. Methods of pre-operative parathyroid gland localization will be evaluated (6, 7, 8). Genes that contribute to development of parathyroid tumors will be analyzed (4, 9, 10).</description>

    <time_frame>Yearly</time_frame>
    <description>There is the potential for direct benefit for patients participating in this study if the study results show 18F-DOPA PET/CT imaging to be more accurate than the current standard 68Gallium-DOTATATE at detecting primary lesions or metastasis. The future application of 18F-DOPA imaging modality in other patients could lead to early detection of solid gastrointestinal or pancreatic lesions and metastatic lesions, which would improve early management of these lesions and potentially have an impact on the overall course of the disease.</description>
