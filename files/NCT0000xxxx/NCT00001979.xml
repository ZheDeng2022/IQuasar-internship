  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney diseases related to the immune system include, nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis,&#xD;
      membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and nephritis associated with connective tissue&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow researchers to admit and follow patients suffering from autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases of the kidney. It will attempt to provide information about the causes and specific&#xD;
      abnormalities associated with autoimmune kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with kidney disease as a result of their immune system, and patients with diseases&#xD;
      of the immune system who may later develop kidney disease, will be potential subjects for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a history and physical examination, and standard laboratory test to&#xD;
      more closely understand the causes, signs, symptoms, and responses to medication of these&#xD;
      diseases. Based on these evaluations the patients may qualify as candidates for other&#xD;
      experimental studies. At any time these patients may be asked to submit blood or urine&#xD;
      samples for further research.&#xD;

      Patients with known or suspected immunologically-mediated kidney diseases, including but not&#xD;
      limited to, nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis,&#xD;
      and nephritis associated with other systemic or connective tissue disorders, will be&#xD;
      evaluated at the Clinical Center. Patients who have immunologically-mediated diseases with&#xD;
      potential for kidney disease will be evaluated as well. Studies will include characterization&#xD;
      of the clinical and laboratory features of these disorders, studies of natural history and&#xD;
      complications, evaluation of responses to standard treatment, and determination of the&#xD;
      patients' eligibility to enter other experimental diagnostic or therapeutic protocols.&#xD;
      Patients may be asked to contribute blood and/or urine samples for immunological research&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
