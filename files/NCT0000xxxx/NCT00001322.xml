    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of estrogen and progesterone on mood, the stress response,&#xD;
      and brain function in healthy women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how low levels of estrogen and progesterone (that&#xD;
      occur during treatment with leuprolide acetate) compare to menstrual cycle levels of estrogen&#xD;
      and progesterone (given during individual months of hormone add-back) on a variety of&#xD;
      physiologic measures (brain imaging, stress testing, etc.) in healthy volunteer women without&#xD;
      PMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate effects of reproductive hormones by temporarily stopping the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle with leuprolide acetate and then giving, in sequence, the menstrual cycle&#xD;
      hormones progesterone and estrogen. Tests (such as brain imaging or stress testing, etc.)&#xD;
      will be performed during the different hormonal conditions (low estrogen and progesterone,&#xD;
      progesterone add-back, estrogen add-back). The results of these studies will be compared&#xD;
      between women without PMS and women with PMS (see also protocol 90-M-0088).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study entry, participants will undergo a physical examination. Blood, urine, and pregnancy&#xD;
      tests will be performed. Cognitive functioning and stress response will be evaluated during&#xD;
      the study along with brain imaging and genetic studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that the gonadal steroids may exert clinically significant effects on&#xD;
      central nervous system function. For example, the menstrual cycle may influence the&#xD;
      occurrence of seizures in some female epileptics and the performance on certain cognitive&#xD;
      tests. Central nervous system effects of gonadal steroids have been inferred largely from&#xD;
      changes in behavior occurring in association with presumed changes in gonadal steroids during&#xD;
      the normal menstrual cycle, during the administration of ovarian hormones, or in a&#xD;
      gender-specific context. These inferences are, by definition, indirect and associational in&#xD;
      nature and further are incapable of disentangling the effects of hormones which are&#xD;
      simultaneously present in women of reproductive age. This study is designed to address those&#xD;
      problems by comparing measures during Lupron-induced hypogonadism with those during&#xD;
      replacement with estrogen or progesterone. On the basis of prior findings from our group and&#xD;
      from others, we will be asking the following questions: 1) Is the decreased r-CBF that we&#xD;
      observed in the prefrontal cortex during the hypogonadal state confirmed in individual women&#xD;
      using new imaging techniques; 2) Will variation in genotype (e.g., COMT val/met, BDNF&#xD;
      val/met) confer differential sensitivity to ovarian steroids in brain circuitry and 3) Are&#xD;
      the menstrual cycle phase-related changes in reward systems that we previously observed&#xD;
      related to estradiol or progesterone actions within the brain (1). Additionally, this&#xD;
      protocol will serve as a control study for protocol # 90-M-0088.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers participating in this study will be women meeting the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Between the ages of 18 and 50 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
        Not pregnant,&#xD;
&#xD;
        In good medical health,&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medication free,&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of menstrual-related mood or behavioral disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additionally, we will recruit a subsample of 20 asymptomatic women who will meet all&#xD;
        inclusion and exclusion criteria in this protocol except they will have a history of a past&#xD;
        major depressive episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Finally, a third sample of 10 women who meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
        listed above for this protocol will be recruited to establish the dose range of transdermal&#xD;
        estrogen gel for this and related protocols (i.e., 90-M-0088 and 05-M-0059).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following conditions will constitute contraindications to treatment with hormonal&#xD;
        therapy and will preclude a subject's participation in this protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current Axis I psychiatric diagnosis (with the exception of this women with a past major&#xD;
        depression who will be studied on this protocol);&#xD;
&#xD;
        History consistent with endometriosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of ill-defined, obscure pelvic lesions, particularly undiagnosed ovarian&#xD;
        enlargement;&#xD;

        Pregnancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any woman meeting the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop Criteria (STRAW) for the&#xD;
        perimenopause (129). Specifically, we will exclude any woman with an elevated plasma FSH&#xD;
        level (greater than or equal to 14 IU/L) and with menstrual cycle variability of &gt; 7 days&#xD;
        different from their normal cycle length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NIMH employees/staff and their immediate family members will be excluded from the study per&#xD;
        NIMH policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects taking birth control pills will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects taking diuretics, prostaglandin inhibitors, or pyridoxine (putative treatments for&#xD;
        MRMD) will similarly be excluded from the study, as will patients taking psychotropic&#xD;
        agents (e.g., lithium carbonate, tricyclic antidepressants).&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects will be required to use non-hormonal forms of birth control (e.g., barrier&#xD;
        methods) to avoid pregnancy during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who have an active condition that places them at an increased risk for&#xD;
        osteoporosis will be excluded from this protocol.&#xD;
