      This study will determine whether patients who have been infected with the Lyme bacteria,&#xD;
      Borrelia burgdorferi, and treated with antibiotics still have the bacteria alive inside them&#xD;
      and whether it is causing their symptoms. The information from this study may serve as a&#xD;
      basis for developing stringent diagnostic criteria for Lyme disease and the establishment of&#xD;
      future treatment trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals in the following categories may be eligible for this study: chronic Lyme disease;&#xD;
      chronic Lyme arthritis; seropositive control (are infected with the bacteria that causes Lyme&#xD;
      disease but do not have disease symptoms); recovered control (have been sick with Lyme&#xD;
      disease but were treated successfully and are currently well); control with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (patients with multiple sclerosis); and healthy volunteers. Patients in the chronic&#xD;
      Lyme disease category must be age 13 and above; all others must be age18 and above.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical examination and the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests Includes HLA-typing, a genetic test of immune system markers;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukapheresis Collection of large numbers of white blood cells Whole blood is collected&#xD;
      through a needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it&#xD;
      into its components. The white cells are removed and the rest of the blood is returned to the&#xD;
      body, either through the same needle used to draw the blood or through another needle in the&#xD;
      other arm. (Alternatively, patients will 100 cc (about 7 tablespoons) of blood drawn.);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) Collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, fluid that bathes the&#xD;
      brain and spinal cord). A local anesthetic is administered and a needle is inserted in the&#xD;
      space between the bones in the lower back where the cerebrospinal fluid circulates below the&#xD;
      spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is collected through the needle;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain Imaging of the brain using a strong magnetic&#xD;
      field and radio waves instead of X-rays. During the scan, the patient lies on a table in a&#xD;
      narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. He or she can speak with a staff member via an&#xD;
      intercom at all times during the procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychologic testing;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants may also have a hearing test and urine collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants whose test results are positive for Borrelia burgdorferi will be followed at NIH&#xD;
      at intervals of 3 to 6 months until it is determined whether there is infection. Those who&#xD;
      are infected will be offered treatment with the antibiotic ceftriaxone. Following treatment,&#xD;
      patients will return to the NIH Clinical Center for follow-up visits 1 week after treatment&#xD;
      and again at 3, 6 and 12 months. The lumbar puncture, hearing examination, blood and urine&#xD;
      tests will be repeated at these visits to evaluate the response to treatment, and the&#xD;
      leukapheresis will be repeated for research purposes. Patients whose MRI was abnormal during&#xD;
      therapy will have a repeat MRI at the 3-month, 6-month and 1-year visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants with chronic Lyme disease, chronic Lyme arthritis, seropositive controls and&#xD;
      recovered controls may be reevaluated at intervals of 6 to 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lyme disease has emerged as the leading vector-borne disease in the United States. Despite&#xD;
      how much has been learned about Lyme borreliosis in the past decade, there are still many&#xD;
      remaining areas of uncertainty. One fundamental question is whether persistent signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of disease, despite the administration of what is currently considered to be&#xD;
      adequate antibiotic therapy, are due to ongoing active borrelial infection, to a&#xD;
      post-infectious syndrome, to irreversible sequelae of earlier tissue injury or due to a&#xD;
      condition unrelated to Lyme disease. Reliable objective markers of infection, of clinical&#xD;
      status and of host responses to the organism are required to discern the scope and the&#xD;
      implications of persistent borrelial infection, the effectiveness of current treatment&#xD;
      options, and the development of new therapeutic approaches. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      assemble and follow a well-characterized cohort of patients with post-treatment Lyme disease&#xD;
      syndrome and relevant controls that will yield a prospective database upon which stringent&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria can be established and future therapeutic trials can be designed.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Screening FOR SUSPECTED PTLDS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age greater than or equal to 13 years old, suspect of suffering from Lyme disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS): For the purposes of this study, PTLDS is&#xD;
        defined as occurring in male or female patients age 13 and above who have been diagnosed&#xD;
        with confirmed or probable Lyme disease per CDC definition&#xD;
        (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/lyme-disease/case-definition/2017/). Studyphysician&#xD;
        will review history to confirm probable cases. They have received recommended antibiotic&#xD;
        therapy and have persistent or relapsing symptoms and/or signs for at least six months&#xD;
        after therapy. They also should have no other documented explanation for their signs and&#xD;
        symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lyme arthritis controls: For the purposes of this study, Lyme arthritis is defined as&#xD;
        occurring in an otherwise healthy male or female aged 18 and above who have intermittent&#xD;
        episodes of arthritis involving one or few joint, without any other cause being documented,&#xD;
        and have positive serum antibodies to B.burgdorferi confirmed by Western blot according to&#xD;
        the CDC criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recovered Controls: For the purposes of this study, a recovered control is defined as an&#xD;

        therapy before protocol evaluation) and who are currently asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Seropositive Controls: For the purposes of this study, a serpositive control is defined as&#xD;
        an otherwise healthy male or female aged 18 and above who has positive serum IgG antibody&#xD;
        to B.burgdorferi by Western blot according to the CDC criteria and are asymptomatic and who&#xD;

        antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OspA vaccinated control: For the purposes of this study, a OspA vaccinated control is&#xD;
        defined as an otherwise healthy male or female aged 18 and above who has received at least&#xD;
        two doses of the OspA vaccine for Lyme disease (Lymerix [R]). These controls may have a&#xD;
        positive ELISA for B.burgdorferi but a negative (or unreadable) IgG western blot.&#xD;

        ELIGIBILITY OF SPECIAL POPULATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children: Children 13 years and older are eligible to participate in the PTLDS cohort&#xD;

&#xD;
        Adults who lack capacity to consent: Adults who lack decision-making capacity to provide&#xD;
        informed consent are excluded at screening, and enrolled adult participants who permanently&#xD;
        lose the ability to consent during study participation will be withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NIH staff members: NIH staff may be enrolled if they meet eligibility criteria. Neither&#xD;
        participation nor refusal to participate as a subject in the research will have an effect,&#xD;
        either beneficial or adverse, on the participant s employment or position at NIH. Every&#xD;
        effort will be made to protect participant information, but such information may be&#xD;
        available in medical records and may be available to authorized users outside of the study&#xD;
