      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1984, there were an estimated 28 million Americans ages 65 and over of whom 11 million&#xD;
      were ages 75 and over. Projected growth in both the numbers and proportion of the elderly&#xD;
      population in the United States showed marked increases, attributed primarily to declines in&#xD;
      death rates from cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there has been a decline in the cardiovascular diseases over the past twenty years,&#xD;
      they are still a major source of morbidity and mortality for middle-aged and older&#xD;
      populations. An estimated 2.8 million persons in the United States ages 65 years and over&#xD;
      have coronary heart disease based on the 1982 National Health Interview Survey of the&#xD;
      National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). About 1.4 million are men and 1.4 million are&#xD;
      women. Prevalence of coronary heart disease is 11 percent in this age group: 13 percent in&#xD;
      men, 9 percent in women, 12 percent in whites, and 13 percent in Blacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics of increased blood pressure and serum cholesterol, cigarette smoking,&#xD;
      overweight, and diabetes have been documented as risk factors for cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      among men and women in their middle years. A few studies have found that some of these&#xD;
      characteristics operate as risk factors in older populations whereas the role of cigarette&#xD;
      smoking and cholesterol is uncertain. The influence of hemostatic factors remains to be&#xD;
      determined. The traditional risk factors are present in a substantial proportion of the&#xD;
      elderly population. From the 1983 National Health Interview Survey, it is estimated that 21&#xD;
      percent of persons 65-74 years of age are current cigarette smokers. From the 1976-80&#xD;
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of NCHS, it is estimated that 29 percent of&#xD;
      persons 65-74 years of age are overweight, and 28 percent have a serum cholesterol level of&#xD;
      260 mg/100 ml or greater. From the SHEP pilot study, an estimated 68 percent of persons 65-74&#xD;
      years of age and 75 percent of persons ages 75 and over have hypertension, that is, systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure of 160 mmHg or greater or a diastolic pressure of 90 or greater (based on&#xD;
      average of three measurements) or are on anti-hypertensive medication. Isolated systolic&#xD;
      hypertension is quite common in the elderly population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Framingham Heart Study observed an average annual incidence of new coronary heart disease&#xD;
      events of 20.4 per 1,000 men ages 65-74 years and 14.5 per 1,100 women in that age group,&#xD;
      based on 20 years of follow-up. The Study has shown a marked increase in incidence with age&#xD;
      and significant physical disability from cardiovascular diseases in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another indication of the impact coronary heart disease has on the elderly in the United&#xD;
      States is health care expenditures. Incidence, prevalence, and disability from heart disease&#xD;
      accounted for personal health care expenditures of $8.2 billion for persons 65 years of age&#xD;
      and older in 1980 according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Based on estimated&#xD;
      expenditures for 1983, that figure was nearly $12 billion in that year. These expenditures&#xD;
      are for hospital care, physician and other professional care, drugs, and nursing home care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristically, older people have been limited by chronic illness, increasing disability,&#xD;
      and decreased function. As more people reach older ages, there are increasing demands and&#xD;
      expectations for a more functional life and active retirement. Data, however, are relatively&#xD;
      sparse as to the prognostic characteristics, effects of medical care, and ultimate outcomes&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease in this population. Particular attention will be given to the&#xD;
      accuracy of diagnosis in this elderly population. The use of medical care services by the&#xD;
      elderly and the frequency and nature of pharmacologic, surgical and medical management of&#xD;
      elderly patients will documented. In addition, this study will supply information on the&#xD;
      place of death, suddenness of death and the circumstances preceding clinical events and death&#xD;
      in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study grew out of recommendations of the Working Conference on Coronary Heart Disease in&#xD;
      the Elderly held in Bethesda, Maryland in September 1985 and was reviewed and approved by the&#xD;
      National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council in September 1986.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a population-based, longitudinal study of risk&#xD;
      factors for the development and progression of CHD and stroke in adults over the age of 65&#xD;
      years. Initially funded for six years, it was renewed for another six-year period in 1994 and&#xD;
      is projected to shift to morbidity and mortality follow-up (with no further collection of&#xD;
      examination data) at the end of the year 11 exam in June 1999.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within a population of men and women 65 years and older, the objectives of the Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Health Study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To quantify associations of conventional and hypothesized risk factors with CHD and&#xD;
           stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the associations of non-invasive measures of subclinical disease with the&#xD;
           incidence of CHD and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To quantify the associations of risk factors with subclinical disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To characterize the natural history of CHD and stroke, and identify factors associated&#xD;
           with clinical course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To describe the prevalence and distributions of risk factors, non-invasive measures of&#xD;
           subclinical disease, and clinical CHD and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the most extensive study undertaken by the NHLBI to study CVD exclusively in an&#xD;
      elderly population. It originated from the recommendations of an NHLBI workshop on the&#xD;
      management of CHD in the elderly. Since atherosclerosis is prevalent in the elderly, the&#xD;
      study is focused on factors thought to induce clinically overt disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major emphasis of the study is its focus on subclinical disease, or abnormalities detected&#xD;
      noninvasively without signs or symptoms. Subclinical disease measures in CHS include&#xD;
      ultrasonography of the carotid artery and abdominal aorta, ankle-brachial index,&#xD;
      echocardiography, resting and ambulatory electrocardiography, cerebral magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging, spirometry, and retinal photography. Some of these measures are conducted three&#xD;
      times; at baseline, to assess risk of clinical disease in relationship to subclinical&#xD;
      disease; three to four years after entry to assess change in subclinical disease and risk of&#xD;
      clinical disease in relationship to change; and toward the end of the study, to assess&#xD;
      predictors of subclinical disease itself. Echocardiography, ambulatory ECG, cerebral MRI and&#xD;
      aortic ultrasonography will only be conducted twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives for the current period (1994-2000) are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify risk associations with clinical disease by accumulation of events.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Compare risk estimates in subgroups of participants, such as women vs. men,&#xD;
                African-American vs. Caucasian, those older vs. younger than 75 years, or those&#xD;
                with vs. without prevalent clinical or subclinical disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Compare risk estimates in subtypes of disease, such as fatal vs. non-fatal&#xD;
                myocardial infarction, symptomatic vs. silent myocardial ischemia, or fatal vs.&#xD;
                non-fatal stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Compare estimates of longer-term (5-10 year) vs. short-term (1-3 year) CVD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether presence or progression of subclinical disease (abnormalities detected&#xD;
           noninvasively without signs or symptoms) are better predictors of clinical disease than&#xD;
           traditional risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify determinants of change in subclinical disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identify characteristics of subgroups at low risk for developing CVD (in whom preventive&#xD;
           measures may be unnecessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves four field centers; a coordinating center; and five reading centers&#xD;
      including an echocardiography reading center, an ultrasound reading center, a cerebral MRI&#xD;
      reading center, and a retinal reading center; and a central blood analysis laboratory.&#xD;
      Protocol development began in June, 1988, and recruitment for the first clinical examination&#xD;
      began in June, 1989. Examination of 5,201 participants (2,962 women and 2,239 men) was&#xD;
      completed in May, 1990. Two brief interim examinations were conducted during 1990-1992. A&#xD;
      more extensive clinical examination in 1992-1993 was repeated to assess change in major&#xD;
      subclinical disease; at that time, an additional cohort of 672 African Americans was&#xD;
      recruited to improve minority representation and assessment of black-white differences. Since&#xD;
      1993, annual examinations have focused on a different major non-invasive measure each time,&#xD;
      to reduce participant burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic examinations were completed in June 1999. The cohort will continue to be followed with&#xD;
      bi-annual phone calls to assess study endpoints, including: myocardial infarction (MI),&#xD;
      stroke, congestive heart failure, peripheral claudication, angina, TIA and death. CHS&#xD;
      investigators will also continue analyses of previously collected serum and DNA samples;&#xD;
      analyses of recently collected cross-sectional data and analyses of longitudinal data.&#xD;
      Close-out of reading centers is underway, but the reading center principal investigators will&#xD;
      continue their study involvement, primarily through continued data analyses and publication&#xD;
      of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been extended through May, 2009 for additional follow-up of the cohort and data&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
