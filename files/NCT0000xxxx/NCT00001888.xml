  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a procedure which involves passing a pencil-thin tube into the&#xD;
      lung in order to collect fluid and cells from the airways. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy can&#xD;
      collect cells from the walls of airways by gently brushing them (bronchial brushing). In&#xD;
      addition, squirting small amounts of sterile water in to the airway and gently suctioning it&#xD;
      back into the bronchoscope (bronchoalveolar lavage) collects cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers plan to perform these tests on patients with asthma and normal&#xD;
      volunteers. This research may help to improve the understanding of the processes involved in&#xD;
      airway inflammation and asthma.&#xD;

      This tissue procurement protocol proposes to perform bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar&#xD;
      lavage, bronchial brushings, and bronchial wall biopsies as well as to collect samples of&#xD;
      sputum, exhaled breath condensates and blood, in order to evaluate the molecular mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying the pathogenesis of airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway&#xD;
      remodeling in asthmatic subjects.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Any individual between the ages of 18 and 75 with asthma will be accepted into the study.&#xD;
        Since asthma has a roughtly equivalent prevalence in groups differing in race and gender,&#xD;
        recruitment of study participants will be aimed at selecting a study population which&#xD;
        reflect this diversity. Asthmatic or research volunteers with HIV infection will be&#xD;
        excluded from the study so as not to include patients with HIV-related lymphocytic airway&#xD;
        inflammation. Volunteers will be obtained through the NIH Clinical Center Research&#xD;
        Volunteer Program or other standard channels at NIH.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        ASTHMATICS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be between 18 and 75 years of age, male or female.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The diagnosis of asthma requires a history of intermittent, reversible expiratory flow&#xD;
        limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, patients will have demonstrated evidence of either an abnormal methacholine&#xD;
        challenge or reversible airway obstruction. An abnormal methacholine challenge will be&#xD;
        defined as a decrease in FEV(1) of at least 20% at a PD(20) dose less than 240 micrograms.&#xD;
        Reversible airway obstruction will be defined as an improvement of at least 12% and 200 cc&#xD;
        in either the FEV(1) or FVC folowing bronchodilator treatment. Methacholine challenge&#xD;
        testing will not be performed if the subject has a history of allergy to methoacholine.&#xD;
        Result of testing performed by the subject's primary care provider may be accepted as&#xD;
        evidence of reversible airflow obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For women of childbearing potential, negative pregnancy test prior to study and willingness&#xD;
        to adhere to reliable birth control methods during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Asthmatic research subjects who will only be providing research blood specimens and will&#xD;
        not be undergoing a research bronchoscopy may participate in the protocol by providing a&#xD;
        clinical history that they have asthma and are not pregnant. Documentation of an abnormal&#xD;
        methacholine challenge or reversible airflow obstruction or a negative pregnancy test, for&#xD;
        women of childbearing age, will not be required for donation of research blood specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        ASTHMATICS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of a pulmonary disorder other than asthma (e.g., chronic bronchitis, cystic&#xD;
        fibrosis, HIV-related lymphocytic airway inflammation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of drug or alcohol abuse within the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (to exclude patients with HIV-related&#xD;
        lymphocytic airway inflammation) or hepatitis virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA - RESEARCH VOLUNTEERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Research volunteers will be between 18 and 75 years of age, male or female.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A negative inhalational methacholine challenge as defined bv the absence of a 20% decrease&#xD;
        in FEV(1), at a PD(20) dose of greater than or equal to 960 micrograms (normal bronchial&#xD;
        hyperresponsiveness). Methacholine challenge testing will not be performed if the subject&#xD;
        has a history of allergy to methacholine. Results of testing performed by the subject's&#xD;
        primary care provider may be accepted as evidence of a negative methacholine challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For women of childbearing potential, negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to study&#xD;
        and willingness to adhere to reliable birth control methods during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Research volunteers who will only providing research blood specimens and will not be&#xD;
        undergoing a research bronchoscopy may be included in the protocol without documentation of&#xD;
        a negative inhalational methacholine challenge or a negative pregnancy test if they provide&#xD;
        a history that they do not have asthma and that they are not currently pregnant, for women&#xD;
        of childbearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - RESEARCH VOLUNTEERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Same as the asthmatic exclusion criteria plus a history of asthma.&#xD;
