  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To verify and validate a biodosimetry test for determining absorbed ionizing radiation dose&#xD;
      by analyzing gene expression signatures of blood samples collected from patients treated with&#xD;
      Total Body Irradiation (TBI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order validate the performance of DxTerity's Radiation Biodosimetry Test (RBT) system,&#xD;
      several clinical centers will provide controlled, de-identified blood samples and associated&#xD;
      clinical information to DxTerity Diagnostics (DxTerity). Variations in dose and frequency of&#xD;
      delivery in TBI protocols are expected between the clinical centers and this has been&#xD;
      accounted for in the study design. Samples from up to 200 participants will be collected via&#xD;
      this protocol. Blood samples for this study will be collected from radiation therapy patients&#xD;
      receiving TBI as part of a therapeutic regimen from the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (up to 4 mL per time point) may be obtained at the time of routine blood&#xD;
      collection; participation in this biomarker study will not affect any aspect of patient&#xD;
      treatment. Study samples will be obtained prior to, during, and post-radiation treatment&#xD;
      regimen. Associated clinical information will be collected from the subject's medical record,&#xD;
      as well.&#xD;

        Blood samples for this study will be collected from radiation therapy patients receiving&#xD;
        TBI as part of a therapeutic regimen from the site. Fractionated TBI treatment will provide&#xD;
        a cumulative dose ≥6.0 Gy depending on the specific treatment protocol, or a single&#xD;
        non-fractionated dose between 1.5 and 3.0 Gy.&#xD;

          3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent/assent document indicating&#xD;
             that the subject or a legally acceptable representative (parent(s)/legal guardian) has&#xD;
             been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Diseases treated with HSCT, including malignant and nonmalignant diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Planned fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) as part of clinical care with a&#xD;
             cumulative dose ≥6 Gy or a single dose between 1.5 and 3.0 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who have received chemotherapy within 21 days prior to TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Concurrent chemotherapy with Fludarabine or an investigational product&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Cytokine inhibitor or cytokine-inducer therapy within 30 days prior to and during the&#xD;
             irradiation regimen&#xD;
