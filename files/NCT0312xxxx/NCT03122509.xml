    <intervention_model_description>This will be a Simon two-stage design, phase II study. It will be conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of (1) durvalumab and tremelimumab plus RT in subjects with metastatic CRC who are undergoing RT as standard therapy; and, (2) durvalumab and tremelimumab plus ablation in subjects with metastatic CRC who are undergoing ablation as standard therapy.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Patients will receive 1500 mg durvalumab via IV infusion q4w for up to 4 doses/cycles and 75 mg tremelimumab via IV infusion q4w for up to 4 doses/cycles, and then continue 1500 mg durvalumab q4w starting on Week 16. Tremelimumab will be administered first. Durvalumab infusion will start approximately 1 hour after the end of tremelimumab infusion. The duration will be approximately 1 hour for each infusion. Radiotherapy (RT) will be performed using external beam ionizing radiation as standard therapy in accordance with institutional standard practice. RT will be initiated within 7 days after the first of durvalumab and tremelimumab.</description>
