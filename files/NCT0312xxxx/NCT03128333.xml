  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine whether self-monitoring PA with the RunKeeper app with&#xD;
      additional physiotherapy coaching is superior in improving patients' self-reported&#xD;
      leisure-time PA compared with usual care in cancer patients after 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, prospective, two-armed, randomized controlled trial. Adult cancer&#xD;
      patients and cancer survivors are randomized in one of the two study arms, (Group A)&#xD;
      RunKeeper app + physiotherapy coaching or (Group B) usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the intervention group will be instructed to use the RunKeeper app for&#xD;
      12 weeks to self-monitor leisure-time PA. In addition, patients will be educated about the&#xD;
      health risks of a sedentary lifestyle, inactivity and (when applicable) other unhealthy&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviors (e.g. unhealthy diet, overweight or obesity, sun exposure, alcohol&#xD;
      intake). Benefits of a behavior change, becoming physically active and pursuing a healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle will be explained by a trained physiotherapist who will also coach the patient&#xD;
      during the PA program. The biweekly physiotherapy coaching starts at baseline and will follow&#xD;
      a structured sequence of strategies to change patients PA behavior which will contribute to&#xD;
      the adoption of leisure-time PA in patients daily living, so the program will be optimally&#xD;
      tailored to the patients capabilities and preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to examine the effectiveness of the RunKeeper use with additional&#xD;
      physiotherapy coaching in improving patients' leisure-time PA compared with usual care in&#xD;
      cancer patients as measured by the PASE subscale leisure-time Sum Score at baseline, 6, 12&#xD;
      and 26 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Group A will use the RunKeeper app for half a year to self-monitor leisure-time PA. Besides, patients are requested to activate the 'training reminder' option in the RunKeeper app, which is all explained in a brief user's manual. In addition, patients will be educated about the health risks of a sedentary lifestyle, inactivity and (when applicable) other unhealthy lifestyle behaviors (e.g. unhealthy diet, overweight or obesity, sun exposure, alcohol intake). Benefits of a behavior change, becoming physically active and pursuing a healthy lifestyle will be explained by a trained physiotherapist who will also coach the patient during the PA program.</description>
