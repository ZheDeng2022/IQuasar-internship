      This is a randomized clinical trial comparing Omegaven® treatment with standard of care&#xD;
      (soybean-based lipid formulation, Intralipid®) on bone health outcomes in infants with&#xD;
      esophageal atresia (EA) undergoing surgical repair at Boston Children's Hospital.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Medical treatments and disease pathophysiology can result in prolonged immobilization that&#xD;
      places hospitalized infants and children at risk for serious musculoskeletal complications&#xD;
      including bone loss, fragility fractures, and muscle atrophy. Patients at the highest risk&#xD;
      for inpatient fracture include premature infants, children with cerebral palsy, spinal cord&#xD;
      injury, neuromuscular disorders (e.g., Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Spinal Muscular&#xD;
      Atrophy), lengthy post-operative immobilization such as esophageal atresia (EA), and&#xD;
      prolonged use of parenteral nutrition (PN). These fractures can result in significant&#xD;
      discomfort, increase medical costs, may require surgical intervention, and may result in long&#xD;
      term deleterious effects on musculoskeletal health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (O3PuFA) are important bio-mediators modulating bone&#xD;
      formation and remodeling. We demonstrated that O3PuFA provide protection of bone&#xD;
      microstructure by increasing the number of trabecular elements and subsequently strengthening&#xD;
      the trabecular network in young mice. Human studies suggest an association between O3PuFA&#xD;
      intake and increased bone mineral density (BMD) in adults, and we also demonstrated decreased&#xD;
      fracture risk in infants. O3PuFA may reduce bone resorption by modulating inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines and inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and activity, and may also increase bone&#xD;
      formation by increasing osteoblast differentiation and activity, which may provide the&#xD;
      explanation for the observed skeletal benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we propose the use of intravenous O3PuFA (Omegaven® , Fresenius Kabi, Bad&#xD;
      Hamburg Germany) administration for the prevention of musculoskeletal complications due to&#xD;
      immobilization in infants. Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) has more than 15 years'&#xD;
      experience with this O3PuFA product, having treated more than 250 infants and children.&#xD;
      Omegaven is currently under review by the FDA for treatment of infants with PN-associated&#xD;
      liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a randomized, double blind clinical trial using comparing Omegaven®&#xD;
      administration to the current standard of care (soybean-based lipid formulation, Intralipid®)&#xD;
      on musculoskeletal health in high risk infants with EA admitted at BCH. Infants with EA have&#xD;
      been observed to have dramatic bone loss and a very high fracture rate (over 40%) related to&#xD;
      their prolonged post-operative immobilization; therefore, these patients represent the ideal&#xD;
      model to evaluate this intervention. By targeting this particular patient population at such&#xD;
      high risk for musculoskeletal complications and limited confounding factors, the effects of&#xD;
      our intervention will have the highest probability of being identified if such a benefit does&#xD;
      exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, thirty-two infants with EA will be randomized to either treatment arm&#xD;
      for a four-week treatment period. Safety outcomes will include regular laboratory monitoring&#xD;
      as per routine standard of care. Efficacy outcomes will include (1) computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      of the bilateral distal femurs at baseline and at 4 weeks, which will provide skeletal&#xD;
      outcomes including volumetric bone density, bone geometry, and bone strength estimates, (2)&#xD;
      serum and urine markers of bone turnover, and (3) incidence of fracture in the post-operative&#xD;
      period. All subjects will continue to receive treatments according to standard of care&#xD;
      regardless of group assignment, including physical therapy, nutritionist consult, fracture&#xD;
      precautions, and regular laboratory monitoring per discretion of the primary medical team.&#xD;
