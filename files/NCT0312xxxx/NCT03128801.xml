  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Low back pain is a major problem for public health that affects about 60-85% of&#xD;
      the population at some point in life. Approximately 10-40% of individuals with low back pain&#xD;
      develop the chronic form. International guidelines consider three groups of treatment options&#xD;
      for low back pain: medication, invasive and conservative treatments in which conservative&#xD;
      approach is the most recommended. The European Guidelines for Management of Chronic&#xD;
      Non-specific Low Back Pain recommends that supervised exercise programs should be used as&#xD;
      front-line treatment for chronic low back pain, such as stabilization exercises, conventional&#xD;
      stretching and other active exercise, but there is no consensus on literature on the most&#xD;
      effective form of treatment. However, there is limited evidence about the effects of a global&#xD;
      stretching intervention using self-stretching postures for chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim of this research is to compare the effects of an active global stretching&#xD;
      program (GSP) using self-management of posture versus stabilization exercises on pain&#xD;
      intensity and disability for patients with chronic non-specific low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study is a randomized controlled three arm clinical trial with examiner&#xD;
      blinding. A sample of 100 patients with chronic non-specific low back pain will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to two treatment groups (GSP or Stabilization Exercises). The eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be 18 and 50 years, pain in the last three months and/or pain in at least half of the&#xD;
      days in the past six months, pain located between T12 and the gluteal folds, pain intensity&#xD;
      greater than or equal to three, and score greater than 14% on Oswestry Disability Index.&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed in baseline, immediately after treatment and after one and&#xD;
      three-months follow-up. Sessions will be provided weekly for eight weeks by a single&#xD;
      therapist lasting 40 minutes. The primary outcomes will be pain intensity and low back pain&#xD;
      related disability and the secondary outcomes will be fear avoidance, global perceived effect&#xD;
      of treatment and muscle flexibility. All statistical analysis will be conducted following&#xD;
      principles of intention to treat, and the treatment effects will be calculated using linear&#xD;
      mixed models.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized controlled with two arm clinical trial and examiner blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will consist of 100 participants (both genders) with nonspecific chronic low back&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned through a randomization process involving opaque envelopes&#xD;
      containing cards stipulating one of the three following groups: (1) Global Stretching Program&#xD;
      (GSP) and (2) Stabilization Exercises (SE). An assistant researcher not involved in the&#xD;
      recruitment of patients will allocate the randomly using data generated by a group allocation&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will follow the recommendations described on Consolidated Standards of&#xD;
      Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement to ensure transparency and quality of the findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be supervised by a single physical therapist, who will not be involved&#xD;
      in the assessment of the patients and/or randomization. A second researcher will conduct the&#xD;
      following evaluation in baseline assessment: pain intensity, low back pain related disability&#xD;
      and psychosocial factors using questionnaires validated to Brazilian Portuguese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment and follow-up periods, the use of drugs will be discouraged. Patients&#xD;
      who require rescue medication during the study will be encouraged to register the use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial evaluation and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      After eligibility assessment, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire with&#xD;
      personal data. Subsequently, the psychosocial evaluation will be conducted in accordance with&#xD;
      the recommendations of the Initiative on Methods, Measurement and Pain Assessment in Clinical&#xD;
      Trials (IMMPACT) for chronic pain. The volunteers will be re-assessed immediately after&#xD;
      treatment and after one and three-months follow-up. The main outcome measures will be pain&#xD;
      intensity and low back pain related disability. Secondary outcomes will be fear avoidance,&#xD;
      global perceived treatment effect and muscle flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that patients with chronic low back pain submitted to global&#xD;
      stretching exercises will show greater effects to pain intensity and disability than patients&#xD;
      submitted to interventions separated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain intensity measurement will be accomplished by application of a numerical pain rating&#xD;
      scale - PNRS, which consists of a sequence of eleven numbers from 0 to 10, in which 0&#xD;
      represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. Volunteers will rate their&#xD;
      pain based on these parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess disability related to chronic low back pain, the Oswestry Low Back Disability&#xD;
      Index, adapted to Brazilian Portuguese will be used. The result is converted into a&#xD;
      percentage by multiplying the total score by two. This instrument consists of 10 items, each&#xD;
      of which has six response options. The total score will be calculated by summing up the&#xD;
      points, the largest possible sum being #50. Previous research has found ODI showed&#xD;
      responsiveness to change for patients with CLBP, with MCID of #8 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fingertip-to-Floor Test, Fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire - FABQ and Global Perceived&#xD;
      Effect of Treatment will be assessed pre and post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FABQ adapted for Brazilian Portuguese consists of 16 self- response items, rated on a&#xD;
      seven-point Likert scale from 0 (completely disagree) to 6 (completely agree). The score is&#xD;
      obtained for each separate subscale: one that addressed the fears and beliefs of individuals&#xD;
      in relation to work and one that addressed their fears and beliefs about physical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global Perceived Effect of Treatment is recommended for use in clinical trials of chronic&#xD;
      pain as a measure of the perception of global improvement/worsening regarding to treatment.&#xD;
      Global Perceived Effect of Treatment is an 11-point scale that ranges from -5 (&quot;vastly&#xD;
      worse&quot;) through 0 (&quot;no change&quot;) to +5 (&quot;completely recovered&quot;). A higher score indicates&#xD;
      higher recovery from the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fingertip-to-floor test showed excellent levels of validity compared to the radiological&#xD;
      measurement (r=0.96) and reproducibility (intra and interexaminer - ICC = 0.99). The test is&#xD;
      known for full mobility in the tilted forward position when standing, corresponding to&#xD;
      flexion of the spine and pelvis. It is a measure of relevance in rehabilitation results&#xD;
      probably because patients simultaneously increase the pelvic and lumbar flexion post&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As baseline intervention the investigators will assess pain catastrophising, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression scale and pain self efficacy. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale will be used&#xD;
      to identify anxiety disorders and depression in physically ill patients. The HADS was&#xD;
      translated and validated into Portuguese. Then divided into the anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and&#xD;
      the depression subscale (HADS-D), both containing seven interspersed items. It is composed of&#xD;
      seven items for depression and seven items for anxiety, each item including four response&#xD;
      options ranging from 0 to 3. The cutoff scores are 8 points for anxiety, 9 for depression.&#xD;
      Change in depressive symptoms significantly predicted change in pain severity and intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain catastrophising scale (PCS) will be used to assess catastrophising thoughts. The scale&#xD;
      is composed of 13 items staggered on a Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 5 points. The total&#xD;
      score is the sum of the items divided by the number of items answered, with the minimum score&#xD;
      being 0 and the maximum being 5 for each item. Higher scores indicated a greater presence of&#xD;
      catastrophic thoughts. The total score of the scale could vary between 0 and 52 points. A&#xD;
      recent systematic review found that found catastrophising to be associated with pain and&#xD;
      disability at follow-up in CLBP patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale (CPSS) will be used to assess self-efficacy perception&#xD;
      related to chronic pain, which can be defined as an individual's personal conviction that&#xD;
      they can successfully execute an action to produce desirable results related to living with&#xD;
      chronic pain. The scale has 22 items and was adapted and validated to Brazilian Portuguese.&#xD;
      Previous research suggested that rehabilitation programs for CLBP should target pain&#xD;
      self-efficacy which mediates the relationship between depressive symptoms and pain severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to two possible interventions: GPS and Stabilization&#xD;
      Exercises intervention group. Treatment protocol will be conducted by eight weeks, one time&#xD;
      per week. The session will last for 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain intensity outcome was considered for sample size calculation. A change of at least 2&#xD;
      units on NPRS was considered for analysis. The sample size obtained was 78 (39 subjects&#xD;
      each). The following specifications were considered: α = 5%, statistical power of 90% and&#xD;
      0.61 effect size for F-test. The GPower software was used to calculate the sample size&#xD;
      (GPower 3.0.10 of the University of Kiel, Germany). Thus, to ensure a power suitable and&#xD;
      assuming sample losses, 100 (50 subjects per group) participants will be considered (GPower&#xD;
      3.0.10, University of Kiel, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistician will be given grouped data, but data will be coded so that the statistician&#xD;
      will remain blinded to patients' group allocation and to protect patient confidentiality. The&#xD;
      mean effects of the interventions and the group differences for all outcomes (primary and&#xD;
      secondary) will be calculated using linear mixed models that incorporated terms for the&#xD;
      treatment groups, time (post-intervention and follow-up), and interaction terms (treatment&#xD;
      subgroups and time) as well as psychosocial variables, sex and age as covariates. Secondary&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted using regression models to determine whether baseline scores of&#xD;
      psychosocial variables (HADS, PCS, CPSS) will moderate the effect of treatments. The analyzes&#xD;
      will follow the intention-to-treat principles. For all of these analyzes, IBM SPSS software&#xD;
      package will be used, version 22 (IBM Corp, New York).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 22 (Chicago, IL, USA)&#xD;
      will be used for analysis, and the significance level was established at 0.05.&#xD;
