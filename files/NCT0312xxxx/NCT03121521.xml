      Introduction. Statins are generally well tolerated but not devoid of side effects. Quite&#xD;
      often it is manifested by asymptomatic increase in the level of aspartate and alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase. In such cases patients to administer hepatoprotective drugs, but most of&#xD;
      them used for this purpose are ineffective. The aim of this study was assess the usefulness&#xD;
      of melatonin in counteracting the adverse hepatic events from statins. Methods. The research&#xD;
      program included 60 patients(aged 47-65 years, 41 women and 23 men)with hyperlipidemia taking&#xD;
      atorvastatin or rosuvastatin in dose 20-40 mg daily. The patients were randomly allocated in&#xD;
      two groups. Group I (n=30) was recommended to take the same statin at a standardized daily&#xD;
      dose of 20 mg together with melatonin at a dose 2 x 5 mg, at 7:00 and 21:00. In group II&#xD;
      (n=30) patients took statins with placebo at the same time of the day. Follow-up laboratory&#xD;
      tests (AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, cholesterol, triglycerides) were evaluated after 2,4 and 6 mounts&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;

      Introduction Statins are widely used in the treatment and prevention of lipid metabolism&#xD;
      disorders. They are generally well tolerated but not devoid of side effects. These include,&#xD;
      among others, muscular symptoms, arthritis, headaches, gynecomastia. Myositis and&#xD;
      rhabdomyolysis associated with increased activity of creatinine kinase and serum creatinine&#xD;
      levels are rare but serious adverse events of statin therapy. The risk of these complications&#xD;
      is increased in elderly patients with chronic diseases and in alcohol abusers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, statins cause hepatotoxic effect which is observed in several percent of treated&#xD;
      patients, usually in the first weeks of the therapy . Most frequently it is manifested by&#xD;
      asymptomatic increase in the level of aspartate and alanine aminotransferase. This is usually&#xD;
      a temporary increase, but in some patients the level of these enzymes exceeds 3 times the&#xD;
      normal limit, which is a matter of concern. In such cases, patients expect the decision to&#xD;
      discontinue the treatment or to administer hepatoprotective drugs. Acetylcholine, sylibinin,&#xD;
      phospholipids and other drugs used for this purpose are not always effective. Therefore,&#xD;
      there is still search for alternative drugs for the protection of liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In own study melatonin was used for this purpose because previous experimental studies had&#xD;
      demonstrated that it protected liver against harmful effects of many toxic agents as well as&#xD;
      the consequences of ischemia-reperfusion model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The liver is an organ in which there comes to intensive metabolic and detoxification&#xD;
      processes. In their course large amounts of reactive oxygen species are generated and they&#xD;
      exert a toxic effect on hepatocytes. A complex antioxidant system - in which metabolized&#xD;
      there melatonin (pineal and from other sources) is an important part - prevents that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main melatonin metabolic pathway in the liver is through hydroxylation pathway at the C-6&#xD;
      position by 6-hydroxylase and P450 cytochromes (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2P19, CYP1B1 isozymes).&#xD;
      The 6-hydroxymelatonin, formed in this process, is conjugated with sulphate and glucuronide&#xD;
      to 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate or glucuronide. In this process melatonin and its metabolites&#xD;
      exert high antioxidant activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative metabolic pathway includes melatonin oxidation to N-acetyl-formyl-5-&#xD;
      methoxykynuramine (AFMK) and N-acetyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AMK). The kynurenine pathway of&#xD;
      melatonin metabolism leads to formation of a series of free radical scavengers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, melatonin decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibits&#xD;
      hepatic fibrogenesis. Owing to its multidirectional action in liver, apoptosis and necrosis&#xD;
      decrease, the integrity is protected and regeneration is improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of melatonin in counteracting the adverse&#xD;
      hepatic events from statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods Patients and Data Collection The research program included 30 subjects,&#xD;
      aged 47-68 years, 41 women and 23 men. All women were I the postpostmenopausal period.&#xD;
      Recruitment and diagnostic tests were conducted in the Department of Gastroenterology,&#xD;
      Medical University of Lodz and Outpatient Consulting Clinic &quot;Gastro&quot; in Lodz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study was performed in the years 2012-2016. Therapeutic Procedures After&#xD;
      inclusion into the study, all patients were recommended the same balanced diet with limited&#xD;
      animal fats and simple carbohydrates of caloric content of 1600 kcal. At the same time, they&#xD;
      were recommended to continue the treatment with the same statin at a daily dose of 20 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomly allocated into two groups. Group I (n=30) was recommended to take&#xD;
      statin together with melatonin (LEK-AM, Poland) at a dose of 2x5 mg, at 7:00 a.m. and 9:00&#xD;
      p.m. In Group II (n=30) patients took statin with placebo (LEK-AM, Poland) at the same dose&#xD;
      and time of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up laboratory tests (AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, cholesterol and triglycerides) were evaluated&#xD;
      after 2,4 and 6 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical procedures A written consent was obtained from the patients and the Bioethics&#xD;
      Committee of the Medical University in Lodz approved the study protocol (RNN/45/12/KB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with the principles&#xD;
      of Good Clinical Practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis All parameters were checked for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test.&#xD;
      Wilcoxon's rank sum test was used for the comparison of basal treatment differences between&#xD;
      each liver enzyme level. Comparison of parameters in four time series was calculated using&#xD;
      ANOVA Friedman test. Mann-Whitney U test was used for nonparametric data to perform the&#xD;
      comparison between groups. Calculation were made using Statistical 9.1 Microsoft Co.&#xD;
      software, and statistical significance was established at p&lt; 0,05.&#xD;
