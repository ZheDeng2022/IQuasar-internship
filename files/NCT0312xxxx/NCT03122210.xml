      During acute coronary syndrome, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart&#xD;
      Association recommend oxygen delivery to patients with less than 90% oxygen saturation.&#xD;
      Oxygen therapy in these patients for a duration of at least 6 hours, but also stipulates that&#xD;
      it is reasonable to administer oxygen to all acute coronary syndrome patients during the&#xD;
      first six hours following the presentation. Hyperoxia also has well-established risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (I) that current practices tend to use high oxygen flows resulting in high SpO2 levels during&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (II) there is a high rate of desaturation in patients with acute coronary syndrome and an&#xD;
      automatic adaptation of oxygen flows may reduce this frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (III) that excessive oxygenation targets have no advantage. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      maintaining a SpO2 of 90 to 94% is at least equivalent when compared to higher saturation&#xD;
      objectives (SpO2 of 94 to 100%) with regard to the occurrence of complications in the patient&#xD;
      in acute coronary syndrome . We will use two SpO2 targets with the FreeO2 system, 92 and 97%.&#xD;

      Hypoxemia is a common problem encountered during acute coronary syndrome. During acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association&#xD;
      recommend oxygen delivery to patients with less than 90% oxygen saturation. Oxygen therapy in&#xD;
      these patients for a duration of at least 6 hours , but also stipulates that it is reasonable&#xD;
      to administer oxygen to all acute coronary syndrome patients during the first six hours&#xD;
      Following the presentation. However, the studies underlying these guidelines are few and far&#xD;
      between, most of them having been done more than forty years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperoxia also has well-established risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (I) that current practices tend to use high oxygen flows resulting in high SpO2 levels during&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (II) there is a high rate of desaturation in patients with acute coronary syndrome and an&#xD;
      automatic adaptation of oxygen flows may reduce this frequency. This will be our primary&#xD;
      endpoint and will be tested with the use of the automated oxygen delivery system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (III) that excessive oxygenation targets have no advantage. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      maintaining a SpO2 of 90 to 94% is at least equivalent when compared to higher saturation&#xD;
      objectives (SpO2 of 94 to 100%) with regard to the occurrence of complications in the patient&#xD;
      in acute coronary syndrome . We will use two SpO2 targets with the FreeO2 system, 92 and 97%.&#xD;
