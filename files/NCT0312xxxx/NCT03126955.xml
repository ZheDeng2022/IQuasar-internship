  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our team recently described a new medical condition called HELPS&#xD;
      (Hemi-Laryngo-Pharyngeal-Spasm) syndrome(1). HELPS syndrome is a condition caused by a blood&#xD;
      vessel pinching the nerve rootlets of the Vagus nerve (Xth cranial nerve). It is similar to&#xD;
      the well recognized hemifacial spasm syndrome but the nerve involved is the Vagus instead of&#xD;
      the Facial nerve. As a result, the symptoms are episodic throat contractions and cough. The&#xD;
      throat contractions become stronger and more frequent over the years and can lead to a&#xD;
      terrifying inability to breath. Patients may end up intubated in the Emergency Department or&#xD;
      with a tracheostomy because of inability to breath during a severe episode. Some but not all&#xD;
      of our patients can tell which side of their throat (left or right) contracts during a&#xD;
      choking episode. In between these choking episodes, patients feel normal. A surgical cure for&#xD;
      these patients is Microvascular Decompression of the Xth nerve.&#xD;

      The treatment of HELPS syndrome begins with the correct diagnosis. Some patients are able to&#xD;
      localize the side of their symptoms in HELPS syndrome while others are unable to. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to prospectively study which of the following is the diagnostic test of&#xD;
      choice for patients who are unable to localize their HELPS: 1. CISS MRI sequences, 2.&#xD;
      interictal laryngoscopy, and 3. unilateral and contralateral Botox injections separated&#xD;
      3-months apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both neuroradiologist and otolaryngologist will be blinded to the outcome of surgery and be&#xD;
      asked &quot;based on your diagnostic test, which side do you believe we should perform MVD&#xD;
      surgery?&quot;&#xD;
