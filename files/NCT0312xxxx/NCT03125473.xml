    <textblock>
      A Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging trial to determine the safety of different&#xD;
      dosing regimens an adenoviral-vector based norovirus vaccine (VXA-G1.1-NN) expressing GI.1&#xD;
      VP1 and dsRNA adjuvant administered orally to healthy volunteers&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will enroll approximately 60 subjects in four cohorts of 15 subjects each. The&#xD;
      cohorts may be enrolled and run in parallel or overlap; they do not have to run sequentially.&#xD;
      The dosing for each cohort will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Multiple low dose on Days 1 and 8 Cohort 2: Multiple low dose on Days 1, 3 and 5&#xD;
      Cohort 3: Multiple low dose on Days 1 and 29 Cohort 4: Multiple high dose on Days 1 and 29&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects receiving study drug will have safety and immunogenicity assessments completed&#xD;
      through Study Day 57 following their initial vaccination. Subjects may also be evaluated for&#xD;
      persistent immunogenicity at Day 180 and will be followed for safety for 12 months following&#xD;
      initial vaccination (Study Day 365).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 1 thru Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects will have blood samples collected on study days 7, 28, and 57 following their initial vaccination for cellular and humoral immune function assays (i.e., production of vaccine specific blocking and neutralizing antibodies, formation of vaccine specific antibody secreting and memory cells, etc.) to assess the effect of the different dosing schedules on the immunogenicity of the VXA-G1.1-NN vaccine. Subjects may also be evaluated for persistent immunogenicity at Day 180 (optional).</description>
