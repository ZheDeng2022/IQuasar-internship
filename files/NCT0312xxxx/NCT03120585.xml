      The object of this study is to determine the best way to care for infants with respiratory&#xD;
      distress. The investigators are testing a method of feeding fluids to infants with&#xD;
      respiratory distress in amounts similar to what healthy breastfed babies eat when they are&#xD;
      feeding on demand, and comparing this method to the current standard of care for feeding&#xD;
      fluids to infants with respiratory distress. These methods of feeding fluids to the study&#xD;
      infants will continue until the infants are able to feed normally by mouth. The study will&#xD;
      include about 400 infants across five sites in the United States, Chile and Argentina.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants with respiratory distress syndrome will be enrolled within the first twelve hours of&#xD;
      life, and randomly assigned to one of two groups: the first group will receive the&#xD;
      interventional fluid management method, and the second (the control group) will receive the&#xD;
      current standard of care for fluid management. To standardize respiratory care across all&#xD;
      five study sites, a computer-based algorithm for respiratory support management based on&#xD;
      objective markers of respiratory distress will guide clinician management decisions. However,&#xD;
      each infant's medical team will make all final decisions on respiratory treatment and IV&#xD;
      fluid management. Any study infant who experiences dehydration and/or low blood sugar during&#xD;
      the course of the study will be removed from the study and be treated for the condition.&#xD;

    <description>Fluid management intervention is fluid restriction to 60 mL/kg/day on Day of Life (DOL) 1 for preterm and 40 mL/kg/day on DOL 1 for term neonates, calculated as total of IV and enteral fluid intake. Infants randomized to low infusion with be placed on 10% dextrose and the Infant will be monitored by obtaining serum glucose levels by point of care testing. Glucose infusion rates (GIR) would be calculated to the corresponding serum glucose and recorded. After 24 hours, infusion rate will be increased to 60ml/kg/d providing minimum GIR &gt;4mg/kg/d. . Total fluid intake will be increased by 20 mL/kg/day until 150 mL/kg/day .</description>
