      Our aim is to evaluate and compare the pain relief of estradiol valerate/dienogest and&#xD;
      ethinylestradiol/ drospirenone by using doppler indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 nullipara patients with symptoms of severe primary dysmenorrhea (PD) requesting&#xD;
      contraception aged from 18 to 35 were included to the study. Visual analog scale (VAS), the&#xD;
      uterine artery doppler indices including systole/diastole rates ( S/D), pulsatility index&#xD;
      (PI) and resistance index (RI) values were evaluated and recorded in both uterine vessels&#xD;
      before treatment. The 66 PD patients who met the inclusion criteria were divided into 2&#xD;
      groups and 33 healthy controls created Group 1. Group 2 were administered estradiol&#xD;
      valerate/dienogest while Group 3 were administered 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 3 mg&#xD;
      drospirenone. Both VAS scores and doppler indices were repeated after 3 months treatment. The&#xD;
      changes in values were recorded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted in Kayseri Education&#xD;
      and Research Hospital, in Turkey between 2015 and 2016. Nullipara patients with symptoms of&#xD;
      severe primary dysmenorrhea (PD) requesting contraception aged from 18 to 35 were included to&#xD;
      the study. Afterwards, based on computer generated random numbers the patients were allocated&#xD;
      to one of the two study arms; Group2 (Qlarista group) and Group3 (yasmin group), equally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PD was diagnosed clinically. The characteristic of pain was periodic (at least following&#xD;
      3 menstrual cycles), midline, lower abdominal cramps or pelvic colic like pain that starts up&#xD;
      to one day before menses, lasts for the 3 days of bleeding, gradually diminishes over 12 to&#xD;
      72 hours and ends after period. The pain starts generally in 2 to 3 years after menarche with&#xD;
      regular menses (25-31 day). Also absence of pelvic pathology was important in these patients&#xD;
      for diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with history of pelvic inflammatory diseases, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, chronic&#xD;
      abdominal pain, fibroids, obstructive endometrial polyps, cervical stenosis, inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, major abdominal or pelvic surgery, intrauterine&#xD;
      device and congenital obstructive müllerian malformations were excluded. Smoking,&#xD;
      overweighted (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30) patients that oral contraceptive pills (OCP)&#xD;
      treatment was contraindicated were also excluded. Additionally, patients enrolled&#xD;
      simultaneously into other studies that require drug intake or otherwise prevent compliance&#xD;
      with protocol were out of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain, 'worst pain I have ever&#xD;
      felt') was applied to patients on the first day of menstrual cycle. Patients with VAS score&#xD;
      of between 7 to10 and PD accompanied with vomiting, nausea, dizziness, headache, nervousness,&#xD;
      diarrhea and fatigue were classified as severe PD. The ages (years), BMI (kg/m2), length of&#xD;
      menstrual cycle (days) and length of bleeding (days) and demographic data of patients were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment during menstruation period all ultrasound examinations were carried out&#xD;
      trans abdominally with Toshiba Xario machine ( Shimoishigami, Otawara-shi, Tochigi 324-8550,&#xD;
      Japan) equipped with a 2.8-7 megahertz (MHz) transducer by a single radiologist (Ş.T.) The&#xD;
      uterine artery blood flows were measured at the lateral level of uterine artery neighbour to&#xD;
      cervicocorporeal junction in both sides (right and left). Doppler indices including&#xD;
      systole/diastole rates ( S/D), pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI) values were&#xD;
      evaluated and recorded in both uterine vessels. Both VAS scores and doppler indices were&#xD;
      repeated after 3 months treatment. The changes in values were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to previously published studies and after power analyses, when α error and β error&#xD;
      were considered, respectively, as 0.05 and 0.20, with 80% power number of patients for each&#xD;
      group were determined as minimum 30. Power Analysis and Sample Size Software (PASS) 11&#xD;
      software (NCSS, Kaysville, USA) was used to perform these analyses. Regarding dropout rates&#xD;
      (40 % -50 %) in similar studies over the treatment period we planned to include 100 patients&#xD;
      with PD and 40 healthy controls. The PD patients who met the inclusion criteria were divided&#xD;
      into 2 groups. Patients in Group 2 were administered estradiol valerate/dienogest (Qlarista;&#xD;
      Bayer HealthCare Berlin, Germany). Qlarista consists of 28 tablets (including 2 tablets of&#xD;
      3mg estradiol valerate, 5 tablets of 2mg estradiol valerate plus 2mg dienogest, 17 tablets of&#xD;
      2mg estradiol valerate plus 3mg dienogest, 2 tablets of 1mg estradiol valerate and 2 non&#xD;
      hormonal tablets as placebo, respectively). Patients in Group 3 were administered 0.03 mg&#xD;
      ethinylestradiol and 3 mg drospirenone (21 tablets) (Yasmin; Bayer HealthCare Berlin,&#xD;
      Germany). Patients were randomly administered to the 2 treatments in a 1:1 ratio. Instead of&#xD;
      relieving, patients were not allowed to use rescue medication (NSAI drugs) to prevent&#xD;
      menstruation related pelvic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the&#xD;
      ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964&#xD;
      Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Ethics&#xD;
      approval for the study was obtained from Erciyes University Hospital (protocol&#xD;
      number:2014/290). Informed consent was obtained from all patients who included in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses were performed using the SPSS for Windows 21.0 (SPSS Inc. USA) software package.&#xD;
      The normality of distribution for variables was assessed using the Shapiro Wilk test. Data&#xD;
      was presented as means ± standart deviation (SD) for continuous variables. To assess the&#xD;
      differences in variables between groups, the independent t test was used. As the results did&#xD;
      not have a normal distribution, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U-test and Bonferroni correction&#xD;
      was used in the comparisons between the groups. For comparison, the Wilcoxon test was applied&#xD;
      to the results (VAS scores, Doppler flow parameters) before and after receiving therapy. For&#xD;
      all comparisons, the P &lt; 0.05 value was determined as statistically significant.&#xD;
