  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional models of smoking cessation focus on delivering advice and counseling to quit and&#xD;
      providing assistance to patients ready to quit smoking, but do not actively intervene with&#xD;
      patients who are not ready to quit (NRTQ). This abrupt cessation approach is often not an&#xD;
      appealing option to those not ready to quit, however, a reduction approach can seem more&#xD;
      attainable and engaging. In response to this need, this smoking cessation intervention has&#xD;
      been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is part of a pilot study to assess the feasibility of introducing a NRTQ&#xD;
      intervention in a primary care setting. This study will also assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      increasing the number of smoking reduction interventions delivered, provider confidence and&#xD;
      satisfaction, relative to control practice. Outcomes will be assessed by a pre-survey and a&#xD;
      three-month follow-up survey, administered to all study participants. All study participants&#xD;
      will also be asked to fill out brief NRTQ consult forms for each NRTQ patient they encounter&#xD;
      for a two-week period. Additionally, participants randomized to the intervention arm will&#xD;
      receive training, and access to tools and resources.&#xD;

      3.0 HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED The intervention program will be feasible to introduce into&#xD;
      primary care practices. The intervention program will also be effective in increasing the&#xD;
      number of smoking reduction interventions delivered and provider confidence, relative to&#xD;
      control practice. Providers in the intervention condition will be satisfied with the&#xD;
      intervention and tools provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 RELEVANCE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE TREATMENT OF NICOTINE DEPENDENCE The Ministry of&#xD;
      Health and Long Term care recently published an updated action plan on smoking cessation in&#xD;
      Ontario (24). This action plan focuses on smoking prevention and cessation rather than harm&#xD;
      reduction in smokers not ready to quit, which accounts for the majority of smokers in Ontario&#xD;
      (24). Previous studies have demonstrated that smoking reduction strategies employing NRT can&#xD;
      lead to smoking cessation in smokers not yet ready to quit (12). This pilot study aims to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of introducing a multi-component intervention program for primary&#xD;
      care providers to target the unmotivated to quit smoker. If successful it will inform a&#xD;
      larger trial throughout the OMSC platform to further evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      smoking cessation through reduction approach. This might result in a shift in smoking&#xD;
      cessation culture in Canada to include harm reduction as an approach to engage the smoker who&#xD;
      is not ready to quit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 METHODS TO BE USED 5.1 Design A two-armed, cluster randomized controlled pilot study will&#xD;
      be conducted. Primary care practices will be randomized to one of two study arms: the&#xD;
      'control' group or the 'intervention' group. Ten primary care practices will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the two arms (5 practices per arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design schema and timeline for the collection of outcome data and intervention&#xD;
      activities is presented in Appendix A -- Study Flow Diagram and Timeline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Setting and Participants Ten primary care practices (5 per study arm) from the existing&#xD;
      Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation (OMSC) primary care network will be recruited from within&#xD;
      the province of Ontario, over a 3-month recruitment period. We will recruit ≥ 40 Medical&#xD;
      Doctors (MD), Nurse Practitioners (NP), Registered Nurses (RN), and pharmacists for&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Procedures 5.3.1 Recruitment of OMSC primary care practices A study invitation letter&#xD;
      [Appendix C -- Study Invitation Letter] will be emailed to OMSC partner sites [Appendix B --&#xD;
      Participant Recruitment Email] located in the Champlain, South East, or Central East Local&#xD;
      Health Integration Networks (LHINs), addressed to the lead physician, executive director or&#xD;
      clinic manager. A member of the research team will place a follow-up phone call approximately&#xD;
      one week later to inquire about the interest in study participation [Appendix D -- Telephone&#xD;
      Script]. Once they have agreed to take part in the study, an email will be sent to all&#xD;
      eligible providers within that clinic, asking them to take part in the study [Appendix E --&#xD;
      Provider Recruitment Email] with an attached invitation letter [Appendix F -- Study&#xD;
      Invitation Letter for Providers]. All primary care providers from eligible participating&#xD;
      practices will provide informed consent [Appendix G -- Telephone Script for Obtaining Verbal&#xD;
      Consent].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who wish to withdraw from the study after being consented must provide a letter&#xD;
      to the PI [Appendix H -- Participant Withdrawal Letter].&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we are unable to recruit all ten primary care practices within the above-mentioned Local&#xD;
      Health Integrated Networks (LHINs), we will expand recruitment to all LHINs within Ontario&#xD;
      [Appendix Q-Eligible Sites for Expansion].&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.2 Allocation to treatment A two-armed, cluster randomized controlled pilot study will be&#xD;
      conducted. Primary care practices will be randomized to one of two study arms: the 'control'&#xD;
      group or the 'intervention' group. Randomization will be performed by the UOHI research&#xD;
      methods group who will not be directly involved in the study. Primary care clinics will not&#xD;
      be blind to the group assignment however the investigator responsible for statistical&#xD;
      analysis will remain blinded to group assignment. The Ottawa Health Science Network Research&#xD;
      Ethics Board (OHSN-REB) will approve this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.3 Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.3.1 Pre- and Post-Assessment Survey At baseline, participating primary care providers&#xD;
      will complete a brief study questionnaire, which will document demographic characteristics of&#xD;
      providers (age, gender, practice model, geographic location), provider knowledge and&#xD;
      confidence in addressing smoking cessation with patients not ready to quit, and assess each&#xD;
      provider's current practice with NRTQ patients. These surveys will be mailed to a contact&#xD;
      person at the clinic, who will distribute and collect the surveys to return them to the&#xD;
      Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation [Appendix K -- Pre-Survey Instructions]. At the 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up, providers will also complete a second survey which will re-assess provider&#xD;
      confidence and satisfaction with the intervention program [Appendix I -- Pre and Post&#xD;
      Provider Surveys]. These surveys will again be mailed out to a contact person at the clinic,&#xD;
      who will distribute and collect the surveys to return to the Ottawa Model for Smoking&#xD;
      Cessation [Appendix L -- Post-Survey Instructions].&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.3.2 Not Ready to Quit (NRTQ) Consult Form At the 3-month follow-up, providers will&#xD;
      complete a brief consult form [Appendix J -- Tools and Resources] for a two week period which&#xD;
      will document the number of smoking reduction interventions completed with NRTQ patients. The&#xD;
      consult form will be provided to both the control and intervention groups, and a chart audit&#xD;
      will assess the number of smoking reduction interventions provided. The consult forms will be&#xD;
      mailed to a contact person at the clinic who will distribute and collect the packages of&#xD;
      forms, and return them to the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation [Appendix M -- NRTQ Consult&#xD;
      Form Instructions]. The packages will also contain a letter for providers with instructions&#xD;
      on how to complete the forms, as well as a form indicating when they started and completed&#xD;
      NRTQ Consult Forms [Appendix N -- NRTQ Provider Instruction].&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.4 Group Comparators 5.3.4.1 Intervention group The intervention program will focus on the&#xD;
      sub-population of tobacco users who report they are not ready/motivated to quit smoking in&#xD;
      the next 30 days but are willing to cut back on smoking over the next 3 months. All providers&#xD;
      randomized to this group will receive a 2-hour Continuing Medical Education (CME)/Group&#xD;
      Learning (GLS) training session on the smoking reduction intervention model. The CME/ GLS&#xD;
      will be delivered by a peer primary care physician. To support delivery of the reduction&#xD;
      program in primary care settings, providers in the intervention group will receive a not&#xD;
      ready to quit (NRTQ) consult form, provider resource, and patient handout which may be&#xD;
      integrated into EMR systems as appropriate. [Appendix J -- Tools and Resources]&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.4.2 Control group Clinics randomized to the control group will not be exposed to the&#xD;
      intervention program. Providers in this group however receive the NRTQ consult form for data&#xD;
      collection purposes [Appendix J -- Tools and Resources].&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4.1 Participation rate (i.e. Practitioner recruitment). The study will evaluate the number&#xD;
      of providers who agree to participate divided by the total number of providers who are sent&#xD;
      an invitation letter. By measuring participation rate, it will inform recruitment for a&#xD;
      larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4.2 NRTQ consult completion rate. The number of NRTQ consults completed per physician in&#xD;
      the intervention group and the control group will be evaluated and compared. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that providers that have received the intervention will have a higher NRTQ&#xD;
      consult completion rate. This will also evaluate the uptake of the NRTQ consult form by&#xD;
      health care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4.3 The number of reduction interventions provided by providers. A chart audit of both the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups will measure the number of reduction interventions provided&#xD;
      in the NRTQ population. This will assess the feasibility of this intervention in primary care&#xD;
      as well as act as a surrogate to inform a larger trial of the receptiveness patients have to&#xD;
      a smoking intervention when they are NRTQ. A chart audit instruction sheet and documentation&#xD;
      form will be faxed to a contact person at the clinic who will record the total number of NRTQ&#xD;
      patients seen by each participating provider during their respective two-week period. The&#xD;
      clinic contact person will return the form via fax to the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation&#xD;
      [Appendix R - Number of Patients NRTQ].&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4.4 Provider confidence in addressing tobacco use among patients NRTQ. Provider confidence&#xD;
      will be measured in a pre and post intervention surveys completed by participating health&#xD;
      care providers in both the intervention and control groups. This will evaluate if providing a&#xD;
      2-hour Continuing Medical Education (CME)/Group Learning (GLS) training session on the&#xD;
      smoking reduction intervention model will alter provider confidence in intervening in the&#xD;
      NRTQ population and help inform a larger study. If provider confidence is not affected by the&#xD;
      NRTQ CME/GLS, the intervention will need to be re-evaluated prior to a larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4.5 Provider satisfaction with the smoking reduction intervention program. Provider&#xD;
      satisfaction with the smoking reduction intervention program will be assessed in the&#xD;
      intervention group only. Summary statistics on provider satisfaction will help inform a&#xD;
      larger study as well as identify if the intervention is acceptable for primary health care&#xD;
      providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5 Sample size As this is a feasibility study, the sample size was dictated by available&#xD;
      resources. We plan to recruit five sites per study arm, and a minimum of four providers per&#xD;
      site, giving a minimum total of 40 health care providers from which to generate the estimates&#xD;
      of intervention efficacy (defined as the number of reduction interventions performed,&#xD;
      excluding dedicated smoking cessation visits and unscheduled visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.6 Statistical analysis For the primary data analyses, we will compare the mean number of&#xD;
      NRTQ consults between groups using a t-test that incorporates a variance inflation factor to&#xD;
      account for the effect of clustering. If there are relevant baseline differences between&#xD;
      groups, we will use Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to account for clustering and&#xD;
      co-variates. Similar analytics will be applied for comparing confidence levels between the&#xD;
      two groups. Summary statistics will be calculated for provider satisfaction with the&#xD;
      intervention in the smoking reduction group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. 7 Potential problems and possible approaches for overcoming them There may be concerns&#xD;
      about the feasibility of primary care practice and provider recruitment, the completion rate&#xD;
      for the experimental intervention and loss-to-follow-up. Our research team has extensive&#xD;
      experience conducting clinical trials of smoking cessation interventions (5, 6, 15). There&#xD;
      are presently 31 eligible primary care practices in the Champlain, South East, and Central&#xD;
      East LHINs [Appendix O -- Eligible Primary Care Practices], within the province of Ontario,&#xD;
      which suggests we will be able to recruit the required sample size of ten primary care&#xD;
      practices with relative ease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.8 Ethical issues relating to the involvement of human subjects Trial design and conduct has&#xD;
      been informed by Good Clinical Practice (GCP), an international ethical and scientific&#xD;
      quality standard for designing, conducting, recording and reporting trials that involve the&#xD;
      participation of human subjects. Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that&#xD;
      the rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects are protected, consistent with the&#xD;
      principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical trial&#xD;
      data are credible. The final study protocol will be reviewed and approved by the Ottawa&#xD;
      Health Science Network Research Ethics Board REB. The trial will be reported in accordance&#xD;
      with CONSORT guidelines for cluster randomized trials (23), and will be registered with&#xD;
      clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;

A reduction intervention is tracked by the provider using the &quot;Not Ready to Quit&quot; consult form. The language &quot;reduction&quot; is important to keep in our study because the word &quot;change&quot; is not specific enough. We are measuring the amount of reduction smoking cessation interventions specifically - meaning gradual cessation as compared to abrupt cessation.</description>
