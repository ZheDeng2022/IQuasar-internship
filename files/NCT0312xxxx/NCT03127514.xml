  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CENTAUR trial was a 2:1 (active:placebo) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      Phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AMX0035 for the treatment of ALS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMX0035 is a combination therapy designed to reduce neuronal death through blockade of key&#xD;
      cellular death pathways originating in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This&#xD;
      clinical trial is designed to demonstrate that treatment is safe, tolerable, and able to slow&#xD;
      decline in function as measured by the ALSFRS-R. The trial will also assess the effects of&#xD;
      AMX0035 on muscle strength, vital capacity, and biomarkers of ALS including markers of&#xD;
      neuronal death and neuroinflammation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in slope of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) over treatment duration. The ALSFRS-R consists of 12 items across 4 subdomains of function (bulbar, fine motor, gross motor, and breathing) with each item scored on a scale from 0 (total loss of function) to 4 (no loss of function). Total scores range from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating better function.</description>

    <measure>Accurate Testing of Limb Isometric Strength (ATLIS) Total Score Change</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ATLIS device assess the isometric muscle strength of six upper-limb and six lower-limb muscle groups. At least two trials are performed for each muscle group to assess change in rate of decline of isometric muscle strength over treatment duration. Values are standardized to the percentage of predicted normal strength based on sex, age, weight, and height. Results are presented as percent of predicted normal.</description>

    <measure>Change in Plasma Levels of Phosphorylated Axonal Neurofilament H Subunit (pNF-H)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neuronal degeneration releases phosphorylated axonal neurofilament H subunit (pNF-H) into the cerebrospinal fluid and subsequently the blood and is thought to be a potential biomarker of motor neuron degeneration; elevated plasma levels of pNF-H are presumed to correlate with neuronal injury. Change in levels of plasma pNF-H were measured from baseline to week 24</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Decline in Slow Vital Capacity (SVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory muscle function was assessed according to slow vital capacity (SVC). SVC was measured in an upright position for at least three trials per assessment. SVC volumes were standardized to the percentage of predicted normal value based on age, sex, and height.</description>

    <measure>Death, Tracheostomy, and Hospitalization</measure>

    <description>The composite outcome was defined as death, a death-equivalent event (which consisted of only tracheostomy in one participant in this trial), or hospitalization, whichever occurred first; there were no instances of permanent ventilation delivered by noninvasive means in the study.</description>
