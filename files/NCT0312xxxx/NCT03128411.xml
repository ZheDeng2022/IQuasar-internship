CCyR is based on the prevalence of Philadelphia chromosome positive metaphases among cells in metaphase on a bone marrow sample. CCyR was defined as absence of detectable Philadelphia chromosome positive cells. CCyR achieved when there was &quot;0&quot; percentage of Philadelphia chromosome positive metaphases among cells in a bone marrow sample when at least 20 metaphases from a bone marrow sample were analyzed or when MMR was achieved if no bone marrow analysis was performed. Cumulative incidence method was used for analysis.</description>

    <description>CHR is based on peripheral blood assessments (complete blood count including 5-part differential, platelet count, absolute neutrophil count), and clinical assessments of extra medullary disease. CHR criteria: WBC &lt;=10*10^9/L, basophils &lt;5% in blood, no myelocytes, promyelocytes, myeloblasts in the blood differential, platelet count &lt;450* 10^9/L, spleen non-palpable.</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants with transformation to AP and blast phase (BP) at Week 48. Transformation to accelerated phase or to blast phase CML defined as the time from first dose to the first date of transformation to accelerated phase or to blast phase CML. The transformation to accelerated phase or to blast phase was counted while participants were on treatment up to 28 days after last dose. Participants without transformation were censored at the last hematologic assessment. Cumulative incidence method was used for analysis.</description>

          <title>Probability of Maintaining Major Molecular Response (MMR) at Week 48</title>
          <description>Probability of MMR: % of participants with MMR who were still achieving MMR. MMR: time from first date of MMR response until first date of confirmed loss of MMR, treatment discontinuation due to progressive disease, or death due to disease progression within 28 days after last dose. Loss of MMR: BCR-ABL/ABL IS ratio &gt;0.1% accompanied by at least 5-fold increase from smallest recorded BCR-ABL transcripts value confirmed by 2 assessments at least 4 weeks apart. An unconfirmed loss followed by treatment discontinuation due to suboptimal response also considered as confirmed loss. Disease progression: progression to accelerated phase or to blast phase. MMR: &lt;= 0.1% BCR-ABL transcripts value on IS. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used.</description>

            <description>Participants with newly diagnosed CP CML received bosutinib treatment, orally at a dose of 400 mg QD. In treatment phase, participants received bosutinib once daily for up to 12 months, which was extended further to at least additional 24 months (total of at least 36 months) or until end of the study, treatment failure, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. If participants discontinued the treatment phase only then they entered the long-term follow-up phase up to approximately 3 years after registration of the last participant, or until study termination, whichever comes first.</description>

            <description>Participants with newly diagnosed CP CML received bosutinib treatment, orally at a dose of 400 mg QD. In treatment phase, participants received bosutinib once daily for up to 12 months, which was extended further to at least additional 24 months (total of at least 36 months) or until end of the study, treatment failure, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. If participants discontinued the treatment phase only then they entered the long-term follow-up phase up to approximately 3 years after registration of the last participant, or until study termination, whichever comes first.</description>

        <population>PK population included of all enrolled participants, who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and had at least 1 concentration of bosutinib on-treatment. For Day 28, 56, 80: total number of participants analyzed for each time point were sum of &quot;number analyzed&quot; against each categories/levels respectively.</population>

            <description>Participants with newly diagnosed CP CML received bosutinib treatment, orally at a dose of 400 mg QD. In treatment phase, participants received bosutinib once daily for up to 12 months, which was extended further to at least additional 24 months (total of at least 36 months) or until end of the study, treatment failure, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. If participants discontinued the treatment phase only then they entered the long-term follow-up phase up to approximately 3 years after registration of the last participant, or until study termination, whichever comes first.</description>

        <title>Cumulative Incidence of Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) at Week 48</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with CCyR at Week 48. Cumulative incidence of CCyR, was measured from first dose to the first date of CCyR. CCyR is based on the prevalence of Philadelphia chromosome positive metaphases among cells in metaphase on a bone marrow sample. CCyR was defined as absence of detectable Philadelphia chromosome positive cells. CCyR achieved when there was &quot;0&quot; percentage of Philadelphia chromosome positive metaphases among cells in a bone marrow sample when at least 20 metaphases from a bone marrow sample were analyzed or when MMR was achieved if no bone marrow analysis was performed. Cumulative incidence method was used for analysis.</description>
