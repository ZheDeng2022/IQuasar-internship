  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there are differences in treatment outcomes&#xD;
      between traditional voice therapy, performed weekly for a maximum of 6 weeks versus intensive&#xD;
      voice therapy, consisting of 4-6 therapy sessions performed within one day.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of voice therapy is optimal long-term vocal quality and communication function with&#xD;
      minimal recurrence. Traditional voice therapy for dysphonia typically consists of one to two&#xD;
      therapy sessions each week with a single clinician for about 8 weeks. Another approach of&#xD;
      voice therapy is intensive short-term therapy also known as &quot;boot camp.&quot; This approach,&#xD;
      borrows from the disciplines of neurobiology, exercise physiology, motor learning, and&#xD;
      psychotherapy which describe desirable learning and behavior changes influenced by practice&#xD;
      that involves high-intensity overload, variability, and specificity of training. A few&#xD;
      studies have showed that &quot;Boot Camp&quot; model of intensive therapy resulted in comparable gains&#xD;
      in voice quality and vibratory mechanics and may promote better patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While such findings support the notion that intensive voice therapy may enhance voice therapy&#xD;
      outcomes, no study to date has examined patient response to the &quot;Boot Camp&quot; approach to voice&#xD;
      therapy. The investigators will compare the outcomes of traditional, weekly voice therapy and&#xD;
      intensive voice therapy with multiple sessions in one day.&#xD;
