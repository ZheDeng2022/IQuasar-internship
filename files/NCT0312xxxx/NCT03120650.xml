  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scalp acupuncture formed by combining traditional Chinese acupuncture techniques and modern&#xD;
      theories in medical anatomy has been widely used to treat ischemic stroke in China, but&#xD;
      effective clinical trials that verify its efficacy are lacking. This study proposes to verify&#xD;
      the effects of Lu's scalp acupuncture on ischemic stroke by comparing differential&#xD;
      improvement of motor function between conventional rehabilitation alone and conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation with Lu's scalp acupuncture.&#xD;

      A randomized, controlled, parallel, clinical trial. 116 ischemic stroke patients will be&#xD;
      collected with dyskinesia from Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese&#xD;
      Medicine and Huashan Hospital, Fudan University in China. All patients will be equally&#xD;
      randomized into either a control group (conventional rehabilitation) or an experimental group&#xD;
      (scalp acupuncture + conventional rehabilitation). In the control group, patients will&#xD;
      receive conventional rehabilitation according to the Guidelines for Stroke Rehabilitation in&#xD;
      China. In the experimental group, conventional rehabilitation will be supplemented with&#xD;
      oblique acupuncture at approximately 15° and an insertion depth of 25-35 mm in the motor&#xD;
      areas of the scalp. Twisting speed will be 200 times per minute. Acupuncture will be&#xD;
      performed six times per day in 1-minute bouts, with a 4-minute rest following each bout.&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will receive rehabilitation five times per week for 8 consecutive&#xD;
      weeks. The primary outcome will be the difference in Fugl-Meyer motor function score between&#xD;
      posttreatment (4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 6 months of follow-up) and baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes will be differences in the Modified Barthel Index, stroke-specific&#xD;
      quality of life, and stroke syndrome of traditional Chinese medicine.&#xD;
