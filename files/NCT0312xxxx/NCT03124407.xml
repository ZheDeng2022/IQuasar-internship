      This is a study of an over-the-counter, capsaicin-based (0.25%) topical analgesic for&#xD;
      management of osteoarthritis knee pain meeting the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDAs)&#xD;
      Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) guidance for &quot;External Analgesic Drug Products For&#xD;
      Over-the-Counter Human Use,&quot; published in the Federal Register on February 8, 1983 (final&#xD;
      proposed 21 CFR 348). Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria and not meeting the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were randomized into one of four groups: once daily treatment with active product,&#xD;
      once daily treatment with product vehicle (no capsaicin), twice daily treatment with active&#xD;
      product, and twice daily treatment with product vehicle (no capsaicin), all for 7 consecutive&#xD;
      days of treatment. The twice daily treatments were spaced approximately 12 hours apart.&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis knee pain was assessed by the 100 mm visual analog scale. Osteoarthritis knee&#xD;
      pain assessments were done each day for 28 days. Tolerability data were also collected.&#xD;

      This is a study of a over-the-counter, capsaicin-based (0.25%) topical analgesic for&#xD;
      management of osteoarthritis knee pain meeting the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDAs)&#xD;
      Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) guidance for &quot;External Analgesic Drug Products For&#xD;
      Over-the-Counter Human Use,&quot; published in the Federal Register on February 8, 1983 (final&#xD;
      proposed 21 CFR 348). Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria and not meeting the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were randomized into one of four groups: once daily treatment with active product,&#xD;
      once daily treatment with product vehicle (no capsaicin), twice daily treatment with active&#xD;
      product, and twice daily treatment with product vehicle (no capsaicin), all for 7 consecutive&#xD;
      days of treatment. The twice daily treatments were spaced approximately 12 hours apart. Both&#xD;
      knees received study drug treatment but only one knee per subject was assigned as the &quot;study&#xD;
      knee&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis knee pain was assessed by the 100 mm visual analog scale and the response&#xD;
      criterion was a 50% or greater reduction in osteoarthritis knee pain from baseline. Baseline&#xD;
      was defined as the visual analog scale recorded not more than 30 minutes before the first&#xD;
      study drug application (on Study Day 1). For subjects in the once daily (QD) groups the&#xD;
      osteoarthritis knee pain assessments were at 12 hrs after the initial application (during&#xD;
      Study Day 1) and 24 hours (Study Day 2) after the initial application and then once in the&#xD;
      morning on Study Days 3 - 28. For subjects in the twice daily (BID) groups the osteoarthritis&#xD;
      knee pain assessments were at 12 hrs after the initial application (during Study Day 1) and&#xD;
      24 hours(Study Day 2) after the initial application and then once in the morning and once 12&#xD;
      hours later on Study Days 3 - 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability data were also collected as reported burning-stinging pain, erythema and&#xD;
      pruritus at the site of application.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the percentage of subjects who experience ≥50% reduction in osteoarthritis knee pain in the target knee compared with baseline at 24 hours following the first study drug treatment. Subjects in the once daily application group recorded their knee pain in a diary twice: at 12 hrs (± 1 hr) after their initial application and then again within ≤30 minutes before their daily topical application which was to be applied at 24 hrs (± 1 hr) after their previous day's application on all subsequent study days. Subjects in the twice daily application group recorded their knee pain in a diary within ≤30 minutes before each application on all study days. Subjects used a 100mm visual analogue scale when assessing their knee pain.</description>

        <description>To evaluate the percentage of subjects who experience ≥50% reduction in osteoarthritis knee pain in the target knee compared with baseline at 24 hours following the first study drug treatment. Subjects in the once daily application group recorded their knee pain in a diary twice: at 12 hrs (± 1 hr) after their initial application and then again within ≤30 minutes before their daily topical application which was to be applied at 24 hrs (± 1 hr) after their previous day's application on all subsequent study days. Subjects in the twice daily application group recorded their knee pain in a diary within ≤30 minutes before each application on all study days. Subjects used a 100mm visual analogue scale when assessing their knee pain.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With 50% or Greater Pain Score Reduction From Baseline to Day 28 Post Study Drug Treatment.</title>
        <description>To evaluate the percentage of subjects who experience ≥50% reduction in osteoarthritis knee pain in the target knee compared with baseline after 28 days. Subjects in the once daily application group recorded their knee pain in a diary twice: at 12 hrs (± 1 hr) after their initial application and then again within ≤30 minutes before their daily topical application which was to be applied at 24 hrs (± 1 hr) after their previous day's application on all subsequent study days. Subjects in the twice daily application group recorded their knee pain in a diary within ≤30 minutes before each application on all study days. Subjects used a 100mm visual analogue scale when assessing their knee pain.</description>

        <population>The analysis population included all subjects who received at least one application of study drug and reported any pain scores during the study.</population>
