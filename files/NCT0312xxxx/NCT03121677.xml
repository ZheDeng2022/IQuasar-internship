  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma (FL) has a number of effective standard of care therapies; however, FL is&#xD;
      not currently considered curable. Therefore, designing well tolerated therapies without&#xD;
      cumulative and long-term toxicity is critical. This is a pilot safety and feasibility study&#xD;
      that combines a personalized tumor vaccine with nivolumab for the treatment of FL. Patients&#xD;
      who demonstrate progression on this study may be treated with rituximab (or another&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody against CD20) in addition to vaccine therapy with nivolumab at the&#xD;
      discretion of treating physician if clinically indicated.&#xD;
