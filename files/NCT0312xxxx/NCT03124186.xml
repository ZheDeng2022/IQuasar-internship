      This research project addresses a scientifically important question that cannot be answered&#xD;
      by other means. The use of peripheral nerve stimulation has the potential to enhance recovery&#xD;
      in subacute stroke patients with poor functional recovery. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      proposal is to demonstrate that peripheral nerve stimulation combined with intensive motor&#xD;
      training has the ability to further improve hand motor function when compared to intensive&#xD;
      training alone or nerve stimulation alone. The results from this study have the potential to&#xD;
      develop new strategies in neurorehabilitation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the United States. Approximately&#xD;
      70-88% of persons with ischemic stroke have some degree of motor impairment. A major goal of&#xD;
      research in stroke rehabilitation is to harness the ability of the brain to reorganize after&#xD;
      neurologic damage has occurred and thus ultimately lead to successful recovery of function.&#xD;
      Data from animal and human models have suggested that sensory input plays an important role&#xD;
      in motor output, possibly by influencing cortical plasticity. However, in spite of the&#xD;
      advances to date, little is known about the extent to which sensory input in the form of&#xD;
      peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) can be successfully combined to physical training,&#xD;
      especially in poorly recovered subacute stroke patients. The proposed study will evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of sustained PNS coupled with motor training, to improve hand motor function in&#xD;
      subacute stroke patients with severe motor deficit. Our preliminary data in chronic stroke&#xD;
      patients with severe motor deficit demonstrate that motor function can be substantially&#xD;
      enhanced when PNS is paired with motor training. In addition, a separate study in patients&#xD;
      with mild motor deficit receiving motor training alone suggests that the optimal therapeutic&#xD;
      time window to deliver motor training is within the first year after stroke. The improvement&#xD;
      of behavioral motor function was associated with corticomotor reorganization. Therefore, this&#xD;
      study proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of sustained PNS paired with motor training, to&#xD;
      promote functional motor recovery in subacute stroke patients with severe motor deficit. The&#xD;
      central hypothesis is that subacute stroke patients with severe motor deficit receiving PNS&#xD;
      and intensive task-oriented therapy will have improved motor function compared to patients&#xD;
      receiving sham-PNS and task-oriented therapy, and the degree of this behaviorally-measured&#xD;
      effect will correlate with the neurophysiological effect measured by transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation. The investigators plan to accept or reject the central hypothesis by&#xD;
      accomplishing two Specific Aims: 1) test the effect of PNS preceding task-oriented therapy on&#xD;
      hand motor function, and 2) test the effect of PNS preceding task-oriented therapy on motor&#xD;
      map measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation. The long-range goals are: a) to maximize&#xD;
      the restoration of hand motor function after stroke, b) to determine the impact of this&#xD;
      intervention in activities of daily living, and c) collect solid data to prepare for a future&#xD;
      multicenter randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
