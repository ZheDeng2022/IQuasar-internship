      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect on first-year college students of&#xD;
      participation in a 14-week seminar course and residential housing wellness activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      WIN has been designed to enhance student wellness and personal success during college and&#xD;
      after graduation from New York University. The program is grounded in the current&#xD;
      understanding of adolescent and young adult development, neuroscience, and positive&#xD;
      psychology and aims to increase resilience within students by building knowledge and skills&#xD;
      in key areas proven to enhance wellness, including communication, executive functioning,&#xD;
      social support, cognitive behavioral techniques, stress management, emotion regulation, and&#xD;
      sense of purpose. WIN will achieve these aims by teaching this knowledge and skills to&#xD;
      students in a class (&quot;Risk and Resilience&quot;) and via participation in various activities&#xD;
      within a residential Living and Learning Community. Students will not only receive training&#xD;
      and support in establishing healthy exercise, nutrition, and sleep habits, students will also&#xD;
      be taught core components of cognitive-behavior therapy, mindfulness, and organizational&#xD;
      skills training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In tandem with the implementation of WIN,the effectiveness of the program will be evaluated.&#xD;
      A research study will offer benefits: first, it will provide the college with data for future&#xD;
      estimations of student interest to assist in further expanding the scope of wellness; and&#xD;
      second, it will provide the Child Study Center at NYU with the opportunity to explore the&#xD;
      impact of teaching resilience skills to first-year college students and to modify, if&#xD;
      appropriate course content to improve effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A longitudinal study at NYU beginning in Fall of 2017 of 175 first-year students, who are&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of three conditions after consenting to participate in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 participants will be recruited during Spring and Summer of 2017 from the incoming&#xD;
      first-year students who will begin classes in Fall 2017. It is anticipated that of the 200&#xD;
      enrolled via electronic assent prior to the beginning of the fall 2017 semester, some may not&#xD;
      attend NYU and some may rethink the decision to participate and then not follow up with&#xD;
      providing informed consent. As such, there will be over-enrolling via preliminary electronic&#xD;
      assent so that the following enrollment can be achieved:&#xD;
&#xD;
      175 students will be assigned randomly into one of three conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  50 students to Condition 1 (enrolled in the Risk and Resilience course during Fall 2017&#xD;
           and directly encouraged to participate in the Founders Living and Learning Community&#xD;
           wellness activities for the Fall of 2017)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  75 students to Condition 2 (waitlisted to be enrolled in the Rick and Resilience course&#xD;
           until Spring 2018, and not directly encouraged to participate in the WIN Living and&#xD;
           Learning Community wellness activities)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  50 students to Condition 3 (a control group that receives none of the interventions&#xD;
           during the first year). This group will instead receive an online pamphlet that contains&#xD;
           a number of wellness tips and advice for first-year students. Participants have access&#xD;
           to the WIN Living and Learning Community wellness activities in Fall of 2017 and Spring&#xD;
           of 2018, but are not directly encouraged to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progress of these 175 students will be measured at frequent intervals throughout the&#xD;
      first and subsequent years at college, beginning with a baseline assessment battery once&#xD;
      participants provide written informed consent in Fall of 2017, followed by a second survey in&#xD;
      Winter 2018, another survey at the end of the academic year (May 2018), and then annually&#xD;
      thereafter. In addition to collecting demographic factors (age, gender, race, ethnicity, and&#xD;
      relationship status), the study will utilize empirically-based measures that will be&#xD;
      self-reported by the students, using an online survey tool. These measures will capture a&#xD;
      series of attributes that have been demonstrated as being important factors in psychological&#xD;
      well-being, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perceived stress&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depressive symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxiety symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dysfunctional attitudes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk behaviors (smoking, sexual activity, alcohol and drug usage, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coping skills&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interpersonal communication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health behaviors (exercise, nutrition, sleep, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional data will be collected to measure academic achievement, such as grade-point&#xD;
      average and persistence in college.&#xD;
