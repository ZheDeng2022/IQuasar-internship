      This is an open-label, single center, nonrandomized, Phase 1 study to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of using the combination treatment of SHR-1210, gemcitabine and cis-platinum by&#xD;
      recurrent and metastatic NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of SHR-1210 will be assessed by ongoing reviews of clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, physical examination,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), and adverse events. Evaluations of immune safety will also be&#xD;
      conducted (immune-related adverse events (AEs), or labs of autoimmune sera, inflammatory&#xD;
      events, and immunogenicity). Safety evaluations (both clinical and laboratory) are performed&#xD;
      at baseline, before each study treatment, and throughout the study.Tumor response will be&#xD;
      assessed by radiographic examination in screening visit and every 2 cycles after first dose.&#xD;

             chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, concurrent radiochemotherapy and adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy 6 month before first dose are excepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Life expectancy more than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects enrolled must have measurable lesion(s) according to response evaluation&#xD;
             criteria in solid (RECIST) v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate laboratory parameters during the screening period as evidenced by the&#xD;
