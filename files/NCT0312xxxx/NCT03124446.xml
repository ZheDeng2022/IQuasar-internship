    <textblock>
      Mindfulness interventions are increasingly offered to undergraduate students at universities&#xD;
      world-wide, however the evidence base is very limited. The objective is to evaluate effects&#xD;
      of a customized mindfulness intervention (called Mindfulness-Based College) on undergraduate&#xD;
      student health. A superiority randomized controlled trial with parallel groups will be&#xD;
      performed with 30 participants in each arm. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based College or health education waitlist control. Investigators will be blinded&#xD;
      to treatment allocation. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 10 weeks, and six months.&#xD;
      The primary outcome is a college health summary score, including seven evidence-based&#xD;
      determinants of health particularly relevant to college student well-being: body mass index,&#xD;
      physical activity, diet, alcohol consumption, sleep quantity, perceived stress, and&#xD;
      loneliness. Primary intention-to-treat analyses will evaluate whether MB-College vs. control&#xD;
      is associated with the summary score, utilizing generalized linear models. Secondary analyses&#xD;
      will evaluate which, if any, of the seven determinants of health are driving associations.&#xD;

      1. Background and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mindfulness interventions in school- and work-place settings are expanding&#xD;
           exponentially, often with a limited evidence base. Increasingly, mindfulness&#xD;
           interventions are customized to specific populations and health outcomes to increase&#xD;
           intervention efficacy and efficiency. Emerging adulthood and the college undergraduate&#xD;
           experience is a sensitive life course period, with strong peer effects, diminished&#xD;
           parental influence, and compelling opportunities for exploring health behaviors having&#xD;
           sustained effects, including social relationships, sleep patterns, alcohol and substance&#xD;
           use, dietary patterns, and physical or sedentary activities.6 Few mindfulness&#xD;
           interventions focus specifically on this population, but preliminary results are&#xD;
           promising. Specifically, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating effects of the&#xD;
           low time-burden Koru mindfulness intervention showed significant improvements in&#xD;
           perceived stress, sleep, mindfulness and self-compassion immediately following the&#xD;
           4-week intervention, vs. waitlist control. An intensive mindfulness intervention RCT,&#xD;
           customized to enhance physical activity, nutrition, sleep, mindfulness, compassion,&#xD;
           relationships and well-being, demonstrated significant improvements in physical health,&#xD;
           working memory, standardized test performance, mood, self-esteem, self-efficacy&#xD;
           mindfulness and life satisfaction vs. control, at 6 weeks follow-up.8 We developed the&#xD;
           moderate intensity Mindfulness-Based College (MB-College) intervention, which in a&#xD;
           pre/post pilot study showed significant improvements in emotion regulation, diastolic&#xD;
           blood pressure, stress, mindfulness and cognitive performance at 8 weeks follow-up&#xD;
           (Table 1). Overall, early studies suggest potential benefit for college student health,&#xD;
           however these studies require replication, longer term follow-up, and rigorous study&#xD;
           designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective is to perform an RCT to evaluate effects of MB-College vs. health&#xD;
           education waitlist control, on a college undergraduate student health summary score at 6&#xD;
           months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, a superiority randomized controlled trial with parallel groups will be performed&#xD;
      with 40 participants per arm. Participants will be randomly assigned to MB-College or health&#xD;
      education waitlist control. Investigators will be blinded to treatment allocation, including&#xD;
      staff performing assessments, randomization, and data analyses. Participants will be assessed&#xD;
      at baseline, 10 weeks, and 6 months follow-up. Standard CONSORT guidelines will be followed,&#xD;
      including trial registration at ClinicalTrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population inclusion criteria are 18-28 years of age, current undergraduate student&#xD;
      at any university, and English communication. Exclusion criteria follow standard&#xD;
      recommendations, specifically current regular meditation practice, substance abuse, suicidal&#xD;
      ideation, or history of bipolar or psychotic disorders or self-injurious behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited using print medium (e.g. recruitment cards and posters&#xD;
      distributed throughout campuses), distributing advertisement graphics via social media, and&#xD;
      advertisement emails sent to student listservs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is MB-College, which is an 8-week, 9-session curriculum providing systematic&#xD;
      and intensive training in mindfulness meditation practices, applied to health behaviors&#xD;
      relevant to college students. The curriculum (available upon request) is based on the&#xD;
      manualized and standardized Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) developed at the&#xD;
      University of Massachusetts Medical School. The course builds a foundation of mindfulness&#xD;
      self-regulation skills, including attention control, self-awareness and emotion regulation.&#xD;
      It then directs those skills towards participants' relationships with health-related factors&#xD;
      particularly salient in college undergraduates, including physical activity, diet, alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, sleep, stress, social relationships, cognitive performance, and emotion&#xD;
      regulation. Health behavior goal setting, and support for behavior change are integrated in&#xD;
      the curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control condition is a health education wait list control, which participants will be&#xD;
      offered a 30 minute, one-on-one meeting with the MB-College instructor. There, participants&#xD;
      will learn about the MB-College curriculum, and have opportunities to share their&#xD;
      relationship with common determinants of undergraduate student health and performance,&#xD;
      described above. Together, the student and instructor will explore ways the course may assist&#xD;
      in shifting these parts of their lives, as they see best. A deliberate relationship will be&#xD;
      formed with the instructor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is a college health summary score, assessed using the following seven&#xD;
      evidence-based determinants of health particularly relevant to college student well-being:&#xD;
      body mass index (height and weight, directly assessed using standard epidemiologic methods);&#xD;
      physical activity (MET minutes and step counts per week, using validated actigraphy and IPAQ&#xD;
      - International Physical Activity Questionnaire); diet (mean daily fruit and vegetable&#xD;
      consumption, utilizing validated Willet food frequency questionnaire); alcohol consumption&#xD;
      (mean drinks per day, via standard questions from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance&#xD;
      Survey); sleep quantity (mean sleep hours per night, using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index);&#xD;
      perceived stress (validated Perceived Stress Scale score); and loneliness (validated R-UCLA&#xD;
      [University of California Los Angeles] Loneliness Scale score). Specifically, analyses will&#xD;
      assess changes in mean Z-scores of college health summary score, using a single mean health&#xD;
      summary score across the seven aforementioned college health domains. Secondary analyses will&#xD;
      evaluate which of the seven domains are most driving associations. Further primary analyses&#xD;
      will determine if participant-identified health domains to focus on showed improvements in&#xD;
      MB-College vs. control, utilizing the z-score approach described above, but restricting only&#xD;
      to health domains identified by participants as having high readiness to change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes, utilizing the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Science of Behavior&#xD;
      Change Framework and NIH Stage Model for Intervention Development, include measures of&#xD;
      self-regulation hypothesized to be proximal targets to the mindfulness intervention such as&#xD;
      self-awareness (e.g. via validated Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness)&#xD;
      and attention control (e.g. via validated Sustained Attention to Response Task and Mindful&#xD;
      Attention Awareness Scale). Potential effect modifiers assessed include age, race, ethnicity,&#xD;
      and socioeconomic status, as well as adverse childhood experiences utilizing the Adverse&#xD;
      Childhood Experiences Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All in-person assessments will take place at the Brown School of Public Health by trained&#xD;
      research staff experienced in assessing all aforementioned measures. For the estimated&#xD;
      timeline, please see Figure 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratified randomization will be used for intervention allocation, performed using Research&#xD;
      Randomizer (www.randomizer.org). Variables used to create strata include gender and&#xD;
      race/ethnicity. Blinded, simple random sampling will occur within each strata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analytic approach will evaluate whether MB-College vs. control is associated with college&#xD;
      health summary score, described above. Analyses will incorporate generalized linear models&#xD;
      (GLM) with properly chosen link functions, performed using generalized estimating equations&#xD;
      (GEE) with robust standard error estimators. Following &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; principles,&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted on all participants, regardless of intervention completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus groups of participants will take place following MB-College, facilitated by Prof.&#xD;
      Abigail Harrison, who is an experienced focus group moderator and researcher. The goal is to&#xD;
      customize MB-College to the unique needs of this population. NVivo software (QSR&#xD;
      International, Burlington, MA) will be utilized to analyze results in collaboration with Dr.&#xD;
      Harrison.&#xD;
