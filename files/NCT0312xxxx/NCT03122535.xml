    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare 70 and 110 degree side-cut angles on the same patient&#xD;
      undergoing Femtosecond Laser-assisted in Situ Keratomileusis (FS-LASIK).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LASIK has become the preferred corneal procedure to correct certain refractive errors. One of&#xD;
      the major advancements in LASIK has been the introduction of Femtosecond Laser technology for&#xD;
      flap creation. Several studies have compared microkeratome and femtosecond laser technology,&#xD;
      showing superior accuracy and precision of flap dimensions in the latter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Femtosecond Laser technology provides different parameters and settings that can be&#xD;
      changed according to the surgeon's preference. One of such parameters is the side-cut angle.&#xD;
      Some of the most common side-cut angles used today include 45, 70, 90, and 110 degrees.&#xD;
      Previous studies have reported on the visual outcomes of side-cut angles, but head to head&#xD;
      comparisons are lacking. Currently, there are no studies comparing the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      the 70 and 110 side-cut angles in FS-LASIK. Information regarding the outcomes and&#xD;
      complication rates between these side-cut angles will provide an objective measure that can&#xD;
      be used when deciding which one is more suitable in FS-LASIK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One angle will be performed on the right eye and the other on the left eye. The study will&#xD;
      evaluate uncorrected visual acuity, best corrected visual acuity, intraoperative, and&#xD;
      postoperative complications. Performing different side-cut angles on the same individual will&#xD;
      allow a direct comparison of outcomes, minimizing confounding variables.&#xD;
