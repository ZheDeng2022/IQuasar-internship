  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, Phase IIA clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      atezolizumab in combination with paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab in 50 patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. Due to&#xD;
      concerns that corticosteroids may have a negative effect on tumor immunity expected with&#xD;
      addition of atezolizumab to the standard of care regimen, patients will receive premedication&#xD;
      with dexamethasone only for weeks 1 and 2 of the weekly paclitaxel, and then corticosteroid&#xD;
      premedication will be discontinued subsequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have pathologically confirmed HER2-overexpressing breast cancer that is locally&#xD;
      recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic, with measurable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
      Tumor measurements and bone scans will be performed every 9 weeks while patients are on&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
