    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies side effects and best dose of copanlisib when given together&#xD;
      with letrozole and palbociclib and to see how well they work in treating hormone receptor&#xD;
      positive HER2 negative stage I-IV breast cancer. Copanlisib and palbociclib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs, such as&#xD;
      letrozole, may lessen the amount of estrogen made by the body. Giving copanlisib, letrozole,&#xD;
      and palbociclib may work better in treating patients with breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the safety, tolerability and to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in a&#xD;
      metastatic setting of the following combination: copanlisib + palbociclib + letrozole. (Phase&#xD;
      Ib) II. Compare the biological activity of letrozole in combination with palbociclib,&#xD;
      letrozole in combination with palbociclib and copanlisib, and letrozole in combination with&#xD;
      copanlisib by assessing the percentage change from the baseline value in Ki67 expression&#xD;
      after 2 weeks of therapy in non-metastatic breast cancer. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the pathologic complete response (pCR) defined as absence of invasive cancer in&#xD;
      the breast and sampled regional lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the clinical objective response Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) criteria 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess safety and tolerability. IV. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of copanlisib when&#xD;
      given in combination with letrozole, and palbociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Measure the gene expression and/or biomarker changes that may be correlated with or&#xD;
      predict biological, clinical, and pathologic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of copanlisib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE Ib: Patients with metastatic breast cancer receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1&#xD;
      hour on days 1, 8, and 15, palbociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and&#xD;
      letrozole PO continuously on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: After determination of MTD, subsequent non-metastatic breast cancer patients are&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 3 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive copanlisib (MTD) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and letrozole PO&#xD;
      continuously on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive copanlisib (MTD) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, palbociclib PO&#xD;
      QD on days 1-21, and letrozole PO continuously on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days&#xD;
      for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients receive palbociclib PO QD for days 1-14 of course 1 and letrozole PO&#xD;
      continuously on days 1-14. Patients then undergo biopsy. Patients then receive copanlisib&#xD;
      (MTD) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and letrozole PO continuously on days 1-28.&#xD;
      Treatment with copanlisib and letrozole repeats every 28 days for up to 3.5 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.&#xD;
