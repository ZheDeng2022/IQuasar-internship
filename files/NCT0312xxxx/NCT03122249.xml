  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 20% of Americans and 41% of Iowans live in rural or non-metropolitan areas.(1) Lack of&#xD;
      access to providers, long travel distances, and a disconnected health system contribute to&#xD;
      increased distress and lower quality-of-life (QOL) in people with advanced cancer living in&#xD;
      rural areas. (2) In the state of Iowa, 94% of rural residents have high-speed internet&#xD;
      access. (3) The University of Iowa Health Care (UIHC) eHealth eNovation Center has developed&#xD;
      the infrastructure to address the health care access gap in Iowa. The combination of wide&#xD;
      availability of high-speed internet and the eHealth network provides an opportunity to&#xD;
      develop and test interventions that leverage this infrastructure in order to address this&#xD;
      important palliative care gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of an eHealth self-management intervention&#xD;
      for cancer symptom management. The intervention consists of a web-application that provides&#xD;
      tailored educational information about cancer symptoms and a monitoring platform to track&#xD;
      symptom distress and strategies used to manage them. Participants will also receive e-visits&#xD;
      from a research nurse or research assistant via UIHC eHealth and eNovation video platform.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is obtain feasibility data about the intervention for a future RCT&#xD;
      and to evaluate the OASIS intervention with patients living in rural Iowa receiving treatment&#xD;
      for advanced cancer. The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the feasibility of the OASIS intervention to self-manage symptoms of rural&#xD;
           patients with advanced cancer, including a) recruitment and retention, b) use patterns,&#xD;
           c) usability of each component of the intervention (i.e., the e-visit platform and the&#xD;
           web-application), d) acceptability of the intervention and study (i.e., satisfaction,&#xD;
           barriers and facilitators to use, burden); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine preliminary effects of the intervention on self-management behaviors and&#xD;
           symptom severity, symptom distress, and symptom interference.&#xD;

      Overview of study procedures - Participation in the study last for 12 weeks. Phase 1:&#xD;
      baseline data collection and orientation to the intervention (week 0); Phase 2: 8 weeks of&#xD;
      daily tracking on website and weekly eHealth visits from a nurse and two data collection&#xD;
      points (week 4 and week 8); Phase 3: Optional continuation of tracking on website and as&#xD;
      needed eHealth visits from a nurse and final data collection (week 12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the intervention: For a period of eight weeks patients will use the OASIS&#xD;
      web-application daily to help them get better control of their cancer symptoms. In addition,&#xD;
      to daily symptom and strategy tracking, participants will have eight e-visits with the&#xD;
      nurse-coach via the Zoom application through the UIHC eHealth and eNovation Center to&#xD;
      evaluate their progress with managing their symptoms, assess for barriers to implementing&#xD;
      strategies, and offering coaching on how to improve symptom management. Questionnaires and&#xD;
      blood samples will be collected at baseline (week 0) and follow-up (weeks 4, 8, and 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: OASIS web-application. The web-application is a secure web-site developed by The&#xD;
      University of Iowa ITS that contains a number of features participants can use to improve&#xD;
      their ability to monitor and manage their physical and emotional symptoms. The daily check-in&#xD;
      allows participants to keep track of their symptoms and strategies on a day-to-day basis. A&#xD;
      data visualization tool provides visual summary of their symptom distress and strategy use&#xD;
      over time. A symptom library describes the pathophysiology (in lay language) of 16 common&#xD;
      cancer symptoms. A strategy library contains written descriptions and videos of how to&#xD;
      implement 47 common symptom management strategies. The contact nurse-coach feature lists the&#xD;
      next scheduled coaching visit as well as provides a way to request an extra e-visit sooner if&#xD;
      needed. And finally, other resources will provide phone numbers and web links to resources&#xD;
      such as the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, and Patients Like Me. The&#xD;
      personal data participants enter into the OASIS web-application is considered level 3 data&#xD;
      and will be handled according to The University of Iowa policies and procedure (See X.4&#xD;
      Electronic Records). After baseline data collection, the web-application will guide&#xD;
      participants through the web-application to set up their tailored symptom management plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: On the initial login participants will complete an orientation to the intervention&#xD;
      that consists of a video and values exercise. The video will briefly describe how physical&#xD;
      and emotional symptoms develop during cancer and why symptom management is critically&#xD;
      important for patients with advanced cancer. They will then complete a brief values exercise&#xD;
      asking them to think about what is important in their lives. The purpose of the values&#xD;
      exercise is to help participants make the cognitive connection about how cancer symptoms may&#xD;
      be interfering with aspects of their lives they value most.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Next the patient will complete a brief profile (first name, age, gender, type of&#xD;
      cancer, current cancer treatment) and select an image or avatar for their profile. Going&#xD;
      forward computer algorithms that are driven by information provided by the participant will&#xD;
      tailor the experience. For example, the cancer ribbon in the OASIS logo will then change to&#xD;
      the color associated with their cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: Participants will then be instructed to select at least one symptom they want to&#xD;
      control better. The selected symptoms will be automatically added to the Symptom Tracker&#xD;
      feature of the application. The order in which the symptoms are presented on this screen will&#xD;
      be based on the answers provided in the profile. The most common symptoms for that cancer and&#xD;
      treatment will be presented first at the top of the list based on behind the scenes decision&#xD;
      algorithm. On this screen they can simply choose symptoms from the list or read about common&#xD;
      cancer symptoms in the symptom library.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4: Next, participants will select at least one symptom management strategy to use for&#xD;
      each symptom. Participants can simply select strategies from a list or read more about them&#xD;
      in the strategy library. Strategies selected will be automatically added to the Strategy&#xD;
      Tracker. For each symptom selected, a list of common symptom management strategies known to&#xD;
      be effective for that symptom will be suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 5: Once the participant has identified at least one symptom to work on and one strategy&#xD;
      to use, s/he can begin tracking. After completing steps 1-5, the Main Page will now show&#xD;
      their symptom and strategy trackers. At the end of each day, the participant is instructed to&#xD;
      rate the symptom distress they experienced in the previous 24 hours for the symptom(s) they&#xD;
      are tracking and whether they used the selected strategy or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 6: While participants are not required to read/watch all the content in the&#xD;
      web-application, they are encouraged to explore the symptom library and strategy library to&#xD;
      learn more about cancer symptoms and ways they can better manage them. Exploration will be&#xD;
      encouraged with factoids and teasers. Each time a participant logs in, a pop-up window with a&#xD;
      symptom management fact or tip will appear. This pop-up will link to the appropriate content&#xD;
      page if the participant is interested in learning more. For example, &quot;TIP: Did you know that&#xD;
      whenever you adjust your opioid pain medicine, you should also adjust your constipation&#xD;
      medicines?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Nurse-Coach. Through weekly visit via Zoom (which is an HIPAA compliant&#xD;
      web-conferencing platform), the nurse-coach will provide the ongoing encouragement, support,&#xD;
      and accountability that has been identified as critical to behavior change in other chronic&#xD;
      illness self-management interventions. The focus of the communications will be to evaluate&#xD;
      the patient's symptoms and use of management strategies, as well as coach the patient to&#xD;
      identify and address barriers to effectively implementing strategies to manage their&#xD;
      symptoms. Prior to each e-visit the participant will be encouraged to think about how well&#xD;
      each management strategy is working and what barriers they are encountering with implementing&#xD;
      the strategy. The nurse-coach will review the symptom distress scores and use of management&#xD;
      strategies with the participant. The nurse-coach and participant will then discuss how well&#xD;
      the strategies have been working and any barriers s/he has encountered. Reviewing the tracker&#xD;
      data and evaluating effectiveness and barriers of the strategies is theorized to help the&#xD;
      participant connect the dots between how they are feeling and what they can do to improve&#xD;
      their symptom management. The nurse-coach may suggest other strategies to consider, assess if&#xD;
      there are underlying symptoms that need to be addressed in order to effectively manage&#xD;
      symptoms (such as pain that is causing disturbed sleep), and finally, and/or determine&#xD;
      additional medical management is appropriate (such as messaging the physician to change a&#xD;
      prescription). The nurse-coach is a key feature of the intervention in that s/he will provide&#xD;
      primary palliative care as well as promote a sense of therapeutic working alliance with the&#xD;
      patient. For the purpose of fidelity monitoring, the e-visits will be audio recorded using&#xD;
      the secure audio recording feature in the Zoom application. Recordings will be transcribed&#xD;
      verbatim. Participants will be informed that the e-visits is being recorded. The participants&#xD;
      will be notified before the recording begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: A member of the research team will assist the patient in completing the&#xD;
      questionnaires at the clinic at the time of enrollment. In week 4, 8, and 12 patient will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires electronically. They will receive these questionnaires via a&#xD;
      Qualtrics survey link through email. The questionnaires take approximately 30-90 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. The questionnaires include sociodemographics, usability and acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention, plus instruments evaluating social support, perceived stress, optimism,&#xD;
      illness/symptom appraisal, symptom burden, self-management behaviors, coping, and&#xD;
      communication with health care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood: The patient will be met at the phlebotomy clinic for scheduled blood draws. Blood&#xD;
      samples for cytokines will be obtained at the same time as other scheduled blood draws to&#xD;
      minimize additional needle sticks. 30 mL of blood will be collected from a central venous&#xD;
      access device or using standard venipuncture techniques with sodium heparin and EDTA tubes&#xD;
      immersed in an ice bath within 15 minutes. Study personnel will confirm that the patient has&#xD;
      not smoked or ingested caffeine for at least one-half hour prior to blood collection. The&#xD;
      blood collection takes about 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire survey data collection will take 45 to 105 minutes per visit(total for visits is&#xD;
      180 to 420 minutes). Daily use of the web-application for a minimum of 10 minutes is&#xD;
      expected, totaling 560 minutes. A total of 12 hours and 30 minutes to 16 hrs and 30 minutes&#xD;
      of data collection is expected for the whole study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical record review: Medical records will be reviewed at each study visit via EPIC Care&#xD;
      Everywhere for information about cancer type and stage, cancer treatments, co-morbid&#xD;
      conditions, clinical blood lab values, and symptom treatment interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of 40 adults (18 years or older) that will be recruited at the&#xD;
      McCreery Cancer Center Clinic sites in Fairfield, IA and Ottumwa, IA. There is no control&#xD;
      group in this study. All participants will receive the intervention. Approximately 1 patients&#xD;
      per week are seen at the McCreery Cancer Center that meet eligibility criteria. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to approach all eligible participants. With a 50% recruitment rate and&#xD;
      expect to reach the sample size within 10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be identified by the McCreery Cancer Center clinic staff (e.g. nurses,&#xD;
      radiation therapists, and oncologists) weekly for the upcoming week. A research assistant&#xD;
      will be at the McCreery Cancer Center on day of the scheduled appointment. The clinic staff&#xD;
      will ask the patient if they are interested in the study. If the patient agrees, a trained&#xD;
      research assistant will confirm eligibility, describe participation, and obtain informed&#xD;
      consent. If the patient is interested in participating in the study but unwilling or unable&#xD;
      to complete the questionnaires or symptom and strategy tracking on the website, they can have&#xD;
      a caregiver assist them. The caregiver will function only as a recorder of the patient's&#xD;
      responses and not provide their own perceptions. If the patient is not able to verbally&#xD;
      interact with the caregiver to complete the questionnaires or symptom and strategy tracking,&#xD;
      then they will not be eligible to participate (or will be dropped from the study if already&#xD;
      in the intervention phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention is based on patient's ability to perform self-care actions with the use of&#xD;
      web-application. Self-management activities is highly dependent on decision making ability.&#xD;
      As a reason, if their physical or psychological status deteriorate due to their advanced&#xD;
      cancer they will no longer will be able to perform self-management actions nor use the web&#xD;
      for self-management and will be excluded from the study. If patient's capacity to consent&#xD;
      changes over the course of study, their study participation will end early. The UCSD Brief&#xD;
      Assessment of Capacity to Consent will be used to reassess capacity as needed during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project involves research on DNA. Analyses of associations among genetic markers for&#xD;
      cytokine, cancer symptoms, and coping behaviors. DNA samples will be identified and labeled&#xD;
      with a unique study ID number. The DNA samples and plasma for cytokine analyses will be&#xD;
      labeled with only the study ID and date of collection and kept in a -80º C freezer in a&#xD;
      locked in the College of Nursing, Office of Nursing Research. Data from the analyses will be&#xD;
      securely stored in RedCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and analysis will be the primary responsibility of the PI. Questionnaires and&#xD;
      biological specimens will be coded to remove all direct personal identifiers. The code list&#xD;
      will be kept in a locked cabinet and secure location, separate from where the questionnaires&#xD;
      and specimens are stored. The original consent and screening forms will be stored in a locked&#xD;
      cabinet in the project area, separate from any data sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These de-identified DNA samples or data may be shared in the future with other researchers&#xD;
      studying cancer symptoms and cytokines. Prior to sharing any data, an approved IRB protocol&#xD;
      and/or material transfer agreement will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAS 9.3 will be used for all analyses. Initial analysis will involve calculating descriptive&#xD;
      statistics for all variables at all study points compared to controls. Outliers will be&#xD;
      investigated for accuracy. Patterns of missing data will be examined. Graphical&#xD;
      representation of the data will be created and examined at each point and longitudinally. The&#xD;
      distributions of variables will be evaluated for normality and homogeneity of variance, and&#xD;
      appropriate transformations will be applied as needed or statistical analyses for non-normal&#xD;
      data will be utilized. Correlations among variables will be examined. A significance level of&#xD;
      .05 will be used for statistical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the acceptability and usability of the intervention, multiple components of the&#xD;
      study will be examined, including resources and time spent on the intervention for each&#xD;
      participant, patterns and sources of missing data. In addition the investigators will review&#xD;
      the recruitment procedures, as well as any potential experimental confounders and logistical&#xD;
      challenges. Descriptive statistics will be employed for analysis of continuous variables and&#xD;
      qualitative analyses will be employed for open-ended questions. This information will be used&#xD;
      to refine the OASIS intervention and develop procedures for a pilot RCT in future&#xD;
