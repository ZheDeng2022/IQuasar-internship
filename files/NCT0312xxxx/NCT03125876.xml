      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of CT053PTSA in Relapsed/refractory AML patients with FLT3 gene&#xD;
      mutation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a multi-center , open-label, dose escalation study conducted in 2 parts.&#xD;
      Dose-escalation part: Subjects will receive oral CT053PTSA once daily repeatedly until&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs, each cycle is defined as 28 days. At&#xD;
      least 3 subjects will receive CT053PTSA at each dose (60, 80, 100mg) for determination of&#xD;
      Maximum Tolerated Dose(MTD) and Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Dose reduction of CT053PTSA will&#xD;
      be considered if study drug-related toxicities are observed in a subject after Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion part:Expansion cohort might be set to further investigate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of CT053PTSA at or lower MTD dose recommended by dose-escalation part.&#xD;
