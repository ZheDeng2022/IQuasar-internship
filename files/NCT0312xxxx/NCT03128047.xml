      The purpose of this study is to determine if the Optune NovoTTF-200A device can be safely&#xD;
      used in combination with chemotherapy in pediatric patients with recurrent high-grade glioma&#xD;
      and ependemoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial will utilize a standard 3+3 design to determine the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the Optune NovoTTF-200A System in pediatric patients with recurrent&#xD;
      high-grade glioma end ependemomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment with the Optune NovoTTF-200A System along with Temozolomide&#xD;
      and Bevacizumab and will consist of children with recurrent high-grade gliomas and&#xD;
      Ependamomas. Patients enrolled will receive treatment with the Optune NovoTTF-200A with&#xD;
      200kHz for a minimum of 18 hours per day in 28 day cycles as monotherapy. Phase I safety&#xD;
      evaluation will take place over the initial two cycles (56 days) of treatment. Following the&#xD;
      completion of the safety evaluation period, patients will continue to receive treatment in 28&#xD;
      day cycles, which may be repeated continuously without therapy interruption for 12 cycles or&#xD;
      until clinical criteria for discontinuation are met. Patients how appear to benefit from this&#xD;
      treatment may be allowed to continue treatment beyond 12 cycles if approved by the study&#xD;
      Principle Investigator.&#xD;

        Note: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24 urine protein excretion - a UPC&#xD;
        ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1000 mg. UPC ratio is&#xD;
        calculated using one of the following formula:&#xD;
