  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop a smart phone app to administer a behavior change&#xD;
      program that helps adults to increase daily steps by planning where, when, and with whom to&#xD;
      walk. The investigators tested the effectiveness of the walking program app for increasing&#xD;
      the number of daily steps among sedentary older adults. The investigators examined the&#xD;
      effects on self-efficacy and social integration/support.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is broadly beneficial for physical, psychological, and cognitive aspects of&#xD;
      health, yet only one in five U.S. adults meets the CDC physical activity guidelines. Making&#xD;
      physical activity accessible and feasible throughout life is an important public health&#xD;
      policy objective that is within reach with the right kind of behavioral and environmental&#xD;
      supports. The project aims to provide such supports for an active lifestyle thereby&#xD;
      contributing to healthy aging. The goal of this project is to increase physical activity&#xD;
      (i.e., walking) in sedentary older adults by providing the environmental and behavioral&#xD;
      resources to incorporate additional steps into their daily lives. The investigators used a&#xD;
      behavioral approach that fosters a sense of control and facilitates planning by focusing on&#xD;
      the what, when, where, and with whom aspects of their physical activity. The investigators&#xD;
      proposed a user-friendly, practical way to increase steps. By providing people with specific,&#xD;
      tailored information about the number of steps one can get by walking a certain distance or&#xD;
      during a certain amount of time, participants can better plan when, where, and with whom they&#xD;
      will be able to achieve the desired number of steps, break goals into manageable portions (at&#xD;
      different times throughout the day or week), and thereby increase the likelihood of goal&#xD;
      achievement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the app development phase, the investigators demonstrated the app to 10 older adults&#xD;
      to get their input. The goal was to get their feedback about the app features and to make&#xD;
      sure it is user friendly. The investigators asked questions about the ease of using the app&#xD;
      and their understanding of the app features. The interviewer recorded their answers to share&#xD;
      with the research team and app developer. Modifications to the app were made based on the&#xD;
      feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the next phase of the study, the investigators tested whether the full app program was&#xD;
      successful in increasing steps and whether it was more effective than the basic app that only&#xD;
      includes step counting and goals, similar to a fitness tracker or pedometer. Sixty&#xD;
      participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: the app with step counting and goals&#xD;
      alone (control), or the full version of the app with the step counting and goals, schedule,&#xD;
      maps, and social components (experimental). It was predicted that the intervention group&#xD;
      would improve more on outcome measures than the control group.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and one month from the start of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A modified version of Bandura's Exercise Self-Efficacy scale (Bandura, 1997) was used in the current study. This 9-item scale assesses how sure one is that they would exercise under different conditions or constraints (e.g. How sure are you that you will exercise when you are feeling down or depressed?), with answer choices ranging from not sure at all (1) to very sure (4). The 9 items are averaged to create a composite score, where a higher score indicates greater exercise self-efficacy (Neupert et al., 2009).</description>

    <description>Control over exercise was measured using the 6-item Exercise Control Beliefs Scale (Neupert, Lachman, &amp; Whitbourne, 2009). Items assess the beliefs about one's control over exercise (e.g., I am confident in my ability to do an exercise routine), with answer choices ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). The 6 items are averaged to create a mean exercise control score, with a higher score indicating greater control over exercise.</description>

    <description>Twice at random times, each day, mood and energy levels were assessed. A popup notification asked participants to rate their current mood (unhappy, neutral, happy) and energy (low, neutral, high) on a slider scale. Scores were converted by the StepMATE app to a 0-10 scale, with 0 indicating low mood/energy, and 10 indicating high mood/energy. If both mood and energy assessments were completed in one day, they were averaged to create daily average scores, one for mood and one for energy. Data presented below are the average of all daily scores across the month, while daily averages were used in the analyses.</description>

App Experimental condition: This group were given the app to 1) count their steps, 2) add walks to their daily schedules, 3) create maps of their walking routes, and 4) text friends to invite them for a walk. Participants are asked to set a daily step goal and they can see how many steps they've taken each day since using the app. 2) There is an interface where participants can create maps based on walking routes. 3) They will also have the option to use a daily schedule to plan certain times in the day that they can walk. 4) The social feature gives participants the option to message friends, co-workers, or neighbors in one's contact list to invite them for a walk. They were also asked to respond to two questions twice a day about their mood and energy levels.</description>

        <title>Exercise Self-efficacy</title>
        <description>A modified version of Bandura's Exercise Self-Efficacy scale (Bandura, 1997) was used in the current study. This 9-item scale assesses how sure one is that they would exercise under different conditions or constraints (e.g. How sure are you that you will exercise when you are feeling down or depressed?), with answer choices ranging from not sure at all (1) to very sure (4). The 9 items are averaged to create a composite score, where a higher score indicates greater exercise self-efficacy (Neupert et al., 2009).</description>

This group will monitor their daily steps over a one-month period, and will be asked to use the app as much as possible. They were also asked to respond to two questions twice a day about their mood and energy levels.</description>

App Experimental condition: This group were given the app to 1) count their steps, 2) add walks to their daily schedules, 3) create maps of their walking routes, and 4) text friends to invite them for a walk. Participants are asked to set a daily step goal and they can see how many steps they've taken each day since using the app. 2) There is an interface where participants can create maps based on walking routes. 3) They will also have the option to use a daily schedule to plan certain times in the day that they can walk. 4) The social feature gives participants the option to message friends, co-workers, or neighbors in one's contact list to invite them for a walk.

          <title>Exercise Self-efficacy</title>
          <description>A modified version of Bandura's Exercise Self-Efficacy scale (Bandura, 1997) was used in the current study. This 9-item scale assesses how sure one is that they would exercise under different conditions or constraints (e.g. How sure are you that you will exercise when you are feeling down or depressed?), with answer choices ranging from not sure at all (1) to very sure (4). The 9 items are averaged to create a composite score, where a higher score indicates greater exercise self-efficacy (Neupert et al., 2009).</description>

        <title>Exercise Control Beliefs</title>
        <description>Control over exercise was measured using the 6-item Exercise Control Beliefs Scale (Neupert, Lachman, &amp; Whitbourne, 2009). Items assess the beliefs about one's control over exercise (e.g., I am confident in my ability to do an exercise routine), with answer choices ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). The 6 items are averaged to create a mean exercise control score, with a higher score indicating greater control over exercise.</description>

        <description>Twice at random times, each day, mood and energy levels were assessed. A popup notification asked participants to rate their current mood (unhappy, neutral, happy) and energy (low, neutral, high) on a slider scale. Scores were converted by the StepMATE app to a 0-10 scale, with 0 indicating low mood/energy, and 10 indicating high mood/energy. If both mood and energy assessments were completed in one day, they were averaged to create daily average scores, one for mood and one for energy.
