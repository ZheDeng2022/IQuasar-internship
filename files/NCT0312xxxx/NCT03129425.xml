  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a psychoeducational multidisciplinary&#xD;
      intervention focusing on improving coping skills, the psychosocial adaptation to Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease and the quality of life in patents and family carers in a Primary Care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of previous research, the hypothesis we propose is that through the development&#xD;
      of coping skills which will contribute to promoting a positive psychosocial adaptation to&#xD;
      Parkinson' disease, the quality of life of the people with Parkinson's disease and their&#xD;
      family carers will be improved. At the same time, it is predicted that, by incorporating this&#xD;
      psychoeducational intervention into clinical practice, the patients and family caregivers&#xD;
      will perceive a greater sense of normality in their lives, which will also promote compliance&#xD;
      with drug treatments and promote healthy lifestyles. In the long-term, such an approach could&#xD;
      have positive effects on the overall health of patients and their family carers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This quasi-experimental study with control group and mixed methods was designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the ReNACE psychoeducational intervention (ReNACE is the spanish acronym for the Research&#xD;
      Programme and means Recovery, Normalisation, Acceptance and Living with Chronic illness).&#xD;
      Based on the relevant study power calculations, 100 people with Parkinson's disease and 100&#xD;
      family carers will be recruited. Participants will be assigned to two groups. The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive the ReNACE psychoeducational intervention. The control group&#xD;
      will be given a general educational program. The study will be carried out in community-based&#xD;
      health centers. The results obtained from the two groups will be evaluated at three time&#xD;
      points: at baseline, immediately after the intervention and at 6 months after the&#xD;
      intervention. The results will be measured with the following instruments: the Quality of&#xD;
      Life Scale PDQ-39 (The 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire) for patients and the&#xD;
      Quality of Life Scale for caregivers SQLC (Scale of Quality of Life of Caregivers) for family&#xD;
      carers, and for patients and family carers the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale&#xD;
      Self-report (PAIS-SR) and the Brief Cope Inventory. To determine the acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention, focus groups will be organized with some patients and family carers who have&#xD;
      received the ReNACE intervention and also with the healthcare professionals involved in its&#xD;
      development.&#xD;

      Registry procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Letters will be sent from the centers themselves to the homes of all the people&#xD;
           diagnosed with Parkinson's disease who meet the inclusion criteria. The letters will&#xD;
           contain information about the study and how to join the study, a stamped addressed&#xD;
           envelope and the informed consent form. Those interested may sign up for the study by&#xD;
           telephone, by sending a letter in a stamped addressed envelope (provided by the research&#xD;
           team) or in person at the reception of the participating centers. Subsequently, a member&#xD;
           of the research team will evaluate if the potential participants meet the inclusion&#xD;
           criteria by means of a brief interview in the health center. Once it has been&#xD;
           established that participants fulfill the inclusion criteria, they will be given a&#xD;
           document with the dates of the sessions that they must attend.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The healthcare professionals helping the participants in data collection will be blinded&#xD;
           to intervention assignment. Two researchers will be in charge of data monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be compared with findings from papers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sample size necessary to detect medium to large differences in the primary outcome&#xD;
           of the project, quality of life, was calculated. The parameters used for the calculation&#xD;
           of the sample size by group will be published in a paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of quantitative data will be performed on an intention to treat basis and for&#xD;
           that SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 23.0 will be used. A&#xD;
           descriptive analysis of the sociodemographic data will be made. For the quantitative&#xD;
           variables, the means of central tendency and standard deviations will be calculated.&#xD;
           Non-parametric tests (χ² tests) and parametric tests (paired student t tests) to compare&#xD;
           patients with family members at each measurement points, unpaired student t tests to&#xD;
           determine any significant differences between the two groups at baseline (Time 0) and&#xD;
           the measurements at Time 1 and Time 2 will be used. Also, repeated measures of&#xD;
           covariance (ANCOVA, analysis of covariance) will be used to compare differences between&#xD;
           the two groups in the main variables.&#xD;
