    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of 4D image acquisition and post-processing&#xD;
      with Vios Works for the evaluation of 3D images acquired on GE Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      scanners. Specifically, the investigators propose to evaluate the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Image acquisition time using traditional 2D and new 4D processing techniques;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Image quality for 2D and 4D processing techniques subjectively&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post-processing time for the two techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Correlation of overall Left ventricular and right ventricular volumes and functions and&#xD;
           aortic and pulmonic flow studies using the two techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The study will monitor any changes in patient diagnoses or treatment resulting from any&#xD;
           differences in interpretations between the two processes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional scanning and post-processing of 2D Cardiac Magnetic Resonance images (CMRI) is&#xD;
      highly technical and time consuming, with many exams requiring one to two hours to complete.&#xD;
      In addition, performance of 2D scans often requires expert technologists working closely with&#xD;
      the clinician imaging expert. These factors limit the general clinical utility of current&#xD;
      generation cardiac MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to address these factors, many researchers began to explore the use of 4D image&#xD;
      acquisition and post processing to shorten exam time. These researchers have documented&#xD;
      success at these efforts but, to the best of the current investigators' knowledge, such&#xD;
      advanced imaging acquisition and post-processing systems are not readily commercially&#xD;
      available in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently GE teamed with Vios-Works for MRI to provide a cloud-based visualization platform&#xD;
      for 4D MRI that provides quantitative and structured reporting in the post processing&#xD;
      environment that makes use of advance MR imaging acquisition techniques. The images can be&#xD;
      accessed by the interpreter and reviewed and manipulated in order to assess cardiac function&#xD;
      and flow retrospectively, which, prior to this innovation, only has been available for&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) generated images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigative team hypothesizes that the use of 4D imaging will result in reduced time&#xD;
      for acquisition (approximately 6 minutes as opposed to 1 hour), and improvement of diagnostic&#xD;
      capability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Images will be acquired using the current standard 2D acquisition protocol for routine&#xD;
      clinical cardiac MRI. A repeat acquisition will be completed using the new protocol for 4D&#xD;
      imaging acquisition. This will require that patient exams be extended in length by six&#xD;
      minutes for those enrolled in the study. The investigators will evaluate the image quality of&#xD;
      the two techniques and grade them according to a scale of 1 to 3 with 1 being excellent&#xD;
      cardiac borders easily identified; 2 - acceptable: cardiac borders acceptably identified; and&#xD;
      3, non-diagnostic. The investigators will specifically focus on the evaluation of cardiac&#xD;
      function of both right and left ventricular function as well as flow analysis of both the&#xD;
      aortic and pulmonic valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each method, technician time and MD time will be collected. The exam will go through post&#xD;
      processing for standard 2D, following by the new 4D post processing technique. Time for post&#xD;
      processing will be collected. All subjects who agree will receive both a 2D and a 4D MRI. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate inter and intra reader reliability by having all readers read the&#xD;
      first 15 exams, and then read them a second time after two weeks in a different order Readers&#xD;
      showing variation in performance will be retrained on interpretation of 4D MRI before reading&#xD;
      scans for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once readers have been trained, the study will require that all 2D and 4D exams be read by&#xD;
      two readers. The exams will be assigned randomly to readers using the Biostatistician Office&#xD;
      random assignment services.&#xD;
