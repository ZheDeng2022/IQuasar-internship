    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and how well pembrolizumab with or without&#xD;
      anetumab ravtansine works in treating patients with mesothelin-positive pleural mesothelioma.&#xD;
      Anetumab ravtansine is a monoclonal antibody, called anetumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug,&#xD;
      called ravtansine. Anetumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific&#xD;
      molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as mesothelin receptors, and&#xD;
      delivers ravtansine to kill them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the dose of anetumab ravtansine that is safe in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      to be used in the randomized phase 2 study. (Phase I safety lead-in) II. Determine if the&#xD;
      overall response rate of the combination of anetumab ravtansine and pembrolizumab is superior&#xD;
      to pembrolizumab alone. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progression free survival of anetumab ravtansine and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      compared to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of anetumab ravtansine and pembrolizumab on&#xD;
      soluble megakaryocyte potentiating factor (MPF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of anetumab ravtansine and pembrolizumab. IV. To&#xD;
      evaluate mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) function, FcgammaRs, hormone and chemokine&#xD;
      mediators as methods to evaluate factors affecting the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      of these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the incidence of antibodies directed against anetumab ravtansine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether elevations in Bim in tumor-reactive T cells (TTR) predict responses&#xD;
      to treatment and whether its detection is dynamic with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether soluble PD-L1 predicts responses to treatment and whether its&#xD;
      detection is dynamic with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate PD-L1 expression in archival tissue as a predictive marker of response to&#xD;
      pembrolizumab-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the symptomatic adverse events (AE) for tolerability of each treatment group&#xD;
      using patient reported outcomes (PRO)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Upon radiologic documentation of disease progression, patients may&#xD;
      cross over to Group II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive anetumab ravtansine IV over 1 hour and pembrolizumab IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 12 months for anetumab ravtansine and&#xD;
      up to 24 months for pembrolizumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.&#xD;

                  computed tomography [CT] scan, for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
                  trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no&#xD;
                  evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at&#xD;
                  least 7 days prior to trial treatment&#xD;

             before the start of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the screening&#xD;
             and treatment phases (including retreatment for post-complete response relapse) of&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Investigational agents other than anetumab ravtansine and pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiation therapy (Note: Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to&#xD;
                  the brain may be considered on an exceptional case by case basis after&#xD;
                  consultation with Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP); the patient must have&#xD;
                  clear measurable disease outside the radiated field; administration of palliative&#xD;
                  radiation therapy will be considered clinical progression for the purposes of&#xD;
                  determining progression free survival [PFS])&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while&#xD;
                  participating in the trial; examples of live vaccines include, but are not&#xD;
                  limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever,&#xD;
                  rabies, Bacillus Chalmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid (oral) vaccine; seasonal&#xD;
                  influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are&#xD;
                  allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live&#xD;
                  attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an&#xD;
                  event of suspected immunologic etiology; the use of physiologic doses of&#xD;
                  corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the study principal&#xD;
                  investigator (PI) and CTEP&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because anetumab ravtansine and&#xD;
                  pembrolizumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
                  effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
                  nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with anetumab ravtansine and&#xD;
                  pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
                  anetumab ravtansine or pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients who do not meet all of the&#xD;
             following and/or are on HIV medications considered to be strong inhibitors or inducers&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Undetectable HIV viral load by standard clinical assay within 6 months of&#xD;
                  registration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Willing to adhere to antiretroviral therapy that has minimal overlapping toxicity&#xD;
                  or pharmacokinetic interactions with protocol therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining events other within the&#xD;
                  past 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Near normal life expectancy if not for the presence of the cancer&#xD;

             reactive) or known active hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA]&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected) infection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: No testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C is required unless mandated by&#xD;
                  local health authority&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are known to have a history of or a finding of corneal epitheliopathy at&#xD;
             pre-study are excluded because anetumab ravtansine may worsen this condition and&#xD;
             reduce vision&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment;&#xD;
             exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy, or in situ cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of transfusion of blood products (including platelets or red blood cells) or&#xD;
             administration of colony stimulating factors (including granulocyte colony-stimulating&#xD;
             factor [G-CSF], granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], or&#xD;
             recombinant erythropoietin) within 4 weeks prior to study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with active interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis or a prior history of&#xD;
             ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids&#xD;
