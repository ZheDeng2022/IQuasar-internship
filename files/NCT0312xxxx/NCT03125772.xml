    <textblock>
      The TUXEDO-India is a prospective, single blind, multi-center randomized clinical trial to&#xD;
      assess the TAXUS Element™ in a consecutive population of diabetic patients with coronary&#xD;
      artery disease undergoing coronary revascularization. Approximately 1,830 patients with&#xD;
      single or multi lesion, multi vessel coronary artery or saphenous vein graft disease ranging&#xD;
      in vessels ranging from 2.25 mm to 4.0 mm in diameter by visual estimate will be enrolled in&#xD;
      a 1:1 randomization to TAXUS Element™ vs. XIENCE™ Prime in India at up to 50 clinical sites,&#xD;
      to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of TAXUS Element™ in an unrestricted population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedural Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Device success, defined as attainment of &lt; 30% residual stenosis of the target lesion&#xD;
           (visual assessment) using the TAXUS Element™ or XIENCE™ Prime stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lesion success defined as attainment of &lt; 30% residual stenosis (visual assessment)&#xD;
           using any percutaneous method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure success defined as lesion success without the occurrence of in-hospital MACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure complication rate including composite and individual angiographic occurrence&#xD;
           of dissection ≥B, distal embolization, no reflow, slow flow, abrupt closure, or&#xD;
           perforation.&#xD;

      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Composite safety endpoint of Target Vessel Failure (TVF) rate at 12 months post-index&#xD;
      procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac Death related to target vessel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target Vessel Myocardial Infarction (TV-MI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical endpoints measured at 30, 180 days, and 1 and 2 years post index procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TVF rate (primary endpoint 1 year)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR) rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Composite of cardiac death or target vessel MI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Composite of all deaths, all MI, all revascularizations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) which is the composite endpoint of cardiac death,&#xD;
           all myocardial infarction, and TLR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MI (Q-wave and non-Q-wave) rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac death rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-cardiac death rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All death rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac death or MI rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All death or MI rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stent thrombosis rate (definite or probable by Academic Research Consortium [ARC]&#xD;
           definitions)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periprocedural endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technical success rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical procedural success rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-platelet Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      A loading dose of either Clopidogrel (300mg, 600mg recommended), Ticlopidine (500mg), or&#xD;
      Prasugrel (60mg) must be given to the patient prior to index procedure. Thereafter,&#xD;
      Clopidogrel (75mg daily), Ticlopidine (250mg twice daily), Prasugrel (10mg) must be given for&#xD;
      at least 12 months after stent implantation. If the protocol mandated (loading and or daily)&#xD;
      dosage conflicts with local DFU, the local DFU should take precedence. Aspirin (ASA): Must be&#xD;
      administered concomitantly with Clopidogrel, Ticlopidine or Prasugrel and then continued&#xD;
      indefinitely&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected 12 month TVF rate for both groups is estimated to be 8.4% based on the data&#xD;
      available from the SPIRIT IV trial. Given the non-inferiority margin (delta) of 4% with equal&#xD;
      expected means and a one-sided 5% significance level, 824 patients in each group will provide&#xD;
      at least 90% power to reject the null hypothesis if it is false. When allowance is made for&#xD;
      10% attrition, approximately 915 patients are required per each treatment group. Therefore,&#xD;
      the necessary total sample size for the trial is 1,830 patients.&#xD;

    <description>The TAXUS® Element™ stent system is a multifunctional device providing a mechanical structure for vascular lumen support and a pharmacological agent targeted toward reducing or preventing the incidence of restenosis. The TAXUS Element™ stent is a balloon expandable, stainless steel platinum alloy stent, coated with paclitaxel in a slow-release system, pre-mounted on a high-pressure Monorail delivery catheter and is intended for use in the treatment of coronary artery disease. The pharmacological agent, paclitaxel, is incorporated into a triblock polymer matrix and applied to the surface of the stent. The polymer matrix provides controlled release of available paclitaxel. The TAXUS Element™ stent design is built upon the TAXUS Express and TAXUS Liberte design experience, but incorporates several improved stent design characteristics. The TAXUS Element™ stent also has a smaller tip profile, designed to enhance the ability to cross tighter and/or more complex lesions.</description>

    <description>The everolimus-eluting stent (EES, manufactured and distributed by Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, as XIENCE PRIME™ ) is a balloon expandable stent manufactured from a flexible cobalt chromium alloy with a multicellular design and 0.0032-in strut thickness which is coated with a thin (7.8 μm) nonadhesive, durable, biocompatible acrylic polymer and fluorinated copolymer releasing everolimus. Everolimus [40-O-(2-hydroxyethyl)- rapamycin], a semisynthetic macrolide immunosuppressant, inhibits growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation by causing cell-cycle arrest in the late G1 stage, thereby suppressing neointimal formation. Comparative analysis in an in vivo rabbit aortoiliac model has shown more rapid endothelialization with the EES compared to SES, PES, and ZES.</description>
