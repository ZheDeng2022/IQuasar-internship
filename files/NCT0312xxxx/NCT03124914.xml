    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a common symptom in people living with HIV (PHAs) that affects all aspects of life&#xD;
      . This would include physical deconditioning, a reduction in motor skills . Numerous studies&#xD;
      show that physical activity brings benefits for the quality of life of PHAs . However, due to&#xD;
      the predominantly reported fatigue, many PHAs are not physically active enough in relation to&#xD;
      these recommendations. While it is recognized that fatigue is predominant in PHAs, this&#xD;
      complaint has mainly been subjectively quantified and has rarely been physically objectified&#xD;
      a better understanding of the relationship between neuromuscular fatigue, perceived fatigue&#xD;
      and the level of physical activity of PHAs is needed in line with current work on integrating&#xD;
      fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES This project, based on an integrative (eg, neurophysiological and psychological)&#xD;
      approach to fatigue, aims to better explain and prevent the vicious circle of physical&#xD;
      deconditioning in PHAs by examining the relationships between neuromuscular fatigue,&#xD;
      perceived fatigue, Physical activity of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study will be to compare the characteristics of neuromuscular&#xD;
      fatigue in physically active or inactive PHAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective will be to examine the relationship between neuromuscular fatigue,&#xD;
      level of physical activity and perceived physical fatigue of PHAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDUCT OF THE STUDY Cross-sectional comparative study without individual benefit for the&#xD;
      patient. Monocentric test to quantify and relate neuromuscular fatigue, perceived physical&#xD;
      fatigue, and physical activity level. The main inclusion criteria for this study are: PLHIV&#xD;
      aged between 40 and 60; Diagnosed and treated with antivirals after 1996, irrespective of the&#xD;
      value of the viral load and CD4 lymphocyte level at the last assessment; The physical&#xD;
      activity level of the patients will be evaluated before the start of the study in order to&#xD;
      constitute two distinct groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Principal evaluation criterion: Investigation of the neurophysiological characteristics&#xD;
           of fatigue will be done by recording the capacity to produce force at the level of the&#xD;
           extensor muscles of the knee under conditions of voluntary contractions and evoked by&#xD;
           magnetic stimulation at the level of Femoral nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary evaluation criteria: the investigation of the perceived fatigue will be done&#xD;
           by a valid psychometric questionnaire.&#xD;

      22) and (b) a group of patients considered as Physically inactive (SAP &lt;15). Confirmed by&#xD;
      blood diagnosis. Those who have recently stopped their antiretroviral treatment and / or&#xD;
      their medical follow-up and who have a progressive recovery of their infection and those&#xD;
      affected by other health conditions marked by fatigue will be excluded.&#xD;
