      This double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept clinical trial is intended to&#xD;
      demonstrate that preemptive oral administration of cocoa flavanol for five days before&#xD;
      surgery will attenuate the surgery-evoked increase of HMGB1 in blood plasma and NFkB&#xD;
      signaling in innate immune cells shortly after surgery. A secondary aim is to capture&#xD;
      preliminary patient-centered outcomes data and relate these outcomes to the intake of oral&#xD;
      cocoa flavanol and surgery-evoked activation of the HMGB1-NFkB signaling axis. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive either an over the counter supplement containing cocoa&#xD;
      flavanols, or placebo, for 5 days before surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last two decades significant effort has been made to enhance recovery after&#xD;
      surgery. Despite the implementation of pragmatic and standardized clinical protocols to&#xD;
      enhance recovery and shorten hospital length of stay, the utility of these protocols for&#xD;
      improving patient-centered recovery cost-effectively remains uncertain. Critical elements of&#xD;
      recovery that greatly matter to patients and health care providers include the resolution of&#xD;
      pain, daily functioning, and loss of postoperative fatigue. A patient-centered and&#xD;
      cost-effective focus on postoperative recovery pays tribute to three goals of health care:&#xD;
      Improving patients' experience, improving health, and constraining per capita cost. As such,&#xD;
      novel and cost-effective strategies are greatly needed to accelerate patient-recovery after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data by Dr. Angst and his collaborators indicate that administration of a cocoa&#xD;
      flavanol extract that is equivalent in dose to the amount of cocoa flavanol contained in&#xD;
      about 50 grams of dark chocolate decreases plasma levels of HMGB1. HMGB1 is an archetypical&#xD;
      alarmin, i.e., an endogenous mediator that is released upon cellular stress and injury. HMGB1&#xD;
      triggers a pro-inflammatory cascade by binding to toll-like receptors (TLRs) on innate immune&#xD;
      and other cells, which results in activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors (e.g.&#xD;
      NFkB) and the subsequent release of major pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNFα). The&#xD;
      prominent role of the HMGB1-TLR axis in inflammatory disease states including surgery,&#xD;
      trauma, stroke, and myocardial infarction has recently been highlighted.16-19 Importantly,&#xD;
      dampening activity along this pathway in preclinical injury models has been shown to improve&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential of HMGB1 as a therapeutic target in acute inflammatory disease states has&#xD;
      recently been emphasized. A major challenge is the identification of effective and non-toxic&#xD;
      clinical strategies that can safely modulate HMGB1 in humans. This research study will&#xD;
      evaluate a safe, highly scalable, and relatively cheap pre-surgical nutritional intervention&#xD;
      that has significant potential to do just that, safely modulate HMGB1 and improve clinical&#xD;
      recovery after surgery. As such, this proposed research could change clinical practice within&#xD;
      years. While studied intervention targets a specific pro-inflammatory pathway implicated in&#xD;
      aggravated tissue damage and delayed healing/recovery, the use of broader and less specific&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory interventions in the perioperative period including non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids is common clinical practice.&#xD;

    <description>Blood samples will be collected to measure possible attenuation of surgery-evoked increase in NFkB signaling in innate immune cells shortly after surgery at specified time points.&#xD;
Phosphorylation of functional markers (activity) was expressed as the arcsinh-transformed value of the median value. Changes in activity over time were captured by building the arcsinh ratio between the arcsinh-value obtained in samples collected at a given time with the arcsinh-value obtained in samples collected at baseline, i.e., before starting the intervention with CocoaVia. The following markers were included: phospho-(p)STAT1, pSTAT3, pSTAT5, pSTAT6, pNF-κB, pMAPKAPK2, pP38, prpS6, pERK1/2, pCREB, and total IκBα.</description>

        <description>Blood samples will be collected to measure possible attenuation of surgery-evoked increase in NFkB signaling in innate immune cells shortly after surgery at specified time points.&#xD;
Phosphorylation of functional markers (activity) was expressed as the arcsinh-transformed value of the median value. Changes in activity over time were captured by building the arcsinh ratio between the arcsinh-value obtained in samples collected at a given time with the arcsinh-value obtained in samples collected at baseline, i.e., before starting the intervention with CocoaVia. The following markers were included: phospho-(p)STAT1, pSTAT3, pSTAT5, pSTAT6, pNF-κB, pMAPKAPK2, pP38, prpS6, pERK1/2, pCREB, and total IκBα.</description>

          <title>Days to Mild Pain as Assessed by WOMAC Pain Scores</title>
          <description>Participants will complete the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire (pain subscale) before surgery, daily during hospitalization, and weekly through week 6 post op.&#xD;
Higher WOMAC scores equate to greater pain. Range of possible scores is 0 - 20.</description>
          <population>Three patients were excluded from the molecular analysis because of incorrect intake of the study medication, difficulties obtaining blood draws, and a non-recognized immune disorder. Four additional patients were excluded from the analysis including clinical data because respective questionnaires were not answered reliably. The total participants included in this analysis is 35. Exclusion of patients from the analyses was determined before unblinding.</population>
