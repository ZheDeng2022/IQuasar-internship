  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The European Union is funding this randomised trial in Scotland as part of the larger eCAP&#xD;
      project (http://www.interreg-npa.eu/projects/funded-projects/project/139/). The need for&#xD;
      psychiatric services for children and adolescents is usually greater than the services&#xD;
      available. As well as this, in many cases, there is confusion as to which service the child&#xD;
      or young person should be referred to. The way children and young people arrive at Child and&#xD;
      Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) may therefore be relatively inefficient and&#xD;
      families could suffer as a result of this inefficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a computerised structured questionnaire such as the Development and Well-being&#xD;
      Assessment (DAWBA) offers the opportunity for these difficulties to be addressed, for the&#xD;
      avoidance of 'inappropriate referrals' and for more rational use of resources. It is usually&#xD;
      administered online through a secure internet portal. At the end of the data collection, a&#xD;
      computerised summary is generated from the data given by all the informants and a&#xD;
      child/adolescent psychiatrist lists the likely diagnosis or diagnoses in a summary of the&#xD;
      case and gives his view about the next steps. This is then made available to the referrer.&#xD;
      This community-based study aims to establish whether using the DAWBA in this way helps&#xD;
      children and young people with mental health problems. The main objectives are to improve&#xD;
      their mental health, reduce waiting times, change referral practice, increase satisfaction in&#xD;
      services and improve cost effectiveness. The principal outcome measure will be parent-rated&#xD;
      Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) score 6 months after randomisation. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures will include teacher and child-rated SDQ at 6 months and waiting times to&#xD;
      services. The investigators will also record service use data and family out -of -pocket&#xD;
      costs. A random sample of young people, family and referrers will be interviewed to explore&#xD;
      satisfaction with service.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will involve 246 participants in each centre (123 intervention, 123 control).&#xD;
      Assuming 20% loss to follow-up (i.e. 197 completing) this will give 80% power at 5%&#xD;
      significance to detect a moderate effect size of 0.4 in each participating centre. If the&#xD;
      investigators assume that the typical SDQ Total Difficulties Score six months after referral&#xD;
      is 15 points (the boundary between 'borderline' and 'abnormal' scores), then this would&#xD;
      correspond to a difference between the groups of around 2 points which is probably near the&#xD;
      lower limit of clinically significant change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient / parent name and telephone number will be supplied to the National Health Service&#xD;
      (NHS) Highland research nurse after verbal agreement is given to the referring practitioner&#xD;
      that the parent is happy to be contacted to gain formal consent to participate in the&#xD;
      project. These details (name and telephone number) will be supplied to enable the research&#xD;
      nurse to initially make contact with each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research nurse will then telephone the parent (contact will be made with the parent first&#xD;
      or the young person if aged 16 or over and either the young person or their parent is&#xD;
      unwilling for their parent to participate). If the parent agrees, the participant information&#xD;
      sheet and consent form will be emailed or posted to the family. Informed consent to&#xD;
      participation in the study will be obtained from parents or legal guardians and young people&#xD;
      aged 16 &amp; 17, and young people aged 11 to 15 years will be asked for assent. Consent/assent&#xD;
      will be requested to cover:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in the project;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of simple questionnaires at baseline and six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provision of relevant contact details (parents, teachers, young people);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  allowing requests for qualitative interviews;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  giving researchers access to service use data. The consent form will explain that the&#xD;
           project is designed to find out whether doing a detailed mental health assessment before&#xD;
           specialist involvement improves the speed and efficiency of service delivery for&#xD;
           families (see attached information sheets).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On receipt of the completed consent forms in the post, the NHS research nurse will assign a&#xD;
      study number to the family and will contact the university statistics department (in&#xD;
      Aberdeen) by email for group allocation. Participants will be assigned at random either to&#xD;
      have a DAWBA administered (by parents in every case, by teachers when possible and by young&#xD;
      people aged 11 or over) plus usual care, or to receive usual care only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If admitted into the project, participants' health records will be accessed by members of&#xD;
      research team only to establish levels of service use before and following intervention.&#xD;
      These data will be recorded as the number of contacts with a particular service e.g. General&#xD;
      Practitioner (GP), school nurse, health visitor, Primary mental Health Worker (PMHW), social&#xD;
      worker. No other details will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will then be asked to complete baseline measures including the Strengths and&#xD;
      Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and demographic (age, sex, family structure, socio-economic&#xD;
      status, rurality/urban/city, and service use details. The investigators will ask for full&#xD;
      postcodes to allow for Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) rank to be ascertained.&#xD;
      These baseline data will only be available to the study team (ideally collected via a secure&#xD;
      web portal), and will not be seen by the local clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DAWBA will be administered online whenever possible, but in cases where there are&#xD;
      literacy problems or lack of internet connectivity, administration will be by telephone (the&#xD;
      interview being conducted by one of the NHS research nurses). In the case of online&#xD;
      completion, the NHS research nurse will pass on login details to parents, and ask them to&#xD;
      pass these on to teachers and young people (where relevant). If the parents are not willing&#xD;
      the NHS research nurse will do this. If the potential participant does not want information&#xD;
      sent to anybody else, then the information will not be sent. The potential participant's&#xD;
      wishes will be respected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once all assessments are completed, the NHS research nurse will alert the local DAWBA rater.&#xD;
      DAWBA ratings will be done by a local psychiatrist familiar with diagnostic classification&#xD;
      and local services. In exceptional circumstances (e.g., no psychiatrist available due to&#xD;
      illness) the Chief Investigator (Phil Wilson) is authorised to rate DAWBAs. (As the online&#xD;
      system is anonymised, this will not jeopardise his blindness to randomisation.) The&#xD;
      summarised DAWBA data and the full report will be shared with the referring clinician. The&#xD;
      referrer will make their own decision about how to handle communication about the DAWBA data&#xD;
      with families, referrers and specialist services. Other data, including the SDQ, will be held&#xD;
      securely and kept confidential by the research team as below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any data collected will be treated confidentially and will be reported anonymously. Any data&#xD;
      collected will be adequate, relevant and not excessive to the purpose of the research study&#xD;
      proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be retained according to the University of Aberdeen's retention policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NHS Highland General Practitioners have full access to patient records as a matter of&#xD;
      routine, the research nurses will have access to patient / parent or teacher name / telephone&#xD;
      number. These NHS staff are familiar with handling data and operate under the umbrella of&#xD;
      confidentiality legislation within the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant consent will be sought for the research team to have access to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GP records, school nurse records, PMHW records, Health Visitor (in case of very young&#xD;
      children) - to identify the number of times the participant has seen the referring&#xD;
      professional or other mental health service providers during the six months post recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal clinical confidentiality will apply, specifically information will be stored in a&#xD;
      locked filing cabinet or a password protected area of a shared drive within the University of&#xD;
      Aberdeen network. Only direct members of the research team will have access to participant&#xD;
      information and participants will be allocated a unique study number that does not contain&#xD;
      identifiable information. Identifiable information will be stored separately from study&#xD;
      information. Any identifiable data will be destroyed less than three months after the study&#xD;
      has ended. All other data will be stored securely for 10 years. The Chief Investigator will&#xD;
      act as custodian for all data. No personal identifiable information will be held on laptop&#xD;
      computers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be archived at the University of Aberdeen according to University of Aberdeen&#xD;
      policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most data will be held within the secure server network of the University of Aberdeen. It is&#xD;
      impossible to access server drives without a valid staff username and password, and all files&#xD;
      will be held within a password protected area accessible only to members of the study team.&#xD;
      Any paper based data (such as a contact list for participants) will be held in a locked&#xD;
      filing cabinet at the Centre for Rural Health (University of Aberdeen) Data from the&#xD;
      telephone interviews (undertaken by the study research nurse) will be stored centrally on a&#xD;
      university held computer in accordance with University of Aberdeen data storage governance&#xD;
      policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be gathered in accordance to the terms of the Data Protection Act (1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal identifiers will not be stored with research data. Unique identification numbers&#xD;
      will be used on separate contact information and research data files, which will be stored in&#xD;
      separate, secure locations on the University of Aberdeen servers. The investigators will&#xD;
      follow Data Protection Act and Caldicott guidelines in relation to use of patient information&#xD;
      at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete the DAWBA online. To maximise confidentiality and keep potentially&#xD;
      sensitive information safe, the DAWBA online system is anonymised - only the research group&#xD;
      knows which child has which identifier. Additional security is provided by using a secure&#xD;
      server with encryption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate Child Protection training for the research nurses will be provided by NHS&#xD;
      Highland, it will be a group session for everyone involved in the project. NHS Highland will&#xD;
      keep the records of who has undertaken the training. There is also an independent contact for&#xD;
      potential participants to go to throughout the study.&#xD;
