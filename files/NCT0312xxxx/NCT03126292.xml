  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to conduct a 12-month pilot longitudinal study of a&#xD;
      parent-directed program delivered in a primary care setting serving primarily low-income&#xD;
      families. The parent-direction program will be evaluated in a randomized controlled design to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of protocol implementation and to investigate the potential impact&#xD;
      on parental outcomes. Process outcomes will include success with recruitment, participant&#xD;
      retention, and ability to collect outcome measures. Clinical outcomes will incorporate&#xD;
      measures of parental self-efficacy and parenting behaviors, including observational&#xD;
      assessments of parent-child interactions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Enriching parenting behaviors in early childhood promotes child development and offers a&#xD;
      promising strategy to reduce future educational disparities. However, current interventions&#xD;
      are limited by cost and have not been widely disseminated. Recognized as a target for&#xD;
      research to improve early childhood development and subsequent school readiness skills among&#xD;
      at-risk families, the primary care setting offers an ideal opportunity to reach the millions&#xD;
      of children living in poverty. However, what remains unknown is how to more efficiently&#xD;
      leverage the primary care setting to deliver a sustainable and effective preventive program&#xD;
      to promote positive parenting behaviors and encourage early childhood development in&#xD;
      low-income families. Therefore, the investigators designed Sit Down and Play (SDP) a brief&#xD;
      parent-directed program delivered in the primary care setting. Modeled after the widely&#xD;
      disseminated literacy program Reach Out and Read and grounded in social cognitive theory, SDP&#xD;
      is intended to take place during each pediatric well-child visit occurring in a child's first&#xD;
      two years with the goal of promoting positive parenting behaviors.&#xD;

    <description>Sit Down and Play (SDP) is designed to be a brief, low-cost intervention that incorporates key theoretical constructs to elicit positive parenting behaviors. It is intended to be delivered by existing clinical staff, nonprofessionals, or volunteers during each of the eight well-child visits between 2-24 months of age while a family waits to be seen by their pediatrician in the examination room.</description>
