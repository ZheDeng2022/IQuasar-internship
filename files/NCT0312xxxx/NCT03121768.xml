      A prospective observational study to re-establish a new prognostic model for predicting the&#xD;
      outcome in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) using the current&#xD;
      recommendation regimen for intermediate and high risk groups and including all potential and&#xD;
      highly prognostic factors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bladder urothelial carcinoma is the most common cancer of the urinary tract and is the 7th&#xD;
      most common cancer in males and the 7th most common cancer in females. Most of newly&#xD;
      diagnosed cases of urothelial cancer of the bladder are non-muscle invasive (NMIBC), and&#xD;
      including stages Ta, T1, or Carcinoma in situ (CIS). The initial management is endoscopic&#xD;
      resection, aiming at complete removal of all visible papillary lesions, and accurate staging&#xD;
      of the bladder tumor. The future plan is determined based on the results of histopathological&#xD;
      diagnosis and included either re-resection or adjuvant immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of recurrence and progression to muscle invasive disease after resection of&#xD;
      NMIBC reaches up to 42 % and 21%, respectively, concluding that alternative treatments are&#xD;
      urgently required. Therefore, the development of prognostic models is of ultimate importance&#xD;
      to minimize long-term morbidity and improve the outcome. The most commonly used&#xD;
      stratification systems are the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer&#xD;
      (EORTC) risk tables and the The Club Urologico Espanol de Tratamiento Oncologico (CUETO)&#xD;
      scoring model. The EORTC risk tables have been constructed based on 2596 patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with Ta/T1 urothelial bladder carcinoma. Nevertheless, there were low number of patients&#xD;
      treated with BCG (7%), as well as immediate postoperative instillation of chemotherapy&#xD;
      (&lt;10%); in addition, there was no second-look transurethral resection (re-TUR) of the bladder&#xD;
      was performed. The CUETO scoring model has been built based on a retrospective analysis of&#xD;
      1,062 patients underwent TUR of bladder tumor followed by 6-month BCG maintenance therapy.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the study was limited by the relatively old grading systems, lack of re-TUR or&#xD;
      immediate intravesical instillation, and inadequacy for determining the time of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pan et al have developed a prognostic nomogram from the retrospective analysis of 1366&#xD;
      patients with NMIBC classified according to the 2004 World Health Organization&#xD;
      WHO/International Society of Urologic Pathology grading system. Similarly, this study was&#xD;
      limited by the retrospective nature, lack of the current recommendations of immediate&#xD;
      intravesical instillation, and lack of studying other different prognostic factors .&#xD;
      Ali-El-Dein et al have constructed a nomogram for recurrence and progression based on a&#xD;
      retrospective analysis of more than 1000 patients from a single institution. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      there was heterogeneity on the adjuvant regimens, in addition, re-TUR were not performed in&#xD;
      all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Cambier et al have published their nomograms and risk stratification systems based&#xD;
      on a data from 1812 patients with intermediate risk and high risk NMIBC with adjuvant BCG&#xD;
      maintenance therapy 1-3 years. Although this study presents the first prognostic factor&#xD;
      analysis in NMIBC patients receiving the currently recommended 1-3 yr of maintenance BCG, it&#xD;
      has several limitations. There was no repeat transurethral resection in high risk patients&#xD;
      during the study period. In addition, there was no central pathology review, and there was no&#xD;
      data on upper tract status at time of recurrence or progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although all previously mentioned nomograms have demonstrated significant ability for&#xD;
      detecting the outcome after transurethral resection of bladder tumor. Neither of these papers&#xD;
      has included any other biological markers that have been proven to improve the predictive&#xD;
      ability. Recently, special emphasis has been focused on the relation between smoking with&#xD;
      recurrence and progression of NMIBC. It has been shown that smoking not only increases the&#xD;
      risk of disease recurrence and progression, but also Current and heavy long-term smokers seem&#xD;
      to be at the greatest risk for both end points. In addition, Ogihara et al have shown that a&#xD;
      positive smoking history was an independent predictor for NMIBC recurrence and refraining&#xD;
      from smoking for 15 years or more reduced the risk of tumor recurrence in former smokers with&#xD;
      regardless of the intensity or duration of smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation in the tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the proliferation and&#xD;
      survival of malignant cells through enhanced angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. The&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms include recruitment of T lymphocytes, chemokines, activated cytokines,&#xD;
      secretion of CRP, and neutrophilia . In a recent meta-analysis, Masson-Lecomte et al have&#xD;
      shown that among different inflammatory predictors, serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP),&#xD;
      Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and urinary and serum interleukin levels were the most&#xD;
      prognostic factors for bladder cancer prognosis. Furthermore, Kamat et al have shown that a&#xD;
      cytokine panel had the potential for identifying patients at risk of tumor recurrence during&#xD;
      BCG treatment. In addition, interleukin IL-2 have been shown to be the most prognostic&#xD;
      biomarker for response to BCG therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent meta-analysis including 15,215 patients, Martin-Doyle et al have shown that the&#xD;
      highest impact risk factor was depth of invasion into lamina propria. In addition,&#xD;
      lymphovascular invasion, associated carcinoma in situ, tumor size &gt; 3 cm, and older age were&#xD;
      independent predictors for progression and cancer specific survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, all publications investigating the outcome after treatment of NMIBC lack several&#xD;
      factors including the re-staging TUR, maintenance BCG therapy, inclusion of other highly&#xD;
      prognostic factors e.g. smoking, inflammatory biomarkers, depth of lamina invasion.&#xD;
      Therefore, this protocol is constructed to combine all clinically affordable biomarkers into&#xD;
      a prognostic model for predicting the outcome after NMIBC.&#xD;
