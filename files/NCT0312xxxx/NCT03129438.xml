      Continuous video-EEG monitoring (cEEG) significantly improves seizure or status epilepticus&#xD;
      detection in patients in intensive care units (ICUs), and is recommended for patients with&#xD;
      consciousness impairment. cEEG is time- and resource consuming as compared to routine EEG&#xD;
      (rEEG, lasting 20-30 minutes). While centers in North America have been using it&#xD;
      increasingly, most European hospitals still do not have resources to comply with these&#xD;
      guidelines. In addition, only one population-based study based on discharge diagnoses&#xD;
      suggested that cEEG may improve patients' outcome. Current guidelines are thus based upon&#xD;
      weak evidence and expert opinions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to assess if cEEG in adults with consciousness impairment is related to&#xD;
      an improvement of functional outcome, and to address the prognostic role of quantitative&#xD;
      network EEG analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, adults with GCS inferior or equal to 11 or&#xD;
      FOUR score inferior or equal to 12 will be randomized 1:1 to cEEG for 30-48 hours or two rEEG&#xD;
      within 48 hours. The primary outcome will be mortality at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      blindly assess functional outcome, seizure/status epilepticus detection rate, duration of ICU&#xD;
      stay, change in patient management (antiepileptic drug introduced, increased, or stopped,&#xD;
      brain imaging), and reimbursement. Additionally, quantitative EEG will be assessed towards&#xD;
      the primary outcome. 350 patients are planned to be included.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Continuous video-EEG monitoring (cEEG) is a non-invasive tool to monitor the&#xD;
      electrical brain function; it significantly improves seizure or status epilepticus detection&#xD;
      in comatose patients in intensive care units (ICUs), which often do not show any specific&#xD;
      clinical correlates. Recently, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine published&#xD;
      guidelines regarding the use of cEEG in the ICUs, recommending it for most patients with&#xD;
      consciousness disorders. cEEG is time- and resource consuming as compared to routine spot EEG&#xD;
      (rEEG, typically lasting 20-30 minutes). While centers in North America have been using it&#xD;
      increasingly, most European - and all Swiss - hospitals still do not have enough resources to&#xD;
      comply with these guidelines. In addition, while the superiority of cEEG to detect&#xD;
      non-convulsive seizures or status epilepticus is proven, only one population-based study&#xD;
      based on discharge diagnoses suggested that cEEG may improve patients' outcome. Current&#xD;
      guidelines are thus based upon weak evidence and expert opinions. If cEEG leads to improved&#xD;
      patients' care remains elusive. Moreover, little attention has been drawn towards&#xD;
      quantitative EEG information beyond visual analysis, and the impact of such information on&#xD;
      diagnosis, treatment, and outcome remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To assess whether the use of cEEG in patients with consciousness impairment is related&#xD;
      to an improvement of functional outcome, and to address the prognostic role of quantitative&#xD;
      network EEG analyses in this cohort. Also, a cost analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, adults with a Glasgow Coma Score&#xD;
      (GCS) inferior or equal to 11 or a FOUR score inferior or equal to 12, regardless of&#xD;
      etiologies, will be randomized 1:1 to cEEG for 30-48 hours or two rEEG within 48 hours,&#xD;
      interpreted in a standardized way. Patients with detected seizures in the last 36h or status&#xD;
      epilepticus in the last 96h will be excluded, as cEEG may represent the standard of care.&#xD;
      Demographics, etiology, Charlson Comorbidity Index, GCS, diagnosis leading to EEG, mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, and subsequent use of rEEG/cEEG will be collected. The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      mortality at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will blindly assess functional outcome at 4 weeks&#xD;
      and 6 months, as well as seizure/status epilepticus detection rate and time to detection,&#xD;
      infections rate, duration of ICU stay, change in patient management (antiepileptic drug&#xD;
      introduced, increased, or stopped, brain imaging), and reimbursement. Analyses will compare&#xD;
      the two interventional groups (intention to diagnose) regarding outcome, as a whole and&#xD;
      stratified according to etiological subgroups, and other variables of interest. Additionally,&#xD;
      lope cross correlation and horizontal visibility graphs will be applied to compute a weighted&#xD;
      adjacency matrix consisting of all the pairwise interdependences between EEG signals, in&#xD;
      order to characterize the integrative and segregative characteristics of the underlying&#xD;
      functional brain networks and compare their relationship with the primary outcome. According&#xD;
      to a previous estimate, patients with consciousness disorders undergoing cEEG have a 75%&#xD;
      survival rate; while patients w/o cEEG 61%. Using a power of 0.8, an Î± error of 0.05, and a&#xD;
      2-side approach, 2x174 patients would be needed to detect this significant difference in&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected impact: This study will clarify if cEEG monitoring has a significant impact on&#xD;
      functional outcome and define its cost effectiveness, and if network EEG analysis has a role&#xD;
      in outcome prognostication. The results of this study will have a considerable potential to&#xD;
      influence clinical practice regarding EEG and treatment of patients with altered levels of&#xD;
      consciousness. If results will indicate that cEEG contributes to improve outcome, this will&#xD;
      lead to the urgent need for implementation of cEEG with consecutive substantial impact on&#xD;
      health care and resource allocation in larger Swiss and European hospitals.&#xD;
