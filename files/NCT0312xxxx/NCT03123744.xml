  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigational drug being tested in this study is palbociclib. Palbociclib is considered&#xD;
      experimental because it is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of all cancers.&#xD;
      Palbociclib is currently approved for use in breast cancer. Palbociclib is a drug belonging&#xD;
      to a family of drugs called kinase inhibitors. These drugs slow or stop the activity of&#xD;
      particular proteins involved in the growth of human cells and in the abnormal growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells. Blocking these proteins may decrease or stop tumor growth. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the safety of the study drug, to see how well it is tolerated, and also to&#xD;
      find a safe dose range of the study drug in patients with specific kinds of tumor genetic&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to give the cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor palbociclib to&#xD;
      patients with advanced malignancy harboring cyclin pathway aberrations (CCN/CDK alterations).&#xD;
      The investigators study will determine whether cyclin signaling aberrations associate with&#xD;
      response to this CDK inhibitor. Once completed, this study will identify subpopulations of&#xD;
      patients that would best benefit from CDK inhibitor therapy with palbociclib and suggest&#xD;
      directions for future study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Age ≥ 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;

             more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subject is intolerant to standard therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subject refuses standard therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Malignancy is refractory to standard therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Malignancy relapsed after standard therapy&#xD;
