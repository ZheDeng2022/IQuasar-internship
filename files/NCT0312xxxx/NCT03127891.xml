      TITLE: EFFECT OF SHORT-TERM PRANAYAMA ON ANESTHESIA MANAGEMENT IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CARDIAC&#xD;
      SURGERY&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective randomized controlled pilot study. After Institutional Ethics&#xD;
      Committee approval and written informed consent patients aged 20-60 years and scheduled for&#xD;
      elective cardiac surgery will be assessed for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients admitted in the CT VS ward and awaiting elective surgery in the next 5-6 days&#xD;
      will be recruited. The patients will be divided randomly into two groups using random number&#xD;
      table; Group C: Control, Group Y: Yoga. Allocation will be done using sealed envelope&#xD;
      technique. The study will be conducted from October 2016 to December 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before any intervention the baseline haemodynamic parameters will be recorded and general&#xD;
      anxiety score will be measured using Spielberg's state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Y:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yoga sessions will be held for the patients during their hospitalization in the CTVS ward in&#xD;
      the evening in a dedicated YOGA room. A YOGA instructor will train the patients for the YOGA&#xD;
      sessions. Target is to give a minimum of 5 sessions of YOGA in this group of patient. yoga&#xD;
      training will be done for 60 min. The vital signs (HR, BP, and SPO2)of the patients before&#xD;
      and after each session will be recorded using multi-parameter vital sign monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;

           nostril.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exhale slowly and completely with the right nostril.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Again inhale through the right nostril and fill lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Close the right nostril by pressing it with the right thumb.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open the left nostril, breathe out slowly. Udgith Pranayama (10 min )&#xD;

&#xD;
             4. During exhalation &quot;AUM&quot; will be chanted for as long as their body allows.The&#xD;
                participant will not be stressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nadishodhana Pranayama (10 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient will be made to sit in a comfortable posture with spine erect and in line&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. The participant will be instructed to fold the index finger and middle finger of the&#xD;
           right hand in such a way that their tips touch the root of the right thumb. The ring&#xD;
           finger and little finger of right hand will be extended and placed on the left nostril.&#xD;
           Right thumb will be placed on right nostril&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The participant will be made to close the eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The right nostril will be closed and deep inhalation will be taken from the left&#xD;
           nostril.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The left nostril will be closed and exhalation will be carried out through the right&#xD;
           nostril.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Inhalation will be done through right nostril keeping the left nostril closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Exhalation will be done through left nostril keeping the right nostril closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. This will complete one round.&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. During exhalation, humming sound will be produced for as long as the participant's body&#xD;
           allows. They will not be stressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The vibration generated within the body will be felt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      YogNidra / Relaxation (15 min)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be made to lie down in Shavasana and made to follow the instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this group will not be given any yoga session and will thus act as a control&#xD;
      group. The vital signs (HR, BP, and SPO2)of the patients will be recorded using&#xD;
      multi-parameter vital sign monitors for the subsequent days after recruitment and group&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic management for cardiac surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety score will be measured by using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) on the day&#xD;
      of surgery. The hemodynamic parameters will be recorded for subsequent comparison of the&#xD;
      effect of Yoga.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be followed by insertion of a 16 G i.v cannula after giving local anesthetic with a&#xD;
      26 G needle. Following monitors will be attached: continuous pulse oximetry (SpO2),&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), periodic non-invasive blood pressure (S/Anesthesia monitor, Datex&#xD;
      Ohmeda Inc., Madison, WI), and continuous BIS (BIS XP, Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA in&#xD;
      the S/5 Anesthesia monitor). Pre-induction arterial line and the central line will be secured&#xD;
      in all patients after giving local anesthetic and continuous arterial blood pressure and&#xD;
      central venous pressure measurements will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction of anesthesia will be performed with propofol using closed-loop anesthesia delivery&#xD;
      system (CLADS) titrated to target BIS of 50 and fentanyl 3 mcg/kg in both groups. Muscular&#xD;
      paralysis for tracheal intubation will be achieved by vecuronium bromide 0.1mg/kg followed by&#xD;
      intermittent boluses. After intubation, volume-controlled mechanical ventilation to be&#xD;
      provided with FiO2 0.5, tidal volume 7-8 ml/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cm&#xD;
      H2O, and respiratory rate of 12-14/min. Patients will be mechanically ventilated with air:&#xD;
      oxygen mixture (50:50) to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) values between 30 and 35&#xD;
      mm Hg. Maintenance of anesthesia will be done with propofol infusion using CLADS titrated to&#xD;
      target BIS value of 40-60. Fentanyl infusion at 1.0 mcg/kg/h will be administered for&#xD;
      analgesia. Fentanyl 1 mcg/kg will be administered before sternotomy. Nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      temperature, urinary output, and ETCO2 will be recorded. CPB will be initiated after&#xD;
      heparinization with an intravenous dose of 3 mg/kg titrated to the ACT of 450 seconds.Every&#xD;
      20 min, cardioplegia will be repeated. The MAP will be maintained in the range 50-70 mm Hg&#xD;
      during CPB. Weaning from CPB will be performed in a stepwise manner. Appropriate inotropes&#xD;
      adrenaline/ noradrenaline/ dopamine/ milrinone will be used to maintain adequate tissue&#xD;
      perfusion and cardiac output. Fluid replacement will include crystalloid solutions with an&#xD;
      initial infusion rate 6-7 ml.kg.hr prior to and during anesthesia and 2- 3 ml/kg/hr&#xD;
      postoperatively. All the anesthesia drug consumption data will be recorded online using&#xD;
      CLADS.&#xD;
