  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different conditions of gait ignition freezing, spontaneous freezing during walking and&#xD;
      turning freezing on encountering obstacle will be investigated in fMRI study to examine&#xD;
      whether different regions of brain will be involved under different conditions of freezing.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that anterior cortical regions will engage in gait ignition failure, deep&#xD;
      locomotion regions will be responsible for spontaneous freezing and schema regions will be&#xD;
      involved in the generation of turning freezing on seeing the barrier. In the third part of&#xD;
      the project, we will deliver a 5-day session of transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) to the motor cortex of the FOG patients to examine whether the intervention will&#xD;
      benefit the patients. Based on the signal source findings, we will investigate whether the&#xD;
      possible tDCS beneficial effect will be different or similar in patients with different&#xD;
      electric sources. In addition, how long the possible beneficial effect of tDCS can be&#xD;
      consolidated after the 5-day course of stimulation is crucial and requires to be elucidated&#xD;
      under the research project. We aim to peep the myth of FOG in PD by the multi-modality&#xD;
      approach and hope the study will benefit the long suffering patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The diagnosis of freezing of gait will be made by the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Without video:Is there any feeling that your feet are transiently glued to the floor&#xD;
             while trying to initiate walking, making a turn or when walking through narrow spaces&#xD;
             or in crowded places? (Sometimes it can be accompanied with trembling of the legs and&#xD;
             small shuffling steps.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Additional instructions with video:We will watch a short video together to see the&#xD;
             many ways in which freezing can occur. Also, look carefully for how long these&#xD;
             episodes last, as you can expect some questions on this later.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is diagnosed to have freezing of gait if &quot;I have experienced such a feeling or&#xD;
             episode over the past month&quot; was answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Impairment of cognition that leads unable to fully cooperate with the oral commands&#xD;
             during examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Moderate to severe medical disorders such as functional III or above congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, or cancer with distant metastasis etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hoehn and Yahr stage 5.&#xD;
