    <textblock>
      This protocol establishes a research oriented psychological treatment clinic within the&#xD;
      Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology (GSAPP), called the Dialectical&#xD;
      Behavior Therapy Rutgers University Research Program (DBT-RU). The overall aim of the&#xD;
      proposed research is to find ways to improve therapist training in existing treatments for&#xD;
      complex and difficult-to-treat problems (e.g., DBT, prolonged exposure), develop new and more&#xD;
      effective treatments, and improve understanding of severe psychopathology. Consequently, this&#xD;
      proposed research will have four branches: (1) training of research clinicians and evaluation&#xD;
      of training methods; (2) training of clinical evaluators for the research studies and&#xD;
      evaluation of assessment training methods; (3) assessment of treatment outcome, including&#xD;
      assessment of mediators and moderators of change (both clinician and client data); (4)&#xD;
      assessment and analyses of psychopathology of subject populations who participate in the&#xD;
      DBT-RU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DBT is an evidence-based and empirically supported treatment for borderline personality&#xD;
      disorder (BPD), suicide, and self-injury. DBT is traditionally administered for a minimum of&#xD;
      6 months in an outpatient setting but has been adapted to be used in other treatment settings&#xD;
      (e.g., intensive outpatient). DBT consists of multiple key components, including weekly&#xD;
      individual therapy, group skills training, and option to engage in out-of-session contact&#xD;
      with their provider via telephone to receive coaching on how to use DBT skills to manage&#xD;
      real-life issues (e.g., urges to harm self). To date, more than a dozen randomized control&#xD;
      trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies have been conducted, and compared to 12 months&#xD;
      of treatment as usual (TAU), DBT has been shown to result in significantly greater reduction&#xD;
      in frequency and severity of self-injurious behaviors, inpatient hospitalizations, suicidal&#xD;
      ideation, and substance abuse (see Panos, Jackson, Hasan, &amp; Panos, 2014 ). This research aims&#xD;
      to (1) advance our understanding of underlying mechanisms driving treatment outcomes; (2)&#xD;
      isolate the effects of particular components and strategies employed in DBT on various&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g., suicide), (3) enhance training and evaluation methods for research&#xD;
      clinicians; (4) test to see if benefits in DBT are sustained over a period of time beyond&#xD;
      follow-up; and (5) advance our knowledge of how DBT operates in everyday life to reduce&#xD;
      day-to-day emotion dysregulation and related target behaviors (e.g., suicidal behavior).&#xD;
