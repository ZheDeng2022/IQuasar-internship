    <textblock>
      This study is enrolling healthy women ages 18-39yo who are not pregnant or breastfeeding, and&#xD;
      are not using hormonal birth control. Initial screening visit will include a blood draw to&#xD;
      assess if the participant has recently ovulated. If hormone test indicates ovulation&#xD;
      occurred, participant will start the study 8 days after the start of their next menstrual&#xD;
      period. On this study visit, vaginal ultrasound will be performed to look the ovaries for&#xD;
      follicles. Vaginal ultrasound is then performed approximately every 2 days until the dominant&#xD;
      follicle has grown into the size group assigned. When this occurs the participant will place&#xD;
      the NuvaRing®, inside the vagina and blood will be drawn for hormone levels. Participant will&#xD;
      then return daily the next 5 days (total of 6 daily visits) for vaginal ultrasound and blood&#xD;
      draw to assess for signs of ovulation. After the 7th day the ring is in the vagina, the&#xD;
      participant will remove the ring from her vagina at home. After removal, there will be twice&#xD;
      weekly clinic visits for ultrasound and blood draw until menstrual bleeding occurs. At this&#xD;
      point, participation in the study is complete. Participants are compensated for their time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be comprised of healthy, non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding, reproductive age&#xD;
      women with regular, ovulatory cycles who are protected from unintended pregnancy via the&#xD;
      concurrent use of non-hormonal methods of contraception. Participants will have a mid-luteal&#xD;
      screening visit, which will include: informed consent, history, physical, vitals, and&#xD;
      assessment of mid-luteal serum progesterone to confirm ovulatory status. Each participant&#xD;
      will be assigned to one of three groups according the size of the leading follicle (12-14mm,&#xD;
      15-17mm, ≥18mm), which will determine the timing of the placement of the ENG/EE CVR.&#xD;
      Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) will be performed three times per week, starting on day 8 of&#xD;
      the menstrual cycle, until the leading follicle is within the assigned group. On that day the&#xD;
      CVR will be placed and, including day of placement, there will be 6 daily visits with&#xD;
      hormonal assays (progesterone, luteinizing hormone) and TVUS to assess for signs of&#xD;
      ovulation. Compliance with CVR placement will be assessed through the measurement of serum&#xD;
      ENG. After 7 days, participants will remove the CVR at home. Participants will then have&#xD;
      biweekly visits until onset of menses to obtain serum progesterone levels and TVUS to assess&#xD;
      for signs of delayed ovulation.&#xD;
