    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the impact of a system called CareSage. The CareSage&#xD;
      system is a technology that uses clinical data to monitor, identify and target care to&#xD;
      patients at risk of being transported to the hospital. The investigators want to see whether&#xD;
      the CareSage system is effective in helping to identify hospital admissions which can be&#xD;
      prevented.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The growing elderly population and rising rates of costly chronic disease have led to the&#xD;
      development of preventative homecare management opportunities to improve health outcomes and&#xD;
      reduce the number of patients who enter costly inpatient care. Partners HealthCare at Home&#xD;
      (PHH) is a preventative homecare management system which offers general care as well as&#xD;
      specialized services to help patients and their loved ones manage chronic conditions at home.&#xD;
      Such continuity of care is achieved through a multidisciplinary clinical team and the&#xD;
      integration of telemonitoring into the patient's care plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Philips Lifeline Personal Emergency Response Service (PERS), a wearable button device&#xD;
      worn on the wrist or as a pendant, is a telemonitoring device available to patients receiving&#xD;
      care through PHH. When the patient presses the button, the patient is immediately connected&#xD;
      with a Lifeline response agent. Philips Lifeline (PLL) has developed CareSage, a predictive&#xD;
      analytics engine that combines continuous monitoring with predictive analytics. The clinical&#xD;
      interface (CareSage platform) helps care teams monitor the patient's calculated risk scores&#xD;
      for emergency transport. The algorithm used by this integrated risk assessment system was&#xD;
      originally developed after studying a large cohort of the PERS subscribers (N = ~600,000). In&#xD;
      Phase 1 of this study the algorithm was validated among a cohort (N = 3,335) of PHH patients&#xD;
      to predict emergency transports in this population (AUC = .76).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2 of this study, the investigators will conduct a prospective, randomized trial of&#xD;
      370 patients to assess the effect of the risk assessment CareSage platform and PHH tailored&#xD;
      interventions on the rate of readmissions, quality of life, and the overall cost of medical&#xD;
      care. The investigators hypothesize that a multidisciplinary intervention approach could&#xD;
      significantly reduce the healthcare resource utilization in patient at high risk for&#xD;
      hospitalization. The intervention will flag those patients at the highest risk for hospital&#xD;
      transport, alert the patient's care team that an intervention may be needed, thereby&#xD;
      targeting care at high risk patients who are most likely to get readmitted. By predicting&#xD;
      which patients are at high risk of hospital transport which may lead to hospitalization,&#xD;
      targeting interventions at those patients and engaging patients with their care team, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to reduce readmissions, hospital days, and rates of mortality in high risk&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this 2-arm randomized controlled study is to assess the impact of the CareSage&#xD;
      risk assessment platform on 90- and 180-day Emergency Department (ED) visits in a cohort of&#xD;
      PHH patients. All patients will receive the PERS device and be followed for a total of 9&#xD;
      months, including an initial 3-month observation period and followed by a 6-month&#xD;
      intervention period. At the beginning of the observation period (baseline), enrolled patients&#xD;
      will be randomized into 2 groups: the Intervention Group or the Control Group. During the&#xD;
      observation period the CareSage algorithm will calibrate using patient data (both groups)&#xD;
      collected during this interval from the PERS device. Then, during the intervention period,&#xD;
      patients in the intervention group will be actively monitored by the CareSage algorithm and&#xD;
      will receive tailored PHH interventions if flagged as being at high risk for emergency&#xD;
      transport. Patients in the control group will receive care as usual during the intervention&#xD;
      period. All data collected during the study will be used to further strengthen the CareSage&#xD;
      algorithm developed in the Phase I of this study.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the intervention group will receive active monitoring by the CareSage risk assessment platform and clinical interface, including nurse triage calls and tailored PHH interventions. Beginning at month 4, the CareSage algorithm will assess patients' risk for emergency transport every 30 days. Patients identified as high risk will receive nurse triage calls and, depending on their needs, tailored care according to a stepped-care approach. The principal goals will be to reinforce the patients' education, ensure compliance with medications and diet, and identify recurrent symptoms amenable to treatment on an outpatient basis to avoid readmissions</description>
