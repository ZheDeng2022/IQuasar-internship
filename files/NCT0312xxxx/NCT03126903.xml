        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

                  pre-operative glaucoma or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. multiple (two or more) failed cornea transplantation surgeries and spontaneous&#xD;
                  visual improvement without surgical intervention is not expected or probable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (Snellen) which is equal or worse than 20/200 in&#xD;
             the study eye (but at least light perception with projection)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated visual potential of the study eye is greater than or equal to at least two&#xD;
             lines visual improvement of BCDVA of current vision in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient and/or caregiver willing and able to insert and remove bandage contact lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visual Acuity of No Light Perception (NLP) in the study eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is monocular or the non-study eye has Best Corrected Distance Visual&#xD;
             Acuity (Snellen) of worse than 20/160 due to an ocular condition other than severe&#xD;
             aniridic limbal stem cell deficiency or failed cornea transplantation surgery(ies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suitable for standard PK with donor tissue in the study eye.&#xD;

             intravitreal injection, etc.) unless the vision is at least light perception with&#xD;
             projection in four field quadrants and the macula is attached (if there is no view of&#xD;
             the retina, an ultrasound must show the macula is attached).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of uncontrolled glaucoma in either eye (IOP has been measured above 25 mmHg at&#xD;
             any time in the last 6 months).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Vertical cup-to-disc (C:D) ratio greater than or equal to 0.8 in either eye (if able&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Limited visual potential (patient does not have the ability to improve a minimum of&#xD;
             two lines of vision of BCDVA by history).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of amblyopia in the study eye limiting visual potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the patient has had a corneal transplant, corneal transplantation surgery was&#xD;
             performed less than 2 years ago.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active ocular infection in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypotony in the study eye (IOP &lt; 6mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Corneal thickness less than 400 microns in any region of the pachymetry map, i.e.&#xD;
&#xD;
        lamellar resection depth would be &lt;100 microns from corneal endothelium accounting for the&#xD;
        optic height of the selected implant design (i.e. 300 microns for KeraKlear or 500 microns&#xD;
        for KeraKlear XT model).*.&#xD;
