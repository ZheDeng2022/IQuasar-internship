             administering LUM/IVA to the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of drug intolerance or other serious reactions to LUM/IVA in Study 115B that&#xD;
             would pose an additional risk to the subject in the opinion of investigator, and which&#xD;

             interruption at the completion of Study 115B, for which no convincing alternative&#xD;
             etiology is identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTc value at the completion of Study 115B that would pose an additional risk to the&#xD;
