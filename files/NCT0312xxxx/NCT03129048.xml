  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The deleterious effects of obesity on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic risk factors&#xD;
      (dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance) are well-documented. Recent evidence&#xD;
      also links obesity to cognitive decline and dementia. Dietary patterns are central to the&#xD;
      development and maintenance of obesity and certain dietary patterns may contribute to the&#xD;
      onset and progression of cognitive decline. With the rapid aging of the US population and the&#xD;
      high prevalence of obesity among older adults, innovative lifestyle strategies to prevent&#xD;
      cognitive decline among ethnically diverse obese older adults are critically needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States, affecting as many as&#xD;
      80 million Americans. It is well-established that obesity contributes to a number of risk&#xD;
      factors for metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. In addition, there is growing evidence that&#xD;
      obesity is associated with cognitive deficits in multiple domains, even in otherwise healthy&#xD;
      older adults. With the rapidly aging US population and the high prevalence of obesity among&#xD;
      older adults, innovative strategies to prevent cognitive decline in this population are&#xD;
      needed. Dietary patterns are central to the development and maintenance of obesity and&#xD;
      evidence suggests that dietary factors also may affect cognition. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      adherence to a Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) is associated with less cognitive decline and&#xD;
      reduced risk for dementia in older adults. Weight loss through caloric restriction also has&#xD;
      been shown to improve cognitive function in obese adults. Both the MedDiet and weight loss&#xD;
      are thought to improve cognition in obese individuals and reduce CVD/metabolic risk through&#xD;
      beneficial changes in systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. The identification of&#xD;
      effective lifestyle interventions for diet/weight management to improve cognition among obese&#xD;
      older adults is a public health priority. However, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs)&#xD;
      have examined the effect of the MedDiet with and without caloric restriction, to promote&#xD;
      weight loss on cognitive functioning in obese older adults. The investigators propose a&#xD;
      three-arm RCT in which 180 obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 and &lt; 50 kg/m²) older adults&#xD;
      (55-80 years) will be randomized to: 1) an 8-month MedDiet Alone, without caloric&#xD;
      restriction/weight loss (MedDiet-A); 2) an 8-month MedDiet lifestyle intervention with&#xD;
      caloric restriction/weight loss (MedDiet-WL); or 3) an 8-month typical diet control (TDC)&#xD;
      without caloric restriction/weight loss. The investigators will test the following&#xD;
      hypotheses: 1) participants randomized to MedDiet-A and MedDiet-WL will achieve greater&#xD;
      improvements in cognition compared to participants randomized to TDC; 2) participants&#xD;
      randomized to MedDiet-WL will exhibit greater improvements in cognition compared to&#xD;
      participants randomized to MedDiet-A; 3) participants randomized to MedDiet-A and MedDiet-WL&#xD;
      will show greater improvements in CVD/metabolic risk factors, systemic inflammation,&#xD;
      OxStress, and body weight/composition compared to participants in TDC; 4) participants&#xD;
      randomized to MedDiet-WL will exhibit greater improvements in CVD/metabolic risk factors,&#xD;
      systemic inflammation, OxStress, and body weight/composition compared to MedDiet-A; 5)&#xD;
      improvements in CVD/metabolic risk factors, body composition, systemic inflammation, and&#xD;
      OxStress will mediate the relationship between MedDiet and improved cognition. The&#xD;
      investigators also will determine the extent to which changes in dietary habits, weight and&#xD;
      cognitive functioning are maintained over a 6-month follow-up period.&#xD;
