    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay for the&#xD;
      improvement of near vision in presbyopic patients with treatments to optimize the ocular&#xD;
      surface before corneal inlay surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The surgical procedure includes a low dose, short duration mitomycin C (MMC) treatment on the&#xD;
      exposed stromal bed of the non-dominant eye, before the unilateral implantation of the&#xD;
      corneal inlay. This treatment is at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL (0.02%) applied for 10 to 30&#xD;
      seconds on the stromal bed as well as the stromal side of the corneal flap or pocket. In the&#xD;
      third month after surgical procedure, a one-drop a day of low dose steroid (initiated in the&#xD;
      second month postoperative) will be continued for the duration of the 24-month follow-up&#xD;
      period to maintain corneal health. Only a portion of patients will receive treatments to&#xD;
      optimize the ocular surface preoperatively, and their clinical outcomes will be statistically&#xD;
      compared against the portion not receiving the preoperative optimization.&#xD;

Omega-3 vitamin supplements should also be provided, initiated and dosed according to standard clinical practice, to maximize ocular surface health.</description>
