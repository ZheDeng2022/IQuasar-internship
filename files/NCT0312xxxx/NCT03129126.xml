  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of three doses of LP-10&#xD;
      (intravesical tacrolimus). Twelve subjects meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be enrolled and treated in a prospective and multi-center trial with LP-10. The proposed&#xD;
      trial will recruit 12 subjects in a dose-escalation trial where 4 subjects will be allocated&#xD;
      into each one of three groups.&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, dose-ranging study including male and female subjects with refractory&#xD;
      moderate to severe hemorrhagic cystitis as determined by a physician. A total of up to 12&#xD;
      subjects are anticipated and will be enrolled in study sites in the United States. Enrollment&#xD;
      is expected to be completed within one year of initiating the study. The proposed trial will&#xD;
      recruit 12 subjects in a dose-escalation trial where 4 subjects will be allocated into each&#xD;
      one of three groups.&#xD;
