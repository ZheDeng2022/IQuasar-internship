      This is an Expanded Access to Investigational Drug program available through the FDA. Some&#xD;
      specific conditions to qualify for this program includes gastroesophageal reflux disease with&#xD;
      upper GI symptoms, gastroparesis, and chronic constipation. Patients failing standard&#xD;
      therapies for these conditions may be eligible to receive domperidone. This program&#xD;
      facilitates availability of investigational drugs, (such as domperidone) to patients with&#xD;
      serious diseases or conditions when there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative&#xD;
      therapy to diagnose, monitor or treat the patients's disease or condition. Authorization must&#xD;
      be obtained from FDA prior to the importation, interstate shipment and administration of&#xD;
      domperidone.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Age 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Symptoms or manifestations secondary to motility disorders of the upper GI tract.&#xD;
             These include gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease&#xD;
             that are refractory to standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have a comprehensive evaluation to eliminate other causes of their&#xD;
             symptoms. This includes a history and physical examination. A recent (within 3 years)&#xD;
             evaluation of the upper GI tract with either upper endoscopy or upper GI radiographic&#xD;
             series. Baseline blood tests suggested are electrolytes, magnesium, and prolactin&#xD;
             level.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has signed informed consent for the administration of domperidone that informs&#xD;
             the patient of potential adverse events including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Increased prolactin levels&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Breast changes&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Extrapyramidal side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cardiac arrhythmias including QT prolongation (increased risk with the drugs&#xD;
                  listed in the appendix)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of, or current, arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular&#xD;
        fibrillation and Torsade des Pointes. Patients with minor forms of ectopy (PACs) are not&#xD;
        necessarily excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinically significant bradycardia, sinus node dysfunction, or heart block. Prolonged&#xD;
        QTc (QTc &gt; 450 milliseconds for males, QTc &gt; 470 milliseconds for females).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinically significant electrolyte disorders. These include significant hypokalemia,&#xD;
        hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypermagnesemia that cannot be corrected with treatment&#xD;
        of these electrolyte abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage or obstruction. 5. Presence of a prolactinoma&#xD;
        (prolactin-releasing pituitary tumor). 6. Pregnant or breast feedings female. 7. Known&#xD;
        allergy to domperidone.&#xD;
