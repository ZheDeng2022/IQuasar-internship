  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate differences in ILC2 blood levels&#xD;
      between asthma patients and control patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To show that ILC2 levels differ between asthma patients with a &quot;TH2&quot; (helper T cell type 2)&#xD;
      profile and asthma patients with a &quot;non-TH2&quot; profile. A TH2 profile is defined as (for a&#xD;
      given patient):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  circulating eosinophils &gt; 500 mm^3 at least once during the year AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  positive allergy skin or specific IgE (Immunoglobulin E) test AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  induced sputum eosinophil level &gt;3% of leukocytes AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exhaled nitric oxide &gt; 25 ppb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the variation in ILC2 levels over time among asthma patients who obtained a good&#xD;
      level of control compared to other patients. A good level of control is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no exacerbations during 6 months of followup (an exacerbation is defined as the&#xD;
           un-planned need for care that modifies the patient's prescription for &gt;48h)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) value current / FEV1 best value &gt; 0.8&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  symptom levels correspond to an ACQ (Asthma Control Questionnaire) questionnaire score&#xD;
           of &lt; 0.75 over the last 7 days&#xD;
