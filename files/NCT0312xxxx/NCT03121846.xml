  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective, Open-label, Single-Arm, Multi-center phase II clinical trial&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of Apatinib for Chemotherapy Failure Ⅳ Stage Soft Tissue&#xD;
      Sarcoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of sarcoma patients in stage IV is poor. For STS, the response rate of&#xD;
      chemotherapy is only 20-35% and the median survival time is about 12 months. The 5 year&#xD;
      survival rate is lower than 10% reported in several large-scale studies. Although&#xD;
      chemotherapy plays a major role in the treatment of advanced STS, the classic chemotherapy&#xD;
      agents are not curative. Combination chemotherapy or dose-dense regimens have largely failed&#xD;
      to improve the response rates. Long-term using of cytotoxic drugs increased the risk of&#xD;
      toxicity in patients. Apatinib is a small molecular inhibitor of Vascular Epithelial Growth&#xD;
      Factor Receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). It has been approved as a second-line treatment for advanced&#xD;
      gastric cancer. Several phase III clinical studies of non small cell lung cancer, liver&#xD;
      cancer, colorectal cancer and other tumors also showed apatinib has less toxic side effects&#xD;
      and better patient tolerance. However, the clinical application of apatinib in STS is still&#xD;
      lack of evidence-based medicine. And this clinical trial is designed to prospectively&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in stage IV sarcoma patients who failed in&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
