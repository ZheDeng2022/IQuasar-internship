      An open-label, non-randomized, two-stage, multicenter study evaluating clinical efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, and pharmacokinetics effects of PQR309 in patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stage of the study will enroll a minimum of 12 patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) evaluable for the primary study objective. If&#xD;
      during the first stage of the study data emerge that 80 mg p.o. qd is not adequately&#xD;
      tolerated or is inefficacious in patients with relapsed or refractory Primary Central Nervous&#xD;
      System Lymphoma (PCNSL), additional patients may be enrolled in the study to evaluate&#xD;
      alternative dosing regimens, either a lower daily dose (eg. 60 mg) or a lower weekly dose&#xD;
      with administration on 2 consecutive days followed by 5 days without treatment in 7-day&#xD;
      treatment cycles (intermittent dosing schedule A).In all cases data from at least 12&#xD;
      evaluable patients will be required on the selected dosing regimen (daily or weekly) before&#xD;
      the decision is made to proceed with this regimen into the second stage of the study.Nine (9)&#xD;
      additional patients will be enrolled for the second stage of the study, for a minimum of 21&#xD;
      patients on the selected dosing regimen in total, evaluable for the final primary endpoint&#xD;
      analysis.All patients evaluable for the primary endpoint will be followed until disease&#xD;
      progression or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives, PQR309 treatment safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) will be evaluated in&#xD;
      all enrolled patients in both study stages.&#xD;
