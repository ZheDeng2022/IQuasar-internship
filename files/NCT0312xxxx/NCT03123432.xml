  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The survey is a phase IV, prospective randomized clinical trial to determine whether an&#xD;
      immunomodulating nutrient-enriched diet compared to a standard diet can improve nutritional&#xD;
      status and reduce postoperative infection and surgery-induced immune suppression in patients&#xD;
      with gastric cancer or GIST undergoing major surgery in a single medical center.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To evaluate the effect of immunomodulating diets on the postoperative inflammatory&#xD;
           response: including interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis&#xD;
           factor-α (TNF-α).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1). Biochemistry parameters: glucose,blood urine nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, sodium, and leukocyte count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2). Nutritional status: albumin, prealbumin, BMI (3). Adverse events (4). Clinical outcomes:&#xD;
      postoperative complications, time to first bowel action and length of hospital stay after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects: Eligible patients will be randomized in 2 arms in the ratio of 1:1, to&#xD;
      reach 15 patients at least in each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This is a randomized, comparative, double blinded study in 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Schedule Study date: the time getting approval letter issued by both regulatory&#xD;
           authority and institutional review board (IRB). Duration of the study: 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Duration of Treatment: Treatment was administered before curative surgery for gastric&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma or gastric GIST, and postoperative day 5-14 or to discharge whichever&#xD;
           occurred first, or consent withdrawal during any time of the study, when the patient&#xD;
           would be withdrawn.&#xD;

    <description>Patients received oral feeding with an ordinary diet plus 400 mL/day (400 kcal/day) of the immunomodulating nutrients enriched diet for 3-5 days before curative surgery for gastric adenocarcinoma or gastric GIST. On postoperative day 3, enteral nutrition (EN) was initiated with 5% glucose in water at a rate of 20 mL/h. On postoperative day 4, patients received a semi-liquid diet plus 400 mL/day (400 kcal/day) of the immunomodulating nutrients enriched diet. From postoperative day 5-14 or to discharge whichever occurred first, 1200 mL/day (1200 kcal/day) of the interventional diet was administered, and an oral soft diet was also administered if no postoperative complications developed and if oral feeding was not prohibited.</description>
