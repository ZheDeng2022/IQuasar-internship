  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With advances in interventional cardiac catheterization, ventricular septal defect (VSD)&#xD;
      could be successfully treated via transcatheter device closure. Cardiac catheterization team&#xD;
      of National Taiwan University Children's Hospital has recently treated more than 60 patients&#xD;
      with VSD using this technique. Both treatment effect and follow-up results were encouraging.&#xD;
      Of particular notice is that many patients experienced subjective improvement in exercise&#xD;
      tolerance after VSD closure. Traditionally, VSD could only be repaired by open-heart surgery&#xD;
      under cardiopulmonary bypass. Therefore, VSD closure would be considered only for those with&#xD;
      moderate to large defect, significant heart failure, or presenting with significant exercise&#xD;
      intolerance. With the success in transcatheter closure of VSD, a procedure which is safer and&#xD;
      leading to faster recovery comparing to cardiac surgery, device closure of VSD would be a&#xD;
      reasonable and sensible treatment of choice if it is beneficial for long-term cardiac&#xD;
      function and exercise performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will prospectively enroll 50 patients with VSDs subject to transcatheter closure&#xD;
      of the defect in our institute. Before device closure and 6 months after closure,&#xD;
      participants will be assessed with image studies (including speckle tracking and tissue&#xD;
      Doppler echocardiography), measurements of serum biomarkers (including B-type natriuretic&#xD;
      peptide and biomarkers of collagen metabolism), and standard cardiopulmonary exercise test.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential benefits of closing VSD with&#xD;
      respect to cardiac function and exercise performance, which might serve as basis to redefine&#xD;
      future indication of VSD closure.&#xD;

      The investigators will enroll 50 consecutive patients with VSDs from the outpatient clinic of&#xD;
      National Taiwan University Children's Hospital and Yi-Da Hospital. All participants will&#xD;
      receive transcatheter VSD closure after comprehensive discussion with the clinical physicians&#xD;
      and the performing clinicians. However, the investigators do not assign such treatment to the&#xD;
      subjects of the study, and are not involved in treatment decision making. The inclusion&#xD;
      criteria included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. subject to transcatheter device closure of VSD (mostly using Amplatzer ductal occluder I&#xD;
           and II for perimembranous VSD, and Amplatzer muscular VSD occluder for muscular VSD)&#xD;
           based on clinical need;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. age between 12-60 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with following conditions will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. additional hemodynamically significant structural anomalies, including more than mild&#xD;
           degree of VSD-related aortic regurgitation or right ventricular outflow tract&#xD;
           obstruction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. pulmonary hypertension documented during cardiac catheterization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. musculoskeletal anomalies limiting the performance of exercise testing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. taking cardiac medications within 6 months of enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. having alcohol abuse, coronary artery disease, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
           liver disease, renal insufficiency, metabolic bone disease, autoimmune disease, and&#xD;
           received operation or having a history of trauma within 6 months of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will provide written informed consent, and the institutional review&#xD;
      committee approved the study protocol. This study conformed to the principles of the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocols Participants will receive following paired evaluations both before VSD&#xD;
      closure and 6 months after VSD closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Echocardiography The echocardiographic studies will be performed with a commercially&#xD;
           available ultrasonography system (iE33, Philips, Andover, Massachusetts). The size of&#xD;
           VSD and diameter of aortic annulus will be recorded. The severity of valvular&#xD;
           regurgitation will be carefully assessed using standard criteria.5 Global LV function&#xD;
           will be assessed by measuring LV end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions and the LV&#xD;
           ejection fraction using the modified biplane Simpson's rule. E- and A-wave velocity of&#xD;
           mitral inflow, E-wave deceleration time, isovolumic relaxation time, and pre-ejection&#xD;
           time and ejection of LV will be measured using conventional Doppler echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pulsed-wave tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) will be recorded at medial and lateral mitral&#xD;
           annulus at apical 4-chamber view. Five consecutive beats will be recorded from each&#xD;
           view. Global LV strain and strain rate will be assessed with 2D speckle tracking&#xD;
           analysis at the apical four-chamber view and parasternal short-axis view&#xD;
           (mid-ventricular level). Frame rates ranges from 40 to 100 frames/s. During analysis the&#xD;
           endocardial border will be manually traced at end-systole and the region of interest&#xD;
           width adjusted to include the entire myocardium. The software then automatically tracks&#xD;
           the motion of the region of interest. The tracking will avoid areas with VSD (before&#xD;
           closure) and device in situ (after closure). Longitudinal, radial, and circumferential&#xD;
           strain/strain rates will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX) The symptom-limited exercise test was performed on a&#xD;
           cycle ergometer (Corival; Lode BV, Zernikepark 16, Groningen, the Netherland) in an&#xD;
           upright position, using a ramp wise increase of load depending on the expected&#xD;
           individual physical capacity. Oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production&#xD;
           (VCO2), and minute ventilation (VE) were measured using a breath-by-breath automatic gas&#xD;
           analyzer (Cortex MetaMax 3B system, Leipzig, Germany), and the peak respiratory exchange&#xD;
           ratio (RER, defined as the ratio of VCO2 to VO2) was recorded. The peak exercise rating&#xD;
           of perceived exertion was measured using the Borg scale of perceived exertion (from 6 to&#xD;
           20).&#xD;
&#xD;
           To evaluate the peak exercise capacity, present study enrolled only patients who&#xD;
           achieved maximal exercise effort, which was defined as a peak RER ≥ 1.10, and whose&#xD;
           rating of perceived exertion was at least 15 on the Borg scale 6. The 2 maximal exercise&#xD;
           parameters, peak VO2, and heart rate reserve, were evaluated. The technical details of&#xD;
           measuring peak VO2 have been published elsewhere 7. Peak VO2 was then expressed as the&#xD;
           percentage of the predicted value.8, 9, and a percentage of the predicted peak VO2 ≤ 70%&#xD;
           was defined as significant exercise intolerance.10 The heart rate reserve was calculated&#xD;
           as the difference between peak and resting heart rates.11 Two submaximal exercise&#xD;
           parameters were also evaluated. The relationship between oxygen consumption and&#xD;
           ventilation was evaluated according to the oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES). This&#xD;
           was calculated by performing a linear regression of VO2 on the common logarithm of VE by&#xD;
           using the equation VO2 = a log (VE) + b. The slope &quot;a&quot; represents the rate of increase&#xD;
           in VO2 in response to an increase in VE, and is the called the OUES,12 which was&#xD;
           subsequently expressed as the percentage of predicted values.13 In addition, the VE/VCO2&#xD;
           slope, which represents the relationship between ventilation and carbon dioxide&#xD;
           production, was calculated. This parameter was obtained by performing linear regression&#xD;
           analysis of the data acquired throughout the entire period of the exercise. 14&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measurement of serum biomarkers Venous blood samples will be obtained before CMR study.&#xD;
           Serum will be isolated within 30 min of phlebotomy and stored at -80°C prior to&#xD;
           simultaneous analysis of biomarkers of collagen metabolism. Serum carboxy-terminal&#xD;
           propeptide of procollagen type I (PICP) concentration will be determined by sandwich&#xD;
           enzyme immunosorbent assay using the METRA EIA kit (Quidel, San Diego, California, USA),&#xD;
           and carboxy-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (CITP) will be determined using a&#xD;
           commercial radioimmunoassay (Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland).15 The PICP:CITP ratio&#xD;
           was considered an index of the degree of coupling between the synthesis and degradation&#xD;
           of collagen type I.15 Serum levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 will be analyzed using&#xD;
           commercially available 2-site sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Quantikine R&amp;D&#xD;
           Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA).16 The sera of all subjects will be sent to the&#xD;
           measurement of plasma BNP levels utilizing the Biosite Triage BNP test (Biosite, San&#xD;
           Diego, Calif).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Other investigations Standard 12-lead ECGs will be acquired with a commercially&#xD;
           available ECG machine and software (ECGLAB 3.0, powered by DM software Inc., USA,&#xD;
           MEIGAOYI Corp). Averaged QRS duration, QT interval, and QTc interval among all 12 leads&#xD;
           will be calculated and reviewed by two experienced cardiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General health-related QoL will be assessed by using the shortened Taiwanese version of the&#xD;
      QoL questionnaire of the World Health Organization (WHOQOL-BREF-Taiwan), which has been used&#xD;
      in adolescents and adults with congenital heart disease previously.17 The following clinical&#xD;
      data will be collected from patients' medical records and at the time of clinical&#xD;
      evaluations: body weight and height, blood pressure, clinical symptoms and signs suggesting&#xD;
      heart failure, New York Heart Association functional class, and hemodynamic data obtained&#xD;
      during cardiac catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Case number estimation: Based on previous published data in patients&#xD;
      with small VSDs, the average peak VO2 is 92% of the predicted, with a standard deviation of&#xD;
      21%. It is assumed that a difference in absolute value of peak VO2 &gt; 20% (i.e., difference &gt;&#xD;
      18.4% of predicted) is not likely attributed to the learning effect. In addition, it is&#xD;
      assumed that a standard deviation of difference of 30%. If the alpha value was set at 0.05,&#xD;
      and the power at 0.80, then the estimated sample size sufficient to detect meaningful changes&#xD;
      in peak VO2 after VSD closure would be 2 × [(1.96 + 0.842)2 × (30%)2] / (18.4%)2 = 42.&#xD;
      Therefore, present project would have sufficient case number to explore changes in exercise&#xD;
      performance after VSD closure if all cases (n = 50) complete follow-up protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: Data will be expressed as percentage, mean ± standard deviation, or median&#xD;
      (25th-75th percentile), as appropriate. Continuous variables will be analyzed using the&#xD;
      two-sample t test or the Mann-Whitney U test, after testing for normality. Categorical&#xD;
      variables will be analyzed by the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate.&#xD;
      Paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used to compare data before and after VSD&#xD;
      closure. Potential parameters predicting improvement in exercise performance will be&#xD;
      identified using ROC curve analysis. The cut-off values of these predictors will be chosen&#xD;
      based on best sum of sensitivity and specificity. All statistical analyses will be performed&#xD;
      using the SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). A value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
