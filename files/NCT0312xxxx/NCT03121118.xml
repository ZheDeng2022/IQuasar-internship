    <textblock>
      Diagnostic tests designed to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology are increasingly&#xD;
      popular in research on cognitive aging and AD. Due to concerns that information from such&#xD;
      tests may be misunderstood, psychologically harmful, and of unclear clinical significance,&#xD;
      results of pre mortem tests of AD pathology have typically been withheld from research&#xD;
      participants. However, as the reliability and potential clinical significance of tests like&#xD;
      brain amyloid imaging have become clear, there is a pressing need to revisit the practice of&#xD;
      unilaterally withholding such information from research participants and identify responsible&#xD;
      approaches to communicating individual results. Amyloid imaging results may be particularly&#xD;
      relevant to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a population for whom a growing body of evidence&#xD;
      suggests that such testing may provide valuable prognostic and planning information, despite&#xD;
      the unavailability of interventions to alter one's clinical course. Our preliminary work&#xD;
      suggests that research participants with MCI and their family members are receptive to and&#xD;
      capable of understanding information about the purpose, results, and implications of amyloid&#xD;
      imaging when presented using a standardized approach developed by our interdisciplinary team.&#xD;
      Building on this work, the proposed study will examine a well characterized sample of MCI&#xD;
      care dyads (patient + family member) who will be randomized to either receive the opportunity&#xD;
      to decide if they would like to pursue an amyloid PET Scan, or be randomized to not receive&#xD;
      that opportunity (and will serve in the no-scan comparison group). This study aims to test&#xD;
      hypotheses that examine how receiving amyloid imaging results will impact understanding of,&#xD;
      and perceived self-efficacy for coping with, MCI among both patients and care partners.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in amyloid imaging are leading to unprecedented changes in research on cognitive&#xD;
      aging. We intend to characterize the way individuals respond to learning of the results of&#xD;
      their amyloid imaging scans, understand the context in which decisions to obtain results of&#xD;
      brain amyloid status are made, and examine the impact of such knowledge over the first year&#xD;
      following results disclosure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of receiving amyloid imaging results on understanding of, and&#xD;
      perceived efficacy to cope with, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) as a potential precursor to&#xD;
      dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1. MCI care dyads who receive amyloid imaging results, using the text and visual&#xD;
      aids developed by our interdisciplinary team, will a) perform better on objective assessments&#xD;
      of basic knowledge about MCI and its relation to AD, and b) report lower levels of perceived&#xD;
      ambiguity about what MCI means, as compared to control MCI care dyads not receiving amyloid&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2. MCI care dyads who receive the patient's amyloid imaging results, using the&#xD;
      text and visual aids developed by our interdisciplinary team, will report higher levels of&#xD;
      perceived efficacy to cope with MCI as compared to those not participating in amyloid&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Amyloid imaging is a brain scanning technique that uses radioligands along with&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) to detect the presence of neuritic plaques associated with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence accumulating over the past decade suggests that current&#xD;
      imaging techniques show fibrillar amyloid beta deposits in patients with known AD in a&#xD;
      pattern consistent with post mortem pathological descriptions of amyloid plaque distribution&#xD;
      (1,2). Although the prognostic utility of amyloid imaging in cognitively healthy older adults&#xD;
      remains unclear, it is increasingly evident that brain amyloid positivity may have&#xD;
      significant implications for the long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (MCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Across 5 published studies, 155 persons with both amnestic and other subtypes of MCI have&#xD;
      received amyloid PET scans and been followed longitudinally (3-7). Of these 155 individuals,&#xD;
      101 were amyloid positive at baseline, just over half (n = 53) of whom converted to dementia&#xD;
      within 1 to 3 years. By contrast, only 7.4% (n = 4) of those who were amyloid negative at&#xD;
      baseline converted to dementia within the same time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This body of research suggests that, regardless of MCI subtype, amyloid imaging is a unique&#xD;
      and powerful indicator of clinical outcomes in MCI. This mounting evidence of the prognostic&#xD;
      value of amyloid imaging underscores the significance of providing amyloid research&#xD;
      participants who have MCI with information about, and the choice of, receiving their amyloid&#xD;
      PET scan results. It is recognized that such results are not medically actionable because&#xD;
      there are no FDA-approved treatments for MCI or otherwise effective means of slowing&#xD;
      progression to dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the fact that amyloid PET research results are not medically actionable in MCI,&#xD;
      preliminary findings from our team's investigation of disclosing mock amyloid scan results to&#xD;
      MCI care dyads (patient + family member) indicate that these individuals are highly receptive&#xD;
      to and generally capable of understanding information about amyloid-based biomarkers for AD,&#xD;
      including the limitations and limited clinical utility of such testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Amyloid imaging advances are leading to unprecedented changes in research on&#xD;
      cognitive aging and AD. As the field transitions into an era of pre-mortem testing for AD&#xD;
      pathology, amyloid imaging is playing a key role in identifying candidates for and evaluating&#xD;
      effectiveness in anti-amyloid clinical trials. Whereas tests of cognitive function have long&#xD;
      been the gold standard for measuring treatment response, amyloid-based markers are rapidly&#xD;
      being adopted as secondary outcome measures and, in some cases, methodologies of choice for&#xD;
      evaluating the effectiveness of experimental therapies targeting AD. In clinical practice,&#xD;
      the recent FDA approval of the commercial amyloid imaging agent, florbetapir, suggests that&#xD;
      in the near future tests of pre-mortem AD pathology, while not sufficient to render a&#xD;
      dementia diagnosis, may augment clinical evaluations of cognitive impairment. Findings from&#xD;
      this research will lead to guidelines to assist clinicians in counseling and supporting&#xD;
      individuals who are considering undergoing such testing.&#xD;
