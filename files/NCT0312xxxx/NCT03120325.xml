  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating a new form of treatment for a digestive disorder called&#xD;
      gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is thought to be caused by a mix of inflammation and neural&#xD;
      dysfunction. The vagal nerve is a large nerve originating from the brain that regulates&#xD;
      digestive function. Patients with gastroparesis have what is a called a low vagal tone which&#xD;
      results in gastrointestinal motility problems and inflammation; therefore, investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that increasing vagal tone through a hand-held vagal nerve simulator will reduce&#xD;
      inflammation and gastrointestinal motility problems in gastroparesis patients. Investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate this hypothesis through the use of upper endoscopy testing, breath testing, and&#xD;
      blood, stool, urine, heart rate variability, and saliva testing before and after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 6 research visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 and visit 2 may take up to 8 weeks (screening/baseline) Visit 3 and visit 4 will take&#xD;
      4 weeks (VNS treatment) visit 5 and 6 will take approximately 4 weeks (VNS followup/washout)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, it is possible that if a patient were to be at the farthest ends of visit&#xD;
      windows, they could potentially be in the study for approx 16 weeks. Visit 1 and 2 may be&#xD;
      less than 8 weeks which would shorten the patient's overall involvement in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase of the study will always be 4 weeks with an additional 4 week washout&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of the VNS device takes 4 weeks. Endoscopy and blood work are taken before and after the&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;

    <measure>Effect of Vagal Nerve Stimulation on gastroparesis symptoms as measures by the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary (GCSI-DD) questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks (2 weeks prior to stimulation, 4 weeks of stimulation, 2 weeks after stimulation). Data analysis will occur at the 1 year mark after enrollment has stopped.</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will send daily GCSI-DD to patients for 8 weeks. This 10 item questionnaire measures the severity of gastroparesis symptoms on a scale 0-5. 0=none, 1=very mild, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe, 5=very severe. Investigators hypothesize a change of more than 0.75 points.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of Vagal Nerve Stimulation on the gastric emptying spirulina breath test emptying time</measure>
    <time_frame>Gastric emptying testing will occur at visit 3 (the very first day of VNS treatment) and then again at visit 5 (which occur after four weeks of VNS treatment). Data analysis will occur at the 1 year mark when enrollment has stopped.</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will measure a change in gastric emptying time before and after vagal nerve stimulation as measured in minutes.</description>
