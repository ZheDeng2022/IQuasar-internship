  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prescribing antibiotics frequently poses problems in practice, since patients don't always&#xD;
      receive the right dosage of the right antibiotic for the right period of time. This promotes&#xD;
      the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. The investigators of this trial aim to&#xD;
      develop a system designed to help doctors to use antibiotics more appropriately. Under&#xD;
      COMPASS (COMPuterized Antibiotic Stewardship Study), doctors in three Swiss hospitals will&#xD;
      receive tips on the use of antibiotics that are integrated directly into electronic health&#xD;
      record and will also be given regular feedback on their use of antibiotics. Parallel to this,&#xD;
      data on the antimicrobial prescription practices of a control group which is not using the&#xD;
      system will be collected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inappropriate use of antimicrobials favours the spread and emergence of antimicrobial&#xD;
      resistance and other adverse patient outcomes. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs aim&#xD;
      to promote the appropriate use of antimicrobials. Most AMS interventions are based on manual,&#xD;
      personalized peer review of antibiotic prescriptions by specialists and are therefore time&#xD;
      and resource intensive. Informatics based, computerized approaches to AMS are a promising way&#xD;
      to &quot;automatize&quot; AMS, but there have been only few randomized controlled trials analysing&#xD;
      their effectiveness in the hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research question of this study is whether a multi-modal, computerized antibiotic&#xD;
      stewardship intervention (I) reduces overall antibiotic exposure (O) in adult patients&#xD;
      hospitalized in acute-care wards of secondary and tertiary care centers (P) compared to no&#xD;
      such intervention (&quot;standard-of- care&quot;) (C) over a one year time period (T) (the letters&#xD;
      refer to the corresponding constituents of the PICOT framework).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to use the methodological rigor of a parallel group,&#xD;
      cluster-randomized, controlled superiority trial in three Swiss hospitals to answer the&#xD;
      primary research question. Secondary objectives are to assess the impact of the intervention&#xD;
      on quality of antibiotic use, patient, microbiologic and economic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the difference in overall systemic antibiotic use measured in&#xD;
      days of therapy (DOT) per admission based on administration data recorded in the electronic&#xD;
      health record (EHR) over the whole intervention period. Secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative antimicrobial use indicators (including non-HIV antivirals and&#xD;
      antifungals), economic outcomes and key clinical and microbiologic indicators and patient&#xD;
      safety indicators such as changes in readmission rates, need for intensive care and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the multimodal intervention is superior to standard-of-care&#xD;
      regarding the primary outcome, i.e. that the intervention leads to a statistically&#xD;
      significant reduction in overall antibiotic use expressed as days of therapy per admission&#xD;
      compared to no such intervention (&quot;standard-of-care&quot; antibiotic stewardship).&#xD;
