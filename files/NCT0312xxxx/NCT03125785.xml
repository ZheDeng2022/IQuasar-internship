  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with congenital cataract operated at St. Erik Eye Hospital are given the topical&#xD;
      steroid dexamethasone (Isopto-Maxidex) according to a set treatment plan. They are provided a&#xD;
      contact lens made of the polymer Filcon 4A that is frequently replaced due to the results of&#xD;
      previous in vitro studies that have shown accumulation of preservatives in the hydrogel&#xD;
      contact lens matrix which could question their use in combination with ophthalmic solutions.&#xD;
      We conducted a pilot study that indicate that the results in vivo are different from the&#xD;
      results in vitro and we suspect that insignificant amounts of dexamethasone and benzalkonium&#xD;
      chloride are taken up by the lenses due to tear drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contact lenses from 30 patients at St. Erik Hospital that have undergone surgery for&#xD;
      congenital cataract and are treated with eye drops containing dexamethasone and benzalkonium&#xD;
      chloride will be collected and analyzed. Ultraviolet-Visible spectrophotometer (UV-vis) and&#xD;
      Laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) will be used to study uptake and&#xD;
      release of dexamethasone and benzalkonium chloride. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) will&#xD;
      be used to study surface morphology. Thirty Contact lenses from a control group without&#xD;
      topical treatment will also be analyzed. Data will consist of contact lens material, wearing&#xD;
      time, pharmaceutical agents, contact lens solution when applicable, diagnosis and possible&#xD;
      co-morbidity.&#xD;

      Contact lenses are frequently used as a part of the treatment in professional hospital eye&#xD;
      care with indications such as visual aid in keratokonus and scarred corneas and as bandage&#xD;
      lenses shielding the cornea in various corneal diseases. An indication of great importance is&#xD;
      the providing the visual correction in infants following surgery for congenital cataract. In&#xD;
      Sweden, approximately 40 children are born with congenital cataract every year and more than&#xD;
      100 children develop cataract within the first years of life. The cataract can develop in one&#xD;
      eye, unilateral cataract, or in both eyes, bilateral cataract. If the cataract is dense it is&#xD;
      of great importance to remove the clouded lens as soon as possible to ensure the influx of&#xD;
      light and to enable visual development. If the eye is big enough an intraocular lens (IOL) is&#xD;
      inserted but if the eye is to small the child is left without an implanted lens. Visual&#xD;
      development however requires not only light influx but a sharp image on the retina and to&#xD;
      achieve good visual function contact lenses are fitted following surgery. After cataract&#xD;
      surgery anti-inflammatory eye drops containing steroids are prescribed for several weeks and&#xD;
      the drops are instilled in the eye with the contact lens in place.The effects of eye drops on&#xD;
      the contact lenses and possible secondary effects on the eye are largely unknown. The&#xD;
      ophthalmic solutions contain active ingredients as well as preservatives such as benzalkonium&#xD;
      chloride. Benzalkonium chloride can increase the ocular permeability but also cause&#xD;
      irritation at higher concentrations. The uptake of these substances by the lenses can impair&#xD;
      the optical clarity of the lenses, cause discoloration, discomfort and irritate the eye. Some&#xD;
      studies have shown accumulation of preservatives in the hydrogel contact lens matrix which&#xD;
      could question their use in combination with ophthalmic solutions and have led to&#xD;
      recommendations of frequent replacement of the lenses. The effects of ophthalmic solutions on&#xD;
      the lens materials are not fully understood and most studies are performed in vitro. In&#xD;
      collaboration with the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) methods for measuring drug and&#xD;
      preservative uptake by silicone hydrogel contact lenses and to study the surface morphology&#xD;
      changes for contact lenses were developed. An in vitro model study showed that active&#xD;
      ingredients from eye drops together with preservatives were taken up by the lenses in&#xD;
      significant amounts. The method was further implemented in an in vivo pilot study with&#xD;
      contact lenses collected from patients treated with different ophthalmologic preparations&#xD;
      with the contact lens in place. No traces of active ingredients or preservatives could be&#xD;
      found on the worn and treated lenses. The surface morphology changes were minor regardless of&#xD;
      the time the lenses were worn or the frequency of medication, which suggests that&#xD;
      insignificant amounts of drugs were taken up and the drugs were probably mostly removed by&#xD;
      tear drainage. The results are presented in a manuscript that will be sent for publication.&#xD;
