  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controversy surrounds the use of regional cerebral oximetry (rSO2) as a measure of true&#xD;
      cerebral oxygenation because of extracranial signal contamination and unmeasured confounding&#xD;
      of cerebral a:v ratio. The measurement of brain tissue oxygen (PbrO2) has been used in&#xD;
      routine neurosurgery and has been shown to reliably demonstrate cerebral hypoxia following&#xD;
      severe head injury. It is the most direct measure of cerebral oxygenation. Here, we test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that there is a correlation between PbrO2 and rSO2 under conditions of varying&#xD;
      inspired oxygen fraction and the varying partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood&#xD;
      in uninjured, normal human brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are scheduled for elective removal of secondary cerebral metastases under&#xD;
      general anesthesia will be recruited following written informed consent obtained by a study&#xD;
      team member during their preoperative evaluation. BIS and rSO2 optodes will be applied,&#xD;
      before induction of anesthesia, by a single researcher on both sides of the patient's&#xD;
      forehead, as recommended by the manufacturer. General anesthesia will be maintained by total&#xD;
      intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with a combination of propofol (80-150 mcg/kg/min) and&#xD;
      remifentanil (0.05-0.1 mcg/kg/min) targeted to a Bispectral Index range 40-60 (BIS; Covidien,&#xD;
      Boulder, CO). Following craniotomy, the LICOX probe will be placed under direct vision into&#xD;
      an area of normal brain within the tumor excision canal by the attending neurosurgeon. During&#xD;
      a pause in surgery FIO2 and minute ventilation will be sequentially adjusted to achieve the&#xD;
      following pairs of ventilation set points: 1) FIO2 0.3 and paCO2 30mmHg, 2) FIO2 1.0 and&#xD;
      paCO2 40mmHg. After â‰¥5 minutes at each set point FIO2, PaCO2, rSO2 and PbrO2 will be recorded&#xD;
      as a &quot;snap-shot&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 15 achieves an 80% power with a one-sided type I error of 5% to detect a&#xD;
      positive correlation of 0.6 (from the null hypothesis of no correlation) between changes in&#xD;
      PbrO2 and changes in rSO2 subsequent on alterations made in ventilation strategy. Correlation&#xD;
      will be measured using Pearson's Correlation. P values &lt; 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
