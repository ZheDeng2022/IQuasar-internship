  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) who frequently attend the emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) with symptoms may not require emergency treatment, and may be more&#xD;
      appropriately managed in an alternative outpatient setting. This may be the result of&#xD;
      inappropriate or inadequate advice or a lack of patient understanding. The main research&#xD;
      objective pertains to the reason for seeking medical attention for AF in the ED, ED&#xD;
      management of the patient, outcomes of ED care and alternative strategies.&#xD;

      This study is a multi-centre, multi-provincial, patient survey using mixed methods. 778&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled from 9 centres in 3 provinces from academic, urban, and rural&#xD;
      centres to achieve geographical and health system heterogeneity. The planned duration of the&#xD;
      entire study (enrollment through follow-up) is approximately 12 months. Patients presenting&#xD;
      to the ED with a primary diagnosis of AF and with a prior diagnosis of established AF will be&#xD;
      approached to participate. Each centre will be responsible for obtaining local consent. Data&#xD;
      will be stored confidentially and securely at the coordinating centre (Queens University,&#xD;
      Kingston, Ontario).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to take part at the time of&#xD;
      presentation to the ED or after their ED visit. For all enrolled patients, one follow up&#xD;
      telephone call will be made within one to four weeks of the ED visit by a social scientist&#xD;
      with specialised training in questionnaires based in Queens University, Kingston, Ontario.&#xD;

    <description>A detailed telephone survey will be performed in which patients with a known history of atrial fibrillation and symptoms which they feel are related to their diagnosis and who are agreeable to take part in the study will be called by a social scientist. They will be asked a series of questions and their responses will be recorded either on a Likert scale (symptom severity, satisfaction with treatment, quality of life) or as qualitative data (exact symptoms, fears and concerns relating to their underlying diagnosis)</description>
