&#xD;
          -  Patients with other factors the researchers considered not suitable for the trail (for&#xD;
             example, patients those who not willing to follow the procedure, limitation or&#xD;
             requirements, who once experienced bone marrow allotransplantation, who have other&#xD;
             kinds of malignant tumor coexisted or who showed allergic to the active ingredients or&#xD;
             inactive adjuvant of the investigational drug, as well as drugs with similar chemical&#xD;
             structure or in the same class).&#xD;
