  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open-label pharmacodynamics study in healthy adults. The purpose of the&#xD;
      study is to determine if the tablet formulation size of VXA-A1.1, an adjuvanted adenoviral&#xD;
      based influenza vaccine, has an impact on delivery location. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate delivery with fasting versus fed status.&#xD;

      This is a pharmacodynamics study in healthy adult males. The purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      determine if the tablet formulation size of VXA-A1.1, an adjuvanted adenoviral based&#xD;
      influenza vaccine, impacts the location and time of initial and complete disintegration of&#xD;
      the drug product. The secondary objective is to evaluate delivery with fasting versus fed&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
