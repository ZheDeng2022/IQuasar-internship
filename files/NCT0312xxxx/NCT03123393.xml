  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of TAK-659 measured by independent&#xD;
      radiologic review committee (IRC)-assessed overall response rate (ORR) in participants with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory DLBCL.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested is TAK-659. This study will evaluate overall response rate (ORR) in&#xD;
      participants with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who take TAK-659.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 122 participants. Participants will be assigned to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ TAK-659 60 mg to 100 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take the tablets of TAK-659 at the same time each day&#xD;
      throughout the study in a 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy,&#xD;
      France, Canada, Germany. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 48&#xD;
      months. Participants will be assessed for disease response and progression during the PFS&#xD;
      follow-up every 3 months after end of treatment (for participants who discontinue due to&#xD;
      reasons other than disease progression) and OS follow-up every 3 months from the last dose of&#xD;
      study drug until death or conclusion of the study, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

             substance, the washout period for P-gp inhibitors or inducers or strong CYP3A&#xD;
             inhibitors or inducers will be either 7 days or 5 times the half-life (half-life is&#xD;
             related to the time required for elimination from the body). The washout period for&#xD;
             grapefruit containing food or beverages is 5 days.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
