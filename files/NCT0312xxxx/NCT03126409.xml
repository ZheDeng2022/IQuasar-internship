      This study evaluates the short-term patency of vein graft harvested by the No-Touch technique&#xD;
      compared to that by the conventional approach in patients undergoing isolated&#xD;
      on-pump/off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. a total of at least 2000&#xD;
      patients undergoing isolated on-pump/off-pump CABG will be consecutively recruited from 7&#xD;
      hospitals across China and randomly assigned to receive No-Touch saphenous vein harvesting or&#xD;
      conventional approach. All participants will be invited for clinical follow-up and 64-slice&#xD;
      multislice computed tomography angiography (MSCTA) analysis at 3 months post-operatively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CABG is still the treatment of choice for ischemic heart disease. However, restenosis or&#xD;
      occlusion may occur to graft vessels, leading to postoperative myocardial ischemia and&#xD;
      subsequent clinical events. Long-term angiographic follow-up demonstrated that vein graft&#xD;
      restenosis and occlusion are common among those receiving CABG, with a vein graft patency of&#xD;
      less than 50% at 15 years postoperatively. Besides, it is found that graft occlusion may&#xD;
      occur as early as 3 months after the surgery. It is, therefore, a major priority to improve&#xD;
      the short-term postoperative vein graft patency so as to achieve better prognosis for&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saphenous vein, the currently most frequently used graft material, occupies over 70% of all&#xD;
      graft vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple factors may contribute to the early restenosis or occlusion of the vein grafts,&#xD;
      including anastomosis technique, graft vessel quality, target lesion site and degree of&#xD;
      stenosis, perioperative coagulating function, etc. The No-Touch technique focuses on&#xD;
      saphenous vein graft harvesting, featured by preserving the surrounding tissue of the vein&#xD;
      while at the same time avoiding manual distension. This technique has been reported&#xD;
      associated with better short and long-term vein graft patency. However, these results mostly&#xD;
      came from small-scale, single-center studies, therefore could hardly be recognized as&#xD;
      high-level evidence for generalization of the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective multi-center study aims to compare the short-term saphenous vein graft&#xD;
      patency harvested by the No-Touch technique and the conventional approach. This study will&#xD;
      consecutively enroll 2000 patients undergoing isolated on-pump/off-pump CABG in 7 hospitals&#xD;
      of China. After obtaining informed written consent, participants will be randomly allocated&#xD;
      to either the No-Touch harvesting or conventional approach group. At baseline, participants&#xD;
      will be interviewed to collect detailed information about on demographics, socioeconomic&#xD;
      status, cardiovascular risk factors, clinical characteristics, treatments, in-hospital&#xD;
      outcomes, general and disease-specific quality of life, function and mental status. During&#xD;
      the follow-ups, the investigators will collect information about clinical outcomes events,&#xD;
      long-term treatments, function, quality of life, symptoms, and medical care during the&#xD;
      recovery period. All participants will be invited for 64-slice multi-slice computed&#xD;
      tomography angiography (MSCTA) analysis at 3 months post-operatively for graft patency&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients, data adjudicators and CT reviewers will be blinded to the study. Due to the&#xD;
      nature of this study, the operating surgeons, anesthetists and other operative room staff&#xD;
      will not be blind in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By comparing the short-term graft patency between the No-Touch and conventional vein&#xD;
      harvesting groups, this study will contribute major evidence of the possible superiority of&#xD;
      this technique, so as to improve patient outcomes after CABG surgery.&#xD;
