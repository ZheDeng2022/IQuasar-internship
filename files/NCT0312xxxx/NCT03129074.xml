  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of varlitinib in combination with&#xD;
      capecitabine as measured by objective response rate (ORR) assessed by independent central&#xD;
      review (ICR), based on RECIST v1.1 criteria.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Also to explore the role of biomarkers as predictors of response and clinical benefit with&#xD;
