  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Currently, paracetamol and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are widely used by&#xD;
           emergency physicians in Turkey for the treatment of patients with acute non traumatic&#xD;
           musculoskeletal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The objective of the study is compare the efficacy of intravenous dexketoprofen with&#xD;
           paracetamol in the treatment of acute non-traumatic musculoskeletal pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This is the randomized double blinded clinical trial to compare the efficacy of these&#xD;
           two drugs in this clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A randomized clinical trial was conducted in the Emergency Department (ED) of Pamukkale&#xD;
           University Medical Faculty Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study personnel (emergency physicians and nurses) were trained before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When intravenous drugs (Paracetamol, Dexketoprofen) was being recommended, an&#xD;
           eligibility checklist was completed by the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there were no exclusion criteria, written informed consent was obtained and baseline&#xD;
           information, including initial acute non-traumatic musculoskeletal pain severity ratings&#xD;
           with visual analog scale (VAS) were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need for identification and enrollment of participants by staff with conflicting&#xD;
           work pressures resulted in recruitment of a convenience sample of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients eligible for the study were randomized to one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Group: 1000 mg of paracetamol ( perfalgan 10mg/ml solutionBristol-Myers Squibb_UK)&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) was given 100 patients, Second Group: dexketoprofen 50 mg ( arveles ampoule&#xD;
      -Ufsa- Istanbul) intravenous (IV) was given 100 patients which determined to be applied as a&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug packs prepared in 150 ml serum physiology were numbered by an independent nurse, who not&#xD;
      involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drugs were prepared according to the computer-generated random number sequence to assign&#xD;
           treatment allocations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The allocation list was kept by the emergency nurse. Patients received the paracetamol,&#xD;
           dexketoprofen medication schemes according to their random allocations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After enrollment and recording of baseline information, the next numbered study drug&#xD;
           pack was obtained, and administered intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization was achieved by using computer software to generate random numbers. During&#xD;
           the intervention, participants were monitored by an oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitor, an&#xD;
           automatic sphygmomanometer (blood pressure), and a rhythm monitor (heart rate and&#xD;
           rhythms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One researcher blinded to patient allocation observed the whole procedure and recorded&#xD;
           the acute non-traumatic musculoskeletal pain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in both groups received two types of medication in a similar manner, thus&#xD;
           ensuring double blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute non-traumatic musculoskeletal pain scores were recorded at 0, 15, 30 and 60 min on&#xD;
           a VAS of 1 to 10&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rescue medication (Fentanyl 1mcg/kg) was given intravenous to patients if pain VAS&#xD;
           scores â‰¥ 5 in sixty minutes after study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All other medications required during the study also were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study, pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,&#xD;
           respiration rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were recorded at baseline (0 min), 15, 30,&#xD;
           and 60 min.&#xD;
