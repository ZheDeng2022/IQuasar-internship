      The objective of this cross-sectional study is to assess the prevalence of depression at 2&#xD;
      months, 6 months, and 1 year postpartum in women who had an immediate postpartum hemorrhage&#xD;
      (immediate PPH defined as blood loss ≥ 500 mL within 24 hours of delivery). The potential&#xD;
      serious consequences of PPH may lead to a greater number of psychological disorders in these&#xD;
      women than in women without PPH.&#xD;

      Study design: This repeated, cross-sectional, descriptive and etiological single-center study&#xD;
      will take place within a cohort of women giving birth at the Clermont-Ferrand University&#xD;
      Hospital Center (Psyche 1), and a cohort of their partners (psyche 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal endpoint: The prevalence of depression, measured by the Edinburgh postnatal&#xD;
      depression scale (EPDS), validated in French, with a discrimination threshold ≥ 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study plan and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psyche 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each woman with a PPH (exposed), 2 women without PPH (not exposed) will be included: the&#xD;
      women who gave birth immediately before and immediate after her. If one of these 2 unexposed&#xD;
      women eligible for the unexposed group also has a postpartum hemorrhage, another woman&#xD;
      immediately just before or after the woman with PPH will be included. The PPH will be managed&#xD;
      according to the national guidelines issued in December 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will consist of 3 questionnaire surveys, at 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year&#xD;
      postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information and inclusion will take place in the immediate postpartum period at the&#xD;
      Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital Center, France. An investigator (midwife or&#xD;
      gynecologist-obstetrician in the maternity ward) will inform eligible women about the study,&#xD;
      in the postpartum period. This investigator will provide them with a written information&#xD;
      sheet and obtain their written consent. If the woman has already left the maternity ward, an&#xD;
      investigator will contact her by mail or telephone, and she will receive the information&#xD;
      sheet and consent form at her postnatal consultation in the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort will complete each questionnaire at the same times in relation to their date of&#xD;
      delivery (2 months, 6 months, and 12 months after). They will receive an email asking them to&#xD;
      complete the questionnaires, including a participation number and an internet link to the&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaires. This intervention is not usually performed for women who&#xD;
      give birth at our hospital, whether or not they had a PPH. The procedures, other than the&#xD;
      surveys, will be those provided habitually as usual care and will comply with good clinical&#xD;
      practices and French regulations (1992 decree, French early discharge guideline from 2004).&#xD;
      Should the questionnaire identify a woman in need of immediate psychological care, she will&#xD;
      be contacted, referred to, and encouraged to consult a competent professional (psychologist,&#xD;
      psychiatrist, child psychiatrist, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psyche 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort of partners will complete each questionnaire at the same times in relation to the&#xD;
      date of delivery (2nd month and 6th month). The &quot;source&quot; documents will be the parturient's&#xD;
      medical file (the part concerning both partners) and questionnaires, as the study involves a&#xD;
      survey of the partners of women giving birth. The relevant covariables (confounding and&#xD;
      prognostic factors) will also be collected from the women's medical files (emergency&#xD;
      cesarean, vascular embolization, etc.). These covariables are already being collected as part&#xD;
      of the Psyche 1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion will take place in the immediate postpartum period. Accordingly, in the Psyche 1&#xD;
      study, for every woman with a PPH (exposed), 2 women without PPH (not exposed) are eligible&#xD;
      (the woman who gave birth before and after the exposed woman). In this ancillary study, the&#xD;
      partners, if eligible, of both the exposed and nonexposed women in the Psyche 1 study will be&#xD;
      asked to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will consist of 3 surveys by questionnaires: during the woman's&#xD;
      hospitalization during the immediate postpartum period, at 2 months, and at 6 months after&#xD;
      the delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The partners of the women who had an immediate postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) will be compared&#xD;
      to the partners of the women who did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The source documents will be the medical file and the questionnaires. Clinicians will make&#xD;
      the data extraction from the medical files, including the relevant covariables: confounding&#xD;
      factors, prognostic factors (e.g., history of depression, anxiolytic treatment before&#xD;
      delivery, psychological or psychiatric care before and delivery and after delivery, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Investigator undertakes to conduct this study in compliance with Good Clinical&#xD;
           Practices and French public health law [Act n°2004-806 dated 9 August 2004 concerning&#xD;
           biomedical research, its implementing decree n° 2006-477 dated 26/04/2006, which&#xD;
           modifies the portion of the Public Health Code (specifically, Part 1, Book 1, Title II,&#xD;
           Section 1) concerning biomedical research, as well as the decrees in force]. The&#xD;
           investigator also undertakes to conduct this research in accordance with Declaration of&#xD;
           Helsinki of the World Medical Association (Tokyo 2004, as revised).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators guarantee the authenticity of the data collected in this study and&#xD;
           accept the legal provisions authorizing the study sponsor to set up quality control&#xD;
           procedures. During quality control inspections, the following items will be checked:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compliance with the research protocol and the procedures defined there.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assurance of the quality of the data collected in the electronic CRF: accuracy,&#xD;
                missing data, consistency of the data with the source documents (such as paper and&#xD;
                electronic medical files and questionnaires completed by the midwives).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting for adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In compliance with decree n° 2006-477 dated 26/04/2006, which modifies the portion of the&#xD;
      Public Health Code (specifically, Part 1, Book 1, Title II, Section 1) concerning biomedical&#xD;
      research, as well as the decrees in force, any suspected unexpected serious adverse effect&#xD;
      will be reported by the Sponsor to the competent, authority at the CPP, as soon as the&#xD;
      Sponsor is aware of it and at the latest 7 days after the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psyche 1: For a power of 90%, with a two-sided alpha of 5%, with 2 unexposed subjects for 1&#xD;
      exposed and according to the Australian study by JF Thompson et al. (2011) who found a&#xD;
      depression rate of 10% in unexposed and 16% in exposed women at 4 months postpartum, this&#xD;
      study requires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1028 women in the unexposed group, with no hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and 514 women in exposed group with a hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1542 women must therefore be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 3 samples for analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respondents to the survey at 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respondents to the survey at 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respondents to the survey at 12 months (not for partners)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation and refusal rates will be calculated at each survey point, together with&#xD;
      the prevalence of the psychological states studied. Some women will be lost to follow-up at&#xD;
      the M6 and M12 surveys. These women will be included in the crude descriptive analyses, and&#xD;
      population lost to follow-up will be compared with the study population to look for possible&#xD;
      differences in the principal characteristics studied. We plan to perform an interim analysis&#xD;
      to assess the need to adjust the study calendar. This interim analysis will be performed&#xD;
      after half of the planned subjects have been included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical methods used for the crude analyses will be a descriptive analysis of the&#xD;
      sample with a comparison of the exposed and unexposed groups, where we describe the&#xD;
      characteristics of the groups included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chi 2 test (or Fisher's exact test when appropriate) will be used to compare the&#xD;
      qualitative variables and Student's t test (or a Mann-Whitney test) for the quantitative&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence rates and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for depression at 2&#xD;
      months, 6 months, and 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multivariate analysis (logistic regression) will be conducted to take into account&#xD;
      confounding factors (smoking, cannabis, etc.) as well as clinically relevant prognostic&#xD;
      factors (history of depression, use of anxiolytic or antidepressant agents, etc.) for&#xD;
      depression at each survey interval (at 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year). The results will be&#xD;
      expressed as adjusted odds ratios (aOR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, another multivariate analysis (generalized linear mixed model) will&#xD;
      be performed to study the trends in the prevalence of depression over the 3 study periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The missing data will be treated as missing and excluded from the analyses.&#xD;
