      A major public health challenge is therefore to accurately identify, in an apparently healthy&#xD;
      population, those who are at high risk and to target prevention at these individuals.&#xD;
      Although primary prevention measures, including aspirin, have been suggested for all&#xD;
      individuals with an estimated intermediate to high cardiovascular risk of 2% per year, the&#xD;
      best method of identifying such individuals has not been established. In addition, models&#xD;
      based on conventional risk factors have been shown to have limited predictability and several&#xD;
      restrictions. They were not designed for people with preexisting cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD), and when risk factors are at extreme levels, the equations may underestimate or&#xD;
      overestimate risk. In this regard, interest is increasing in the use of noninvasive markers&#xD;
      that allow the identification of sub-clinical atherosclerosis, including the ankle brachial&#xD;
      index (ABI), ratio of ankle to arm systolic blood pressure). Although quick and easy to&#xD;
      perform with a high patient acceptability, the ABI was originally used to identify lower-limb&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. However, it has subsequently been shown to be an accurate and reliable&#xD;
      marker of generalized atherosclerosis. Cohort studies between 5 and 10 years of follow-up&#xD;
      have shown that people with a low ABI have an increased risk of both cardiovascular morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. They have previously reported that the 5-year incidence of total&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in subjects with an ABI ˂ 0.9 was almost twice that in subjects with an&#xD;
      ABI ˃ 0.9 Furthermore, examination of positive predictive values showed that a low ABI was&#xD;
      better at predicting risk of future cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events than&#xD;
      conventional risk factors alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac neuro-hormone secreted from membrane granules&#xD;
      in the cardiac ventricles as a response to ventricular volume expansion and pressure&#xD;
      overload. The natriuretic peptide system allows the heart to participate in the regulation of&#xD;
      vascular tone and extracellular volume status. The natriuretic peptide system and the renin&#xD;
      angiotensin system counteract each other in arterial pressure regulation. Levels of atrial&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are elevated in cardiac&#xD;
      disease states associated with increased ventricular stretch. The main circulating and&#xD;
      storage form of BNP is 32 amino acid peptide with a ring structure. Physiological actions of&#xD;
      BNP are mediated through a guanylate cyclase-linked receptor, natriuretic peptide receptor A&#xD;
      (NPR-A). BNP produces arterial and venous vasodilatation. Clearance of BNP is promoted by a&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR-C) which removes it from the circulation and BNP is also&#xD;
      degraded through enzymatic cleavage by neutral endopeptidase. BNP levels are reflective of&#xD;
      left ventricular diastolic filling pressures and thus correlate with pulmonary capillary&#xD;
      wedge pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BNP levels have been shown to be elevated in patients with symptomatic left ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction and correlate with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the available information a BNP &lt; 100 pg/ml, allows clinicians to exclude heart&#xD;
      failure as a cause of the patients' symptoms or physical exam signs in most circumstances BNP&#xD;
      levels have been shown to predict long term mortality in patients with heart failure,&#xD;
      independent of other established prognostic variable&#xD;
