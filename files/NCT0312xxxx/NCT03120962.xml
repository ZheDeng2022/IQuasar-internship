  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) which persists more than 90 days after the resolution of the&#xD;
      acute shingles episode is the most common complication of herpes zoster. The continued pain&#xD;
      or paresthesia not only affects patient quality of life, but also causes physical disability,&#xD;
      emotional distress and social isolation. Conventional treatments for PHN are only partially&#xD;
      work in some patients or not work at all in others. Once PHN presences, it is often&#xD;
      refractory to the treatment, therefore, it is important to prevent the occurrence of PHN. In&#xD;
      the study, the investigators want to identift whether the additional use of oxycodone therapy&#xD;
      to current standard treatment in acute herpes zoster patients will decrease the incidence of&#xD;
      post-herpetic neuralgia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Herpes zoster (HZ) results from reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus in sensory&#xD;
      ganglia, with characteristic symptom of painful skin rash and localized blisters. Usually,&#xD;
      the rash heals and pain resolves within two to four weeks, but in some patients the pain&#xD;
      continues to persist for more than 90 days after the onset of rash, which is known as&#xD;
      postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHN is the most common complication of HZ. Depending on the definition, the incidence of HZ&#xD;
      patients developing PHN varied from approximately 5% to 30%. The continued pain or&#xD;
      paresthesia not only affects patient quality of life, but also causes physical disability,&#xD;
      emotional distress and social isolation. Conventional treatments for PHN include topical&#xD;
      lidocaine or capsaicin, anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, and opioids. However,&#xD;
      whether prescribed alone or in combination, these medications are only partially work in some&#xD;
      patients or not work at all in others. Once PHN presences, it is often refractory to the&#xD;
      treatment, therefore, it is important to prevent the occurrence of PHN. Previous studies have&#xD;
      identified age, rash duration before consultation, presence of severe rash and acute pain&#xD;
      severity as predictors of increased PHN risk. Thus, the treatment of acute pain of herpes&#xD;
      zoster has the potential to prevent the development of PHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute zoster pain represents a combination of nociceptive and neuropathic pain which can be&#xD;
      relieved by oxycodone. However, it is not known whether the additional use of oxycodone&#xD;
      therapy to current standard treatment in acute herpes zoster patients will decrease the&#xD;
      incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia.&#xD;
