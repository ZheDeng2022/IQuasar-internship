  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done with patients with advanced kidney cancer (also called renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma or RCC). This is a research study involving the use of the drug Nivolumab (also&#xD;
      known as Opdivo®). Nivolumab is an anti-PD-1 antibody. It works by attaching to and blocking&#xD;
      a molecule called PD-1. PD-1 is a protein that is present on different types of cells in the&#xD;
      immune system and controls parts of the immune system by shutting it down. Antibodies that&#xD;
      block PD-1 can potentially prevent PD-1 from shutting down the immune system, thus allowing&#xD;
      it to recognize and help destroy cancer cells. In many countries (including the United&#xD;
      States, European Union and Japan) Nivolumab is approved to treat certain cancer types. The&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to test the safety and effectiveness of nivolumab in patients with&#xD;
      advanced RCC when given intermittently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced kidney cancer, non small cell lung cancer, classical Hodgkin Lymphoma and Metastatic&#xD;
      Melanoma. Nivolumab is FDA-approved for advanced RCC because has been shown to shrink RCC&#xD;
      tumors that have spread outside the kidney.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the feasibility of intermittent nivolumab therapy in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the clinical outcome (overall response rate (ORR), progressive free&#xD;
           survival (PFS), overall survival (OS)) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients&#xD;
           treated with intermittent nivolumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the toxicity of intermittent nivolumab therapy in patients with metastatic&#xD;
           renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Investigate correlations between baseline and post-treatment immunomodulatory cells&#xD;
      [specifically, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) regulatory T cells (Treg), cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 4 (CD4) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8), T Cells, T-cell receptor&#xD;
      (TCR) repertoire and time off therapy.&#xD;

Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.&#xD;
Partial response (PR) is defined as a greater than or equal to 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions&#xD;
Progressive disease (PD) is defined as a greater than or equal to 20% increase in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions, or the appearance of one or more new lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.&#xD;

             therapy (for example, Interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-α), vaccine therapy, or&#xD;

             administered to pregnant women. Breastfeeding women are excluded from this study&#xD;
             because nivolumab may be excreted in human milk and the potential for serious adverse&#xD;
