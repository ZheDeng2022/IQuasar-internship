  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Four healthy hookworm-naive volunteers will be exposed to 50 L3 Necator americanus larvae&#xD;
      once and will retain infection for up to 2 years.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Four volunteers will be exposed to 50 Necator americanus L3 larvae. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      followed on a weekly basis until week 12 after infection. If volunteers develop a patent&#xD;
      infection, defined by detectable egg production in stool by microscopy at any timepoint&#xD;
      within week 9 to 12, they will be scheduled to donate faeces on request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two years after infection or if volunteers do not excrete eggs detectable by microscopy on&#xD;
      week 9 to 12, volunteers will be treated with a 3-day regimen of albendazole to abrogate the&#xD;
      infection. Retreatment with albendazole will be given to volunteers who remain positive for&#xD;
      hookworm after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months after the treatment, volunteers will undergo their last visit.&#xD;

             study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects are able to respond to phone or email within 24 hours during the first 12&#xD;
             weeks of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject agrees to refrain from blood donation to Sanquin or for other purposes&#xD;
             throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. For female subjects: subject agrees to use adequate contraception and not to&#xD;
