  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MRI is being increasingly relied upon for detection, staging and management of prostate&#xD;
      cancer. In this study patients with risk of prostate cancer will be recommended to have a&#xD;
      pelvic MRI prior to the standard biopsy of the prostate and standard treatment of any&#xD;
      detected prostate cancer. The results of the MRI will be compared to standard diagnosis&#xD;
      techniques to see if cancer can be more accurately detected.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study team hypothesizes that strategic use of advanced MRI methods will provide a more&#xD;
      accurate and less invasive approach for diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. The&#xD;
      primary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop advanced MRI methods and optimal MRI protocols for detection, staging, and&#xD;
           follow-up of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of MRI-guided biopsy methods and correlate MRI&#xD;
           findings with the pathological grade of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate prostate MRI findings and biopsy results with patient progress and&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in disease re-classification in patients on&#xD;
           active surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To apply computer-aided advanced image analytic techniques (Computer-assisted&#xD;
           diagnostics- CAD) to extract MRI features of patient clinical scans that correlate with&#xD;
           diagnosis and grade of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study MRI features of lesions that mimic prostate cancer on imaging eg - chronic&#xD;
           prostatitis, post treatment changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the impact of MRI in decision making and choice of treatment by physicians&#xD;
           and patients.&#xD;

    <description>The diagnostic performance of MRI guided biopsy techniques will be compared with standard TRUS biopsy using a single sample of patients undergoing both biopsy techniques. It has been reported that MRI consistently detects a larger number of clinically significant prostate cancers (sensitivity - 0.91 for MRI-guided biopsy vs 0.76 for TRUS biopsy), while avoiding the detection of cancers that are clinically insignificant, as compared to TRUS biopsy.</description>

The multiparametric MRI exam will consist of T1-, T2- and diffusion weighted imaging with or without post-contrast perfusion studies. magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) will be performed before contrast injection. The MRI will be interpreted by two specified radiologists from the research team.</description>
