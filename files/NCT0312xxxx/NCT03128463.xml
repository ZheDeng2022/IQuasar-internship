      Macular neovascular diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), polypoidal&#xD;
      choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), pathological myopia (PM) and etc. can cause severe vision loss.&#xD;
      It has become the focus of World Health Organization's blindness- prevention cause. A new&#xD;
      anti-VEGF drug conbercept has been approved and showed good efficacy and safety in clinical&#xD;
      trials. But the exact therapeutic regimen and the efficacy in the real world still needs to&#xD;
      be further studied, the reasons are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The efficacy and safety data of conbercept are collected from rigorous random controlled&#xD;
           trials (RCT) , it can not fully reflect the clinical application of conbercept in the&#xD;
           real world . Therefore, the knowledge of the therapeutic regimen, safety and efficacy of&#xD;
           conbercept is still limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conbercept has been approved for wet-AMD only, but in clinical practice, some doctors&#xD;
           applied other &quot;off-label use&quot; of conbercept. These &quot;off-label use&quot; has become a common&#xD;
           phenomenon all over the world for the instruction book of drugs usually lag behind&#xD;
           scientific researches. There is no specific law or regulatory document of drug off-label&#xD;
           use in China until now.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Anti-VEGF drugs are expensive and often require multiple treatments, and some patients&#xD;
           have poor or even no response to the drugs. This resulted enormous waste of medical&#xD;
           resources. So, how to accurately find out those patients who have good response, how to&#xD;
           develop individualized therapeutic regimen, and the response of patients in the real&#xD;
           world need to be urgently investigated in the aspect of pharmacogenomics, and&#xD;
           pharmacometabolomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators plan to carry out real-world researches of conbercept on&#xD;
      treating macular neovascular diseases has significance and urgency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intended to conduct a nationwide, non-intrusive, prospective,&#xD;
      observational, and multicenter registration study to investigate the efficacy of conbercept&#xD;
      in the real-world. And this study will explore the pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics&#xD;
      of conbercept, relationships of phenotype and the effectiveness of the drug, optimize the&#xD;
      therapeutic regimen, then reduce the financial burden of patients and save the limited&#xD;
      medical resources to achieve the purpose of accurate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For three unanswered questions raised in the background, the researchers carried out the&#xD;
      following purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate the safety and efficacy of conbercept in treating neovascular macular&#xD;
           disease in the real world.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Find out whether the &quot;off-label use&quot; of conbercept on PCV and PM have good efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore the pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics of conbercept through large-sample&#xD;
           registration study.&#xD;

      Research Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macular neovascular disease, is a group of diseases with subfoveal choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularization, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), polypoidal choroidal&#xD;
      vasculopathy (PCV), pathological myopia (PM) and etc. Due to the high permeability of&#xD;
      immature blood vessel wall, consequent bleeding, and scarring，macular neovascularization&#xD;
      often leads to severe vision loss. It has become the focus of World Health Organization's&#xD;
      blindness- prevention cause [1]. Currently, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has&#xD;
      been widely recognized as an important promoter for neovascularization. And a series of&#xD;
      large-scale clinical studies revealed that anti- VEGF drug is the only effective way for&#xD;
      macular neovascular disease [2], Anti-VEGF drug has been awarded as one of the top ten&#xD;
      scientific and technological progress by Nature magazine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conbercept is an anti-VEGF drug developed independently by Chinese researchers in recent&#xD;
      years, it competitively prevents the binding of VEGF to its receptor and inhibits the&#xD;
      downstream pathway activation, and has a higher binding affinity to VEGFA than other widely&#xD;
      used anti-VEGF drugs. Many multicenter double blind random controlled study showed that&#xD;
      conbercept has good efficacy and safety in treating macular neovascular diseases. In 2013,&#xD;
      conbercept has been approved by the State Food and Drug Regulatory Administration of China&#xD;
      and now has been widely used and recognized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trial results showed that the conbercept has good efficacy and safety in treating&#xD;
      macular neovascular diseases [3], but the exact therapeutic regimen and the efficacy in the&#xD;
      real world still needs to be further studied, the reasons are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The efficacy and safety data of conbercept are collected from rigorous random controlled&#xD;
           trials (RCT), it cannot fully reflect the clinical application of conbercept in the real&#xD;
           world. Therefore, the knowledge of the therapeutic regimen, safety and efficacy of&#xD;
           conbercept is still limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conbercept has been approved for wet-AMD only, but in clinical practice, some doctors&#xD;
           applied other &quot;off-label use&quot; of conbercept. These &quot;off-label use&quot; has become a common&#xD;
           phenomenon all over the world for the instruction book of drugs usually lag behind&#xD;
           scientific researches. There is no specific law or regulatory document of drug off-label&#xD;
           use in China until now.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Anti-VEGF drugs are expensive and often require multiple treatments, besides, some&#xD;
           patients have poor or even no response to the drugs. This resulted enormous waste of&#xD;
           medical resources. So, how to accurately find out those patients who have good response,&#xD;
           how to develop individualized therapeutic regimen, and the response of patients in the&#xD;
           real world need to be urgently investigated in the aspect of pharmacogenomics, and&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. Explore the pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics of conbercept through large-sample&#xD;
           registration study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program schedule: Total 2 years (1 year on enrollment, 1-year on observation) Start time:&#xD;
      February of 2017 (FPFV, First Time Patient First Visit) End time: December of 2018 (LPLV, the&#xD;
      last time Last Patient Last Visit) Clinical study report (CSR): December of 2018; Publish:&#xD;
      June of 2019&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study, the investigators aim to observe and collect 5000 patients&#xD;
      from forty nationwide ophthalmic centers that receive ocular injections of conbercept to&#xD;
      treat macular neovascular diseases during December 2016- November 2017. And the follow-up&#xD;
      observation last for one year. The investigators do not interfere patients' treatment plan&#xD;
      during the entire research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration time:&#xD;
&#xD;
      V1: baseline (enrollment period), V2: 1month after treatment, V3: 3 months, V4: 6 months, V5:&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and transfer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each visit, patients' demographic information, vital sign, history of systematic diseases,&#xD;
      concomitant medication, eye disease history, eye examinations record, safety information and&#xD;
      blood samples are collected. Clinical data and fundus imaging data collected by forty&#xD;
      clinical centers will be uploaded to Shanghai Jiaotong University Ophthalmic Reading Center&#xD;
      database then be analyzed and evaluated together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Program: Statistical general principles:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will undergo descriptive statistics and statistical tests，analysis will be based on&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan to enroll 5,000 patients by 40 hospitals. The amount will depend on the registration&#xD;
      capacity and follow-up rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: observe the number of cases and the percentage of adverse events and severe adverse&#xD;
      events of conbercept in real world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible bias and solutions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients lost to follow (such as patients from other places, can not undergo regular local&#xD;
      follow up): Solution 1, enroll in local patients or patients who plan to have regular and&#xD;
      long-term follow-up in our hospital; 2, Follow up and register by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor patient compliance: offer some compensation for patients' transport costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who cannot afford the drugs due to economic conditions: pharmaceutical has policies&#xD;
      on drug donation for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control and Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Object Data Management: Ensure that all enrolled patients have signed informed consent. Each&#xD;
      visit information should be timely, accurately and completely recorded and entered into the&#xD;
      electronic case report form (CRF). The electronic CRF should be consistent with the original&#xD;
      medical records. All adverse events, concomitant medications should be documented, serious&#xD;
      adverse events should be reported to the relevant authorities within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up management: follow-up should be conducted according to required time point and&#xD;
      rules. Researchers should try to find out the reasons of losing visit and avoid them. If&#xD;
      patients failed to come to clinic, then the researchers should make a phone call follow up.&#xD;
      If patients refused to continue participating in the study for some concerns, they should be&#xD;
      interpreted by reasonable encourages to continue cooperation.&#xD;
