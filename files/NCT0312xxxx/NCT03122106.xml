  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open-label study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a neoantigen&#xD;
      DNA vaccine strategy in pancreatic cancer patients following surgical resection and adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The neoantigen DNA vaccines will incorporate prioritized neoantigens and&#xD;
      personalized mesothelin epitopes and will be administered with an electroporation device. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of this study is that neoantigen DNA vaccines will be safe and capable of&#xD;
      generating measurable neoantigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses.&#xD;

      -Subjects will be enrolled within 12 weeks of surgery and standard of care adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy will last approximately 12 weeks with an additional 12 weeks of standard of care&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiation. The first vaccine may be administered&#xD;
      following confirmation of disease-free status and within 60 days following date of repeat&#xD;
      imaging. From time of enrollment to first vaccine could be up to 45 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Vaccines will be weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Vaccines will occur within +/- 1 week with at least 3 weeks between vaccines. All study injections will be given intramuscularly using TDS-IM system. At each vaccination time point, patients will receive 2 injections of the neoantigen DNA vaccine, 1 injection into each deltoid or lateralis.&#xD;
Minimum observation of 30 minutes. Vital signs will be taken at 30-45 minutes post-immunization. The injection sites will be inspected for evidence of local reaction. Follow up on subject well-being will be performed by telephone on the 1st or 2nd day following each injection. -Post-vaccination follow-up visits are at Week 25 ± 7 days and Week 77 ± 14 days. Additional follow-up visits or telephone contact will be scheduled at Week 129 and annually thereafter if the patient is alive and available for follow-up.&#xD;
At intervals throughout the study (both before and after vaccination) subjects will have blood drawn for immunologic assays.</description>
