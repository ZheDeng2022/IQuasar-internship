      Aim/Objective: Investigate the effect of implementing a working model for performing&#xD;
      medication reconciliation (MR) and medication review (MRe) in the emergency department (ED),&#xD;
      on readmissions, patient safety and efficiency of the stay in the ED and the hospital.&#xD;
      Research design: randomized, controlled, non-blinded trial. Control group; standard care.&#xD;
      Intervention group; MR and MRe performed at admission to the ED by a clinical pharmacist in&#xD;
      the interdisciplinary team. The intervention is based on a working model for MR, developed in&#xD;
      our initiation project, and it will be adapted to also include MRe. Key challenges in this&#xD;
      research field: Currently no implemented systematic model ensuring that the patient's correct&#xD;
      medication list is obtained and assessed at the point of admission. There is lack of studies&#xD;
      investigating the clinically outcome of performing MR and MRe in the ED. Lack of knowledge on&#xD;
      the extent of drug related hospital admissions in Norway. These challenges are also&#xD;
      recognized and prioritized by the Norwegian authorities. Impact and utility: The results from&#xD;
      this study will give important answers to the challenges listed above. The results could&#xD;
      imply a huge impact on how to organize ED in Norway regarding drug safety. If the hypothesis&#xD;
      of this study is confirmed, implementing the intervention described will increase patient&#xD;
      safety, both the hospital and society can reduce health care expenses from readmissions, and&#xD;
      also the readmission-burden can be reduced for the patients.&#xD;

      Inclusion and randomization procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff at the emergency department, including physicians and nurses will be informed about the&#xD;
      project. At admission, the project pharmacist will describe the project to each potential&#xD;
      participant and/or their next of kin, then provide written information about the project and&#xD;
      answer potential questions. If patients temporary are unable to consent when asked to&#xD;
      participate (e.g. delirium) their next of kin will be asked to supply a preliminary consent&#xD;
      in the patients place. If the patient later refuses to participate he/she will be excluded&#xD;
      from the trial, and any registered data for this patient will be deleted. Patients will&#xD;
      periodically be included at day shift and evening shift and by different clinical pharmacists&#xD;
      to reduce potential bias. We will randomize the patients into two study groups. The&#xD;
      randomization process will be conducted by Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology at&#xD;
      Oslo University Hospital. This department will deliver randomization lists, and the project&#xD;
      pharmacist will follow randomization procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data registration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data will be registered on paper forms, which will be de-identified after the patient&#xD;
      data is transferred de-identified to the password protected project database on the hospital&#xD;
      research server. Only a code list will connect the patient to his or her data. Paper forms&#xD;
      will at all times be kept accessible only to authorized project personnel, and eventually the&#xD;
      forms will be maculated. De-identified patient information will not be brought out of the&#xD;
      hospital. The code list connecting the patients to their data will at the latest be deleted 3&#xD;
      years after start of data collection. When results are published it will not be possible to&#xD;
      identify individual patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Customized Standard Operating Procedures addressing inclusion and randomization operations,&#xD;
      registry operations and how to perform the intervention is developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available information about readmission frequency at Diakonhjemmet Hospital is based on 30&#xD;
      days follow-up, and therefore cannot be used to calculate proportion of patients readmitted&#xD;
      after 12 months. However, numbers from Oslo University Hospital estimate a readmission&#xD;
      proportion of 50% after 12 months in a comparable patient population. Therefore this estimate&#xD;
      is used as the expected readmission rate in the control group of this project. In a previous&#xD;
      Swedish study conducted by Ulrika Gillespie who is member of the reference group of this&#xD;
      project, a 16% reduction in hospital revisits within 12 months was found amongst older&#xD;
      patients (&gt;80 years) following a comparable intervention as described in this project. On&#xD;
      this basis, it will be necessary to include at least 146 patients in each group to show a&#xD;
      significant effect on the primary endpoint (significance level of 5%, study power of 80%).&#xD;
      However, the elderly patients included in the Swedish study had more comorbidity and&#xD;
      therefore more use of health care resources. In this project we will include all patients 18&#xD;
      years and older and thereby the difference between the control group and intervention group&#xD;
      probably will be smaller. A more realistic difference between the groups is 10%; thereby 385&#xD;
      patients would have to be included in each group to show a significant effect on the primary&#xD;
      endpoint. To compensate for dropout the aim is to include 400 patients in each project group,&#xD;
      thus a total of 800 patients. Based on statistics from Diakonhjemmet Hospital, inclusion of&#xD;
      this amount of patients from the Emergency Department would require an inclusion period of 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be conducted in IBM (International Business Machines)SPSS&#xD;
      Statistics (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). Data will be assessed for normality&#xD;
      and analyzed according to appropriate statistical tests. The baseline demographic and&#xD;
      clinical characteristics will be summarized using proportions, means and standard deviations,&#xD;
      or median and interquartile range, as appropriate. Baseline comparisons: Characteristics of&#xD;
      project participants in the two project groups will be compared using the chi-square test for&#xD;
      categorical variables and the Student's t-test or non-parametric equivalent (e.g. the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test) for continuous variables. Multivariable analysis (logistic regression)&#xD;
      will be used to compare endpoints between project groups while adjusting for prognostic&#xD;
      variables and potential confounders. All statistical tests will be interpreted with a&#xD;
      significance level of 5% (two-tailed). For building the model for prioritizing patients at&#xD;
      increased risk of drug-related admissions and drug-related problems at admission to the&#xD;
      emergency department binary regression analysis will be used. Data will be analyzed according&#xD;
      to intention-to-treat (ITT) principles. In addition to ITT analysis, per protocol analysis&#xD;
      will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approval&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is approved by the Regional committee for medical and health research ethics&#xD;
      (REC) and the research committee at Diakonhjemmet Hospital.&#xD;
