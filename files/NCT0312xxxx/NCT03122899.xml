    <textblock>
      Participants will all get sacroiliac joint fusion on this study using the iFuse-3D titanium&#xD;
      implant, manufactured by SI-BONE, Inc. Participants will be followed for clinical outcomes at&#xD;
      pre-planned time points on the trial. Participants will be randomized to CT scan at 6 months&#xD;
      or 12 months, and all will also get a CT scan at 5 years, the final visit for the study.&#xD;

             responsive to conservative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction on one or two sides to be treated on study&#xD;
             that is a direct result of sacroiliac joint disruption and/or degenerative&#xD;
             sacroiliitis and is based on ALL of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patient has pain at or close to the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) with&#xD;
                  possible radiation into buttocks, posterior thigh or groin and can point with a&#xD;
                  single finger to the location of pain (Fortin Finger Test) (on any targeted&#xD;
                  side), and&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patient has positive findings on at least 3 physical examination maneuvers that&#xD;
                  stress the target SI joint(s) and&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patient has block on any study targeted side with improvement in SI joint pain&#xD;
                  numeric rating scale (NRS) at 30 or 60 minutes of at least 50% after injection of&#xD;
                  local anesthetic into any affected SI joint with an immediate pre-block NRS of at&#xD;
                  least 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Baseline Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score of at least 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Baseline (average over the last week) SI joint pain score of at least 50 on 0-100 mm&#xD;
             visual analog scale on any side to be treated under the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has signed study-specific informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has the necessary mental capacity to participate and is physically able to&#xD;
             comply with study protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient's insurance coverage for SI joint treatment has been considered and plan is to&#xD;
             submit all study-related healthcare to insurance (or it is the patient's&#xD;
             responsibility) (any required preauthorization should be completed prior to&#xD;
             randomization on study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Investigator believes patient is appropriate candidate for surgery using iFuse-3D&#xD;
             Implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has bilateral SI joint symptoms with VAS pain scores Â³50 on both sides and&#xD;
             patient refuses to undergo bilateral treatment according to the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is currently pregnant, actively trying to become pregnant or is planning to&#xD;
             become pregnant in the next year.&#xD;

             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Known allergy to titanium or titanium alloys.&#xD;
&#xD;
