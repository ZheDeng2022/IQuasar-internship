    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of niclosamide when given together&#xD;
      with enzalutamide in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has&#xD;
      come back or has spread to other places in the body. Androgens can cause the growth of&#xD;
      prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using enzalutamide may fight prostate cancer by&#xD;
      lowering the amount of androgen the body makes and/or blocking the use of androgen by the&#xD;
      tumor cells. Niclosamide may block signals that enhance prostate cancer cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      enzalutamide and niclosamide may work better in treating patients with castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of niclosamide (PDMX1001/niclosamide) and enzalutamide in patients&#xD;
      with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of PDMX1001/niclosamide and&#xD;
      enzalutamide for the treatment of patients with CRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of PDMX1001/niclosamide. II. To determine the number of&#xD;
      patients who have a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response that is a 50% or more reduction&#xD;
      from the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify overall responses as determined by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2&#xD;
      (PCWG2) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of CRPC patients treated with&#xD;
      PDMX1001/niclosamide and enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate molecular correlatives for patient response and outcomes through the analysis&#xD;
      of patient baseline tumor specimens (diagnostic biopsy) along with serial blood specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of niclosamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive niclosamide orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and enzalutamide PO once daily&#xD;
      (QD) on weeks 1-4. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed carcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
             (CaP); CaP can be recurrent disease after definitive therapy (radical prostatectomy or&#xD;
             radiation therapy) for localized CaP, or metastatic CaP&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have CaP deemed to be castration-resistant by one or more of the&#xD;
             following criteria (despite androgen deprivation when applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progression of unidimensionally measurable disease assessed within 42 days prior&#xD;
                  to initial administration of drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progression of evaluable but not measurable disease assessed within 42 days prior&#xD;
                  to initial administration of drug for PSA evaluation and for imaging studies&#xD;
                  (e.g, bone scans)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Rising PSA, defined as at least two consecutive rises in PSA to be documented&#xD;
                  over a reference value (measure 1); the first rising PSA (measure 2) should be&#xD;
                  taken at least 7 days after the reference value; a third confirmatory PSA measure&#xD;
                  (2nd beyond the reference level) should be greater than the second measure, and&#xD;
                  it must be obtained at least 7 days after the 2nd measure; if this is not the&#xD;
                  case, a fourth PSA measurement is required to be taken and be greater than the&#xD;
                  second measure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease is not required:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have measurable disease must have had X-rays, computed tomography&#xD;
                  (CT) scans or physical examinations used for tumor measurement completed within&#xD;
                  28 days prior to initial administration of drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have non-measurable disease (such as nuclear medicine bone scans)&#xD;
                  and non-target lesions (such as PSA level) assessed within 28 days prior to&#xD;
                  initial administration of drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Soft tissue disease that has been radiated within two months prior to&#xD;
                  registration is not assessable as measurable disease; soft tissue disease that&#xD;
                  has been radiated two or more months prior to registration is assessable as&#xD;
                  measurable disease provided that the lesion has progressed following radiation;&#xD;
                  as the biology of previously irradiated tumors may be different from&#xD;
                  non-irradiated tumors, patients must have at least one measurable lesion outside&#xD;
                  the previously irradiated region in order to be considered to have measurable&#xD;
                  disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If PSA is the only indicator of disease without any evidence of metastasis, PSA&#xD;
                  value must be 5.0 or higher&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expression of AR-V7 is not required as expression of AR-V7 can occur during&#xD;
             enzalutamide and contribute to resistance to enzalutamide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have been surgically or medically castrated; if the method of castration&#xD;
             was luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (leuprolide or goserelin) or&#xD;
             antagonists (degarelix), then the patient must be willing to continue the use of LHRH&#xD;
             agonists or antagonists; serum testosterone must be at castration levels (&lt; 50 ng/dL)&#xD;
             within 3 months prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)&#xD;

             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after&#xD;
