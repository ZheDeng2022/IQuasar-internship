  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 40 to 70% of patients with critical illness experience moderate to severe pain.&#xD;
      Diagnosing pain and assessing its severity is difficult in non-verbal patients both in an&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit and in Postoperative Unit after a major surgery such as cardiac surgery).&#xD;
      In patients who are unable to self-report pain, we use behavioural pain scales, namely BPS -&#xD;
      Behavioural Pain Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study was to validate the Polish version of a behavioural pain&#xD;
      assessment method - BPS in intubated, sedated patients after cardiac surgery versus self&#xD;
      assessment of pain using Numeric rating scale (NRS) in both delirious and non-delirious&#xD;
      patients (assessed using Confusion Assessment Method for ICU, CAM-ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A prospective observational cohort study will include 60 patients. The patients will&#xD;
      be observed by two trained observers during a nociceptive procedure (position change), both&#xD;
      during analgosedation and analgesia. Patients will be observed 5 minutes before, during, and&#xD;
      15 min after the two sets of interventions (six assessments in total). Each BPS assessment&#xD;
      will be carried out by two observers blinded to each other. To validate the Polish BPS&#xD;
      translation we will use the following methods: calculations of interrater reliability,&#xD;
      criterion validity and discriminant validity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients after major surgery, namely cardiac surgery frequently suffer pain during their&#xD;
      postoperative stay in the intensive care unit. Nearly 30% of those patients experience pain&#xD;
      at rest and up to 50% experience pain during nursing procedures. Pain experienced by&#xD;
      critically ill patients falls into four categories that coexist and overlap: pre-existing&#xD;
      chronic pain, acute illness-related pain, continuous ICU treatment-related pain or discomfort&#xD;
      and intermittent procedural pain. Moreover, acute pain experienced in the ICU may become a&#xD;
      chronic problem after discharge from the unit, as a lifelong ICU footprint. Everyday nursing&#xD;
      procedures, including position changing performed in the ICU may be a potential source of&#xD;
      pain, therefore there is a clinical need for a simple and easy behavioural pain scale to&#xD;
      evaluate this condition in patients unable to self assess pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of pain in patients treated in the ICU becomes a daily clinical challenge for the&#xD;
      ICU team, also in those units where minimal sedation environment based on analgesia are used.&#xD;
      Various guidelines and recommendations exist to guide the ICU care team in the pain&#xD;
      management and assessment process. Nevertheless, the gold standard for pain assessment is&#xD;
      patient's self-report of pain (using numeric raing scale - NRS), which can be aided with&#xD;
      behavioural scales only when the self-report is unreliable or impossible to obtain.&#xD;
      Observational pain scales include the Behavioural Pain Scale (BPS) and have been recommended&#xD;
      for clinical use in the critically ill adults. However, their validation in a given patient&#xD;
      population (cardiac, burn, different languages) is strongly recommended and required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need to equip critical care teams (intensive care units - ICUs, high dependency unit -&#xD;
      HDUs, Post-Operative Units) with dedicated monitoring tools is clear. The BPS has been&#xD;
      developed by critical care professionals and validated in various situations, but it has not&#xD;
      been translated or validated in Polish until now.&#xD;
