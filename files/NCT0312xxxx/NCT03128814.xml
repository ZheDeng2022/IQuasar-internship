  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Humans generally develop a preferred upper and lower extremity. Due to repetitive uneven&#xD;
      loading, this gradually results in structural (e.g. increased bone and muscle mass) and&#xD;
      functional (e.g. increased strength) adaptations to the dominant side of the body. The&#xD;
      corresponding structural and functional asymmetry can be further accentuated by (intensively)&#xD;
      practicing a unilateral sport such as tennis, which is very popular. Yet, research on this&#xD;
      particular topic is scarce, especially in (pre)adolescent players. Existing studies, which&#xD;
      often face methodological shortcomings (e.g. crosssectional designs, small sample sizes, no&#xD;
      link to field methods), mainly focus on adults and structural asymmetry of the upper&#xD;
      extremity itself, with very little or no attention to whole body structural as well as&#xD;
      functional asymmetry. Moreover, the link of both forms of asymmetry with growth and&#xD;
      maturation, everyday locomotion, technical skill performance and whole body injury is&#xD;
      currently not (fully) understood. Therefore, the main purpose of this research project is to&#xD;
      gain comprehensive knowledge on the degree, development and implications of both structural&#xD;
      and functional asymmetry during a critical period in life using a longitudinal approach. As&#xD;
      such, this project among youth elite tennis players will provide insights on the extent to&#xD;
      which structural and/or functional asymmetry is acceptable for being most successful but&#xD;
      remaining injury free.&#xD;
