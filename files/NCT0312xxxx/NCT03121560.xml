  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menorrhagia is frequent and occur in 11 to 13 % of the general population. It accounts for&#xD;
      20% of the gynecological consultations and tends to increase with age. It can be the first&#xD;
      symptom of a mild uterine disease or cancer (cervical or endometrial), especially if the&#xD;
      patient is older. The most common causes are polyps, adenomyosis, fibroids, hyperplasia and&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menorrhagia needs to be investigated -especially after menopause, when the prevalence of&#xD;
      endometrial cancer is higher (10-15%). For premenopausal metrorrhagia, the assessment will be&#xD;
      made if a pathology is suspected or if there is no response to the medical treatment within 3&#xD;
      to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical check-up consists in the first instance in a questionnaire, a clinical&#xD;
      examination and an endovaginal ultrasound examination. If the endometrium is thickened, a&#xD;
      focal pathology is suspected, or if the bleeding persists despite a normal endovaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound result, further examinations including a possible biopsy are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While hysteroscopy is widely accepted as a standard examination for uterine cavity&#xD;
      exploration, a meta-analysis showed that the diagnostic performance of hysterosonography was&#xD;
      equivalent. Both are carried out on an outpatient basis during a gynecological consultation&#xD;
      and require no special preparation. Several studies seem to show that hysterosonography is&#xD;
      less painful, causes less discomfort and is therefore more accepted by patients than&#xD;
      hysteroscopy. This is why many practitioners continue to prefer it to hysteroscopy and&#xD;
      associate it with the Pipelle of Cornier for the assessment of postmenopausal metrorrhagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, if endometrial cancer is confirmed, the histological type detected within the biopsy&#xD;
      is the main predictor of the severity of the disease and the treatment to be given. It is&#xD;
      therefore essential to have an accurate biopsy sampling prior to therapeutic management. It&#xD;
      is not the case with blind biopsies (without visual control). Indeed, some studies showed&#xD;
      that the concordance between the optical aspect of the endometrium under hysteroscopy and the&#xD;
      histological result was close to 90%, validating the hypothesis of an improved sensitivity&#xD;
      through visual control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) currently recommends an&#xD;
      endovaginal ultrasound assessment followed by an endometrial biopsy in the event of a&#xD;
      thickened endometrium or when a pathology is suspected. A biopsy can even be taken during the&#xD;
      consultation, at the onset of the complaints. The last recommendations of December 2010 leave&#xD;
      the choice to clinicians regarding the histological diagnostic modalities (a blind biopsy&#xD;
      with the Pipelle of Cornier or a targeted biopsy under hysteroscopy), although the biopsies&#xD;
      under hysteroscopy are recommended since 2015. However, despite its poor sensitivity, the&#xD;
      most widely used technique in the world is the blind biopsy by aspiration performed after&#xD;
      vaginal ultrasound or hysterosonography because it is an easy low cost method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of hysteroscopes with a smaller diameter and the introduction of the&#xD;
      vaginoscopy have considerably increased the tolerance of this examination. In addition,&#xD;
      hysteroscopy allows a simultaneous therapeutic intervention for certain indications, which is&#xD;
      comfortable and well accepted by the patients. Unfortunately, there are few studies comparing&#xD;
      the tolerance of the two examinations performed according to the current recommendations of&#xD;
      good practice of hysteroscopy. Only one comparative randomized study in 2008 showed that&#xD;
      saline infusion sonography (SIS) was less painful than hysteroscopy with vaginoscopy.&#xD;
      However, direct comparison was impossible since women only had one of the two examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Brugmann University Hospital set up a consultation called &quot;one stop bleeding clinic&quot; in&#xD;
      which the two examinations are performed for each patient with abnormal bleedings, in order&#xD;
      to increase diagnostic performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included patients will thus undergo a saline infusion sonography (SIS) and a hysteroscopy&#xD;
      (HSC). Each procedure will be evaluated on pain level (EVA scale) and tolerance by the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;

    <description>Hysteroscopy allows a direct visualization of the interior of the uterine cavity in order to invalidate or confirm the presence of uterine pathologies.In the pre-menopausal period, it is preferable to perform a hysteroscopy at the beginning of the follicular phase (just after the menstruations, when the endometrium is atrophic). Use of a rigid hysteroscope comprising a 2.9 mm optics and a 4.3 mm sheath with a 5 - bit operator channel allowing the realization of a biopsy.</description>

    <description>Hysterosonography (SIS) is an endovaginal ultrasound performed along with an injection of saline in order to observe the uterine cavity and detect any endometrial pathology. A 3D image can be associated with it to define the topography of a lesion. It is ideally performed in the first part of the cycle. Use of the GE Voluson E8 Ultrasound System.</description>
