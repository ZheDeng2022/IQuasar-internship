  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of two targeted therapies as a possible&#xD;
      treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that has relapsed after initial treatment or did&#xD;
      not fully respond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Merestinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LY2874455&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an&#xD;
           investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
           investigational intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that&#xD;
           the intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Merestinib or LY2874455&#xD;
           as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Merestinib is an oral drug known as a MET kinase inhibitor that is being developed as a&#xD;
           treatment for patients with advanced cancer. MET inhibitors work by stopping a signal&#xD;
           that a cell receives instructing it to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LY2874455 is an oral drug known as an FGFR inhibitor that is also being developed as a&#xD;
           treatment for patients with advanced cancer. FGFR inhibitors work by stopping a signal&#xD;
           that a cell receives instructing it to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this research study, the investigators are investigating whether Merestinib and&#xD;
           LY2874455 is safe to give in combination in patients with AML. In previous laboratory&#xD;
           studies, it was found that leukemia cells responded to treatment with a MET inhibitor&#xD;
           and an FGFR inhibitor. However, it is not yet known whether this will also be the case&#xD;
           with LY2874455 and merestinib when given to participants.&#xD;

The investigators are looking for the highest dose of the combination of study drugs that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have AML, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study prior and how well the dose was tolerated.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  For subjects with secondary AML: untreated secondary AML, must have been&#xD;
                  previously treated for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloproliferative&#xD;

          -  No limit to number of prior therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are considered to have failed available therapies or to be ineligible for or&#xD;

             of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening.&#xD;
             Females are not considered to be of child bearing potential if they are status post&#xD;
             successful surgical sterilization including hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy, or if they are postmenopausal (absence of menses for 12&#xD;
             consecutive months that is not secondary to prior chemotherapy, anti-estrogens,&#xD;
             ovarian suppression or other reversible cause).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of Merestinib and LY2874455 on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             Small molecular inhibitors of tyrosine kinase receptors are known to be teratogenic.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to undergo the required bone marrow biopsies. Correlative studies are&#xD;
             strongly encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had radiotherapy within 2 weeks, with the exception of localized&#xD;
             radiotherapy to palliate extramedullary leukemia where no washout is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is&#xD;
             longer) from the last dose of chemotherapy prior to entering the study or those who&#xD;
             have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks&#xD;
             earlier. Hydroxyurea is allowed per treating investigator. IT chemotherapy prophylaxis&#xD;
             is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents, with the exception of&#xD;
             topical or ophthalmologic therapies for mild graft versus host disease which are&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known CNS leukemia involvement should be excluded from this clinical&#xD;
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive&#xD;
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other&#xD;
             adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with other active malignancies that require concurrent chemotherapy are&#xD;
             ineligible. Hormone therapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a known gastrointestinal disorder that in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
             investigator is concerning for malabsorption of oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is unable to swallow pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements. Patients with current or history of NYHA class III or IV cardiac&#xD;
             disease, myocardial infarction with past 6 months, or unstable arrhythmia will be&#xD;
             ineligible for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Merestinib and LY2874455 have the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with Merestinib and LY2874455, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with Merestinib and LY2874455.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Merestinib and LY2874455. In&#xD;
             addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated&#xD;
             with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in&#xD;
             participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with QTcF interval of ≥ 450 msec if male and ≥ 470 msec if female following&#xD;
             or with other factors increase the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events (e.g.&#xD;
             heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT interval syndrome) at screening.&#xD;
             Subjects with bundle branch block should be reviewed by the Medical Monitor for&#xD;
             potential inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known active HBV or HCV (cannot have an elevated viral load of HBV or&#xD;
             HCV if known history) are ineligible&#xD;
