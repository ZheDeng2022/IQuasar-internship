  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was set-up to evaluate clinical efficacy of Pixie® cryogenic pen versus two&#xD;
      comparator cryogenic products (Wartner® and Wortie®) for the treatment of common and plantar&#xD;
      warts.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of cryotherapy has been long known to be effective against warts. The indications for&#xD;
      Pixie® are in line with the indications presented in the collected literature data, as well&#xD;
      as with the indications of equivalent devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of warts treatment without the use of chemicals are clearly evidenced. The&#xD;
      treatment period is much shorter (one treatment compared to daily application of&#xD;
      keratinolytics or fluorouracil, over a period of a few weeks). The cryogen therapy&#xD;
      application through a conic tip is much more precise than with chemical substances. Chemical&#xD;
      substance application is leading to more side effects of the surrounding skin (typical for&#xD;
      chemical treatment are pain, blistering, ulceration and contact dermatitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Instructions for Use were developed in line with these data and are therefore covering&#xD;
      all hazards known up to the date of this report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these data the product received its CE-mark approval&#xD;
