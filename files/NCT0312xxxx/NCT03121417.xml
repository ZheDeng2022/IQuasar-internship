  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying blood and tumor tissue from patients with advanced non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer who are treated with nivolumab to better understand how nivolumab works.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread by turning on the immune system (T cells). We want to study the effects of&#xD;
      nivolumab on the immune system (T cells) by collecting blood samples and samples from&#xD;
      patients' tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study the sustained proliferation of programmed cell death protein (PD)-1+Ki-67+cluster&#xD;
      of differentiation(CD)8 T cells as a predictive biomarker of response to nivolumab by&#xD;
      comparing the response rates to nivolumab treatment between two groups of patients (positive&#xD;
      vs negative) stratified by the status of PD-1+Ki-67+CD8 T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Characterize phenotype of proliferating T cells in peripheral blood in the setting of&#xD;
      nivolumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Perform gene expression profiling of activated T cells from peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Perform T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of activated T cells from peripheral blood and&#xD;
      tumor infiltrating T cells (TILs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess pre-treatment biopsies and biopsies at the time of disease progression for tumor&#xD;
      infiltrating lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days and then&#xD;
      every 3 months for up to 3 years.&#xD;
