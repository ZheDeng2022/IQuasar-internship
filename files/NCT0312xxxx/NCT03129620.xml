  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controlled Hypothermia has become the standard of care for neonates with moderate to severe&#xD;
      HIE. Ampicillin and aminoglycosides are drugs that are universally used for the treatment of&#xD;
      suspected neonatal sepsis, which may or may not be responsible for the etiology of HIE.&#xD;
      Currently, medication dosage regimens are not altered in the setting of CH. A better&#xD;
      understanding of the effects of our interventions on this unique population may help us&#xD;
      tailor our therapy to the specific circumstances of the patient&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) affects approximately 1 to 2 per 1000 live births and&#xD;
      remains a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in the neonatal period. In response to&#xD;
      an anoxic insult, perfusion to vital organs is preserved; however, when this injury is&#xD;
      profound concomitant injury to nonvital organs is observed. Controlled hypothermia (CH) has&#xD;
      been accepted as a neuroprotective therapeutic modality for neonates with moderate to severe&#xD;
      HIE because of its role in attenuating secondary brain injury. Neonates exhibit varying&#xD;
      degrees of multiorgan dysfunction after a hypoxic-ischemic insult, although the added&#xD;
      beneficial and potential adverse effects that CH has in these babies have not been completely&#xD;
      delineated or understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CH has been shown to alter normal physiologic functioning of several organ systems. Specific&#xD;
      physiologic changes as a consequence of CH have been demonstrated in both animal and human&#xD;
      models. The observed reduction in cardiac output and reflexive increase in systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance in response to CH alter renal perfusion and subsequently reduce glomerular&#xD;
      filtration . Drugs that are renally cleared may develop a prolonged half-life in this&#xD;
      setting. Finally, drug metabolism may further be affected by altered hepatic blood flow and&#xD;
      temperature-dependent effects on hepatic enzyme activity . Collectively, the potential&#xD;
      effects of CH on drug metabolism and clearance are significant warranting further&#xD;
      investigation. The investigator aims to evaluate the combined effects of hypoxia and&#xD;
      hypothermia on ampicillin clearance and excretion&#xD;
