      This study will be an open-label, randomized, 4-period, 4-treatment, cross-over,&#xD;
      single-center, single-dose study to assess the relative bioavailability of different&#xD;
      formulations of ticagrelor in approximately 44 healthy adult subjects. Eligible subjects will&#xD;
      be healthy male and female aged 18 to 55 years, with a body weight of 55 to 100 kg and a body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) of 18 to 30 kg/m2. Of the 44 randomized subjects, at least 36 evaluable&#xD;
      subjects should be at the end of the last treatment period. Subjects will be randomized to 1&#xD;
      of 4 treatment sequences and will receive single oral doses of 4 different formulations of&#xD;
      ticagrelor under fasted conditions. Subjects will fast for at least 10 hours prior to&#xD;
      administration of Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs). No fluids will be allowed apart&#xD;
      from water which can be given until 1 hour prior to administration of the IMP and then from 2&#xD;
      hours after administration of the IMP. A meal can be given 4 hours after administration of&#xD;
      the IMP.&#xD;
