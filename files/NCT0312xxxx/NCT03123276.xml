  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a group of rare mesenchymal neoplasms affecting all ages. STS&#xD;
      most commonly present as localised disease but despite surgery and adjuvant treatment more&#xD;
      than half of patients will develop recurrent or metastatic disease. Leiomyosarcoma (LMS), a&#xD;
      malignancy of smooth muscle, is one of the most common STS and undifferentiated pleomorphic&#xD;
      sarcoma (UPS) is a common sarcoma sub-type with aggressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have demonstrated reasonable sensitivity of LMS to gemcitabine monotherapy&#xD;
      with an objective response rate of 8-19%. However the overall survival is still only about 12&#xD;
      months which illustrates the critical clinical need for improved therapies for advanced STS&#xD;
      and sarcoma in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators propose to combine the immune synapse checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
      with the cytotoxic and immune modulating agent, gemcitabine. It is hoped that this dual&#xD;
      immunomodulatory approach will enhance the effect of pembrolizumab on PD-L1 expressing LMS&#xD;
      and UPS, leading to a safe treatment with patient outcomes. This is a two part, phase I,&#xD;
      single centre dose escalation and dose expansion study in the total of 24 patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed metastatic or inoperable LMS and UPS. There will be approximately 12 patients in&#xD;
      the dose escalation cohort (part A) and the starting dose will be a fixed dose rate (FDR)&#xD;
      gemcitabine of 800 mg/m2 on day 1 and 8 of 21 days cycles in combination of 200 mg of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab given as an infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks. The MTD cohort (part B) will then&#xD;
      be expanded to a total of 12 patients in order to further evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of that dose as well as to preliminarily assess response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is sponsored by Royal Marsden NHS Foundation trust and the funding for the study is&#xD;
      provided by Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two part, phase I, single centre dose escalation and dose expansion study to&#xD;
      establish the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      different dose levels of fixed dose rate gemcitabine in patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      metastatic or inoperable leiomyosarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), for&#xD;
      whom gemcitabine monotherapy is deemed appropriate, or in patients with previously treated&#xD;
      leiomyosarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, not including gemcitabine, with&#xD;
      disease progression documented in the 12 weeks prior to enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a maximum of 18 patients in the dose-escalation cohort (part A) and the&#xD;
      starting dose will be a fixed dose rate (FDR) gemcitabine of 800 mg/m2 on day 1 and 8 of 21&#xD;
      days cycles in combination of 200 mg of pembrolizumab given as an infusion on day 1 every 3&#xD;
      weeks. There will be a minimum of three and a maximum of six evaluable patients entered per&#xD;
      dose cohort and each patient will continue to receive treatment cycles of gemcitabine in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab for as long as he/she is, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
      deriving clinical benefit and continues to meet re-treatment criteria. Treatment will&#xD;
      continue until disease progression or is stopped because of toxicity. There will be an option&#xD;
      to continue pembrolizumab alone in patients with SD or response who stop gemcitabine for&#xD;
      toxicity before completing 6 cycles of combination therapy. During the dose-escalation phase,&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, biological and clinical activity will be assessed and the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MTD cohort (part B) will then be expanded to a total of 12 patients in order to further&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of that dose as well as to preliminarily assess response&#xD;
      to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mandatory tumour biopsy will be collected prior to the start of treatment for pre-treatment&#xD;
      testing for PD-L1 expression, Immunophenotyping and extent and localization of tumour&#xD;
      infiltrating lymphocytes and following 3 cycles of therapy for analysis of potential markers&#xD;
      of tumour response on post-treatment tissue. Additional mandatory bloods will be collected&#xD;
      for analysis of potential circulating immune markers. Patient genetic material will also be&#xD;
      collected for analysis of potential markers of tumour response and future pharmacogenetic&#xD;
      analyses. Provision of genetic material is not mandatory for participation in the main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Dose escalation cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will be the dose escalation phase. Gemcitabine doses will be escalated (or&#xD;
      de-escalated) until the non-tolerated dose (NTD) is attained and a maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is defined. A maximum of 18 patients will be recruited in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients as&#xD;
      part of a toxicity rule-based 3+3 design. The total number of patients will depend upon the&#xD;
      number of dose escalations and toxicities observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting dose (dose level 1) will be 800 mg/m2 of FDR gemcitabine given by 120 min IV&#xD;
      infusion on Day 1 and Day 8 of each 3 week cycle (see Rationale for choice of starting&#xD;
      doses). Pembrolizumab will be administered as a 200 mg IV infusion on Day 1 following the&#xD;
      infusion of FDR gemcitabine. Pembrolizumab infusions will be repeated every 3 weeks. Each&#xD;
      dose escalation cohort will consist of a minimum of three and a maximum of six patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dose-limiting toxicity is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neutropenia &lt;0.5 x 109/L for &gt;5 days . This must be confirmed with repeat blood tests at&#xD;
           the Royal Marsden Hospital within 6 days of the diagnosis of neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Febrile neutropaenia as per definition by ESMO (&gt;38.3°C or two consecutive readings of&#xD;
           &gt;38.0°C for 2 hours and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of &lt;0.5 x 109/L or expected&#xD;
           to fall below &lt;0.5 x 109/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thrombocytopenia &lt;25 x 109/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any non-haematological CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 toxicity that is, in the opinion of the&#xD;
           investigator, clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The toxicities listed above must be, in the investigator's opinion, likely to be causally&#xD;
      linked with the administration of Gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the unlikely event that dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs at the proposed starting dose&#xD;
      and that dose is deemed intolerable, a second cohort of patients will be recruited and a dose&#xD;
      of 600 mg/m2 (dose level -1). If no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is documented, the FDR&#xD;
      gemcitabine dose will be escalated to 1000 mg/m2 and subsequently to 1200 mg/m2 unless 2 or&#xD;
      more patients in a single cohort have experienced DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the first patient does not experience dose-limiting toxicity by Day 14 of the first&#xD;
      treatment cycle, two additional patients may be entered. Three patients must complete one&#xD;
      full cycle of treatment (to day 21 of cycle 1) for a dose-escalation decision to be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If one of the first three patients in a cohort experiences a DLT during the first cycle, the&#xD;
      cohort will be expanded to six patients. If 2/3 or 2/6 patients in a cohort experience DLT&#xD;
      during the first cycle, that dose will be considered intolerable, no further dose-escalations&#xD;
      will occur and cohort expansion of the next lowest dose (the presumed maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      - MTD) will commence. Only toxicities occurring during the first treatment cycle will be&#xD;
      taken in to account for dose escalation decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient withdraws or is withdrawn for reasons other than DLT prior to completing Cycle&#xD;
      1, the patient will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Maximum tolerated dose cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 12 additional patients will be recruited and dosed at the MTD identified in Part A&#xD;
      in order to ensure the tolerability and biological activity of gemcitabine in combination&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab as well to preliminarily assess response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of tumour response will be according to RECIST v1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      in Solid Tumours) criteria. The RECIST v1.1 guidelines for measurable, non-measurable, target&#xD;
      and non-target lesions and the objective tumour response criteria (complete response, partial&#xD;
      response, stable disease or progression of disease) are presented in the Appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have imaging performed at the end of the 3rd and the 6th cycle. After cycle&#xD;
      6, RECIST evaluation will be performed at the end of every third cycle for the duration of&#xD;
      the entire study, or more frequently if it deemed necessary by the Investigator.&#xD;
