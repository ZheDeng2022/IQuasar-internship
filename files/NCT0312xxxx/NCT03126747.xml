  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Japanese post-marketing surveillance (PMS) which is required by the&#xD;
      regulatory authorities. General objective of PMS is to confirm the clinical usefulness,&#xD;
      especially the safety profile of a drug under the routine clinical practice.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a local, non-interventional, multi-center, single-cohort study using primary data of&#xD;
      patients treated with YazFlex in endometriosis or dysmenorrhea indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 600 patients (300 for endometriosis and 300 for dysmenorrhea) is planned to be&#xD;
      enrolled in 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment should be performed in Japan based on the product label. The patients will be&#xD;
      observed for up to 2 years (1 year at the earliest) during their YazFlex treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome variables for the primary objective are treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs)&#xD;
      and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The outcome variables for the secondary objective include&#xD;
      newly developed haemorrhagic ovarian cyst, genital bleeding, severity of dysmenorrhea, pelvic&#xD;
      pain and compliance status in the new flexible regimen.&#xD;
