  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of mobility and cognitive ability are serious conditions that threaten the independence&#xD;
      of older adults. The objective of this study is to initiate a line of research to develop a&#xD;
      novel therapeutic intervention to enhance both mobility and cognition via neuroplasticity of&#xD;
      frontal/executive circuits.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frontal lobe dysfunction has been implicated as a factor contributing to gait deficits in&#xD;
      some individuals with Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia and vascular dementia.&#xD;
      There is a critical gap in knowledge about what therapeutic strategies are effective for&#xD;
      maintaining or reinstating function in this critical brain region in order to preserve&#xD;
      physical and cognitive health in older adults. The goal of our research is to develop a novel&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention to enhance both mobility and cognition via neuroplasticity of&#xD;
      frontal/executive control circuits. The Investigator will engage neuroplasticity of frontal&#xD;
      circuits in two ways. The first is through neurorehabilitation with &quot;complex walking tasks&quot;&#xD;
      (CWTs), such as obstacle crossing, obstacle avoidance and walking on non-uniform surfaces.&#xD;
      CWTs are a potent behavioral approach for engaging prefrontal circuits. Furthermore, CWTs are&#xD;
      crucial to successful ambulation in the home and community settings and therefore provide an&#xD;
      ecologically valid therapeutic approach. The second approach that the Investigator will use&#xD;
      to engage neuroplasticity of frontal circuits is anodal transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS). Anodal tDCS is a safe, non-invasive neuromodulation technique. It has&#xD;
      previously been shown to induce excitatory effects on brain tissue and, in single-session&#xD;
      assessments, to improve performance during complex walking tasks. tDCS has also been shown to&#xD;
      be an effective adjuvant for enhancing the effects of cognitive training. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to calculate effect size, establish variance of response and demonstrate&#xD;
      feasibility of the experimental interventions in order to plan for a full scale clinical&#xD;
      trial. Participants will include thirty older adults who demonstrate evidence of&#xD;
      frontal/executive impairment. Participants will be randomized to one of three groups: 1)&#xD;
      standard walking neurorehabilitation with sham tDCS ('standard/sham' group), 2) complex&#xD;
      walking neurorehabilitation with sham tDCS ('complex/sham' group), or 3) complex walking&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation with active anodal tDCS ('complex/active' group). Functional near&#xD;
      infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will be used to explore intervention-induced changes in&#xD;
      prefrontal cortical activity. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, post-treatment and&#xD;
      3-month follow up. The Investigator propose the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine preliminary efficacy for recovery of mobility and cognitive&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate feasibility/safety of tDCS as an adjuvant to rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Explore the relationship between prefrontal activity and behavioral outcomes&#xD;
      The data collected here will provide the information needed to justify and plan a future full&#xD;
      scale clinical trial to assess the relative efficacy and underlying mechanisms of each&#xD;
      intervention approach.&#xD;

    <description>Neurorehabilitation is a behavioral therapeutic approach for enhancing the neural control of task performance by: Restoration of function, specificity of training, Sensory input to the nervous system, Intensity, Repetition and Progression of training. Neurorehabilitation of complex walking will focus on the use of walking tasks that require increased attention and executive functions. The following walking tasks will be used: over obstacles, navigating around obstacles, changing speeds, on soft surfaces (exercise mat), in dim lighting, while conversing with the therapist, up/down ramps and climbing/descending stairs.</description>
