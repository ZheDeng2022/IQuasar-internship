  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is either an obstruction (ischemic stroke) or the rupture of a blood vessel in the&#xD;
      brain (ruptured aneurysm). It can happen at any age in adults. Because of the risk of&#xD;
      irreversible brain damage, it is an absolute medical emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ischemic stroke (stroke) is the result of a lack of oxygen supply to a part of the brain.&#xD;
      It can be one of many causes of stroke as a result of a thrombosis (occlusion) of the&#xD;
      internal carotid artery or a cerebral embolism (migration of a clot or debris of fatty&#xD;
      deposits) from a carotid stenosis. In both cases part of the brain is less irrigated. There&#xD;
      will then be a neurological deficit (paralysis) more or less important corresponding to the&#xD;
      affected cerebral territory. The deficit may concern the whole hemicorps (hemiplegia) or a&#xD;
      part of the body (upper or lower limb) and sometimes is associated with facial paralysis&#xD;
      and/or language disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A brain aneurysm occurs when the wall of an intracranial artery expands abnormally, creating&#xD;
      a pocket of blood. It is often caused by weakness in the vascular tissue, but it can also&#xD;
      occur later in life due to illness, head injury, oral contraceptives or certain lifestyle&#xD;
      habits (smoking, excessive alcohol consumption). Sudden increases in pressure due to stress&#xD;
      or strenuous exercise can serve as a trigger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional Neuroradiology (INR) is a medical specialty that manages stroke patients using&#xD;
      imaging to perform the medical procedure and thereby limit openings and their associated&#xD;
      risks. This specialty has a growing place in modern medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to improve the quality of care, patient safety and functional outcomes, it is&#xD;
      necessary to keep patient information. A database storing patient data from the NRI&#xD;
      department will make it possible to track patients since their arrival at the Brest&#xD;
      University Hospital. Thanks to this structured database, clinical studies will be&#xD;
      facilitated, making it possible to advance knowledge of the pathology and its treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the bibliographical research, we can conclude as to the current state of the facts:&#xD;
      there is currently no method for predicting the functional results of the interventional&#xD;
      neuroradiologist's patient based on automated learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A strategy based on an innovation programme is therefore being implemented over several&#xD;
      years, the first stage of which is the retrospective data study which was approved by the&#xD;
      ethics committee on 12/09/2019 and the second stage is the prospective data study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This innovation program requires the most complete and homogeneous data possible.&#xD;
