    <textblock>
      This study will look at silicone tape compared to the current no dressing standard at the&#xD;
      investigators institution, to determine if silicone tape provides a significant improvement&#xD;
      in post-abdominoplasty scar appearance. Silicone tape will be added to half of the&#xD;
      abdominoplasty incision of patients undergoing abdominally-based breast reconstruction&#xD;
      procedures two weeks after their operation. They will be followed up and assessed at specific&#xD;
      timepoints to determine whether the silicone improves scar outcomes in these patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, masked, randomized self-controlled clinical human trial&#xD;
      to evaluate the appearance of abdominal scars after autologous free-flap breast&#xD;
      reconstruction following post-operative application of silicone tape to improve scar quality.&#xD;
      Incisions from 32 adult subjects will act as their own control and will be randomized to have&#xD;
      silicone tape applied to one half of their abdominoplasty incision and control treatment&#xD;
      using the current standard of care at the investigators institution to the other half, which&#xD;
      is no dressing after the initial two week post-op period. A participant size of 32 leaves&#xD;
      room in case of participant loss to follow-up, ensuring data will be available for the&#xD;
      required sample size of 28 (see statistical analysis section below). A random number sequence&#xD;
      generator will be used to randomize which half of the patient's wound will receive the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from plastic surgery clinics at the Queen Elizabeth II (QEII)&#xD;
      Health Sciences Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Plastic surgeons will be asked to participate&#xD;
      and enroll their breast reconstruction patients, who will undergo a type of abdominoplasty as&#xD;
      part of their reconstruction procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a de novo abdominoplasty procedure as part of a reconstructive breast&#xD;
      surgery. Two weeks post-operatively, one side of the patient's abdominoplasty incision will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive the silicone tape and the remaining half will be left to heal&#xD;
      without any dressing application, which is the current standard at the investigators&#xD;
      institution. Each patient will act as their own control. Patients will apply silicone tape on&#xD;
      a daily basis, with each piece lasting 24 hours. Tape may be removed for showers and replied&#xD;
      after drying. Total length of treatment will be two and a half months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not possible to mask patients, as they will be responsible for ongoing application of&#xD;
      the silicone tape. However, the staff surgeon will be masked. Patients will present to their&#xD;
      first post-op visit at two weeks. After examination by the staff surgeon, the patient will be&#xD;
      seen by the research coordinator who will provide the patient with their randomization&#xD;
      treatment assignment. To ensure ongoing masking, at subsequent follow-up visits, patients&#xD;
      will remove their dressings one day prior to their appointment with their surgeon. This will&#xD;
      ensure no local reaction (i.e. redness after tape removal) that would compromise the masking&#xD;
      of staff surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then follow up for scar assessment at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12&#xD;
      months. Unless otherwise required, scar assessments will then be performed at each visit by&#xD;
      both the patient and the surgeon using validated objective and subjective scar measures.&#xD;
      Patients will also meet with the research coordinator at each follow up visit, to address any&#xD;
      questions or concerns about the study and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (PSAS &amp; OSAS) system will be used to measure&#xD;
      scar appearance. The PSAS and OSAS are tools that the patient uses to assess the scar on&#xD;
      color, irregularity, itch, pain, thickness, stiffness and overall opinion, and the surgeon&#xD;
      uses to assess pigmentation, pliability, relief, surface area, thickness, vascularity and&#xD;
      overall opinion (Appendix A). Of note, only the sum of the components of the OSAS portion of&#xD;
      the assessment scale is included to calculate the power and sample size, and will therefore&#xD;
      be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include the sum of the components of the PSAS&#xD;
      score and the overall scores out of 10 for both the PSAS and OSAS from the patient and masked&#xD;
      surgeon.&#xD;
