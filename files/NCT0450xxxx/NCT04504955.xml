      This prospective, non-interventional research registry is designed to study the comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness and comparative safety of approved treatments for patients with atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis under the care of a licensed dermatologist or qualified physician extender.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include analyzing the epidemiology and natural history of the disease,&#xD;
      its comorbidities, and current treatment practices.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of the Corrona Atopic Dermatitis (AD) Registry is to create a national cohort&#xD;
      of patients with atopic dermatitis. Data collected will be used to extensively evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of medications used to treat atopic dermatitis. This will be done&#xD;
      through the standardized collection of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported&#xD;
      outcomes (ClinRO), and the prevalence and incidence of comorbidities and adverse events,&#xD;
      medication utilization patterns, and patient productivity measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a prospective, non-interventional registry for patients with AD under the care&#xD;
      of a dermatologist or qualified physician extender. Longitudinal data are collected from both&#xD;
      patients and their treating dermatology providers during routine clinical encounters using a&#xD;
      structured and standardized data collection method. The scope of data collection includes but&#xD;
      is not limited to patient demographics, disease phenotype, duration, medical history&#xD;
      (including all prior and current treatments for AD), smoking status, alcohol use, disease&#xD;
      activity and severity, as well as other clinician- and patient-reported outcomes,&#xD;
      comorbidities and adverse events, infections, hospitalizations, and other targeted safety&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the enrollment visit, AD patients and physicians will complete the follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires during regularly scheduled clinical encounters. The goal is to collect data&#xD;
      from patients and providers approximately every six-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the subject or be discovered as a result&#xD;
      of general questioning by the Investigator. During all Corrona related visits with the&#xD;
      Investigator, subjects will be questioned regarding the occurrence of adverse events.&#xD;
