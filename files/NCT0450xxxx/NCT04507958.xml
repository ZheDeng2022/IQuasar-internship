  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the pandemic outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in many countries, the&#xD;
      number of critical ill patients are rapidly growing. Critical ill COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      inevitably require endotracheal intubation for ventilator support. The chest X-rays,&#xD;
      ultrasound, and stethoscope are three tools that can detect whether or not bronchial&#xD;
      intubation has occurred. Auscultation by using the stethoscope is the routine first-line tool&#xD;
      for this purpose. However, clinician who wears the full personal protective equipment (PPE)&#xD;
      is very difficult to perform adequate auscultation with conventional stethoscope. In&#xD;
      addition, the X-ray machines and ultrasound are very difficult to enter the negative-pressure&#xD;
      isolation room and may raise the risks of infection spread. By using the electronic&#xD;
      stethoscope amplified by the Bluetooth speaker, the clinician with full PPE may still hear&#xD;
      the proper lung sound. In addition, electronic stethoscope has a good portability that can be&#xD;
      easily brought into the isolation room. For patients undergoing surgery with general&#xD;
      anesthesia, endotracheal tube is often mandatory and auscultation with stethoscope is&#xD;
      routinely applied. Therefore, the investigators can simulate the circumstance that clinician&#xD;
      with a full PPE to use the electronic stethoscope for confirmation of the proper endotracheal&#xD;
      tube position. In addition, patients undergoing thoracic surgery require the single-lung&#xD;
      ventilation which could be a proper simulation scenario for detection of bronchial intubation&#xD;
      by using electronic stethoscope for clinicians with PPE.&#xD;
