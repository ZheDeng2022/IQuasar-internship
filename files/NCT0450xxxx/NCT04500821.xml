  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimum 50 eyes and up to 100 eyes will be treated in this prospective, open-label clinical&#xD;
      study. The investigator or designee will perform LipiFlow treatment with the Activators&#xD;
      LFD-2100 on both eyes of a subject. The data from the treatment reports generated by the&#xD;
      LipiFlow console and from the questionnaire will be used to assess the clinical utilization&#xD;
      of the Activator LFD-2100. This study will be conducted in up to four sites in the USA.&#xD;
