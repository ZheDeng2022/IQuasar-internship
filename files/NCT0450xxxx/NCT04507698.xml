  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise has been established to be safe and result in improved physical function and quality&#xD;
      of life for most individuals with cancer. However, little information exists regarding&#xD;
      whether exercise can increase overall survival and reduce disease progression, events related&#xD;
      to cancer spreading to the bones (e.g. bone fracture, spinal cord compression, extra&#xD;
      radiation or surgery), and pain in patients with metastatic prostate cancer that is no longer&#xD;
      responding to hormone therapy. The primary objective of this study is to determine if high&#xD;
      intensity aerobic and resistance training plus psychosocial support increases overall&#xD;
      survival compared to psychosocial support alone in prostate cancer patients.&#xD;

      Exercise as Non-Pharmacologic Adjuvant Therapy for Prostate Cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying and evaluating low-toxicity adjuvant interventions that can be combined with&#xD;
      standard therapy to improve outcomes for men with prostate cancer is a high priority and has&#xD;
      the potential to have a large impact on the clinical and public health burden of prostate&#xD;
      cancer. The investigators summarise briefly below promising observational, pre-clinical, and&#xD;
      pilot clinical data that support the hypothesis that exercise improves overall survival and&#xD;
      health-related quality-of-life (QOL) among men with advanced prostate cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vigorous aerobic exercise after diagnosis was associated with a 60% risk of fatal&#xD;
           prostate cancer and a 49% risk of all-cause mortality among men initially diagnosed with&#xD;
           localised disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loading of bone inhibited growth of metastatic tumours in animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resistance exercise and programs with both resistance and aerobic exercise improved&#xD;
           physical function and quality-of-life in men without metastases on androgen deprivation&#xD;
           therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment-related fatigue is a common side effect in men with advanced prostate cancer&#xD;
           and exercise may decrease fatigue and increase adherence to treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New standard treatments for advanced prostate cancer cause adverse metabolic effects&#xD;
           (e.g., weight gain, insulin resistance) that may be avoided or attenuated by exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential mechanisms of exercise influencing prostate cancer tumour biology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential mechanisms by which exercise may reduce the risk of prostate cancer progression,&#xD;
      the incidence and progression of comorbidities, treatment side effects, and overall death&#xD;
      among men with advanced prostate cancer include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endocrine - Exercise influences all hormonal systems in the body with key hormones relevant&#xD;
      to prostate cancer being testosterone, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor-1&#xD;
      (IGF-I). The androgen receptor and its transactivation by ligand are one of the most&#xD;
      important determinants of prostate cancer progression. Measurements of serum androgens&#xD;
      provide an important biomarker for effectiveness of androgen deprivation and prostate cancer&#xD;
      progression. Current studies are inconclusive as to the effects of exercise on serum androgen&#xD;
      levels. In part, these studies are limited by low patient numbers and inadequate methods for&#xD;
      measuring testosterone levels in the low ranges seen in men on androgen deprivation therapy.&#xD;
      This is especially true with the cyp17 inhibitors, such as Abiraterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune System, Inflammation, and Cytokines - High levels of inflammatory biomarkers are&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality, and exercise is&#xD;
      known to levels of circulating inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., interleukin- 6 (IL-6)) in&#xD;
      elderly populations. In addition, exercise may enhance natural killer cell cytotoxicity and&#xD;
      immune surveillance, improving immune defence against prostate cancer. Further, adipokines&#xD;
      may also have pro- or anti-oncogenic roles in angiogenesis and cell proliferation. For&#xD;
      example, adiponectin has anti-inflammatory effects and its serum concentration is inversely&#xD;
      correlated with adiposity. Resistin is associated with insulin resistance through AMP kinase&#xD;
      down-regulation. It up-regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, tumour necrosis factor&#xD;
      alpha (TNFα)) which act via the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B&#xD;
      cells (NFκb) pathway to increase transcription of proteins involved in cell proliferation,&#xD;
      inflammation and anti-apoptosis. In addition, activation of NFκb is implicated in prostate&#xD;
      cancer, nuclear expression being associated with nodal metastasis. IL-6 and TNFα are both&#xD;
      elevated in the serum of patients with metastatic carcinoma compared to patients without&#xD;
      metastases. Interestingly, both are elevated in prostate carcinoma in direct proportion to&#xD;
      disease stage, and increases occur at the time of biochemical (PSA) disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Energy Metabolism - Exercise improves insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. While ADT&#xD;
      in principle is targeting the prostate cancer tumour, the systemic treatment in patient's&#xD;
      results in a range of alterations associated with metabolic syndrome. One of the earliest&#xD;
      changes following ADT, within 2-6 a reduction in insulin sensitivity leading to a rise in&#xD;
      circulating insulin (hyperinsulinemia); the rise in insulin levels precedes changes in&#xD;
      adiposity and increased lipids, sarcopenia, and bone loss. High insulin levels are predictive&#xD;
      of more rapid progression to CRPC, and poor prognosis. Insulin has been shown to have a&#xD;
      direct action on prostate cancer growth and progression, and this can be inhibited by&#xD;
      blocking insulin action. Additionally, high levels of C-peptide, a marker of insulin&#xD;
      secretion, are associated with a more than 2-fold increased risk of prostate cancer-specific&#xD;
      mortality. Further, over the (body mass index (BMI) &gt;25 kg/m2) men with high C-peptide levels&#xD;
      had a more than 4-fold increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality compared to&#xD;
      normal the men with low C-peptide levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition - Cancer and its treatments cause substantial changes in body composition&#xD;
      with sarcopenic obesity being a common outcome. This not only results in substantial&#xD;
      impediment to functional ability and increased cardio-metabolic risk, but also alteration of&#xD;
      adipokine and myokine balance, which may contribute to tumour progression. Exercise increases&#xD;
      lean muscle mass and may cause loss of fat mass, thereby improving overall body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetics - Exercise can produce epigenetic modulations that may inhibit tumour cell&#xD;
      proliferation, such as altering histone deacetylase pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telomere - Short and/or variable telomere length in the prostate is a prognostic marker among&#xD;
      men with prostate cancer. One study among 10 men with localised prostate cancer on active&#xD;
      surveillance reported that a lifestyle program that included moderate exercise (as the as&#xD;
      diet, stress management, and social support) increased telomere length in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholesterol - Epidemiological studies have suggested that high levels of cholesterol in the&#xD;
      blood are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer and progression of prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Exercise combined with dietary modification has been demonstrated to substantially&#xD;
      reduce total cholesterol as the as improve the ratio of high density lipoprotein to low&#xD;
      density lipoprotein cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress - Exercise has been demonstrated to modulate oxidative stress and improve&#xD;
      antioxidant capacity. In a pilot study at the University of California, San Francisco, men&#xD;
      with low risk, localised prostate cancer who reported ≥3 hours/the of vigorous physical&#xD;
      activity had modulated expression of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2)&#xD;
      mediated oxidative stress response pathway in their normal prostate tissue compared to men&#xD;
      who did less exercise. Oxidative stress is hypothesized to play a significant role in the&#xD;
      initiation and progression of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the burden of disease among men with prostate cancer advances, a rapid, significant&#xD;
      deterioration in QOL is observed. Bone pain which is reported in up to 80% of patients with&#xD;
      metastatic disease throughout their treatment, makes the largest single contributor to QOL&#xD;
      deterioration in this population. Other symptoms which compromise QOL include urinary&#xD;
      frequency, sexual dysfunction, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite and dyspnoea. The&#xD;
      benefits of exercise training on QOL for men with non-metastatic prostate cancer are the&#xD;
      described, and include improvements in general QOL and also cancer-specific concerns&#xD;
      including fatigue and sexual health. Whether exercise can improve QOL among men at the end&#xD;
      stage of this disease is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic spread of prostate cancer occurs primarily to sites in the axial skeleton&#xD;
      including the femur, pelvis and vertebrae. Metastatic lesions, which are typically&#xD;
      osteoblastic, lead to significant bone pain and compromised skeletal quality. Skeletal&#xD;
      complications, such as bone fractures, orthopaedic intervention or spinal cord compression,&#xD;
      which develop due to bone metastases, result in significant patient morbidity and compromised&#xD;
      QOL. Furthermore, compared to those who do not experience a symptomatic skeletal related&#xD;
      event (SSE), the occurrence of a SSE is associated with increased patient mortality. A&#xD;
      modular multi-modal approach to exercise training involving individualised prescription of&#xD;
      exercise to reduce the forces going through the bone has been shown to be safe and feasible&#xD;
      in men with bony metastases and not associated with increased risk of pathological fracture.&#xD;
      This proposal will test whether exercise training delays time to SSE as the time to&#xD;
      progression of pain and affects measures of pain severity and opiate use. Control or relief&#xD;
      of pain and delay or prevention of SSE are both indications for approved therapeutic agents&#xD;
      for men with metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to SSE and pain due to the infiltration of metastatic prostate cancer in bone,&#xD;
      men with this disease also experience debilitating cancer-related fatigue and adverse&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic health as a side effect of therapy. Cancer-related fatigue is a distinct&#xD;
      phenomenon from fatigue experienced by healthy individuals and significantly health-related&#xD;
      QOL. There are extensive data to support that exercise improves fatigue in men with a disease&#xD;
      burden. This proposal will be the first to examine whether exercise improves or delays onset&#xD;
      of cancer-related fatigue in men with metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Focus on Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer (MCRPC), our overarching&#xD;
      objective is to determine the effect of exercise on overall survival among men with advanced&#xD;
      prostate cancer. The investigators have chosen to restrict our study population to men with&#xD;
      progressive MCRPC because: 1) Men with progressive MCRPC are at high risk for death within a&#xD;
      time frame that can be feasibly tested in the setting of a RCT (median OS on treatment = 3242&#xD;
      to 3543 months). 2) With the proper use of stratification variables (treatment and study&#xD;
      site), it is possible to define a homogenous study population in terms of risk of death; 3)&#xD;
      This is the largest group of patients that can be uniformly considered to have advanced&#xD;
      prostate cancer and thus provides the largest patient pool for recruitment while also meeting&#xD;
      criteria 1 &amp; 2; 4) while new therapies for MCRPC extend life, they also cause significant&#xD;
      harm to metabolic and cardiac function and health-related QOL which may be attenuated or&#xD;
      avoided through exercise; and 5) the investigators hypothesize that exercise will have the&#xD;
      largest measurable effect on OS among men with documented evidence of progressing MCRPC (in&#xD;
      contrast to men with stable M1 CRPC, non-castrate resistant disease, or non-metastatic&#xD;
      disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for this randomised controlled trial will be overall survival (OS). OS&#xD;
      was chosen as the primary endpoint because it has clear biological, clinical and public&#xD;
      health significance and is a validated endpoint for approval of new treatments among men with&#xD;
      MCRPC. Additionally, OS data can be obtained with minimal loss to follow-up through review of&#xD;
      medical and death records. The median OS among men with MCRPC is 3242 to 3543 months. Thus,&#xD;
      OS is a feasible outcome to examine within the budget and timeline of the proposed study.&#xD;
