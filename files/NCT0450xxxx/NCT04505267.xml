  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial investigates the best dose and side effects of NBTXR3 when given together&#xD;
      with radiation therapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be treated&#xD;
      by surgery (inoperable) and has come back (recurrent). NBTXR3 is a radio-enhancer designed to&#xD;
      increase the radiotherapy energy dose deposition inside tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses&#xD;
      high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving NBTXR3 and radiation therapy&#xD;
      may increase radiation-dependent tumor cell killing without increasing the radiation exposure&#xD;
      of healthy surrounding tissues.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of hafnium oxide-containing&#xD;
      nanoparticles NBTXR3 (NBTXR3) activated by radiotherapy in patients with inoperable,&#xD;
      locoregional recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), previously treated with definitive&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of reirradiation with NBTXR3 in patients with&#xD;
      inoperable, locoregionally recurrent NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the anti-tumor response of reirradiation with NBTXR3 in patients with&#xD;
      inoperable, locoregionally recurrent NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate time-to-event outcomes after reirradiation with NBTXR3 in patients with&#xD;
      inoperable, locoregionally recurrent NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess biomarkers of response in patients treated with NBTXR3/radiation therapy (RT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of NBTXR3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive NBTXR3 intratumorally (IT) or intranodally on day 1. Within 15 days,&#xD;
      patients undergo RT 5 times weekly (Monday-Friday) over 3 weeks for a total of 10-15&#xD;
      fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,&#xD;
      then every 6 months for up to 5 years.&#xD;
