    <description>Retrospective analysis of existing data :Anthropometric parameters, including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body weight and height at fasting state, were measured in all subjects at the occasion of the routine follow-up visits. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by the height in meter squared (kg/m2). Body composition parameters, including lean mass (LM), total body fat (BF), android and gynoid fat, and bone mineral content, were determined using dual-energy X-Ray absorbtiometry (DXA) (GE-Healthcare Lunar iDXA system), biochemical and routine hormonal analysis</description>

    <description>The University Hospital in Nancy is an academic regional transgender referral center in Lorraine (France) and keeps a register of subjects available from 2004. The register at the time of the present study (February 2020) included 320 subjects who met diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria and were seen regularly in the out-patient clinic at our department of endocrinology. Our investigation is a part of the regular care of subjects with gender dysphoria.</description>
