      Single-blind, double-blind, controlled, randomized clinical trial of two parallel branches&#xD;
      depending on the product consumed (experimental product and placebo product) and&#xD;
      single-center with the objective of evaluating the effect of the investigational product on&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk reduction.&#xD;

      Subjects who meet the selection criteria will make a total of two visits to the research&#xD;
      laboratory and will carry out the tests established in the protocol. Subsequently, a&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be performed with the variables measured in the study to obtain&#xD;
