  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a primary headache attack, specific, paroxysmal, with or without aura, with&#xD;
      subjective manifestations both before and after the attack, a chronic type of headache with&#xD;
      symptoms of recurrence, attacks at productive age and can cause a decrease in work&#xD;
      productivity up to 80%, so that it will affect the quality of life, economic life and&#xD;
      education globally which leads to losses for migraine sufferers and institutions where&#xD;
      migraine sufferers attend school, work and in the lives of sufferers' families.&#xD;

      Migraine is a primary headache attack, specific, paroxysmal, with or without aura, with&#xD;
      subjective manifestations both before and after the attack, a chronic type of headache with&#xD;
      symptoms of recurrence, attacks at productive age and can cause a decrease in work&#xD;
      productivity up to 80%, so that it will affect the quality of life, economic life and&#xD;
      education globally which leads to losses for migraine sufferers and institutions where&#xD;
      migraine sufferers attend school, work and in the lives of sufferers' families. With the high&#xD;
      prevalence and disability rates for migraine sufferers, on the other hand, the right&#xD;
      treatment for migraine has not yet been obtained to the maximum, it is necessary to deepen&#xD;
      the treatment and prevention of migraine is needed, and until now there has been no&#xD;
      definitive cure, both for prevention and treatment, so it is necessary to develop therapies&#xD;
      that can provide more accurate relief for migraine sufferers. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the success in managing migraine in reducing the frequency of attacks, reducing the&#xD;
      intensity of attacks and reducing the duration of attacks from weeks 0, 4 to 8&#xD;
