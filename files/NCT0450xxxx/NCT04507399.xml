      Brief Summary: This study aims to investigate whether protein fortification of beverages&#xD;
      causes mouthdrying and mucoadhesion and whether this is influenced by saliva flow.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether whey protein beverages causes mouthdrying and reduces acceptability&#xD;
      compared with a control beverage (whey permeate beverage) and to determine whether&#xD;
      manipulating salivary flow rates influences mouthdrying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether mucoadhesion is a probable cause of mouthdrying.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study involves both a crossover design where each participant tastes both the control product and the protein fortified product with an appropriate break between the two sessions. The study will be conducted single blind as it not feasible to blind the researcher. Each participant will attend 2 study visits and all foods will be presented with random blinding codes.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mucoadhesion and Mouthdrying</measure>
    <time_frame>Saliva collection and mouthdrying scoring throughout visits, 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Following swallowing of different whey beverage samples (whey protein / whey permeate), volunteers will be asked either to rate samples for mouthdrying or to spit their saliva into a tube at specific timepoints (15s &amp; 60s) with appropriate rest periods. The rating and spitting times will be set within a balanced order protocol.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mouthdrying from whey beverages</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (Sampled at study visit one)</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived mouth drying from whey beverages (whey permeate / whey protein) using data from sensory methods (rating drying as well as discrimination tests &quot;which is the stronger in drying&quot;). Scale for scoring is the gLMS scale (general linear magnitude scale); higher value is worse outcome.</description>
