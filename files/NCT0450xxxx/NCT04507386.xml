  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research program aims to comprehensively investigate the clinical, physiological,&#xD;
      metabolic, and molecular effects of reducing sedentary behavior in patients with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. A 4-month parallel-group randomized controlled trial will be conducted&#xD;
      aiming to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of a newly developed personalized&#xD;
      intervention focused on replacing sedentary time with light-(or very light-) intensity&#xD;
      physical activity in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Additionally, a sub-sample of&#xD;
      patients will complete a randomised cross-over study aiming to unravel potential mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying the metabolic, physiological and molecular effects of breaking up sedentary time&#xD;
      with light-intensity physical activity versus carrying out the minimum amount of daily&#xD;
      exercise at once and then remaining sedentary versus simply remaining sedentary throughout&#xD;
      all sessions, in a well-controlled laboratorial condition.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A 4-month parallel-group randomised controlled trial will be performed, in which patients with mild cognitive impairment will be assessed at baseline (PRE) and after 4 months (POST). Moreover, a sub-sample of patients will perform a randomised crossover trial at baseline (PRE). Patients will complete three experimental sessions in a random manner, as follows: Prolonged sitting (SIT), in which participants engaged in prolonged sitting throughout an 5-h period and were instructed to minimize excessive movement; Exercise followed by prolonged sitting (EX), in which participants performed a 30-min moderate-to-vigorous exercise bout on a treadmill, subsequently, participants engaged in prolonged sitting as described for SIT; Light-intensity breaks (BR), in which participants completed a 3-min bout of light-intensity walking every 30 min of sitting throughout the experimental period.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Assessment of cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 inhalation</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will wear a mask connected to a unidirectional valve with a Douglas bag (with 5% CO2). Evaluations will include: partial pressure of carbon dioxide at the end of expiration (PetO2, PetCO2) (Metalyzer model III b/breath-by-breath, CORTEX, Germany) and O2 saturation (SpO2; Nellcor, Medtronic Corporation, USA). Blood flow and diameter of the internal carotid artery will be assessed using a Doppler ultrasound (Logiq E, General Electric, Milwaukee, USA) connected to a linear transducer (12L-RS - 5.0-13.0 MHz). Cerebrovascular reactivity will be assessed by responses of arterial diameter, blood flow and shear rate to CO2 inhalation (reactivity = peak - baseline). A software with automatic detection of the artery walls will be used (Cardiovascular Suite, Quipu®, Pisa, Italy). Blood flow will be calculated (Flow = Vm x πr2 x 60). The shear rate will be calculated using the following formula: Shear rate = 8 x Vm / diameter</description>
