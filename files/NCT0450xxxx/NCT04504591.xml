  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study will be to assess the efficacy of S-ICD with SMART Pass to&#xD;
      discriminate dynamic T-waves amplitudes and morphologies over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot, multi-centric, prospective, blinded, one arm (repeated measures), non-interventional&#xD;
      study. Objective is to setup a 8-center data collection registry between Switzerland, Italy&#xD;
      and Belgium.&#xD;

      The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) should be considered as an&#xD;
      alternative to transvenous defibrillators in patients with an ICD indication when pacing&#xD;
      therapy for bradycardia support, cardiac resynchronization or ventricular tachycardia&#xD;
      management is not necessary.1 This class IIa recommendation from the 2015 ESC guidelines can&#xD;
      often be applied to patients with inherited channelopathies, since these patients usually&#xD;
      require decades of ICD therapy without developing a need for any type of pacing support. On&#xD;
      the other hand, especially in patients with Brugada Syndrome (BrS), the dynamic nature of ECG&#xD;
      morphology may increase the risk for cardiac T-wave oversensing (TWOS), which has also been&#xD;
      reported the main cause of inappropriate shocks (IAS) in the general S-ICD population. In&#xD;
      order to avoid unnecessary sensing issues with the S-ICD, baseline ECG screening is&#xD;
      recommended prior to the implantation procedure. Recently, it has been shown that eligibility&#xD;
      failure for S-ICD can occur in up to 13% of patients with an inherited primary arrhythmia&#xD;
      syndrome and that patients with BrS present the highest rate of screening failure if compared&#xD;
      with other channelopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of yet, this QRS and T-wave morphology assessment can be done with an algorithm-based&#xD;
      automated screening tool (AST) that mimics the sensing set-up process of the S-ICD after&#xD;
      implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a novel 9Hz high-pass filter (SMART Pass, available for all EMBLEM S-ICD models)&#xD;
      has been introduced to reduce the risk of TWOS with the S-ICD12. This algorithm is only&#xD;
      available with the S-ICD sensing mechanism and has not been incorporated in the automated&#xD;
      screening software12. Retrospective modelling of inappropriate shock events recorded in the&#xD;
      EFFORTLESS registry have shown a reduction in inappropriate shocks by ~80% with SMART Pass&#xD;
      compared to the first generation sensing algorithm of the S-ICD13. This was achieved without&#xD;
      affecting the detection and the time to therapy for true ventricular arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective data are lacking about the effectiveness of SMART Pass to discriminate T-waves in&#xD;
      patients with dynamic ECG morphologies. This may be of particular interest since the&#xD;
      occurrence of ECG morphology disturbances is usually difficult to be predicted in individual&#xD;
      patients. As such, these data will provide additional guidance to the mandatory screening&#xD;
      process for all S-ICD candidates, in particular for those who have a known risk factor for&#xD;
      dynamic ECG changes, like patients withBrS. The main objective of this study will be to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of S-ICD with SMART Pass to discriminate dynamic T-waves amplitudes and&#xD;
      morphologies over time.&#xD;
