  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intermediate/high risk endometrial cancer shows locoregional recurrence rates up to 20%. Also&#xD;
      in so called low-risk disease 5-10% incidence of nodal metastasis is reported. Although&#xD;
      adjuvant radiotherapy may reduce these recurrences there has been no survival benefit. To&#xD;
      avoid toxicity of irradiation and preserve the full potential of radiotherapy for salvage&#xD;
      treatment of recurrences surgery should avoid locoregional recurrence. According to the&#xD;
      concept of ontogenetically based compartmental surgery it may be suggested that this may be&#xD;
      achieved by PMMR and therapeutic LNE as it has been already shown for TMMR in cervical cancer&#xD;
      and TME in rectal cancer. First, monocentric data have shown feasibility and safety of this&#xD;
      approach and are promising with respect to reduce locoregional recurrence rate significantly.&#xD;
      On parallel it has also been convincingly shown that sentinel node detection shows a high&#xD;
      level of accuracy in precluding nodal involvement in endometrial cancer. Thus, unnecessary&#xD;
      complete lymphadenectomy may be avoided in patients with proven node negative disease.&#xD;
      However, this procedure is aimed on diagnostic and not therapeutic goals. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      therapeutically it fits well in the surgical concept of compartmental surgery indicating the&#xD;
      peripheral border of therapeutic surgical approach. This leads to the concept to resect the&#xD;
      embryologically determined tissue of risk en bloc together with the &quot;sentinel nodes&quot; of the&#xD;
      draining lymph compartment (module I). In case of positive node extended therapeutic pelvic&#xD;
      and paraaortic lymphadenectomy (module II) may be indicated. This should now be evaluated in&#xD;
      a European collaborative observational trial. The surgical arm (cohort A) will include&#xD;
      Patients who have received surgical treatment (module I) and in case of positive nodes or&#xD;
      enhanced risk for isolated positive paraaortic nodes (module II) and don't want to receive&#xD;
      adjuvant radiation therapy; in intermediate/high risk situations, however, adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy should be offered to these patients. For patients with high-risk carcinomas who&#xD;
      do not want to be treated with the modular concept, the option of receiving systematic&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy during primary surgery will be given. Patients who prefer to be treated&#xD;
      according current clinical practice will be asked to participate in cohort B to be observed&#xD;
      as concomitant control and will be treated according to current clinical practice based on&#xD;
      the European ESMO/ESGO/ESTRO-Guidelines. Primary endpoint will be loco-regional recurrence&#xD;
      and recurrence free survival. Follow up is planned for 5 years following date of first&#xD;
      surgery (module I).&#xD;
