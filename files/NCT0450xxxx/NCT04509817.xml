  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 subjects will be recruited and randomly allocated into experimental or control&#xD;
      group with 30 subjects respectively. The subjects in experimental group will receive a&#xD;
      standardized acupuncture treatment plus usual care, whereas the ones in control group will be&#xD;
      managed only with usual care.&#xD;

    <description>Acupuncture intervention Disposable, sterilized needles (0.25×40 mm and 0.30×50 mm) will be used and selected acupoints will include GV20, CV4, and bilateral BL32, ST25, ST29, EX-CA1, LI4, LR3, SP6, SP9. Subject will be prone position first and BL32 will be inserted with an angle of 30-45° in an inferomedial direction and a depth of 30-50 mm. Once the subject has a needle sensation ('De-qi'), the needle will be removed immediately. Then the subject will be supine position, and GV20, CV4, ST25, ST29, EX-CA1, LI4, LR3, SP6, SP9 will be needled with a depth of 10-40mm. After subject feel 'De-qi', the needles will be placed for 20 min to maintain the stimulation.&#xD;
Usual care intervention The subjects will receive the health advice including diet with regular meal, enough sleep, and appropriate exercise.&#xD;
