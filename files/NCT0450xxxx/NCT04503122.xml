  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia. The posterior surface of the left atrium&#xD;
      is covered by an extensive network belonging to the autonomic nervous system that can be&#xD;
      damaged during the ablation. The involvement of the autonomous nervous system in the genesis&#xD;
      and maintenance of atrial fibrillation remains poorly understood. Baroreflex sensitivity is a&#xD;
      non-invasive method assessing autonomous nervous system activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of atrial fibrillation recurrence after ablation is currently high and a better&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms associated with recurrence is essential to improve selection&#xD;
      of the patients who will benefit the most from this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between the baroreflex sensitivity and&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation recurrences and to analyze the prognostic contribution of the baroreflex&#xD;
      measurement compared to other published criteria.&#xD;
