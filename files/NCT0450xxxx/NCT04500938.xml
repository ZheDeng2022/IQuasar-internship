      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of heart failure has improved considerably in the past decades. Despite this&#xD;
      improvement, the disease may progress into an end-stage ultimately leaving the physicians&#xD;
      with no other treatment option than heart transplantation (HTx). There are multiple&#xD;
      etiologies underlying heart failure. Cardiomyopathy is the leading cause for HTx in any&#xD;
      age-group with coronary artery disease being the second most common cause in adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alterations in the mitochondrial function have been recognized as key factors in heart&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the transplant procedure the diseased heart is removed, providing a unique opportunity&#xD;
      to collect samples eligible for thorough mitochondrial examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hopefully, the knowledge gained from this investigation will contribute with important&#xD;
      insights in the diseased myocardial energy metabolism. Such knowledge may pave the way for&#xD;
      development of treatments targeting both energy substrate supply for adenosine-triphosphate&#xD;
      generation produced by the mitochondria as well as mitochondrial function in the failing&#xD;
      heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathological myocardial function seen in heart failure is related to dysfunctional&#xD;
      cardiac mitochondria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine if cardiac mitochondrial function in end-stage heart failure of multiple&#xD;
      etiologies is inferior to mitochondrial function in transplanted hearts with no signs of&#xD;
      rejection or vasculopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial mitochondrial function analyzed from 24 explanted hearts will be compared to&#xD;
      endomyocardial biopsies from 20 HTx patients at scheduled biopsies (1 or 2 years after&#xD;
      implantation).&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of heart failure has improved considerably in the past decades. Despite this&#xD;
      improvement, the disease may progress into an end-stage ultimately leaving the physicians&#xD;
      with no other treatment option than heart transplantation (HTx). There are multiple&#xD;
      etiologies underlying heart failure. Cardiomyopathy is the leading cause for HTx in any&#xD;
      age-group with coronary artery disease being the second most common cause in adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alterations in the mitochondrial function have been recognized as key factors in heart&#xD;
      failure. The understanding of the complex interaction of the mitochondria in regulation of&#xD;
      the metabolism and cellular apoptosis has brought new perspectives to research in heart&#xD;
      failure. It is now known that the myocardial mitochondrial density changes and their function&#xD;
      and integrity is impaired during heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the transplant procedure the diseased heart is removed, providing a unique opportunity&#xD;
      to collect samples eligible for thorough mitochondrial examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected myocardial tissue samples will be evaluated with High Resolution Respirometry,&#xD;
      examining the glucose coupled respiratory capacity of permeabilized myocardial fibers. The&#xD;
      respiratory capacity in the diseased fibers will be compared to the respiratory capacity in&#xD;
      fibers from coronary healthy HTx patients transplanted 1 to 2 years prior to acquisition of&#xD;
      the fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hopefully, the knowledge gained from this investigation will contribute with important&#xD;
      insights in the diseased myocardial energy metabolism. Such knowledge may pave the way for&#xD;
      development of treatments targeting energy substrate supply for adenosine-triphosphate&#xD;

&#xD;

      The pathological myocardial function seen in heart failure is related to dysfunctional&#xD;
      cardiac mitochondria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine if cardiac mitochondrial function in end-stage heart failure of multiple&#xD;
      etiologies is inferior to mitochondrial function in transplanted hearts with no signs of&#xD;
      rejection or vasculopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial mitochondrial function analyzed from 24 explanted hearts will be compared to&#xD;
      endomyocardial biopsies from 20 HTx patients at scheduled biopsies (1 or 2 years after&#xD;
      implantation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: 1) Mitochondrial respiratory capacity. 2) Mitochondrial complex function, outer&#xD;
      membrane integrity and mitochondrial content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-resolution respirometry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-resolution respirometry is used to measure mitochondrial respiratory capacity in&#xD;
      endomyocardial biopsies. After appropriate preparation, two biopsies are transferred to an&#xD;
      oxygraph (Oxygraph-2k; Oroboros, Innsbruck, Austria) for high resolution respirometry.&#xD;
      Mitochondrial respiratory capacity will be analyzed in a step-by-step manner using titrations&#xD;
      of substrates and inhibitors to evaluate glucose coupled respiration in the fibers.&#xD;
      High-resolution respirometry analysis is performed within 8 hours after the biopsy has been&#xD;
      taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After analysis the tissue will be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a research&#xD;
      biobank at -80 degrees celsius until examination of citrate synthase activity is carried out.&#xD;
      Hereafter, any remaining tissue will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electron microscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample from each biopsy used for high-resolution respirometry will be used for electron&#xD;
      microscopy (EM) to evaluate mitochondrial volume density (MitoVD) and integrity. Muscle&#xD;
      samples are fixated for 24 hours in glutaraldehyde and washed 4x15 minutes with Na-cacodylate&#xD;
      buffer before being casted in Epon. The Epon casted tissue will be stored in a research&#xD;
      biobank until EM analysis. Ultra-thin sections of the Epon-blocks (60 nm) are cut in three&#xD;
      depths and dyed with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Imaging is performed with an EM 208&#xD;
      transmission electron microscope and a Megaview III camera. All fibers are photographed at&#xD;
      10.000 × magnification in a randomized order. MitoVD is estimated from mitochondrial&#xD;
      fractional area and only distinct fibers will be used in the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normally distributed data will be presented as mean ± standard deviation; non-normally&#xD;
      distributed data will be presented as median and interquartile range. Categorical data are&#xD;
      presented as absolute values or percentages. Histograms and Q-Q plots will be used to check&#xD;
      continuous values for normality. Between-group differences will be assessed by t-test for&#xD;
      normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed data.&#xD;
      Statistical significance at a p-value of &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present there are no test-retest evaluation of mitochondrial respiratory analysis in&#xD;
      endomyocardial biopsies from explanted human hearts. However, a recent study performed at our&#xD;
      department on myocardial biopsies demonstrated that a total sample size of 40 human subjects&#xD;
      in a 1:1 parallel group design was able to identify differences between the two groups&#xD;
      (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data will be recorded in the patient's electronic patient record or on specific&#xD;
      worksheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A centralized electronic Case Report Form (CRF) will be constructed for data capture. Data&#xD;
      will be stored until completion of the project, after which, it will be transmitted to the&#xD;
      Danish Data Archives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HTx is the golden standard treatment for patients suffering from end-stage heart failure, but&#xD;
      its limitations cannot be ignored. Firstly, the procedure is accompanied by a substantial&#xD;
      risk and a significant percentage of patients suffer from acute graft failure. Furthermore,&#xD;
      HTx patients have a higher risk of severe infections and cancer, and up to 50% of HTx&#xD;
      patients suffer from cardiac allograft vasculopathy 10 years after transplantation, all of&#xD;
      which are highly related to mortality. Hence, postponing HTx is desirable, if health and&#xD;
      life-quality can be kept at an acceptable level. In this context, mitochondrial function&#xD;
      seems to be pivotal, as approaches to assess mitochondrial function in the failing heart may&#xD;
      prove to pave the way for new follow-up algorithms and even treatment targets.&#xD;
