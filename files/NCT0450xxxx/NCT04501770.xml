  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of different doses of&#xD;
      M802 in patients with HER2-positive advanced solid tumors, and to determine the dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) so as to provide basis for the&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
