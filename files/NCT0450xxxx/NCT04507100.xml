  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims is to comprehensively analyze the design, implementation, results, and impact&#xD;
      of Salud Escolar, a program led by the Mexican Ministries of Health and Education, during the&#xD;
      first phase of implementation, from August 2020 to July 2021. Salud Escolar considers the&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO) health promoting framework to foster a healthy environment&#xD;
      and enhance children's physical activity, healthy eating and hydration. Salud Escolar&#xD;
      consists on several activities aligned in the following components: healthy eating, healthy&#xD;
      hydration, physical activity and additional cross sectional strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of implementation will be conducted in a total of 58 schools located in&#xD;
      Mexico City purposively selected by the Ministry of Education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design evaluation will use available policy documents and program implementation&#xD;
      guidelines, scientific literature, to investigate wether the design of Salud Escolar is&#xD;
      adequate to achieve the proposed objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation evaluation will be conducted in a sub-sample of 6 intervention schools&#xD;
      using qualitative methodologies among key informants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results evaluation will be conducted in the 58 intervention schools and pre-post changes&#xD;
      in self-reported knowledge, attitudes and practices related to healthy eating, hydration and&#xD;
      being physically active will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact evaluation aims to evaluate the effect of Salud Escolar on the consumption of&#xD;
      fruits, vegetables and plain water and daily moderate to vigorous physical activity. A sample&#xD;
      of 1200 children (6-12 years old) in 15 intervention schools- randomly selected from the&#xD;
      sample of 58 intervention schools-, and 15 comparison schools - randomly selected from the&#xD;
      waiting list of available schools in the city will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results derived from this analysis, a set of recommendations will be provided to&#xD;
      improve the feasibility of scaling up the program at the national level during the second and&#xD;
      third phases of Salud Escolar.&#xD;
