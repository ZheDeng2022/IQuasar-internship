  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of&#xD;
      the drug Perampanel when used in persons who drink and wish to stop drinking. Perampanel has&#xD;
      been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of seizures&#xD;
      but has not yet been approved to treat alcohol use disorders. For this reason, it is&#xD;
      considered an investigational drug. Some people in this study will receive Perampanel alone&#xD;
      and some people will receive Perampanel and Disulfiram, this will be determined by the&#xD;
      pharmacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be asked to take a medication (Perampanel or Perampanel + Disulfiram) every&#xD;
      day for approximately 8 weeks and have weekly study visits. At these visits, participants&#xD;
      will be asked questions about their medical history, drinking behavior and life events, have&#xD;
      bloodwork checked routinely, have regular medication counseling, and perform some computer&#xD;
      tasks. Throughout the study, there will be regular phone calls from staff. Participants will&#xD;
      also be asked to use a device called &quot;Soberlink&quot; which is like an at-home breathalyzer test&#xD;
      to help track progress throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive either Perampanel&#xD;
      alone or Peramanel and Disulfiram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last up to 10 weeks. Approximately 20 individuals will&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will sequence all or part of participant's DNA. This is a necessary part of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the study, participants may be referred to an alcohol detoxification program&#xD;
      (medical treatment of an alcoholic), if clinically indicated.&#xD;

    <description>Alcohol craving will be assess using the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUG). The AUG is an 8-item survey asking participants to rate their craving for alcohol on a 1 to 7 scale. The answers are summed yielding a score ranging from 7 to 56 with higher scores indicated higher alcohol craving.</description>
