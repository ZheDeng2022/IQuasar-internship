  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many persons with autonomic failure often have high blood pressure when lying down (supine&#xD;
      hypertension). This study is exploring the impact of decreased venous return to the heart&#xD;
      (achieved by raising the head of the bed) to lessen supine blood pressure. If decreased&#xD;
      venous return to the heart is effective at lowering supine blood pressure, these approaches&#xD;
      may be utilized to treat supine hypertension non-pharmacologically. Raising the head of the&#xD;
      bed decreases the amount of blood returning to the heart due to the effects of gravity. In&#xD;
      this case, the decreased blood return to the heart may decrease blood pressure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autonomic failure (AF) is a severely disabling condition, which is characterized by&#xD;
      orthostatic hypotension (severe drop in blood pressure upon standing), bladder and bowel&#xD;
      dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction. Besides disabling orthostatic hypotension, however, half&#xD;
      of these patients have supine hypertension (high blood pressure when lying). Sustained high&#xD;
      blood pressure is a cardiac risk for heart disease, kidney disease, and stroke. Sustained&#xD;
      supine hypertension during the night induces pressure natriuresis (increased urine production&#xD;
      due to high blood pressure) and volume loss (due to frequent urination/high volumes of&#xD;
      urine), worsening orthostatic hypotension the following morning (blood pressure falls even&#xD;
      more when the blood volume has been decreased due to loss of fluids in urine) and may also&#xD;
      complicate the treatment of orthostatic hypotension with pressor agents (giving a blood&#xD;
      pressure pill to prevent overnight high blood pressure may make daytime standing blood&#xD;
      pressure worse).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upright posture induces significant gravitational pooling of blood in the lower body that is&#xD;
      normally compensated for by sympathetic activation. Failure of compensatory sympathetic&#xD;
      activation results in orthostatic hypotension in autonomic failure patients due to the&#xD;
      reduction in venous return and cardiac output. This abnormality has been used in autonomic&#xD;
      failure patients with supine hypertension to their benefit by having them sleep with the head&#xD;
      of the bed tilted up. The recommended amount of head up tilt is 10Â°, or about a 9-inch&#xD;
      elevation of the head of the bed. In the investigators' hands this degree of tilt produces a&#xD;
      significant but only modest decrease in blood pressure. Compliance is a limiting factor&#xD;
      because most patients (and their spouses) are not able to tolerate even this modest level of&#xD;
      head up tilt. Participants often elevate just the torso overnight, but the effect of this&#xD;
      approach on supine blood pressure has not been reported.The investigators would like to&#xD;
      compare the effects of tilt versus only elevating the head on supine blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing knowledge provides the rationale for the study of the elevation of the head of&#xD;
      the bed as a non-pharmacologic approaches for the treatment of supine hypertension in these&#xD;
      patients. Elevation of the head of the bed will decrease venous return to the heart using the&#xD;
      effects of gravity.&#xD;
