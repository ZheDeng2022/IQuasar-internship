    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to evaluate the effect of hepatic ultrasound insonification&#xD;
      on whole-body insulin sensitivity and evaluate the safety and tolerability of hepatic&#xD;
      ultrasound insonification in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;
      &quot;Insonify/insonification&quot; is defined as applying to an area or an object carefully-controlled&#xD;
      sound waves, typically as in ultrasound imaging. GE Research is sponsoring this research&#xD;
      study. The purpose of this research study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of liver ultrasound waves on changes from baseline in whole-body&#xD;
           insulin sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test the safety and tolerability of liver ultrasound waves in subjects with Type 2&#xD;
           Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of liver ultrasound waves on change from baseline in glucose&#xD;
           tolerance and insulin secretion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of liver ultrasound waves on glucose metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin sensitivity refers to how sensitive the body's cells are in response to insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose tolerance refers to the body's ability to handle (tolerate) glucose. Insulin&#xD;
      secretion is a process in which the body releases insulin in response to glucose levels in&#xD;
      the blood becoming elevated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study device used in this study is cleared for use by the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for ultrasound diagnostic exams, however it has not been tested or&#xD;
      approved specifically for modulation of metabolism in people with diabetes. The use of the&#xD;
      study device in this study is investigational and is considered a Non-Significant Risk (NSR).&#xD;
