  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The neurotrophic protein S100B has been promoted as a neuromarker for decades, and to reflect&#xD;
      the severity of brain injury. On the other hand, S100B is a tumor marker. The interpretation&#xD;
      of its serum levels may be altered by a contribution from extracerebral sources and its renal&#xD;
      elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study we investigate the relevance of S100B as a prognostic factor, as well as&#xD;
      the correlation with different CT classifications in a large cohort of patients with and&#xD;
      without brain injury. Furthermore, we examine whether S100B is elevated in brain tumors.&#xD;

      Patients of the Department of Neurosurgery, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, undergoing&#xD;
      surgery for sellar lesions were prospectively included. The study protocol was approved by&#xD;
      the local Ethical Committee. Informed written consent was given by the participants or the&#xD;
      next-of-kin in each case. Exclusion criteria comprised of those below 18 years of age,&#xD;
      pregnancy and a drug intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients baseline information included age, gender, clinical presentation, and preexisting&#xD;
      medical conditions. In four different cohorts of patients, S100B was measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ICU TBI, patients treated on the ICU with brain injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ICU tumor, patients treated on the ICU because of an intracranial tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ICU surgery, patients treated on the ICU following surgery without brain injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ICU control, patients treated on the ICU without TBI, tumor or surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performed diagnostic tests included blood, cerebrospinal fluid and urine samples. In all&#xD;
      subjects, blood (4 mL), cerebrospinal fluid (4mL) and urine (4mL) samples were collected&#xD;
      daily as part of the clinical routine at 6:00 AM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples were immediately centrifuged for 10min at 1.300xG and 4°C and stored at a temperature&#xD;
      of -80°C until the assays were performed. Analysis was performed with commercially available&#xD;
      kits on automated immunoanalyzers (LIAISON® Sangtec®100 by chemiluminescence immunoassay,&#xD;
      Diasorin). The sensitivity of the assay was 0.02ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cohorts the clinical status was documented with Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), and the&#xD;
      outcome was assessed applying the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) or the Karnofsky Status Scale.&#xD;
      The radiological work-up included a computed tomography (CT) or a magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI). In brain injured patients, the CT was classifiied by the Marshall and Rotterdam Score.&#xD;
      Extracranial injuries or surgical procedures were documented&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS, and p&lt;0.05 was accepted as significant.&#xD;
