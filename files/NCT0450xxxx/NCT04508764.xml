    <time_frame>From start of study through completion of 6 month follow-up (estimated to be 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-For each proband, this testing rate is defined as the number of first-degree relatives tested divided by the number of living first-degree relatives age-appropriate for testing, as determined by family surveys done by the proband. The investigators will calculate mean cascade genetic testing rates for both conditions (Usual Care and FACTT intervention).</description>

    <description>For approximately the first 6 months of the study, or until 75 patient with cancer who is initially approached in clinic (probands) are enrolled, the investigators will be enrolling probands into the &quot;Usual Care&quot; group. During this time, the investigators will clarify usual care regarding cascade genetic testing for each participating clinic and proband participant. The investigators will do this by proband participant surveys, as well as initial provider semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
Proband: Complete Cascade Genetic Testing survey. The survey will also contain questions regarding willingness or not to invite each eligible 1st degree family member to participate in the family study. At 6 months, there will be a follow-up survey&#xD;
