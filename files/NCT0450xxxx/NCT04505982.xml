  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interleukin 6 is identified as a cytokine with pro and anti-inflammatory effects, depending&#xD;
      on the context to which it is exposed, exerting a role in the expansion and activation of T&#xD;
      lymphocytes, in the survival, expansion and the maturation of B lymphocytes and plasmablasts&#xD;
      as well as in the regulation of the acute phase response. The IL-6 receptor complex is a&#xD;
      dimer in which each monomer is composed of an 80 kD subunit, IL-6R or CD126, expressed in&#xD;
      hepatocytes, leukocytes and in megakaryocytes, which binds IL- 6 and a 130 kD subunit, gp130&#xD;
      or CD130, which is expressed ubiquitously. Its effects are mediated mainly by the way of&#xD;
      tyrosine kinases of the Jaks family, and transcription factors of the STATs family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complement system is made up of a set of plasma proteins, cascading through three&#xD;
      activation pathways (classical, alternate and lectin pathway). This system is considered part&#xD;
      of innate immunity. It is also part of the acute phase response.The complement has several&#xD;
      functions: cell lysis by formation of the membrane attack complex; opsonization and&#xD;
      activation of phagocytosis of foreign particles, elimination of circulating immune complexes,&#xD;
      and regulation of the adaptive immunity response and inflammation via anaphylatoxins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After reviewing the literature, the link between IL6 and the complement system can be&#xD;
      summarized as an induction of factor C3 and factor B, but also probably CD55 (DAF or Decay&#xD;
      acceleration factor) and CD59 (MAC-IP or MAC-Inhibitory Protein) by interleukin-6. The&#xD;
      effects of IL-6 on the lectin pathway, on the other hand, seem contradictory: inhibition or&#xD;
      induction of the synthesis of MASP1 / 3 and 2 depending on the experimental model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has become common knowledge that anti-IL6 receptor monoclonal antibodies, used in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, reduce the&#xD;
      serum levels of acute phase proteins and in particular the levels of CRP. But what about&#xD;
      other acute phase proteins and in particular the complement ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study showed that the serum levels of the complement components C3 and C4 were also&#xD;
      reduced after the use of tocilizumab and this as early as 4 weeks after the first&#xD;
      administration. To the investigator's knowledge, this is the only study reporting a decrease&#xD;
      in complement during treatment with anti-IL6R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would allow the evaluation of complement parameters in the population of patients&#xD;
      under treatment with antiIL6R (tocilizumab or sarilumab) within the CHU Brugmann Hospital in&#xD;
      order to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  confirm or not this observation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  look for a possible secondary clinical consequence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compare this decrease with the activity of the disease in order to see if it could be a&#xD;
           marker of effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  put this decrease in parallel with the side effects / tolerance of the treatment in&#xD;
           order to see if it could be a marker of toxicity / safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also investigate the subpopulations of B lymphocytes (memory B, transitional&#xD;
      B, and plasmablasts) in order to assess whether the evolution of one of these lines would be&#xD;
      predictive of a therapeutic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, this study would eventually allow&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to improve the understanding of the mechanisms of action of the treatment on&#xD;
           inflammatory markers by evaluating the activity of the residual complement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to raise the need to find new parameters for monitoring inflammatory activity in these&#xD;
           patients, since CRP assays are not very helpful.&#xD;
