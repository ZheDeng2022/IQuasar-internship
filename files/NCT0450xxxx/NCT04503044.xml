  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial Lung Abnormalities (ILA) have been previously defined as nondependent changes&#xD;
      affecting more than 5% of any lung zone on computed tomography (CT) scans of the lung.&#xD;
      Several studies suggest that the prevalence of ILA in participants in non-pulmonary research&#xD;
      studies ranges anywhere from 7-9%. Work over the last decade has shown that, despite previous&#xD;
      characterization as an asymptomatic research finding, ILA has significant clinical and&#xD;
      biological consequences. These include reduced exercise capacity, functional limitations,&#xD;
      decreased lung volumes, increased mortality, and in some cases histopathology similar to&#xD;
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). ILA have been detected in lung cancer screening cohorts,&#xD;
      where the prevalence of ILA is estimated to be between (10%-20%) to those noted in other&#xD;
      research cohorts. Given that a significant proportion of those will have progression, CT lung&#xD;
      cancer screening (CTLS) cohorts represent an ideal catchment population for future research&#xD;
      and clinical trials. Lahey Hospital and Medical Center was one of the earliest clinical&#xD;
      centers to develop a CTLS program in the country. Investigators propose to qualitatively&#xD;
      characterize ILA in a large clinical CTLS population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose a retrospective, single-center study with following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterize the prevalence and incidence of ILA at baseline and 5 year follow-up,&#xD;
           respectively, and associated imaging phenotypes in CTLS cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline qualitative ILA features associated with clinical outcomes: Lung Cancer,&#xD;
           Hospitalization, and Mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline qualitative ILA features associated with progressive ILA and fibrotic lung&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical opportunity: to determine the % of CTLS patients with ILA who are at risk for&#xD;
           progressive and development of fibrotic lung disease and who would benefit from&#xD;
           specialized care referral and potential enrollment in clinical trials utilizing proven&#xD;
           antifibrotic therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical CT Lung Cancer Screening (CTLS) patients at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center&#xD;
      (LHMC), Burlington, MA from January 1st, 2012 through September 30th, 2014 who had an in&#xD;
      network primary care physician (n=1703). Patients with T4 screening scans will be scored for&#xD;
      progression (n=653). To qualify for our study, patients had to satisfy the National&#xD;
      Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines® Lung Cancer Screening Version 1.2012&#xD;
      high-risk criteria for lung cancer. Based on the NCCN Guidelines®, individuals eligible for&#xD;
      lung cancer screening can be classified into NCCN group 1 and 2 as previously described.&#xD;
      Patients in both groups were asymptomatic and had a physician order for CTLS, were free of&#xD;
      lung cancer for ≥ 5 years, and had no known metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical variables were collected prospectively as part of the CTLS program and stored in a&#xD;
      centralized data repository. Additional clinical variables not already available in this data&#xD;
      repository will be collected retrospectively by manual review of the electronic medical&#xD;
      record or pulled directly from the EMR and stored utilizing a custom-designed database&#xD;
      (FileMaker ProVersion 11; Filemaker Inc, Santa Clara, California). Data was obtained through&#xD;
      September 30th, 2019, patient demographics, past medical history, PFTs, immunization records,&#xD;
      whether the patient was managed by a pulmonologist, and for hospital admissions with&#xD;
      principal admission diagnoses. Hospital admissions will be collected using Lahey&#xD;
      administrative coding data. Principal admission diagnoses of COPD, PNA, and CHF will be&#xD;
      characterized based on diagnosis codes per 2018 Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services&#xD;
      (CMS) condition-specific measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT Imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically acquired, CTLS examinations which were performed on ≥64-row multidetector CT&#xD;
      scanners (LightSpeed VCT and Discovery VCT [GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin];&#xD;
      Somatom Definition [Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany]; iCT [Philips Medical Systems, Andover,&#xD;
      Massachusetts]) at 100 kV and 30 to 100 mA, depending on the scanner and the availability of&#xD;
      iterative reconstruction software. Axial images were obtained at 1.25- to 1.5-mm thickness&#xD;
      with 50% overlap and reconstructed with both soft tissue and lung kernels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative ILA Scoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT images will be scored utilizing Philips Intellispace PACS version 4.4 with clinical grade&#xD;
      monitors. Scoring will be performed independently by two thoracic radiologists as described&#xD;
      previously. Scores that are discordant between the two radiologists will be scored by a third&#xD;
      by a pulmonologist with expertise in ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ILA: The presence of ILA features will be scores as (Yes/No/Indeterminate). Indeterminate&#xD;
      will be defined as features identified unilaterally/focal involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ILA features that will be scored include: A) non dependent ground glass, B) reticular&#xD;
      abnormalities, C) traction bronchiectasis and D) honeycombing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Non Dependent ground glass: (Yes/No/Indeterminate) defined as hazy increased attenuation&#xD;
      of the lung with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Reticular abnormalities: (Yes/No/Indeterminate) defined as a collection of innumerable&#xD;
      small linear opacities that, by summation, produce an appearance resembling a net.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Traction Bronchiectasis: (Yes/No/Indeterminate) defined Traction bronchiectasis and&#xD;
      traction bronchiolectasis respectively represents irregular bronchial and bronchiolar&#xD;
      dilatation caused by surrounding retractile pulmonary fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Honeycombing: (Yes/No/Indeterminate) defined on CT as clustered cystic air spaces,&#xD;
      typically of comparable diameters on the ordered of 3-10 mm but occasionally as large as 2.5&#xD;
      cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pattern: The overall pattern/Type of ILA findings will also be scored as the following:&#xD;
      Subpleural, centrilobular, mixed or consistent with ILD (see UIP below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subpleural: Defined as less than 1 cm from the pleural surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centrilobular: Defined as region of the bronchiolovascular core of the secondary pulmonary&#xD;
      lobule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location: Overall location ILA will then be scored as Upper lobe, lower lobe or diffuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extent: Overall extent of disease will be scored as Mild, Moderate and Marked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual Interstitial Pneumonia: Finally, the subset of scans that have evidence of fibrotic&#xD;
      disease defined as traction bronchiectasis/honeycombing will then be classified as consistent&#xD;
      with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) (Yes/Probable/No) based on Fleischner Criteria. UIP&#xD;
      defined as Honey-combing with basal and subpleural distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression: The subset of patients who have had their T4 (5 year post baseline) screening&#xD;
      scanned will be independently scored as above and in addition will be compared to their&#xD;
      baseline scans and scored for progression: Stable, improved, and progressed.&#xD;
