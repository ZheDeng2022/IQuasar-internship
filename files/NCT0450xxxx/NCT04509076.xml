  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research is to create an effective and sustainable program to&#xD;
      support retention in PrEP care and PrEP adherence among 18-29 year old men who have sex with&#xD;
      men (MSM). To reach this goal, we will develop and pilot test a mobile intervention tailored&#xD;
      to young MSM, called PrEP iT! Primary aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Develop the PrEP iT! mobile intervention through focus groups with young MSM and&#xD;
      refine iterations through input from a community advisory board (CAB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability&#xD;
      and preliminary impact of the PrEP iT! intervention for young MSM.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact of PrEP iT! in a&#xD;
      pilot RCT (n=80). Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) recently (re)initiating PrEP will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either PrEP iT! plus usual care or usual care alone, and followed for 6&#xD;
      months with assessments at baseline, and 3- and 6-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PrEP iT! will use open source software that conforms to current programming standards, and&#xD;
      can be used across all devices (desktop, laptop, smartphone, and tablet) to ensure&#xD;
      sustainability. PrEP iT! will be developed from feedback from PrEP-using YMSM through focus&#xD;
      groups and a community advisory board (CAB). PrEP iT! is grounded in the Information,&#xD;
      Motivation, and Behavioral Skills model, and also draws from a model of technology adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PrEP iT! intervention components are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PrEP Adherence, PrEP Appointment, and Sexual Activity Self-Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tailored feedback on PrEP adherence/non-adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PrEP and sexual health information tailored for YMSM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Text message reminders for PrEP adherence and healthcare appointments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An &quot;ask the expert&quot; feature&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm participants will receive usual PrEP care only. Locally this entails, clinic&#xD;
      visits every 3 months in the initial period following PrEP initiation, including HIV/STI&#xD;
      screening and laboratory toxicity testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be stratified by age in a 1:1 ratio (i.e., n=40 per group) of 18-24 and&#xD;
      25-29 year olds, and will reflect 50% Black and/or Hispanic YMSM participation. This will&#xD;
      allow us to explore subgroup differences (e.g., by age and race/ethnicity) for PrEP iT! to&#xD;
      better inform future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Clinical Sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from two clinics in Minneapolis that provide PrEP care. The&#xD;
      clinical sites include the HIV clinic at Hennepin Healthcare (HH) and the Hennepin County STD&#xD;
      clinic. We will recruit and enroll study participants concurrent with their PrEP clinical&#xD;
      visits when possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited in four ways: a) PrEP clinic patients who are new or returning&#xD;
      to care (i.e., are not currently receiving PrEP) will be identified by clinic staff and&#xD;
      referred to research coordinators on the day of their clinic visit when possible; b) flyers&#xD;
      will be hung in PrEP clinics and other HIV/AIDS NGO service organizations within the Twin&#xD;
      Cities; and c) the study team will engage and solicit referrals from other community HIV/AIDS&#xD;
      NGO with focused PrEP and prevention campaigns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment, Randomization, and Follow-up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study candidates will undergo a separate screening visit with a brief questionnaire at/after&#xD;
      PrEP clinic visits. Participants will have a rapid HIV test as part of usual care. Persons&#xD;
      whose test positive for HIV will be referred for same-day evaluation and care. Participants&#xD;
      are randomized 1:1 to either the intervention (PrEP iT! + usual care) or control (usual care)&#xD;
      arm. The randomization sequence will be stratified by age (18-24 v. 25-29 yrs) and use blocks&#xD;
      of ten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent, participants will complete a computer-assisted baseline survey. All&#xD;
      participants will be provided usual PrEP educational information encouraged to attend their&#xD;
      regular healthcare visits. Participants randomized to the treatment arm (PrEP iT! + usual&#xD;
      care) will be guided through setting up their user account and user profile, provided with&#xD;
      basic training on how to navigate and use intervention components, and given the opportunity&#xD;
      to ask questions. YMSM in the treatment arm will have immediate access to PrEP iT! after the&#xD;
      initial visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      YMSM will undergo a 3- and 6-month follow-up assessment, with multiple reminders sent to&#xD;
      participants prior to each visit. The 3- and 6-month stud procedures include completing a&#xD;
      short computerized assessment, and submitting a dried blood spot specimen for the TFV-DP&#xD;
      analyses. Study data will also be collected from the month 3 and month 6 healthcare visits&#xD;
      that include laboratory and clinical data generated routinely as part of standard PrEP care&#xD;
      (e.g., testing for HIV Ab and other STIs). We anticipate that most HIV tests results data&#xD;
      will be extracted from participant's medical record to confirm their HIV-negative status. In&#xD;
      the event that we must conduct an HIV test (e.g., we are unable to extract that from the&#xD;
      medical record or if there is an expressed concern that the participant's HIV status has&#xD;
      changed), they will be conducted at the Hennepin Healthcare clinical laboratory, using&#xD;
      standard clinical assays (we use the HIV Ab/Ag combination test for diagnosis). This&#xD;
      information would be captured in our CRFs via REDCap, and this information will be securely&#xD;
      transferred to SDSU but would be via a de-identified file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study retention protocols involve the use of multiple contact methods, including telephone&#xD;
      calls, text messages and e-mail reminders. We anticipate no more than 20% attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exit Interviews: A random subset of participants randomized to the PrEP iT! arm will be asked&#xD;
      if he would be willing to participate in 30-60 minute exit interview to assess a) his&#xD;
      experience in the intervention, b) suggestions for modifications to the existing interface,&#xD;
      c) suggestions for new features; and d) and changes to the study procedures. Recruitment for&#xD;
      exit interviews will entail sufficient numbers for the goal of achieving ten men completing&#xD;
      the exit interview.&#xD;
