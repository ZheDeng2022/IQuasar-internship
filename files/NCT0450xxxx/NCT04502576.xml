  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helmet noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula are novel tools for the first-line&#xD;
      treatment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Compared to face-mask noninvasive&#xD;
      ventilation in randomized trials, both have improved clinical outcome of patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe hypoxemic respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As compared to high-flow nasal cannula, helmet noninvasive ventilation improves oxygenation,&#xD;
      reduces inspiratory effort, respiratory rate and dyspnea. Whether these physiological&#xD;
      benefits are translated into improved outcome remains to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a randomized trial to establish whether first line treatment with&#xD;
      Helmet noninvasive ventilation is capable of increasing the number of 28-day&#xD;
      respiratory-support-free days, as compared to high-flow nasal cannula in patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.&#xD;

    <description>High-flow nasal cannula will be delivered with the Optiflow system. Initial set flow will be ≥ 50 /min and flows will be decreased in case of intolerance and/or according to patients' requirements: flows≥30 L/min will be mandatory in all enrolled patients. Humidification chamber (MR860, Fisher and Paykel healthcare, New Zealand) will be set at 37 °C or 34 °C according to patient's comfort. FiO2 will be titrated to obtain an SpO2≥92% and ≤98%.&#xD;
The treatment according to the assigned protocol will be continued until the patient requires endotracheal intubation or (in case of no intubation) up to ICU discharge. Weaning from high-flow will be considered as standardized criteria are met.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive continuous helmet pressure support ventilation for at least 16 hours/day the first 2 calendar days. Continuous noninvasive ventilation without interruptions will be strongly encouraged in the first 24 hours of treatment. The ventilator will be set in pressure support mode. Use of continuous positive airway pressure by flow generators and Venturi systems instead of pressure support ventilation will be allowed in case of shortage of ventilators. Maintenance of positive end-expiratory pressure ≥ 8-10 during the treatment is mandatory.&#xD;
After weaning and during any interruption from noninvasive ventilation, patients will undergo low-flow or high-flow oxygen, according to the decision of the attending physician.&#xD;
The treatment according to the assigned protocol will be continued until the patient requires endotracheal intubation or (in case of no intubation) up to ICU discharge.</description>
