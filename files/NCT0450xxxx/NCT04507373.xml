  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 40 million Americans take statins to reduce their risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (ASCVD). Unfortunately, 10 to 20% stop taking them due to statin-associated muscle&#xD;
      symptoms (e.g. pain, aches, weakness, cramps, or stiffness) (1, 2). The pathophysiology of&#xD;
      these statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) has remained elusive. Consequently, no&#xD;
      objective diagnostic method exists, causing confusion for patient and providers since muscle&#xD;
      symptoms can often be multifactorial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objectives of this project are to identify the underlying cause of SAMS and&#xD;
      establish an in-vivo imaging technique to detect SAMS. The central hypothesis of this&#xD;
      pro-posal is that statins directly inhibit mitochondrial function in SAMS patients. Our&#xD;
      rationale is based on our own preliminary data indicating that simvastatin - the most common&#xD;
      statin to cause SAMS - can directly inhibit oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mice. Since&#xD;
      such changes can be detected in vivo in humans utilizing 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy&#xD;
      (MRS) techniques, the investigators will use a state-of-the art 7 Tesla (7T) MRS instrument&#xD;
      to study the so-leus muscles of SAMS patients. Additionally, the investigators will validate&#xD;
      the MRS findings by doing func-tional studies in muscle biopsy specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study in 15 SAMS&#xD;
      pa-tients and 15 controls. Study participants will be treated with simvastatin 40 mg daily or&#xD;
      place-bo for 10 weeks. The investigators will perform 7T MRS of soleus muscles at&#xD;
      randomization and either at first complaint of muscle symptoms or at the end of 10 weeks if&#xD;
      no muscle symptoms occur, whichever occurs first. Quadriceps muscle biopsies will also be&#xD;
      done immediately following the second MRS scan.&#xD;

        Inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        â€¢ Adults, age &gt; 18 ys or &lt; 80 yrs. Patients reporting complaints of statin-associated&#xD;
        muscle symptoms, aches, weakness, cramps, or stiffness in the legs.&#xD;
