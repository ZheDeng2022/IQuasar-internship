  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In people with type 2 diabetes, the body does not make enough of a hormone called insulin or&#xD;
      does not use insulin well. This results in high blood sugar levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with diabetes are more likely to have non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) compared&#xD;
      to people who do not have diabetes. Having both NVAF and diabetes can increase the chances of&#xD;
      developing other serious health conditions, like blood clots and strokes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with NVAF may receive treatments to help lower the risk of blood clots. This can then&#xD;
      help to lower the risk of having a stroke. Two of these treatments are rivaroxaban and&#xD;
      warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers will look at how well rivaroxaban works and how safe it is&#xD;
      compared to warfarin in routine clinical practice. The study will include men and women who&#xD;
      are at least age 18 and who have NVAF and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers in this study will use the participants' health information from an&#xD;
      electronic database.&#xD;
