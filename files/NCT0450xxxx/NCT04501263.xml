  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a&#xD;
      novel educational intervention for HCPs to help them manage constipation experienced by&#xD;
      people in the hospice setting. This stage aims to establish the feasibility of, and to pilot,&#xD;
      a novel educational intervention for HCPs. Additionally, it also originally aimed to test the&#xD;
      feasibility of the chosen measures of change in patient care, however this was not&#xD;
      undertaken. In order to achieve this aim, the objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implement the educational intervention across Marie Curie sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the likely effectiveness of the educational intervention on the knowledge and&#xD;
           self-efficacy of HCPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the feasibility and acceptability of the educational intervention with HCPs, and&#xD;
           identify factors associated with feasibility/acceptability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the feasibility and acceptability of research procedures, and identify factors&#xD;
           associated with feasibility/acceptability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the effect of contextual factors upon the implementation and sustainability of&#xD;
           the educational intervention in the hospice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the suitability of outcome measures for HCPs&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An incremental, multi-method approach was adopted, in line with the MRC Framework for complex&#xD;
      interventions. Four prior data collection phases helped to inform the development of the&#xD;
      educational intervention (a review of guidelines and a systematic review of the existing&#xD;
      literature Muldrew et al 2018; a clinical case note review (McIlfatrick et al 2019) and&#xD;
      qualitative findings from patients, caregivers and health professionals (Hasson et al 2019).&#xD;
      The refinement of the intervention involved the project's fourth step (unpublished). This was&#xD;
      the use of the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) with 39 HCPs to help identify priorities in the&#xD;
      assessment and management of constipation. The findings from the NGT were further ratified by&#xD;
      an international review group (n=19) on constipation management and care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed methods approach was undertaken to inform the development of the intervention and&#xD;
      assess its impact. A small cohort, one-sample repeated measures design was used to assess the&#xD;
      impact of the intervention on the knowledge of participants (health care professionals). Data&#xD;
      collection was focused on three primary groups of HCPs; nurses, medics, and pharmacists.&#xD;
      Qualitative data were collected after the intervention to assess the appropriateness of the&#xD;
      intervention, the support in the specialist palliative care unit to complete it, the overall&#xD;
      processes surrounding its implementation, and any impact that participants felt it had on&#xD;
      practice. These data were gathered from focus groups (n=4) with 14 HCPs and nine telephone&#xD;
      interviews with managers and senior staff in the SPC units. The intervention was delivered,&#xD;
      and participants were recruited from five specialist palliative care inpatient units in the&#xD;
      UK (Northern Ireland, Scotland, and England).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCPS (nurses, medics, pharmacists) were invited to participate if they met the following&#xD;
      inclusion criteria; (i) working in a clinical capacity in the SPC inpatient unit; (ii)&#xD;
      involvement in the management of patients with constipation; (iii) over 18 years of age; and&#xD;
      (iv) able to provide written consent in English. The educational intervention was advertised&#xD;
      across sites through Research Leads, flyers and the identification of a &quot;champion&quot;, in&#xD;
      conjunction with senior staff. HCPs who met the inclusion criteria and were willing to&#xD;
      participate could sign up via a webpage containing an information sheet, consent form, and&#xD;
      information on how to access the education programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention development and implementation processes Based on the findings from the previous&#xD;
      stages, a 6-week, online, educational program was created with Syngery Learning an online&#xD;
      learning management company, on constipation assessment and management. Each week of the&#xD;
      program consisted of a short theoretical introduction to key aspects of constipation&#xD;
      (assessment, prevention, non-pharmacological management, pharmacological management, opioid&#xD;
      induced constipation, and bowel obstruction). This was supplemented with a quiz, link to&#xD;
      practice activity, and a group discussion in an online closed group. Participant's study was&#xD;
      largely self-directed and flexible. They could log in at any time during the 6-week data&#xD;
      collection period to complete the activities. Managers of the specialist palliative care&#xD;
      units were supportive of the educational program and assisted in the practical elements of&#xD;
      running the course, including releasing staff from their workload to complete the required&#xD;
      activities. Participants were encouraged to complete these activities during their work&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Measures were completed online at baseline and after completion of the&#xD;
      educational intervention. Competency measures were the primary outcome of the study, linked&#xD;
      to the NiCan Framework for Generalist and Specialist Palliative and End of Life Care&#xD;
      Knowledge and Skills Framework. Participants completed a competency assessment tool extracted&#xD;
      from the Competency and End of Life Care Competency Tool and the Knowledge and Self-Efficacy&#xD;
      Survey. The intervention was implemented gradually, over two separate occasions, enabling&#xD;
      learning from the first phase to be incorporated into the second phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Data Collection Qualitative data were collected after the intervention to assess&#xD;
      the appropriateness of the resource, the support within the SPC unit to complete it, the&#xD;
      overall processes surrounding its implementation, and any impact that participants felt it&#xD;
      had on practice. This used focus groups and telephone interviews with managers and senior&#xD;
      staff within the specialist palliative care units . Participants taking part in were invited&#xD;
      to participate if they met set inclusion criteria; (i) employed by hospice as HCP; (ii)&#xD;
      previous experience working with patients receiving palliative care who suffer from&#xD;
      constipation; (iii) over 18 years of age; and (iv) Willing to participant in the study and&#xD;
      have provided informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost analysis Information was collected on the time spent by staff on the training resource,&#xD;
      by staff type and by study centre. Staff time was valued using unit costs obtained from the&#xD;
      Personal Social Services Research Unit Costs of Health &amp; Social Care 2018.&#xD;
