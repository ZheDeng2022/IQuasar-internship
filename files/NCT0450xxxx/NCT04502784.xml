  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaemia (low haemoglobin levels) can develop in a number of conditions, including chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD) and intestinal conditions (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal&#xD;
      failure). Intravenous iron can be given to patients with these conditions to help correct&#xD;
      their aneaemia. However, intravenous iron has been associated with the development of low&#xD;
      phosphate levels - hypophophosphataemia. The aim of this study is to determine potential&#xD;
      causes of hypophosphataemia following administration of intravenous iron.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low levels of iron can lead to anaemia, known as iron deficiency anaemia, which can be&#xD;
      debilitating due to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and dizziness. Iron&#xD;
      deficiency anaemia can be treated by giving iron supplementation. Iron supplements can be&#xD;
      taken orally or can be given intravenously (through the veins). Giving iron intravenously has&#xD;
      advantages over iron supplements taken orally, which can cause side effects such as stomach&#xD;
      pain and cramping. However, giving iron intravenously has been associated with the&#xD;
      development of low levels of phosphate in the blood. This is known as hypophosphataemia.&#xD;
      Phosphate is an important salt in the body and has a number of important functions. Very low&#xD;
      levels of phosphate can cause muscle pain, disorientation, seizures and heart problems. It is&#xD;
      unclear why giving iron intravenously can cause hypophosphataemia. This project aims to&#xD;
      investigate the potential causes of hypophosphataemia in patients who receive intravenous&#xD;
      iron as treatment for anaemia associated with their condition. Patients with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD) and intestinal failure will be recruited to the study, since people with CKD&#xD;
      may handle iron differently than those with healthy kidneys. Samples will be taken at two&#xD;
      time points: prior to giving the intravenous iron and at the patient's next appointment.&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will also be recruited to the study to allow comparison between the groups&#xD;
      receiving iron and those who do not receive iron. Samples will be analysed to determine&#xD;
      potential causes of hypophosphataemia. Results from before and after iron is given will be&#xD;
      compared to determine if any of the participants developed hypophosphataemia and if any other&#xD;
      test are affected which may explain why this has developed.&#xD;
