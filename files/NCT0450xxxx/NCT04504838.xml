  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study involves a new device, called 'N-Tidal C', which uses a method that has the&#xD;
      potential to predict when asthma attacks are about to happen. The device works by accurately&#xD;
      measuring an individual's exhaled CO2 waveform. A person has to breathe in and out through&#xD;
      the mouthpiece at their normal relaxed rate of breathing. It does not need any extra effort&#xD;
      and therefore has considerable benefits over current breathing tests which require&#xD;
      significant patient effort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with more severe asthma suffer from frequent asthma attacks that require regular&#xD;
      hospital admissions. These attacks are difficult to predict and can devastate the lives of&#xD;
      patients. A new tool is needed that can help to predict when an asthma attack is going to&#xD;
      happen. This would help people recognise an attack earlier and allow treatment to be started&#xD;
      sooner. This study will evaluate a new breathing monitor, to see whether it can detect asthma&#xD;
      attacks. The study tests a new device, called 'N-Tidal C', which uses a method that has the&#xD;
      potential to predict when attacks are about to happen. The investigators have found that&#xD;
      people with asthma breathe out a gas, called carbon dioxide (CO2), in a different way to&#xD;
      healthy people. The pattern of breathing out CO2 (the waveform) changes further when patients&#xD;
      are having an attack of their disease. If patients could monitor their CO2, they may&#xD;
      recognise when their asthma is getting worse, and take earlier action to avoid attacks&#xD;
      getting out of hand and going to hospital.&#xD;
