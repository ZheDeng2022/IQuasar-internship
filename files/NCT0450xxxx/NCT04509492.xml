    <textblock>
      Liver metastasis may not be detected by CT and MRI due to their small size while they can be&#xD;
      detected by EUS. Also, EUS-FNA has a great impact in improving the diagnostic accuracy of&#xD;
      EUS. Objectives: To assess the feasibility of EUS in the detection of occult small hepatic&#xD;
      focal lesions at the time of primary tumor staging, not seen by CT or MRI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was used firstly in 1980s as a diagnostic imaging technique for&#xD;
      pancreatic lesions. It has the ability to detect the histological layers of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract wall as well as the periluminal structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS has been used to perform FNA from lesions that are difficult to access by conventional&#xD;
      methods. EUS has the advantage of using both ultrasound and endoscopy to give the exact&#xD;
      diagnostic features of the GI tract. The use of EUS was not limited to visualization only,&#xD;
      but also in obtaining tissue biopsy for diagnostic purpose through EUS guided fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration (FNA), and it has played a major role in revolutionizing the diagnosis of focal&#xD;
      hepatic lesions as it is a minimally invasive procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal imaging [CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and transabdominal ultrasonography&#xD;
      (USG)] are the diagnostic tests of choice to detect hepatic lesions suspicious of&#xD;
      metastasis.Unfortunately, these modalities are limited in their ability to detect hepatic&#xD;
      lesions less than 1 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, although rare, percutaneous FNA for suspected metastatic lesions carries the&#xD;
      risk of implantation metastasis. Although unable to completely visualize the entirety of the&#xD;
      liver, EUS can detect small hepatic lesions that may be otherwise missed by conventional&#xD;
      imaging. EUS can delineate detailed anatomy of the liver from the trans-gastric and&#xD;
      trans-duodenal routes with the exception of the right posterior segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospect to obtain precise, ultrasound-guided biopsies of possible metastatic liver&#xD;
      lesions can drastically alter the therapeutic conduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This, combined with limited adverse events, makes EUS an excellent modality to allow staging&#xD;
      in malignant conditions. Due to the vicinity of the transducer to the liver, EUS provides&#xD;
      detailed images of the liver segments and its vascular structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the premise that EUS is more sensitive for the detection of small hepatic lesions&#xD;
      then CT/MRI, Singh et al. proved that EUS was superior to CT scan (98% vs 92%, respectively)&#xD;
      in diagnostic accuracy in its ability to detect the number of metastatic lesions in the liver&#xD;
      and correctly diagnose the nature of the lesions .(Singh P etal.,2009) Endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasonography (EUS) has become an indispensable method for diagnosis and therapeutic&#xD;
      procedures in gastroenterology and as experience with this technique is growing, new&#xD;
      indications for EUS continue to emerge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Saraireh HA .,2017) Furthermore, the use of on-site cytopathology interpretation has further&#xD;
      improved the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA by helping to ensure that the samples obtained are&#xD;
      representative of the target organ and adequate for diagnostic purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess the feasibility of EUS in detection of occult small hepatic focal&#xD;
      lesions at the time of primary tumor staging, not seen by CT or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Thorough history talking including;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Comorbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical general and local abdominal examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Abdominal US &amp; CT abdomen&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. laboratory investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. complete blood count (CBC)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Prothombin time ,INR&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Ceatinine , Urea&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Albumin&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. ALT , AST&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Virological test for HIV, HCV and HBV&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. CA-19-9 and alfa fetoproteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. EUS will be done to all patients. During EUS examination the liver will be examined&#xD;
           thoroughly to detect hepatic focal lesions with possible EUS-FNA of any detected&#xD;
           lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All EUS examination with be done by EUS linear array Echoendoscope, Pentax EG-3870UTK&#xD;
      attached to Hitachi Avius US machine under Propofol deep sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data will be organized and statistically analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tool:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data including study design, participant demographics, stage and type of pancreatic and GI&#xD;
      malignancy will be extracted and recorded on electronic data collection sheet. Data will be&#xD;
      pooled for various arms in trials: Individual data for each outcome were entered into the&#xD;
      Comprehensive analysis. Pooled effects with 95%CI will be reported. Data will be analyzed&#xD;
      separately for each arm.&#xD;
