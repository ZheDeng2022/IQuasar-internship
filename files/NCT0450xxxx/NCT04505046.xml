  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria, schistosomiasis and ancylostomiasis are three parasitic diseases which affect&#xD;
      hundreds of millions of people and are an important cause of global mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
      For the control of these poverty related parasitic diseases, and to complement&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic strategies, accurate and accessible diagnostic procedures play a crucial&#xD;
      role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, innovative smart mobile technologies have been applied for detection and&#xD;
      identification of cultured parasite species, which is basically based on sample imaging and&#xD;
      parasite morphology identification. Promising advances have been made with this technology&#xD;
      and coupled with its small size, low cost and easy to manipulate, makes it suitable for point&#xD;
      of care diagnostics in low resource setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed explorative study is to further validate sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      of each of the developed devices, using besides microscopy a range of more advanced reference&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;

      Malaria, schistosomiasis and ancylostomiasis are three parasitic diseases which affect&#xD;
      hundreds of millions of people and are an important cause of global mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
      For the control of these poverty related parasitic diseases, and to complement&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic strategies, accurate and accessible diagnostic procedures play a crucial&#xD;
      role. Especially in remote and/or low resource settings, appropriate diagnostic tests are&#xD;
      often lacking. These tests should not only be sensitive and specific, but also affordable,&#xD;
      reliable, and easy to operate. In recent years, innovative smart mobile technologies have&#xD;
      been applied for detection and identification of cultured parasite species, which is&#xD;
      basically based on sample imaging and parasite morphology identification. Promising advances&#xD;
      have been made with this technology and coupled with its small size, low cost and easy to&#xD;
      manipulate, makes it suitable for point of care diagnostics in low resource setting. At the&#xD;
      Technical University of Delft, a smart optical device prototype has been recently developed&#xD;
      for the detection of Plasmodium. This Excelscope has been tested on a small number of malaria&#xD;
      cases in Nigeria, showing promising results. In addition, TU Delft has developed a prototype&#xD;
      for the detection of Schistosoma haematobium eggs in urine, which is ready for further&#xD;
      validation in the field. Still under construction is a smart optical device for the detection&#xD;
      of helminth eggs in stool, including eggs of hookworms. For each of these three smart optical&#xD;
      devices using respectively blood, urine or stool, a diagnostic performance is aimed which&#xD;
      does not significantly deviate in sensitivity and specificity from the diagnostic tests&#xD;
      commonly in use in low resource settings, e.g. basic microscopy. At the same time, the&#xD;
      optical devices have supplementary logistical advantages, e.g. easiness to use, high&#xD;
      throughput and low costs per sample. The aim of the proposed explorative study is to further&#xD;
      validate sensitivity and specificity of each of the developed devices, using besides&#xD;
      microscopy a range of more advanced reference tests. For this purpose, diagnostic samples&#xD;
      (blood, urine, stool) collected from ongoing studies involving malaria, schistosomiasis and&#xD;
      STHs. at CERMEL will be used. The outcome of this study will give new insight in the&#xD;
      diagnostic performance of the innovative smart optical devices, specifically in comparison to&#xD;
      the WHO recommended diagnostic procedures currently used at CERMEL. The study is the core&#xD;
      activity of Work Package 3 within the INSPiRED project.&#xD;
