      Background After diagnosing well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC), careful assessment of&#xD;
      the risk for disease-specific recurrence is essential for deciding between partial (low risk)&#xD;
      and completion (high risk) thyroidectomies. Patients' preoperatively determined risk levels&#xD;
      are re-stratified according to surgical and final histopathological findings. The American&#xD;
      Thyroid Association 2015 guidelines suggest that patients with WDTC between 1-4 cm in size&#xD;
      and without suspicious features may be suitable candidates for partial thyroidectomy. The&#xD;
      incidence and clinical implications of high-risk features discovered postoperatively in&#xD;
      patients with preoperatively determined low-risk WDTC have not been previously reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods All thyroidectomies performed between 2006-2018 in the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical&#xD;
      Center were included. Pre- and postoperative risk stratifications were performed, and the&#xD;
      rate of completion thyroidectomy was determined. Patients with 1-4 cm WDTC without evidence&#xD;
      of positive cervical lymph nodes, invasion to adjacent structures, or high-risk cytology were&#xD;
      considered at low risk for disease-specific recurrence and therefore suitable for lobectomy.&#xD;

        The medical charts of all patients who underwent thyroid surgery between January 2006 and&#xD;
        December 2018 in TASMC were retrieved. Most of them were females. The mean age of the&#xD;
        entire cohort was 49.59 Â± 15.17 years (median 50 years, interquartile range 38-61].&#xD;
