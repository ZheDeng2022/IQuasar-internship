  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of Vonoprazan by assessing all adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in routine&#xD;
      clinical settings in China.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-interventional study in Chinese participants with RE who are&#xD;
      receiving or will receive the standard treatment of vonoprazan. This study will assess the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of vonoprazan in the real-world clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 3000 participants. The data will be collected through&#xD;
      participants' medical records, self-reported questionnaires, and recorded information on&#xD;
      symptom via diaries. All the participants will be assigned to a single observational cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Participants with RE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multi-center trial will be conducted in China. The standard treatment will be of 4 weeks&#xD;
      or it may reach up to 8 weeks if the dosing proves insufficient. All participants will be&#xD;
      followed up for additional 2 weeks after the standard treatment. The overall duration of the&#xD;
      study will be approximately 10 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The severity of participants' GERD symptoms based on the investigator's assessment among all participants will be evaluated at Baseline and Week 4. GERD symptoms will be assessed on a 5-point scale, wherein 1= no symptom, 2= mild, 3= moderate, 4= severe and 5= very severe. GERD symptoms include heartburn (HB), acid regurgitation (AR), dysphagia (dysp), belching (bch) and epigastric pain (EP). The participants without any GERD typical symptoms will be analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) Score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>GerdQ is a self-completed participant questionnaire that is used to assess whether the following symptoms of RE are improved under treatment: heartburn, regurgitation, stomach pain, nausea, sleep disturbance and use of additional medication due to heartburn/regurgitation. Symptom frequency will be assessed for the week passed using following answers: 0 days, 1 day, 2-3 days, and 4-7 days. Each answer will be assigned a score from 0 to 3 (heartburn, regurgitation, sleep disturbance and use of additional medication due to heartburn/regurgitation) or from 3 to 0 (stomach pain, nausea). Total score will be calculated as a sum of 6 individual scores. GerdQ score was calculated as sum of these scores, giving a total score ranging from 0 to 18. When GerdQ &gt;=8, the participants could be symptom based diagnosed as GERD. Total score of 0 to 2 points= 0% likelihood of GERD; 3 to 7 points= 50% likelihood of GERD; 8 to 10 points= 79% likelihood of GERD; 11 to 18 points= 89% likelihood of GERD.</description>
