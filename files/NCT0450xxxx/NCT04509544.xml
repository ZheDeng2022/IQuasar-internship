  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This national cross-sectional ESPaCe survey (Enquête Satisfaction Paralysie Cérébrale) was&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate perceived needs, barriers and expectations regarding Motor&#xD;
      Rehabilitation services further to a preliminary qualitative work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From June 2016 to June 2017, participants answered a web-based or postal questionnaire, by&#xD;
      themselves or with the help of a family member.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ESPaCe was a cross-sectional national survey designed to collect data on Cerebral Palsy (CP)&#xD;
      motor rehabilitation from individuals with CP and their families in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Needs, barriers and expectations regarding PT services were identified in a series of&#xD;
      standardised individual interviews and group discussions developed by a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      group composed of individuals with cerebral palsy, families, professional organisation&#xD;
      representatives, therapists and rehabilitation specialists, described as &quot;ESPaCe working&#xD;
      group&quot;. The issues identified in the preparatory qualitative work were structured in a&#xD;
      questionnaire and tested in a feasibility study.This study was carried out in accordance with&#xD;
      the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). Informed&#xD;
      consent was not required for this survey according to current French legislation.The study&#xD;
      included all individuals with cerebral palsy aged 2 y.o. or more, whether they were receiving&#xD;
      physiotherapy (PT) services at the time of the survey or not. CP features were self-reported.&#xD;
      Eligibility was confirmed by cross-checking the responses to questionnaire items related to&#xD;
      history, diagnosis and clinical description of CP. The questionnaire was completed either by&#xD;
      individuals with cerebral palsy, a family member or a caretaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were described with the following characteristics: age, gender, Gross Motor&#xD;
      Function Classification System (GMFCS) level, CP subtype, associated impairments, frequency&#xD;
      of pain, mother education (as a proxy for socio-economic status), and PT service provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the ESPaCe survey was promoted through local and national patient advocacy&#xD;
      groups and professional networks. The questionnaire was completed online or mailed-in. Data&#xD;
      collection was open from June 2016 to June 2017.Participation in the ESPaCe survey was&#xD;
      promoted through local and national patient advocacy groups and professional networks.&#xD;
