  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical trial to evaluate length of stay, growth velocity and clinical outcomes in infants&#xD;
      with neonatal abstinence syndrome receiving an exclusive human milk diet. Human milk is&#xD;
      defined as expressed human milk or donor milk and its derivatives, human milk-based fortifier&#xD;
      and human milk caloric fortifier.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single blinded (physician investigator), randomized, controlled trial to evaluate&#xD;
      length of stay in infants with NAS and an exclusive human milk diet during their initial&#xD;
      hospitalization after birth and through the 28 days of life or hospital discharge, whichever&#xD;
      comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups after at birth. Parents who decline&#xD;
      participation for their infants in the study will be asked to consent to data gathering on&#xD;
      their infants who will be treated and fed per institutional practice. The data on these&#xD;
      individuals will be summarized and evaluated descriptively in comparison with the actual&#xD;
      trial results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All experimental group participants will receive exclusive maternal human milk or donor human&#xD;
      milk prior to randomization. Once randomized, patients in Group One will receive an exclusive&#xD;
      human milk diet throughout the 28-day feeding period or until hospital discharge, whichever&#xD;
      comes first. Patients in Group Two (Control Group) will receive maternal human milk or&#xD;
      formula (per standard of care). Fortification will be implemented with a standard protocol.&#xD;

             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Parent(s) willing to sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Parent(s) willing to comply with study follow-up procedures.&#xD;

&#xD;

             diet either in the form of mother's milk, human milk-based human milk fortifier, human&#xD;
