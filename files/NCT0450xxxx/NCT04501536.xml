  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the amount of speech-language intervention children&#xD;
      with language impairment need to make vocabulary gains. The investigators hope to identify&#xD;
      the optimal amount of intervention needed as well as the point at which adding more&#xD;
      intervention is no longer beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned (like a flip of a coin) to attend therapy either one&#xD;
      time a week for 10 weeks (2 hours a session) or 4 times a week for 10 weeks (30 min per&#xD;
      session). Each therapy session will follow a word learning intervention that is designed to&#xD;
      increase children's word learning abilities using rich, robust word learning strategies&#xD;
      within story book readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal amount of intervention relates to duration, dose, and frequency. Duration refers&#xD;
      to how long the child is seen for (e.g., 10 weeks, 1 year). Dose represents the number of&#xD;
      exposures to each new vocabulary word within a therapy session. Frequency represents the&#xD;
      number of therapy sessions per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that distributed learning leads to higher gains.&#xD;
      The investigators propose that the greatest gains will be observed for children who receive&#xD;
      high-frequency/low-dose or low-frequency/high-dose treatments as compared to children who&#xD;
      receive high-frequency/high-dose or low-frequency/low-dose treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that for both low-frequency and high-frequency&#xD;
      treatments, there is a point at which increases in treatment dose do not correspond to any&#xD;
      additional gains in children's vocabulary skills during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the close of this four-year study, evidence concerning optimal treatment intensity of a&#xD;
      word learning intervention will be instrumental for immediately informing speech-language&#xD;
      pathologists in how much vocabulary treatment to prescribe as well as for designing&#xD;
      additional clinical trials by our and other research teams.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal treatment intensity of a word learning&#xD;
      intervention for improved measures of vocabulary immediately post intervention and at&#xD;
      6-months follow up by addressing 3 specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine whether low frequency (massed) or high frequency (distributed) conditions&#xD;
           are more effective intervention schedules with respect to children's vocabulary gains&#xD;
           during treatment. Using a causally interpretable research design with children randomly&#xD;
           assigned to both conditions, the investigators will test the hypothesis that high&#xD;
           frequency treatment will be more effective than low frequency schedules, informed from&#xD;
           our own research as well as that proposed by distributed learning theorists. The&#xD;
           investigators propose that the greatest gains will be observed immediately post&#xD;
           intervention as well as 6-months post intervention for children who receive&#xD;
           high-frequency treatment as compared to children who receive low-frequency treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the optimal number of dose exposures within each condition of frequency.&#xD;
           Using a causally interpretable research design, with planned variations in dose, the&#xD;
           investigators will test the hypothesis that increases in dose are beneficial when&#xD;
           treatment frequency is low, and similarly that low levels of dose are beneficial when&#xD;
           frequency is high. The investigators propose that the greatest gains will be observed&#xD;
           for children who receive high-frequency/low-dose or low-frequency/high-dose treatments&#xD;
           as compared to children who receive high-frequency/high-dose or low-frequency/low-dose&#xD;
           treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to identify thresholds of cumulative intensity after which additional exposures provide&#xD;
           no additional benefit to children's vocabulary gains, corresponding to a point of&#xD;
           'diminishing returns'. The investigators will test the hypothesis that for both&#xD;
           low-frequency and high-frequency treatments, there is a point at which increases in&#xD;
           treatment dose do not correspond to any additional gains in children's vocabulary skills&#xD;
           during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study features a two-group pre/post experimental design with random assignment&#xD;
      to target words across six dose exposures. Using blocked random assignment, each child will&#xD;
      first be randomized to a low-or high-frequency treatment condition. Target words will then be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of six dose exposures (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 with 0 serving as a&#xD;
      control). Thus, this study will measure both between child (frequency) and within child&#xD;
      (dose) variance attributed to intensity of treatment. Children who meet all eligibility&#xD;
      criteria and are enrolled in the study will be randomly assigned to one of the two&#xD;
      conditions, high-or low-frequency, as previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child will receive one-on-one treatment sessions each week for 10 weeks according to&#xD;
      their assigned frequency (one or four sessions per week for a total of 10 or 40 sessions,&#xD;
      respectively) over the summer period. Each session will follow an efficacious word learning&#xD;
      intervention. The word learning intervention uses the 10 commercially available children's&#xD;
      books from previous studies. Each week, 2 of the 10 storybooks will be read, with 3 of the 6&#xD;
      vocabulary words targeted from each book. The book and words targeted will be consistent&#xD;
      between frequency conditions. For the high-frequency condition, each book will be read once&#xD;
      per session across 4 sessions, for a total of 4 readings per book each week. For the&#xD;
      low-frequency condition, each book will be read 4 times in 1 session for a total of 4&#xD;
      readings per book each week, thereby keeping the number of book-readings equal across&#xD;
      conditions. Over the course of the 10-week intervention, two books will be read each week and&#xD;
      all 10 books will be read twice throughout the intervention. Three of the 6 targeted words&#xD;
      will be taught the first week the book is read and the other 3 of 6 targeted words taught the&#xD;
      second week the book is read. Each child will receive a total of 120 minutes of therapy each&#xD;
      week, which equates to 14-16 hours of therapy (approximately 4 hours of therapy per day for 4&#xD;
      days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The word learning intervention is designed to increase children's word learning abilities&#xD;
      using rich, robust word learning strategies within story book readings including provision of&#xD;
      a synonym (e.g., A furnace is like a heater), definition (e.g., Furnace means something used&#xD;
      to make heat to warm buildings), and context sentence (e.g., Today it was cold outside so mom&#xD;
      turned on the furnace) during pre-book reading, book reading, and post-book reading&#xD;
      activities. During the pre-book reading, the intern will discuss the target words that the&#xD;
      child will hear in the book, with the exception of the word assigned to the 0 exposure&#xD;
      condition. During this portion of the intervention, the speech-language intern will use zero,&#xD;
      one or two strategies, depending on the assigned dose. During the book reading portion of the&#xD;
      intervention, the intern will read the book in its entirety. The intern will either not&#xD;
      elaborate the target word (0 dose) or will offer a synonym as the word is read in the book.&#xD;
      During the post-book reading, the intern will use zero, one, or two strategies depending on&#xD;
      the assigned dose.&#xD;

    <description>The word learning intervention uses the 10 commercially available children's books and 6 target vocabulary words from each book that meet common criteria for appropriate vocabulary targets. Children will receive 1-on-1 treatment sessions with a trained, speech-language research assistant. Each week, 2 of 10 storybooks chosen for the study will be read with 3 of 6 targeted vocabulary words targeted from each book. The book and words targeted will be consistent between random assignment conditions. For each book reading, speech-language interns will implement word learning strategies during pre reading, during reading, and post reading. Strategies include providing a definition, a synonym, and a contextual sentence. The number of strategies used will vary on which word is being targeted; all words will be randomly assigned to a particular dose, ranging from 0 (no strategies) to 20 (all of the strategies at each reading).</description>
