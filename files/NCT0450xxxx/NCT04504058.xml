  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will focus on the major technical difficulty of &quot;lack of effective nutritional&#xD;
      intervention measures for early risk of common mental diseases in China&quot;, and rely on the&#xD;
      platform of psychiatric risk identification and treatment specialty of Shanghai Mental Health&#xD;
      Center, an authoritative institution in the field of mental health, and focus on the&#xD;
      effective application of the domestic independent research and development of the artificial&#xD;
      intelligence nicotinic acid skin flushing reaction quantification instrument.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the biological data of one of the world's largest cohort of psychiatric patients&#xD;
      with early phase and risk, nicotinic acid reaction pictures were introduced as biological&#xD;
      information for the first time in nutritional intervention of psychiatric risk prevention and&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploration of machine learning and big data analysis methods, based on the objective&#xD;
      quantitative evaluation tool, combined with fingertip blood fat spectrum detection, to&#xD;
      construct the optimization scheme and targeted non drug intervention measures of nutritional&#xD;
      supplement for common mental diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the perspective of antioxidant stress and nutritional supplement, a new clinical pathway&#xD;
      for the prevention and treatment of mental diseases with artificial intelligence products as&#xD;
      screening, early warning and guidance prevention will be established.&#xD;

    <description>It will be determined using the criteria for the Presence of Psychotic Symptoms from SIPS. Specifically, the conversion will be defined by the presence of level 6 positive symptoms (the rating &quot;6&quot; refers to severe and psychotic symptoms) identified as either dangerous, disorganised, or occurring at least one hour a day on average, over four days a week for at least 16 hours.</description>
