  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Nalu Neurostimulation System is capable of delivering multiple therapy options to address&#xD;
      patient needs. The study will confirm the efficacy, safety, comfort and compliance with the&#xD;
      Nalu Neurostimulation System in adult subjects with chronic pain in the legs and back.&#xD;
      Patients who have been diagnosed with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) and meet other&#xD;
      study eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study to receive the Nalu Neurostimulation&#xD;
      System.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm clinical study with each&#xD;
      subject serving as their own control. The study will confirm device efficacy, safety, comfort&#xD;
      and compliance with the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the protocol specified eligibility criteria and provide documented informed&#xD;
      consent will be considered for study participation. There are three phases in the study:&#xD;
      Screening/Baseline Phase, Trial Phase, Permanent Implant Phase. On confirmation of&#xD;
      eligibility during the screening/baseline phase, subjects will enter the Trial Phase where&#xD;
      they will undergo a trial with the Nalu Neurostimulation System. Trials will be done per&#xD;
      standard clinical practice and per system IFU. Subjects receiving at least 50% reduction in&#xD;
      their back pain, during the trial phase, will continue to the permanent implant phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will receive the Nalu Neurostimulation System per standard surgical and&#xD;
      medical practices and will be programmed for stimulation with one or more therapies to&#xD;
      optimize pain reduction. All subjects receiving a permanent implant will be followed for&#xD;
      3-months post device activation. They will visit the clinic at 1 month and 3-months follow-up&#xD;
      and programming, as required. Adverse Event data will also be collected to support a safety&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple outcome domains will be captured throughout the study to confirm system performance&#xD;
      and subject response to the device. These include Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain,&#xD;
      Numeric Rating Scales for pain, EQ-5D (QoL), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), PROMIS&#xD;
      Sleep Disturbance SF, Beck's Depression Index (BDI), pain and paresthesia maps, pain and&#xD;
      wearability diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study completion, subjects will return to standard clinical practice.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is between 21 and 80 years of age at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has chronic (defined as at least 6 months duration), intractable neuropathic&#xD;
             pain of legs and back; any nociceptive pain must be less prominent than the&#xD;
             neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject's pain is unresponsive to conservative treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has been diagnosed with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), and it has been&#xD;
             at least 6 months from the last back surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has an average baseline leg and back pain NRS diary score of at least 6 i.e.&#xD;
             average NRS in back ≥ 6 and average NRS in legs ≥ 6 from baseline pain diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject currently has an active implantable medical device such as a drug pump, spinal&#xD;
             cord stimulator, sacral nerve stimulator, deep brain stimulator, and/or cardiac&#xD;
             pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has previously failed SCS therapy (either trial system evaluation or permanent&#xD;
             implant).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has had an ablative procedure directed at the spinal cord including the dorsal&#xD;
             root entry zone (DREZ) or dorsal root ganglion (DRG).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has pain in another anatomic region besides the leg(s) and back that would&#xD;
             interfere with their ability to accurately report pain (e.g. hip joint pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has a medical condition that would prevent them from participating in the&#xD;
             current study per investigator's or medical monitor's judgment.&#xD;
