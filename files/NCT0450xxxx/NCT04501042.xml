  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease.&#xD;
      Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an aggressive form of NAFLD with remarkable&#xD;
      inflammatory features which may cause advanced fibrosis and liver cancer. So far there is no&#xD;
      FDA-approved drug for treating NASH. A 10% weight loss by life style modification is a&#xD;
      standard recommendation to treat NASH which achieves only 10-20% success rate in clinical&#xD;
      practice. Thus, the development of therapeutics to prevent and treat NASH is certainly an&#xD;
      unmet need. For now, the mechanism of how simple steatosis progresses to NASH remains unclear&#xD;
      and accumulating evidences suggest the role of gut microbiota may be essential. Studies have&#xD;
      also noted the bariatric surgery effectively improve diabetes and NASH with significant&#xD;
      alterations in the composition and function of gut microbiome. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to investigate the role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of NASH by&#xD;
      comparing NAFLD severity, gut microbiome, metabolomics, immune profiles among patients before&#xD;
      and after the bariatric surgery. With these efforts, the investigators wish to decipher the&#xD;
      mechanism of how bariatric surgery may improve NASH through changing the gut microbiota and&#xD;
      find out microbe-associated molecular signatures between NASH and NAFLD through this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators anticipate to recruit 140 morbidly obese patients who will receive&#xD;
      bariatric surgery including 100 patients receiving sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and 40 receiving&#xD;
      gastric bypass surgery (GB). Liver biopsy will be performed during the operation to confirm&#xD;
      the histological scores of NAFLD severity. The investigators expect to have 50% NASH and 50%&#xD;
      NAFL patients from these morbidly obese patients based on previous domestic data. (i.e. 50&#xD;
      patients receiving SG to have NASH and 50 patients receiving SG to have NAFL; 20 patients&#xD;
      receiving GB to have NASH and 20 patients receiving GB to have NAFL.) In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators have two study objectives which are as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first objective is to discover potential mechanisms among gut-liver axis for&#xD;
           preventing or promoting NAFL to NASH by comparing (1) fecal microbiome composition and&#xD;
           metabolomics, (2) peripheral blood biochemistry, metabolomics, immune cell phenotypes,&#xD;
           and cytokines (3) portal vein biochemistry, metabolomics, immune cell phenotypes, and&#xD;
           cytokines (4) Liver metabolomics and RNA-seq (5) gut permeability test&#xD;
           (lactulose/mannitol challenge) (6) host genetic susceptibility for NAFLD (PNPLA3 and&#xD;
           TM6SF2) between the tissue-proved NASH and NAFL patients in this study with a&#xD;
           cross-sectional comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second objective is to longitudinally investigate the potential mechanisms of&#xD;
           bariatric surgery for improving NASH via a gut-microbiota dependent pathway. Clinical&#xD;
           and experimental data before (baseline) and after (1st, 3rd, 6th months) bariatric&#xD;
           surgery will be collected which include (1) non-invasive evaluation of NAFLD severity&#xD;
           (Fibroscan, MRI-PDFF (proton density fat fraction) and MRE), (2) blood biochemistry,&#xD;
           metabolomics, immune cell phenotypes, and cytokines (3) fecal microbiome and&#xD;
           metabolomics (4) gut permeability test (5) liver biopsy histology (if available)&#xD;
