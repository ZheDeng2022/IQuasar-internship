  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this study is conducted to evaluate the role of the novel triple therapy combination in&#xD;
      reducing the mortality rate, reducing the shock time, and reversal of organ damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the study includes two arms, the first arm is the control which received hydrocortisone&#xD;
      monotherapy and the second arm is the intervention arm which received the triple therapy&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      calculation of 28 days in-hospital mortality is the primary outcome. shock time, vasopressor&#xD;
      doses, infection markers, and organ function tests are the secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the data will be analyzed by student t-test or Mann Whitney test, Fischer exact or chi-square&#xD;
      test for numbers, repeated measures ANOVA will be used to consider confounders and other&#xD;
      parameters, mortality will be expressed by Kaplan Meier and ROC curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Multivariate analysis of repeated quantitative outcomes, linear mixed models were used to&#xD;
      quantify the relationship between one dependent variable (SOFA, SCr, doses of vasopressors)&#xD;
      and many independent variables including group type and sepsis phenotype adjusted to other&#xD;
      clinical and demographic factors.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Sepsis&quot; is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by the dysregulated host response to&#xD;
      infection. Septic Shock: Subset of sepsis with circulatory and cellular/metabolic dysfunction&#xD;
      associated with a higher risk of mortality. Organ dysfunction can be identified by acute&#xD;
      change in the total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or higher&#xD;
      consequent to the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Septic shock patients can be identified by developing sepsis with persistent arterial&#xD;
      hypotension requiring vasopressors to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mm Hg and&#xD;
      having serum lactate above 2 mmol/L. In hospitals, the mortality of septic shock according to&#xD;
      retrospective studies is around 35%-54%. Pneumonia is the most common site of infection&#xD;
      (about 50%) of cases, followed by intra-abdominal infection and urinary tract infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The (1-hr Bundle) is the cornerstone of the management, it encourages clinicians to act as&#xD;
      quickly as possible to obtain blood cultures, administer broad-spectrum antibiotics, start&#xD;
      appropriate fluid resuscitation, measure lactate, and begin vasopressors if clinically&#xD;
      indicated. Ideally, these interventions would all begin in the first hour from sepsis&#xD;
      recognition but may not necessarily be completed in the first hour. However, over the last&#xD;
      few years, there have been interesting investigational novel therapeutic approaches. One of&#xD;
      them is the use of high dose vitamin C. A small retrospective study demonstrated a mortality&#xD;
      benefit by using high dose vitamin C, thiamine (vitamin B1), and hydrocortisone (Triple&#xD;
      therapy) for treatment of septic shock in the adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normal plasma vitamin C level is ≥ 23 µmol/l. A recent study found that 88% of septic&#xD;
      shock patients have hypovitaminosis C (&lt;23 µmol/l), while 38% have a scurvy level (&lt;11&#xD;
      µmol/l). The acute deficiency of vitamin C in this category of patients may be caused by the&#xD;
      increased metabolic consumption due to critical illness such (trauma, burn, septic shock,&#xD;
      etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin C has pleiotropic effects such as antioxidant (direct radical scavenger- reduction of&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) production-regeneration of antioxidants), anti-inflammatory,&#xD;
      and immune-supporting, cofactor/co-substrate biosynthesis, increasing catecholamine&#xD;
      sensitivity and protection of microcirculation. Vitamin C enteral intake is insufficient in&#xD;
      critically ill patients due to saturable mucosal sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 1&#xD;
      (SCVC1). So, supplementation of high doses of vitamin C by intravenous route can restore&#xD;
      normal plasma concentration and reverse the stress and its sequences (reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      organ failure, reduce vasopressor support, and may reduce the overall mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent small controlled studies suggested the dosing range of vitamin C is from 6-16 gm/day.&#xD;
      Also, a dose-response relationship in patients who received high doses of vitamin C was&#xD;
      proven. Vitamin C is actively transported in tissue cells by (SCVC2), leading to achieving a&#xD;
      high intracellular level than the plasma especially in leukocytes and neurons protecting them&#xD;
      against ROS. While high doses of vitamin C given were not associated with any harms related&#xD;
      to the drug, there is a theoretical concern regarding the use of high doses related to the&#xD;
      potential risk for developing oxalate crystals in the urinary tract, For this reason,&#xD;
      co-administration of thiamine with these high doses of vitamin C acts as a co-enzyme for the&#xD;
      function of glyoxalate-amino transferase which catalyzes the degradation of glyoxalate to&#xD;
      carbon dioxide instead of the oxalate. Another note is a short course of high doses vitamin C&#xD;
      has not been found to increase the risk of renal calculi in the previous studies. Also,&#xD;
      patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme deficiency are at risk of&#xD;
      hemolysis with high doses of vitamin C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiamine has a crucial role in cellular metabolic processes. Thiamine deficiency is common in&#xD;
      critically ill patients when becomes insufficient pyruvate not converted to acetyl coenzyme A&#xD;
      resulting in impaired aerobic respiration and switch to anaerobic respiration leading to&#xD;
      elevate of lactate level. Previous studies showed improvement in lactate level and in organ&#xD;
      dysfunction with supplementation of thiamine for critically ill patients, thiamine dose is&#xD;
      200mg every 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydrocortisone is another major component of the recommended triple therapy, the dose of&#xD;
      hydrocortisone in septic shock is 200 mg/day, The rationale for its use is that, in septic&#xD;
      shock, the released component of the cell membrane of gram-negative and gram-positive&#xD;
      bacteria and endotoxins induce nitric oxide synthase which promotes the relaxation of&#xD;
      vascular beds in addition to releasing of inflammatory cytokines such tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      (TNF-alpha) and interleukins (IL-1). These cytokines suppress the action of Adreno-Cortico&#xD;
      Trophic Hormone (ACTH) on the adrenal gland and decrease the endogenous cortisol and compete&#xD;
      with cortisol on receptor sites and diminish its effect, By supplying hydrocortisone,&#xD;
      reversing of these mechanisms occurs which improves response to vasopressors, blocks&#xD;
      phospholipase A2 then reduces prostacyclins and prostaglandins (vasodilators), reducing the&#xD;
      diminished steroid action at receptor sites. Synergism appears between hydrocortisone and&#xD;
      vitamin C based on two roles, one of them is glucocorticoid binding to glucocorticoid&#xD;
      receptors is negatively affected by oxidizing molecules and this can be reversed by&#xD;
      administration of high doses of vitamin C which restores the glucocorticoid receptor&#xD;
      functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, it was found that the transcellular transportation of vitamin C via SVCT2 is impaired&#xD;
      due to the downregulation of this transporter during septic shock, hydrocortisone has been&#xD;
      shown increasing the expression of this transporter and then increases the cellular uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study To determine the effectiveness of triple therapy regimen (vitamin C, vitamin&#xD;
      B1, and Hydrocortisone) in the reduction of mortality of septic shock patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Study subjects and designs This is an interventional, controlled, single-blind&#xD;
      prospective parallel study to be conducted in the (ICUs) at the Air Force Specialized&#xD;
      Hospital (AFSH), Cairo, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be selected according to the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Sample size will be calculated based on this equation&#xD;
&#xD;
      assuming the following parameters: Anticipated Incidence of mortality: GP1 (hydrocortisone&#xD;
      arm) = 40.4%, in GP 2 (triple therapy arm) = 8.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha = 0.05, power = 95%, enrollment ratio = 1 So each group will consist of 44 patients&#xD;
      (total = 88).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By considering dropout rate = 20%, So each group will consist of 53 patients and the&#xD;
           total sample size =106 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first arm will take the triple therapy regimen (vitamin C, vitamin B1, and&#xD;
           Hydrocortisone), the Second arm will take Hydrocortisone as the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From each patient the following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, gender, height and weight, and any allergies (on admission)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Causes of ICU admission (on admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's past medical history (PMH) (on admission)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SOFA score to be assessed on admission and daily (primary outcome) [28] and Acute&#xD;
           Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE ӏӏ) [29] score (on&#xD;
           admission only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic data (blood pressure, pulse, central venous pressure (CVP), respiratory&#xD;
           rate, O2 saturation) on admission, and daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection markers (total leukocytic count, CRP), lactate level, serum creatinine,&#xD;
           Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT). on admission and for&#xD;
           follow- up daily (secondary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different statistical tests selection will be based on the type of data and the calculated&#xD;
      outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality (primary outcome) calculation will be evaluated by the chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reversal of organs failure, weaning from the mechanical ventilator, and vasopressors&#xD;
           will be evaluated using the Mann-Whitney test.&#xD;
