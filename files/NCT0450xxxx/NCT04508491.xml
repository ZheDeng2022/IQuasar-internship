      Compare the difference of cognitive function between different treatment strategy in patients&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) had been increasing for the past decade. The&#xD;
      increase of AF was attributed to the aging of the population and the increased awareness of&#xD;
      the disease among people and the primary physicians. However, we have not achieved the&#xD;
      consensus whether aggressive rhythm control or conservative rate control is better in a&#xD;
      patient with asymptomatic persisted AF. We do prescribe anti-coagulant for stroke prevention,&#xD;
      but which treatment strategy is best for the patients is uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial of catheter-based ablation for rhythm control compared to traditional&#xD;
      medication control has not shown the benefit of reducing all-cause mortality, but it did show&#xD;
      a reduction of re-hospitalization and the recurrence of AF. On the contrary, the study in&#xD;
      heart failure patients had shown a significant benefit applying catheter-based rhythm control&#xD;
      strategy to reduce all-cause mortality. The different results of these two trials told us the&#xD;
      benefit of rhythm control is not easily to be seen in a short-term, but could be seen in a&#xD;
      long term or in high risk patients. The association between AF and cognitive impairment has&#xD;
      also been reported in observation cohort. However, there is no sold evidence in clinical&#xD;
      trials to show the improvement of cognitive function by treating atrial fibrillation. One&#xD;
      study did show improvement of cognitive function with questionnaire, but the other showed new&#xD;
      lesion detected by traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after ablation, though the&#xD;
      lesion resolved after one year of follow-up. There is no clear answer to which treatment&#xD;
      strategy is better for the patients' cognitive functionã€‚ Therefore, we designe a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, blind endpointtrial. We will enroll the patients with persisted AF, and use&#xD;
      advanced MRI (DTI/SWI) and questionnaire to longitudinally study the cognitive function&#xD;
      change of the patients before and after the initiation of anti-coagulant agents, before and&#xD;
      after the catheter-based ablation, and use this as a surrogate to understand the best&#xD;
      treatment strategy for these AF patients.&#xD;
