    <textblock>
      Cervicocranial flexion exercise (CCFE) and superficial neck flexor endurance training have&#xD;
      been widely implemented in clinical practice for curing chronic neck pain. By means of CCFE,&#xD;
      the muscle balance between deep neck flexor and superficial flexor would be optimal during&#xD;
      neck movement. In other words, the superficial neck flexor( scalenes, SCM, and trapezius)&#xD;
      would not overactive and the fatigue threshold might increase. Superficial neck flexor&#xD;
      endurance training is proved to be efficient in reducing superficial cervical flexor muscle&#xD;
      fatigue as well as increasing cervical flexion strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasonably, Cervicocranial flexion exercise (CCFE) and superficial neck flexor endurance&#xD;
      training are also beneficial to pulmonary function due to training the respiratory accessory&#xD;
      muscle (scalens and SCM). Hence this article hypothesizes that Cervicocranial flexion&#xD;
      exercise (CCFE) and superficial neck flexor endurance training combined with common pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation will manifest better outcomes (pulmonary function, dyspnea situation, pain and&#xD;
      stiffness level of neck) than pulmonary rehabilitation only.&#xD;

      2.1 subject 20 patients were recruited in this article during 2020/03 to 2021/02. The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were 1.) SCI onset in a year; 2.) motor level above T12 and American&#xD;
      Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade A, B, C, or D; 3.) age from 20~70; 4.)&#xD;
      FEV1&lt; 80% prediction value. The exclusion criteria were 1.) ventilation dependence 2.)&#xD;
      Tracheostomy 3.) Psychiatric condition 4.) Progressive diseases 5.) infection 6.) cancer&#xD;
      7.)unable to speak Chinese or English. Patient who met the criteria would were asked to&#xD;
      provide written informed consent. The IRB were approved by Tao Yuan General Hospital,&#xD;
      Ministry of Health and Welfare, IRB committee.(TYGH108045 ) 2.2 procedure The subjects&#xD;
      included in this study were randomized assigned to experimental group and control group. The&#xD;
      randomization orders were decided by computer, and all the contents were concealed into a&#xD;
      dark color envelop. Before first treatment, the envelops were opened to determine which&#xD;
      treatment protocol were adopted. The treatment of experimental group was consist of&#xD;
      Cervicocranial flexion exercise (CCFE) and neck flexor endurance training plus normal&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. The treatment of control group was composed of general neck&#xD;
      stretch exercise plus cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. Subsequently, initial measurement was&#xD;
      conducted including lung capacity test, dyspnea situation, pain and stiffness of neck.&#xD;
      Moreover, lung function such as FVC and FEV1, dyspnea situation, pain and stiffness of neck&#xD;
      were also recorded one time in a week as a short-term outcome. Then, the treatment protocols&#xD;
      were both executed for 30 minutes, ten times in a month. After completing the treatment&#xD;
      process, the final measurement were conducted as the initial treatment. All the outcome were&#xD;
      collected and analyzed by statistically method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Outcome measurement Lung capacity was evaluated by in lung function examination center of&#xD;
      Taoyaun general hospital. The parameters revealed by this test. Before the examination,&#xD;
      bronchodilator should not be used to avoid interfering the outcome of examination. In&#xD;
      addition, portable lung capacity device(ezOxygen, Taipei, Taiwan) were adopted to record lung&#xD;
      function parameters such as FVC and FEV1. First, subjects were instructed to hold deep breath&#xD;
      and let his mouth firmly contact to the mouthpiece. Second, subjects were asked to exhale the&#xD;
      air into the mouth and the process was repeated three times, between each sessions, subjects&#xD;
      were allowed to rest at least thirty seconds. Three tests were recorded and the mean value&#xD;
      was calculated. The dyspnea situation was evaluated by the questionnaire Baseline Dyspnea&#xD;
      Index (BDI) and Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI). The BDI measured the severity of dyspnea at&#xD;
      the baseline and the TDI measured the change from baseline. Both questionnaires are composed&#xD;
      of three parts: functional impairment, magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort required to&#xD;
      evoke dyspnea. Each part in BDI is scored from 0(very severe) to 4(no impairment) and total&#xD;
      score from 0~12( the lower the score, the worse the severity of dyspnea) is also recorded.&#xD;
      Each component in TDI is rated by seven grades ranging from -3 (major deterioration) to +3&#xD;
      (major improvement). Total score ranged from - 9 to + 9. The lower the score is, the more&#xD;
      deterioration of the severity of dyspnea revealed. The minimal clinical important&#xD;
      difference(MCID) of TDI is ≥1 unit[31]. The number rating scale NRS is used to define the&#xD;
      level of neck pain and stiffness. The MCID of neck pain VAS is 1.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Treatment Experimental group is consist of CCFE and neck flexor endurance training plus&#xD;
      normal cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. Subjects were instructed to perform chin in without&#xD;
      excessive SCM contraction. CCFE was conducted in supine position. Subjects were asked to&#xD;
      maintain chin for 10 seconds each repetition, ten repetitions for a set, 3 sets in a&#xD;
      treatment session[30]. The physiotherapist with abundant experience related to CCFE&#xD;
      supervised all the treatment process to confirm the quality of execution. If no symptoms&#xD;
      revealed, the neck endurance exercise would involve into the treatment sessions. Neck&#xD;
      endurance exercise was also conducted in supine position. Subjects were taught to lift their&#xD;
      head with a neutral upper cervical spine first. Then, they gradually move the head and neck&#xD;
      through as full range as possible without induce discomfort or neck related symptom. This&#xD;
      exercise was performed 12~15 repetition depends on patient's condition[33]. If the subjects&#xD;
      were unable to achieve the training level, subject's bed were inclined up from horizontal.&#xD;
      Hence, the demand of lifting neck and head declined and subjects could perform aimed&#xD;
      repetitions. The cardiopulmonary rehabilitation protocol was based on Wu, Y.-T. et al[9], and&#xD;
      it was divide into three stages. In first stage, subjects lied in supine position, and they&#xD;
      were instructed to do diaphragm breath, pursed-lip breath, lateral coastal breath, cough&#xD;
      training, and rib mobilization. The dosage and type of therapy was decided depending on&#xD;
      subjects situation everyday. The total cardiopulmonary training was controlled in 20 minutes.&#xD;
      In second stage, the incentive spirometer (picture A) was integrated into the therapy.&#xD;
      Subjects were asked to inhale the air slowly with eye contact at the chamber of the&#xD;
      spirometer for controlling the air flow velocity. Subject were also asked to inhale as many&#xD;
      volumes as possible. Back support was inclined to hold subject in semi-sitting position. 15&#xD;
      repetitions was given to subjects and subjects received 20 second rest between each&#xD;
      repetition. In addition, some upper extremities training combined with breath exercise were&#xD;
      also involved in after incentive spirometer training. 15 repetitions, 3 sets was given to&#xD;
      subjects. In stage 3, the upper extremities exercise were combined with spirometer training.&#xD;
      15 repetitions, 3 sets was given to subjects. The experienced physiotherapist decided the&#xD;
      stages depends on patient's capability, that is, the stages were not the same for every&#xD;
      subject. The control group were composed of neck stretch exercise plus cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The neck stretch exercises were executed by physiotherapist before&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary training. Neck flexion, neck extension, neck right rotation, neck left&#xD;
      rotation, neck right side-bending, and neck left side-bending were applied to subjects 5&#xD;
      times for each direction, and neck maintained at end position for 30 seconds each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Statistical analysis The primary variable of the study were vital capacity, respiratory&#xD;
      complication ,and dyspnea. The secondary variable of the study were FEV1, pain and stiffness&#xD;
      of neck. Descriptive statistics for the categorical variable were documented as frequency&#xD;
      counts and percentages. The continuous variables were reported as mean + SD, if they were&#xD;
      normal distribution, or they were recorded as median and range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Wilcox signed test was adopted to analyze the treatment before and after the treatment&#xD;
      sessions (time effect). The Mann-Whitney U was applied for the difference before and after&#xD;
      treatment between two groups (group effect), and the baseline of two groups was also analyzed&#xD;
      by this method. The significant level was set as p value&lt; 0.05. All the statistical data&#xD;
      analysis were performed by SPSS version 22.&#xD;
