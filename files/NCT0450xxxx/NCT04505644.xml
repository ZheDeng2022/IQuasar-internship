    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of lidocaine patch applied around wound in reduction of&#xD;
      postoperative pain and illus compared to intravenous lidocaine infusion and placebo after&#xD;
      cesarean section.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The use of lidocaine as a local anesthetic is a common and widely used in practice. Lidocaine&#xD;
      patches can be used for localized pain control and can be placed every 24 hours. The use of&#xD;
      lidocaine patches in post-operative patients has been reported in one case report in&#xD;
      obstetric literature. There is one study that reports decreased immediate postoperative pain&#xD;
      when lidocaine patches were placed at laparoscopic port sites following gynecologic surgery&#xD;
      as measured by visual analog scale score and the Prince Henry and 5-point verbal rating pain&#xD;
      scale . There have been no studies looking at the impact of lidocaine patches in obstetric&#xD;
      surgical procedures, specifically cesarean sections.&#xD;

This total dose will be calculated for every subject in the study, and the average and standard deviation (or appropriate non-parametric values if the data is not normally distributed) will be compared between the subjects randomized to the intervention arm and the placebo arm of the study.</description>
