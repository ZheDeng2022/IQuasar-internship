  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the predictive validity of a game-based screening system based on&#xD;
      child self-report measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The core study hypotheses are that (1) in-game assessments will predict problematic recovery&#xD;
      (child pain and posttraumatic stress symptoms [PTSS]) and (2) parents in the intervention&#xD;
      group will report greater confidence in managing child recovery.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the predictive validity of a game-based screening system based on&#xD;
      child self-report measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The core study hypotheses are that (1) in-game assessments will predict problematic recovery&#xD;
      (child pain and PTSS) and (2) parents in the intervention group will report greater&#xD;
      confidence in managing child recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled trial that will examine validity of eScreen measures&#xD;
      (primary aim) and assess the impact of the eScreen system on parent confidence in managing&#xD;
      child symptoms and recovery (secondary aim).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At T1, after baseline assessment (questionnaires), children will be randomized to the usual&#xD;
      care plus eScreen (eScreen) or usual care alone (Usual Care) groups. In the eScreen group,&#xD;
      children will use the game-based screening component and parents the parent information&#xD;
      component for 6 weeks. All participants will complete follow-up research assessments by&#xD;
      phone, online, or mail at T2 (6 weeks) and T3 (12 weeks). Following their T3 research&#xD;
      assessment, child participants in the Usual Care group will have the option to play and&#xD;
      provide feedback on the game (with no in-game assessment and no parent information&#xD;
      component).&#xD;

    <description>The eScreen system is composed of a child screening component and a parent information component. The child screening component is delivered via a game-like interface and includes assessment of current pain, PTSS, and functional recovery. Children are asked to play the game at least 3x/week. The parent information component consists of text / email messages sent to parents at least weekly that summarize child ratings and include a link to an online dashboard with additional personalized information for parents.</description>
