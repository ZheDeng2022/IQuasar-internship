    <textblock>
      It is an interventional study in which 60 obese elderly patients (30 male &amp; 30 female)&#xD;
      estimated to enroll according to random allocation and divided into two groups. The study&#xD;
      group will receive active acupuncture low level laser in addition to nasal laser irradiation&#xD;
      and aerobic exercises while the control group will aerobic exercises. The laser consists of a&#xD;
      semiconductor and operates at a wavelength of 650 nanometre. The laser installed in the watch&#xD;
      comprises 10 individual laser beams for the wrist and an additional adapter for nasal&#xD;
      stimulation. The output power is 5 megawatt, but it can also be adjusted. The device operates&#xD;
      at an ambient temperature of -20 to +40 ° C and a relative humidity of ≤ 85%. The laser watch&#xD;
      can be used for a variable irradiation period of 10-60 min. the device will be applied on&#xD;
      specific acupuncture points ( acupuncture point, Radial artery acupuncture points, and ulnar&#xD;
      artery acupuncture points) combined with nasal laser irradiation at the same time, once per&#xD;
      day, 3 times per week for three months&#xD;

      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether low level laser light therapy is effective as an adjunctive therapy on&#xD;
      countering hypercoagulable state parameters (fibrinogen, bleeding time, Prothrombin time) and&#xD;
      total cholesterol (, d-dimer and c-reactive protein) as preventive strategy of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism incidence in obese elderly patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the general population the annual incidence of venous thrombosis (VT) approximates 1 in&#xD;
      1000 persons and appears to be increasing over time. Notably, incidence rates rise&#xD;
      exponentially with age with an approximate 7- to 10-fold increase from less than 55 years to&#xD;
      greater than 75 years. Aging is associated with increased levels of coagulation factors and&#xD;
      decrease in natural anticoagulant factors. This strongly supports that age-related&#xD;
      hypercoagulable state occurs in elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood coagulation plays a critical role not only in homeostasis but also in many&#xD;
      physiological and pathological conditions. Blood coagulation potential in humans reaches a&#xD;
      young adult level around the time of weaning, followed by a gradual increase during young&#xD;
      adulthood and an almost 2-fold increase by old age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrinogen may contribute to the cardiovascular risk due to their influence on blood&#xD;
      viscosity, platelet aggregation, low-density lipoprotein deposition, blood vessel diameter&#xD;
      and cell proliferation. Most of the factors that cause venous thromboembolism are related to&#xD;
      changes in blood flow and changes in the composition of the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, an innovative technology using low-level laser light has garnered an&#xD;
      exceptional level of interest across myriad medical disciplines because of its unique ability&#xD;
      to modulate cellular metabolism, therefore inducing beneficial clinical effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low level laser radiation has particular effect on blood viscosity by changing the sizes of&#xD;
      erythrocyte aggregates which lead to an increase in the blood flow velocity in the human&#xD;
      body. There are several reasons for the increase in the blood microcirculation under&#xD;
      irradiation. One of the major reasons is the activation of the respiratory chains of cells&#xD;
      leading to a cascade of biochemical reactions that resulting in an increase in the&#xD;
      permeability of erythrocyte membranes and an increase in the concentration of oxygen in the&#xD;
      bio tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      countering hypercoagulable state parameters (fibrinogen, bleeding time, Prothrombin time) and&#xD;
      total cholesterol (, d-dimer and c-reactive protein) as a preventive strategy of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism incidence in obese elderly patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does low level laser therapy with aerobic exercises influence on obese elderly patients'&#xD;
      hemostatic state parameters as coagulation profile ((fibrinogen, bleeding time, Prothrombin&#xD;
      time) and total cholesterol (, d-dimer and c-reactive protein) as prevention of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism in the obese elderly patient&#xD;
