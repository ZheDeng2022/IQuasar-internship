    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled, multi-center, open, phase II clinical study is designed to target&#xD;
      patients with resectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with high-risk recurrence factors&#xD;
      which has extremely low postoperative recurrence-free survival. In this study, we aim to&#xD;
      compare the prognosis in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma between Toripalimab combined with&#xD;
      Lenvatinib and GEMOX neoadjuvant treatment and the current clinical surgical treatment&#xD;
      (traditional group).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a malignant tumor of biliary epithelial cells that&#xD;
      originates from the branches of the intrahepatic bile duct at the second level and above. Its&#xD;
      incidence accounts for about 15%-20% of primary liver malignancies, showing a gradually&#xD;
      increasing trend. Surgical resection is currently the main method for the treatment of ICC.&#xD;
      The data of a large number of ICC cases show that even radical resection (R0) patients have&#xD;
      an average survival of only 18.3 months, while for palliative resection patients, the average&#xD;
      survival is only 6.6 months, and laparotomy patients only 5.6 months. Retrospective studies&#xD;
      reported that positive resection margins, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic vessel invasion,&#xD;
      nerve bundle invasion, preoperative CA199&gt;200U/ml, multiple tumor nodules, and&#xD;
      differentiation are the main factors affecting the survival of ICC patients after surgery.&#xD;
      How to improve the surgical results of ICC patients, especially those with high-risk factors&#xD;
      for postoperative recurrence, is an important way to improve the overall survival of ICC.&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant therapy refers to some treatments taken before surgery for newly treated tumor&#xD;
      patients who have not found distant metastasis, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy,&#xD;
      targeted therapy, etc., to reduce tumors, reduce tumor stages, and reduce postoperative&#xD;
      recurrence rate, prolonging survival time. Our previous study using Toripalimab combined with&#xD;
      Lenvatinib and Gemox chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of unresectable advanced&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma (NCT03951597,2020ESMO) showed that the ORR was 80% and the DCR reached&#xD;
      93.3%, of which 1 case was CR, 23 cases were PR, and 2 cases were successfully treated with&#xD;
      radical resection after downstage. And the adverse reactions are controllable. These data&#xD;
      suggest that Toripalimab combined with Lenvatinib and Gemox chemotherapy may be an ideal&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment for patients with resectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with&#xD;
      high-risk recurrence factors, needing more investigation.&#xD;
