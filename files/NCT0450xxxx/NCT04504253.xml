  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to determine if augmentation of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) utilized for the&#xD;
      treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) with daily oral creatine will lead to an&#xD;
      accelerated response to treatment, an overall increase in response rate, and will protect&#xD;
      against cognitive adverse effects associated with ECT. We propose to conduct a two-arm,&#xD;
      parallel, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, with a treatment group&#xD;
      receiving 20 g oral loading dose of creatine for 1 week starting the day before initiating&#xD;
      ECT, followed by 5 g oral creatine daily for roughly five weeks, including the approximately&#xD;
      three-week ECT treatment course and a two-week follow-up period. Response to treatment will&#xD;
      be assessed using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) at each treatment&#xD;
      and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) at the end of each week.&#xD;

      A. Prevalence and Impact of Depression&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDD has a lifetime prevalence of over 16%[1] and is associated with significant personal and&#xD;
      social costs, including lost work productivity [2], disability [3, 4], diminished quality of&#xD;
      life, increased mortality [5], increased rates of suicide attempts [6] and completed suicides&#xD;
      [7, 8]. The financial impact of depression in the United States is significant, with an&#xD;
      estimated economic burden of individuals with MDD of approximately $210.5 billion dollars&#xD;
      annually, including direct costs, suicide-related costs, and workplace costs [9]. Although&#xD;
      MDD is often regarded as a single disorder, it may encompass a variety of different&#xD;
      etiologies with overlapping symptoms and signs [10, 11]. An additional complication of MDD is&#xD;
      the high risk of disease recurrence; the presence of two or more chronic medical conditions,&#xD;
      female gender, never having been married, activity limitation, and less contact with family&#xD;
      are all significant predictors of MDD persistence [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDD can be challenging to treat clinically, especially due to its propensity to be&#xD;
      treatment-resistant. Treatment-resistant Depression (TRD) is currently defined as failure to&#xD;
      achieve remission after two or more adequate pharmacologic trials [14, 15]. Current&#xD;
      literature suggests that the majority of individuals with MDD do not reach and subsequently&#xD;
      maintain a fully remitted state [16]. Furthermore, results from the STAR-D trial indicate&#xD;
      that the overall likelihood of failure to achieve remission is increased with increasing&#xD;
      number of failed medication trials [17]. At this time, the adjunctive use of atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotics has been well-investigated, but less is known about alternative adjunctive&#xD;
      agents [16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current clinical guidelines for the treatment of depression establish basic principles for&#xD;
      establishing a treatment plan, preparing for potential need for long-term treatment, and&#xD;
      assessment of remission. For moderate major depression, first line treatment includes&#xD;
      antidepressant monotherapy and psychotherapy. For severe major depression, antidepressant&#xD;
      therapy can be augmented with an antipsychotic or ECT [18]. Due to the overall disease burden&#xD;
      of unmanaged MDD, the prevalence of treatment resistant depression, high rates of primary&#xD;
      treatment failure, the additional study of alterative adjunctive therapy is both appropriate&#xD;
      and potentially impactful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Efficacy of ECT in Treatment of MDD&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECT is considered to be a first line treatment for depression with psychotic features, but it&#xD;
      is also often used to treat patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) [19].&#xD;
      According to a 2015 metanalysis, approximately one third of patients with MDD do not respond&#xD;
      to ECT, with failed medication trials and longer depressive episodes being the strongest&#xD;
      predictors of poor response [20]. For treatment-resistant depression, the overall response&#xD;
      rate is approximately 58%, compared to a 70% response rate in patients without TRD [20]. When&#xD;
      assessing the overall efficacy of ECT, both remission and response are used, although&#xD;
      remission is more frequently used in clinical practice. In general, response has been defined&#xD;
      as a 50% decrease in baseline depression screening scores, while remission is defined as a&#xD;
      score &lt;7 on the HAM-D17, or &lt;10 with the 24-item HAM-D [19].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of remission in MDD after ECT treatment suggest that chronic depression,&#xD;
      medication resistance, longer episode duration, and younger age are all statistically&#xD;
      significant predictors of non-remission [21]. Remission rates in ECT tend to be robust; data&#xD;
      from the CORE trial suggested an overall remission rate of 87%, which further delineates into&#xD;
      95% remission rate with the presence of psychotic features and 83% without [22]. Again,&#xD;
      however, rates of response and remission with ECT are lower for patients with&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depression, who may make up the majority of patients receiving ECT in&#xD;
      clinical samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although ECT is an effective treatment for MDD, up to one third of patients experience&#xD;
      significant memory loss and other adverse cognitive effects after receiving ECT [23].&#xD;
      Strategies to limit ECT's effects on memory, such as altering electrode placement (e.g., from&#xD;
      bitemporal to bifrontal), ensuring days off between treatments, and modulating pulse width,&#xD;
      amplitude, and frequency, may all have some benefit[24]. Still, cognitive complaints remain&#xD;
      one of the most significant side-effects of ECT, and concerns about these effects represent a&#xD;
      major reason that patients who could benefit from ECT choose not to pursue it. [23].&#xD;
      Nootropic agents, thyroid hormone, and donepezil have all been studied to mitigate the&#xD;
      cognitive side effects, but no consistent benefit has been shown and no current adjunctive&#xD;
      medication is recommended [24].&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. ECT Augmentation&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to maximize the efficacy of ECT in the treatment of MDD, several studies have&#xD;
      analyzed the benefit of augmentation with a variety of antidepressants, anesthetic agents,&#xD;
      and nutritional supplements. The most thoroughly studied has been adjunctive ketamine&#xD;
      administration with ECT, although findings have been inconsistent. A metanalysis of RCTs&#xD;
      investigating adjunctive ketamine and ECT in 2019 did not find that ketamine improves the&#xD;
      efficacy of ECT when compared to other anesthetic agents, although it was suggested that&#xD;
      ketamine could lead to improvement of depressive symptoms in the acute phases of ECT when&#xD;
      used in combination [25]. There was no improvement in depressive symptoms with ketamine&#xD;
      augmentation by the end of the ECT series [25]. The effect of ketamine on the neurocognitive&#xD;
      side effects associated with ECT remains unclear, but no clear benefit has been shown [25].&#xD;
      In addition, the long-term efficacy and safety of ketamine use in ECT is unknown,&#xD;
      particularly in the setting of maintenance treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many secondary agents have been studied in conjunction with ECT therapy, including caffeine&#xD;
      sodium benzoate (CSB), hyperventilation, and methylxanthines [26]. However, these agents have&#xD;
      primarily been studied for their potential to lower seizure threshold or increase overall&#xD;
      seizure duration during ECT, without clear effects on overall ECT efficacy or symptom&#xD;
      improvement apart from effects on seizure characteristics [26]. Less is understood about the&#xD;
      effects of nutritional supplementation, such as folate, thyroid hormone, tryptophan, or&#xD;
      S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e). A case study from 2015 demonstrated improvement in response to&#xD;
      ECT after folate supplementation [27].&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some research that has demonstrated associations between response/remission in ECT&#xD;
      and serum levels of various vitamins and essential nutrients. A 1994 study examining the&#xD;
      association between serum 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MeTHF) levels and ECT response did not&#xD;
      demonstrate any significant association between ECT response and serum 5-MeTHF levels,&#xD;
      although low serum 5-MeTHF levels were positively correlated with depression symptom severity&#xD;
      [28]. A pilot study has further analyzed serum levels of vitamin B12, folate, S100B,&#xD;
      homocysteine, and procalcitonin in patients undergoing ECT, and found that decreased vitamin&#xD;
      B12 and folate levels in conjunction with elevated homocysteine and S100B levels lead to&#xD;
      increased sensitivity to ECT, as evidenced by increased remission rates [29]. Thyroid hormone&#xD;
      has been studied in the setting of ECT therapy, both as an adjunctive treatment for&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and as an agent to reduce neurocognitive deficits associated with ECT and&#xD;
      has been demonstrated to reduce ECT associated amnesia and promote a decrease in depressive&#xD;
      symptoms [30]. Still, thyroid hormone has not been widely used in clinical practice, possibly&#xD;
      because of concerns about adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Creatine and Depression&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing body of literature surrounding the use of standardized,&#xD;
      pharmaceutical-grade nutrients (nutraceuticals) as augmentation therapy in the setting of&#xD;
      treatment resistant depression. A 2016 metanalysis concluded that adjunctive use of SAM-e,&#xD;
      l-methylfolate, omega-3, and vitamin D with antidepressant therapy leads to a reduction in&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, while isolated studies showed a similar effect with the use of creatine,&#xD;
      folinic acid, and an amino acid combination [31].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatine is a naturally-occurring organic acid that is known to play a role in brain energy&#xD;
      homeostasis and is hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression via&#xD;
      altered energy metabolism [31]. Oral creatine supplementation has been shown to increase&#xD;
      cerebral phosphocreatine levels, which is hypothesized to shift cerebral creatine kinase&#xD;
      activity, leading to increased ATP production [32-34]. Early literature suggests that&#xD;
      creatine may have an antidepressant effect when used as adjunctive therapy in MDD, due to its&#xD;
      role in altering brain bioenergetics [35]. Creatine has been shown to lead to an earlier&#xD;
      treatment response in patients treated with escitalopram, with positive response to therapy&#xD;
      as early as 2 weeks after beginning treatment [34]. To date, no studies have investigated the&#xD;
      use of creatine as an adjunctive therapy to ECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inadequate tissue bioenergetic functioning is thought to be related to disease pathology that&#xD;
      affects predominately organs that are comparatively highly metabolically active, like the&#xD;
      brain, liver, heart, and skeletal muscle [36]. Because creatine supplementation has the&#xD;
      potential to increase bioenergetic stores, it may produce an antidepressant response by&#xD;
      enabling synaptogenesis, increasing connectivity between frontal cortical regions and the&#xD;
      amygdala, or enhancing frontal cortical functioning. ECT is thought to produce an&#xD;
      antidepressant effect largely by promoting synaptogenesis in frontal cortical regions via&#xD;
      alterations in the activity of NMDA and AMPA receptors, leading to upregulations in BDNF.&#xD;
      Accordingly, creatine has the potential to augment the efficacy of ECT by increasing&#xD;
      bioenergetic stores available for synaptogenesis. There is also some evidence to suggest that&#xD;
      creatine has activity at NMDA receptors, functioning as a neuromodulator that is released in&#xD;
      response to electrical stimulation [37]. Its activity at NMDA receptors is potentially&#xD;
      another explanation for its antidepressant effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a mouse model study of hyperhomocystinemia, a condition that leads to impaired creatine&#xD;
      kinase activity, creatine supplementation was shown to have neuroprotective effects, with&#xD;
      suggestion of memory improvement [38]. Other mouse model studies have shown that creatine can&#xD;
      generate improvement of spatial memory, when compared to a traditional diet, as well as&#xD;
      improve learning and mitochondrial function[39, 40]. Several human studies have also&#xD;
      demonstrated that creatine supplementation is associated with multiple cognitive&#xD;
      improvements, including effects on attention, mood, working and long-term memory, and mental&#xD;
      fatigue [41-45]. These data suggest that creatine is a potential approach for addressing the&#xD;
      cognitive side effects associated with ECT therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Creatine Safety and Toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective and prospective studies in humans have found no evidence for long-term or&#xD;
      short-term significant side effects from creatine supplementation taken at recommended doses&#xD;
      [46-49]. Most controlled studies of creatine report an absence of side effects or report no&#xD;
      differences in the incidence of side effects between creatine and placebo [50]. Mihic and&#xD;
      colleagues (2000) have demonstrated that creatine loading increases fat-free mass, but does&#xD;
      not affect blood pressure or plasma creatinine in adult men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reports in the popular media of links between creatine use and muscle strains, muscle cramps,&#xD;
      heat intolerance, and other side effects are not supported by the medical literature [50].&#xD;
      Studies conducted in athletes and military personnel indicate a substantial safety level of&#xD;
      both short- and long-term creatine supplementation in healthy adults [51-56]. Concerns about&#xD;
      high-dose creatine's association with renal toxicity are based exclusively on two published&#xD;
      case reports; in one of the cases the patient had a documented pre-existing kidney condition&#xD;
      [57, 58]. Literature reviews and expert consensus panels have concluded there is no evidence&#xD;
      supporting an association between creatine and renal disease [59-62].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concern has been raised regarding creatine's potential for adverse effects on the kidneys and&#xD;
      renal system, in part because creatine supplementation can increase urinary creatine and&#xD;
      creatinine excretion [63]. In response to the concerns regarding creatine and renal toxicity,&#xD;
      Poortman's conducted studies of the effect of creatine supplementation on renal function,&#xD;
      showing that short-term supplementation does not alter glomerular filtration rate [47], and&#xD;
      that chronic supplementation of up to five years' duration did not impair renal function in&#xD;
      healthy athletes [49].&#xD;
&#xD;
      [64] conducted a retrospective study of participants who had been taking oral creatine from&#xD;
      0.8 to 4 years, at an average dose of 9.7 grams per day. Data was collected on 65&#xD;
      health-related variables. These included a complete blood count, 27 serum chemistries, and&#xD;
      anthropometric data including vital signs and % body fat. On all 65 variables, group means&#xD;
      fell within the normal clinical range. The authors concluded that that long-term creatine&#xD;
      supplementation does not result in adverse health effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence to date suggests that even aged, debilitated, medically fragile patients are able to&#xD;
      tolerate creatine supplementation. Bender and colleagues studied elderly patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease who had received either placebo or four grams/day of creatine for two&#xD;
      years. They found no differences between the creatine and placebo groups in laboratory&#xD;
      markers of renal dysfunction [65]. Interestingly, the participants who received creatine&#xD;
      performed better on the depression subscale of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale&#xD;
      [66].&#xD;
&#xD;
      No strong evidence exists linking creatine supplementation and gastrointestinal discomfort.&#xD;
      These reports remain anecdotal, as there are no documented reports of creatine over placebo&#xD;
      resulting in stomach concerns.&#xD;

      All procedures performed by study personnel are research-related, but will be performed in&#xD;
      addition to routine care (see Table 1). None of the study activities will be considered&#xD;
      standard of care. There will be no cost to study subjects for their participation.&#xD;
      Participants will be compensated for their time and travel. Study visits will be supervised&#xD;
      by a board-certified/board-eligible psychiatrist or psychiatry resident and will be conducted&#xD;
      either by a board-certified/board-eligible psychiatrist, psychiatry resident, or an at least&#xD;
      baccalaureate degree level research assistant with training in the specific measures used.&#xD;
      Laboratory and other study interpretation will be conducted by a&#xD;
      board-certified/board-eligible psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if an individual is eligible for study participation, a screening visit will be&#xD;
      conducted. Initially, a HAM-D17 will be administered to determine if the patient exhibits&#xD;
      depressive symptoms that are sufficiently severe for inclusion in the study. Next, the Mini&#xD;
      International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) will be administered to confirm a diagnosis&#xD;
      of a current major depressive episode. Study subjects will receive a baseline basic metabolic&#xD;
      panel (BMP) to assess for renal insufficiency, and vitals (these may have been obtained in&#xD;
      the course of ongoing clinical care). The QIDS, Antidepressant Treatment Response&#xD;
      Questionnaire (ATRQ), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Beck Suicide Scale (BSS), and a MoCA&#xD;
      will be administered. Each participant will be assessed for history of ECT therapy, current&#xD;
      medications, and any other medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once entered into the study, depressed subjects will be randomized to receive either creatine&#xD;
      or placebo using a random-digit method that is based on computer-generated numbers. Block&#xD;
      randomization created by Investigational Drug Services (IDS) will be used to ensure equal&#xD;
      treatment allocation within each block. 50% of the trial's clinical subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to placebo and the other 50% to active treatment. The study will be conducted as a&#xD;
      double-blind trial, with neither participants nor research staff aware of participant&#xD;
      assignment. Except in cases of medical emergency, the double-blind will not be &quot;broken&quot; until&#xD;
      recruitment is closed and the final participant has completed 6 weeks of treatment and 4&#xD;
      weeks of follow-up. The blind will be broken following the culmination of the study or at the&#xD;
      request of a medical professional dealing with a medical emergency in a case in which it&#xD;
      would help a study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Electroconvulsive Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from a population of patients who have already been referred&#xD;
      for ECT and who have had initial clinical assessments to determine whether ECT is indicated.&#xD;
      As this study is an add-on to standard clinical care only, routine ECT procedures will be&#xD;
      followed, though the ECT service (attending psychiatrist, anesthesiologist) will be notified&#xD;
      of subject participation. In general, subjects will, after being medically cleared for ECT&#xD;
      (psychiatric exam, physical exam, EKG, laboratory studies if indicated), received bifrontal&#xD;
      ECT every other day for between 6 and up to roughly 14 treatments, with a total duration of&#xD;
      treatment lasting between two and four weeks. Anesthesia for ECT is provided by a&#xD;
      board-certified anesthesiologist and comprises the use of methohexital, midazolam, etomidate,&#xD;
      or ketamine, as indicated, and at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Participants may&#xD;
      receive interventions designed to augment the likelihood of a seizure being achieved, such as&#xD;
      a caffeine infusion, hyperventilation, or other techniques, at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      ECT psychiatrist and anesthesiologist. After ECT, participants are monitored for recurrent&#xD;
      seizure/status epilepticus and for vital sign abnormalities for roughly thirty minutes, then&#xD;
      released to home (if outpatient) with 24 hour per day supervision by adult family members, or&#xD;
      else escorted back to the inpatient unit, where they again receive 24 hour per day&#xD;
      supervision by unit staff. Prior to each treatment, subjects complete a Quick Inventory of&#xD;
      Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) to assess their overall burden of depressive symptoms. The exact&#xD;
      duration of treatment/number of treatments is determined by the treating ECT psychiatrist,&#xD;
      based on clinical response. The study will record all pertinent variables related to ECT as&#xD;
      noted in the clinical record, including number of treatments, QIDS score, number of seizures&#xD;
      per treatment session, seizure duration, adverse effects, augmentation strategies, anesthesia&#xD;
      type, and vitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Drug Dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have been assigned to the creatine arm of the trial will receive a 20g&#xD;
      loading dose daily for 1 week starting as soon as possible before ECT begins and after&#xD;
      completion of the 31P-MRS; this will be administered in 4 divided doses of 5g each.&#xD;
      Participants will then receive 5 g creatine daily throughout the course of ECT therapy (~3&#xD;
      weeks), with continuation for an additional 2 weeks after the completion of the acute series&#xD;
      of ECT, again at 5g daily (thus, up to 5 weeks total supplementation with creating 5g per&#xD;
      day, depending on the length of ECT) Placebo recipients will receive an inert, relatively&#xD;
      tasteless powder matched to creatine (e.g., glucose). Creatine doses are based on doses that&#xD;
      have previously been shown to be safe and efficacious [67-69].&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to use the following for determining participant baseline and data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) (at baseline, the end of week 1, the end of&#xD;
           week 2, the end of week 3, and two weeks after completion of the ECT series)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) (at baseline and prior to each ECT&#xD;
           session)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ) (at baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) (at baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) illness improvement subscale (CGI-I) (at&#xD;
           baseline, week 1, week 2, week 3, and two weeks after completion of the ECT series)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beck Suicide Scale (BSS) at baseline, week 1, week 2, week 3, and two weeks after&#xD;
           completion of the ECT series)&#xD;

           after completion of the ECT series)&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Siemens 3T MRI system)&#xD;
&#xD;
                MRI scans will be conducted twice: after the baseline visit and prior to initiating&#xD;
                ECT, and following completion of the ECT series (i.e., after ~3 weeks, and during&#xD;
                the 2 week post-ECT follow-up period). The 3.0 Tesla Siemens Prisma whole-body&#xD;
                clinical scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) located within the&#xD;
                University Neuropsychiatric Institute (UNI) will be used to acquire this data.&#xD;
                Participants will first undergo a routine anatomic MRI protocol, which includes MRI&#xD;
                images acquired in the axial and coronal planes. Specifically, the anatomic scan&#xD;
                protocol consists of a T1 weighted structural scan (MP2RAGE), and double-echo T2&#xD;
                weighted scan, and a Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery scan (FLAIR). The purposes&#xD;
                of the MR anatomic screening session include screening subjects for gross&#xD;
                structural abnormalities and acquiring images for use in brain cortical thickness&#xD;
                measurements. Anatomic MRI examinations will be performed with Siemens 64 channel&#xD;
                head coil. After localization, anatomical imaging will be obtained using a&#xD;
                T1-weighted, sagittal oriented 3D-Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo&#xD;
                (MPRAGE) sequence (TR/TE/TI 5000/2.93/700 ms, matrix 256x256, FOV 256x256 mm, flip&#xD;
                angle 4 degree, slice thickness 1.0 mm, slab 176 mm, bandwidth 240 Hz/pixel). Axial&#xD;
                proton-density and T2 weighted images will be acquired to screen for brain&#xD;
                structural abnormalities using 2D Double echo T2 weighted turbo spin echo (TSE)&#xD;
                sequence (TR 7110 ms, TE 28/84 ms, FOV 240x210, slice thickness 3 mm, flip 150°,&#xD;
                bandwidth 179 Hz/pixel). FLAIR sequence (TR/TE/TI 8000/90/2500 ms, slice thickness&#xD;
                5 mm, FOV 240x168, voxel size 0.8x0.6x5.0 mm, bandwidth 200 Hz/pixel, turbo factor&#xD;
                13) will be used to detect juxtacortical-cortical lesions. All anatomic MRI images&#xD;
                will be read by a board-certified, CAQ neuroradiologist to screen for structural&#xD;
                abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Measurement of In-Vivo Brain Chemistry Using Phosphorus-31 Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
                Spectroscopy (31P-MRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                Phosphorus spectroscopy data will be acquired on the same Siemens 3T system. We aim&#xD;
                to keep the duration of each MRSI examination at or under 25 minutes. A 3D-MRSI&#xD;
                sequence with elliptically weighted phase-encoding will be used to collect 31P-MRSI&#xD;
                data to minimize T2 signal decay. Acquisition parameters will be: data matrix size&#xD;
                16x16x8; TR 2000 ms; tip-angle 90 degree for hard RF pulse; Rx bandwidth ±1 kHz;&#xD;
                complex-points 1024; readout duration 256 ms; pre-acquisition delay 0.3ms; FOV&#xD;
                240x240 mm2 ; 16 NEX.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Spectral Analysis of 31P-MRS Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spectroscopy will be analyzed using Liner Combination of Model Spectra (LCModel) [70], which&#xD;
      analyzes an in vivo spectrum as a linear combination of model in vitro spectra from&#xD;
      individual metabolite solutions. This model is fully automatic and user independent. A nearly&#xD;
      model-free constrained regularization method is used for convolution and baseline. For&#xD;
      quantification, absolute metabolite concentrations (institutional units) will be estimated&#xD;
      using the unsuppressed water signal as an internal concentration reference. Also, total&#xD;
      creatine levels will be used as a denominator for calculating the relative concentration for&#xD;
      the comparison with previous reports. The standard Siemens libraries of model metabolite&#xD;
      spectra provided with LCModel will be used in the basis set. The metabolites from the basis&#xD;
      set will include alanine, aspartate, creatine, gamma-amino butyric acid, glucose, glutamine,&#xD;
      glutamate, glycerophosphocholine, glutathione, myo-inositol, scyllo-inositol, lactate,&#xD;
      N-acetylaspartate, N-acetylaspartylglutamate, phosphocholine, phosphocreatine,&#xD;
      phosphoethanolamine, and taurine. For the reliability of detection, the Cramer-Rao lower&#xD;
      bounds (CRLB) will be determined: the acceptable upper limit of estimated standard deviations&#xD;
      will be set at 20% [71].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post processing of 31P-MRS data will be conducted using jMRUI software (jMRUI v. 4.0,&#xD;
      European Community) with the AMARES algorithm (Advanced Method for Accurate, Robust and&#xD;
      Efficient Spectral fitting of MRS data with use of prior knowledge). Before fitting the FID&#xD;
      (Free-induction-decay) data, a Hamming filter will be applied to reduce signal contamination&#xD;
      from neighboring voxels, with apodization of 10 Hz line broadening. Fourier transformation,&#xD;
      frequency shifts correction, and zero-order/first order phase correction as well as baseline&#xD;
      correction will be applied. The structural image-processing tool FSL (FMRIB Software Library,&#xD;
      Release 4.1, University of Oxford) will be used to account for gray matter, white matter, and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in order to correct the partial volume effects on metabolite&#xD;
      concentrations. The MRS grid will be positioned over the images in an identical fashion&#xD;
      between baseline and treatment scans for each participant. The peak area for each 31P-MRS&#xD;
      metabolite will be calculated as a percentage of the total phosphorus signal.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with moderate to severe symptoms&#xD;
        will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either ECT with creatine augmentation or ECT&#xD;
        with placebo augmentation or 6 weeks. Individuals must meet criteria for major depressive&#xD;
        episode for a duration of at least 2 months in order to participate. Participants must be&#xD;
        greater than 18 years of age and considered to be a good candidate for ECT based on&#xD;
        clinical assessment. Individuals who are pregnant or breast-feeding or who possess any&#xD;
        other contraindication to ECT will not be invited to participate. Participants can receive&#xD;
        ECT treatments in either inpatient or outpatient setting at the University Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
        Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who meet diagnostic criteria for other psychiatric conditions apart from major&#xD;
        depressive disorder (including Bipolar I, Bipolar II, or personality disorders) will not be&#xD;
        invited to participate. Individuals with substance use disorders will be excluded because&#xD;
        substance use disorders typically confound the diagnosis of depression and can contribute&#xD;
        to treatment resistance. Individuals will not be considered for study participation if they&#xD;
        have renal disease because to date it cannot definitively be stated if short and long-term&#xD;
        creatine usage is or is not harmful to the kidneys. Appropriate renal function will be&#xD;
        determined based on normal creatinine clearance, determined by routine laboratory work&#xD;
        (basic metabolic panel).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who are already undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial&#xD;
        magnetic stimulation (TMS) for the treatment of depression, or who have completed a course&#xD;
        of ECT within a month of the baseline visit, will not be invited to participate given the&#xD;
        possibility of confounding treatment effects as well as increased seizure risk. Individuals&#xD;
        currently undergoing psychotherapy remain eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who have implanted ferromagnetic hardware, implanted electronic devices, or&#xD;
        retained ferromagnetic materials from surgery or injuries will not be invited to&#xD;
        participate as these represent contraindications to MRI. Likewise, individuals who are&#xD;
        unable to tolerate confinement in the MRI scanner will not be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who lack capacity to consent to treatment or to participate in the study will&#xD;
        be excluded. Patients who are hospitalized involuntarily will also be excluded. Individuals&#xD;
        demonstrating active psychosis or any other clinical characteristic making them&#xD;
        inappropriate candidates for treatment will be excluded. Patients with pre-existing&#xD;
        neurologic condition, any major neurocognitive disorder, or known traumatic brain injury&#xD;
        will not be invited to participate.&#xD;
