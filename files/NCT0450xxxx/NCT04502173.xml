  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this implementation research study is to generate evidence that informs the&#xD;
      successful uptake and adoption of the Ellavi Uterine Balloon Tamponade (UBT) within Kenyan&#xD;
      postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) management programs. The investigators aim to improve the&#xD;
      likelihood that the Ellavi UBT will be integrated into the Kenyan health care system by&#xD;
      obtaining critical feedback from stakeholders and health care providers on the barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators towards its successful adoption and roll out. The research will be done in three&#xD;
      purposively selected University of Nairobi affiliated hospitals in Nairobi county, Kenya.&#xD;
      This study will therefore be exploratory and use a non-experimental design. The study team&#xD;
      will train all obstetric healthcare staff (i.e. obstetricians, midwives, medical officers,&#xD;
      clinical officers) involved in PPH management at the participating healthcare facilities on&#xD;
      use of the Ellavi UBT. The investigators will then gather feedback from the obstetric&#xD;
      healthcare workers (post-training and post-PPH) to understand the barriers to and&#xD;
      facilitators of use in order to evaluate acceptability and feasibility among facilities&#xD;
      providing different levels of care (level 4, level 5 (county), level 6 (tertiary)). This&#xD;
      process will help to generate training and facility level recommendations for improved uptake&#xD;
      and integration into the local maternal care package. Case report forms and semi-quantitative&#xD;
      surveys will be completed by obstetrical care providers to evaluate the primary outcomes of&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility by measuring: context of use, accuracy of use, perceptions of&#xD;
      the device, user confidence, acceptability, usability, facilitators of use, barriers to use,&#xD;
      use-patterns, and insights into training effectiveness. The secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      financial data to determine the cost of introducing the Ellavi UBT into the Kenyan PPH&#xD;
      management protocols and the health system. The study will not involve the storage of&#xD;
      biological samples. There is not a direct benefit of the study to the individual&#xD;
      participants. All study participants will sign consent forms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this implementation research study is to generate evidence that informs the&#xD;
      successful uptake and adoption of the Ellavi UBT within Kenyan MOH PPH management programs&#xD;
      for both public and private sector programs. The investigators aim to generate evidence for&#xD;
      Kenyan stakeholders to use in their decision-making around the use of Ellavi UBT in Kenyan&#xD;
      PPH management programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the adoption, penetration, sustainability and fidelity of implementing the&#xD;
           Ellavi UBT device into PPH care in three health care facilities (2 public facilities, 1&#xD;
           private facility). The investigators will explore the number of health workers and&#xD;
           facilities that receive the PPH and Ellavi UBT training, and percent of health workers&#xD;
           and facilities that adopt the Ellavi UBT device over the 6-month period. The&#xD;
           investigators will also assess factors that influence the adoption, penetration,&#xD;
           sustainability, and fidelity through an operations research survey, and the Ellavi UBT&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the appropriateness, acceptability and feasibility of using the Ellavi UBT&#xD;
           in participating health facilities at various levels of care in Nairobi County, the&#xD;
           investigators will explore user comprehension of the Ellavi UBT usage steps, accuracy of&#xD;
           use, perceptions of the device, attitudes towards the device, user confidence,&#xD;
           usability, facilitators of use, barriers to use, use-patterns, and insights into&#xD;
           training effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Sensitize senior management at each of the three participating facilities,&#xD;
                separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Conduct two half-day trainings on PPH and Ellavi UBT use at each of the three&#xD;
                participating health facilities separated by: 1) obstetricians, medical and&#xD;
                clinical officers, and 2) midwives.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Collect individual initial (post-training) data to assess comprehension of Ellavi&#xD;
                UBT usage steps, perceptions of the device, attitudes towards the device, user&#xD;
                confidence, usability, and insights into training effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Case Management Form (CMF): Obstetrical care provider will complete a CMF within&#xD;
                24hrs (&lt;24hrs) of managing each PPH event. This will inform the study team of how&#xD;
                decision-making algorithms were applied and accuracy of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Ellavi UBT Questionnaire: PATH-Kenya study team member will collect individual post&#xD;
                (post-usage) Ellavi UBT use data (&lt;72hrs) from each study participant (obstetrical&#xD;
                care worker) to assess comprehension of Ellavi UBT usage steps, perceptions of the&#xD;
                device, attitudes towards the device, user confidence, usability, facilitators of&#xD;
                use, barriers to use, use-patterns, and insights into training effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. PATH-Kenya study staff will record secondary data from hospital registry books over&#xD;
                the six (6) month duration of this study (March - August 2020) in comparison to the&#xD;
                same six (6) month period in 2019 to examine changes in use of condom catheters,&#xD;
                and Ellavi UBTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to identify&#xD;
                constructs with the potential to influence the introduction and use of Ellavi UBT.&#xD;
                These constructs will be mapped to questions in the questionnaire, and will be&#xD;
                analyzed to identify their influence on Ellavi UBT use. Constructs that have&#xD;
                influence on the implementation of UBTs (both positively and negatively) will be&#xD;
                disseminated for use in future introduction and scale up of Ellavi UBTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the cost of introducing the Ellavi UBT into the PPH management protocol and&#xD;
           health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Estimate the costs of the different obstetrical care provider training components.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Estimate the costs for other country-level activities associated with the&#xD;
                introduction of the UBT into the PPH management protocols such as costs for&#xD;
                meetings, advocacy, and communication materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Qualitatively evaluate the frequency and duration of stock outs of condoms,&#xD;
                catheters, IV fluids (sterilized materials), and sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Estimate the costs of staff time spent on assembling a condom catheter UBT and the&#xD;
                costs of supplies used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To disseminate the information in national (KOGS), regional (ECSACOG, AFOG), and&#xD;
           international forums to support information sharing, increased awareness of the role of&#xD;
           UBT for refractory PPH, and adoption of its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
           e. Summarize how the Ellavi UBT can be integrated into curriculums, guidelines, and&#xD;
           hospital systems (e.g. patient-provider friendly materials) by analyzing the key&#xD;
           facilitators and barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           f. Host a national level meeting with Kenyan MOH stakeholders and participating&#xD;
           facilities g. Publish and disseminate findings in a peer-reviewed journal h. Present at&#xD;
           international conferences and forums, as funding permits. Show the use of Ellavi UBT&#xD;
           using poster presentations and demonstration sessions at international obstetrics&#xD;
           meetings: FIGO, WHO UBT group, Women Deliver as funding permits.&#xD;
