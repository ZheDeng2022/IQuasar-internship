  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic urothelial carcinoma is lethal and has no cure. Response rates to current&#xD;
      treatments are modest. Researchers want to find new strategies to treat the disease. In this&#xD;
      study, they will test a drug called M7824. The drug is a new immunotherapy that blocks the&#xD;
      pathways that cancer cells use to stop the immune system from fighting cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if M7824 can help the immune system s ability to fight urothelial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 18 and older who have urothelial cancer that has spread to other parts of their&#xD;
      body and they have been previously treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have blood&#xD;
      and urine tests. They will have imaging scans. They will have an electrocardiogram to measure&#xD;
      heart function. Their ability to perform their normal activities will be evaluated. They may&#xD;
      have a tumor biopsy. They will take a pregnancy test if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat some of the screening tests during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be given in a series of 28-day cycles. Participants will get M7824 once every&#xD;
      2 weeks. It is given through an intravenous infusion. For this, a small plastic tube is put&#xD;
      into an arm vein. They will get M7824 until their disease gets worse, they have unacceptable&#xD;
      side effects, or they decide to stop treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after treatment ends. Then they will be&#xD;
      followed every 12 weeks in the clinic or by telephone/email. Follow-up will last&#xD;
      indefinitely.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic urothelial carcinoma is lethal and incurable with a median overall survival&#xD;
           of 14 months from diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have greatly changed&#xD;
           clinical management of metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) improving survival by 3&#xD;
           months in the second-line setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Five PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are FDA-approved for for second-line mUC, two agents for&#xD;
           first-line cisplatin-ineligible mUC. However, response rates are modest, ranging&#xD;
           from15-20% in the second-line and 24% in the first-line cisplatin-ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therefore, novel strategies are needed to extend benefit of immunotherapy to the&#xD;
           remaining approximately 75% of non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Higher levels of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) are associated with immune&#xD;
           escape, therapy resistance and poor outcomes in advanced malignancies. Non-responders to&#xD;
           anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies have also been found to have increased TGF-beta in the tumor&#xD;
           microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bintrafusp alfa (M7824) is a novel first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein composed&#xD;
           of a monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 fused to the extracellular domain of human&#xD;
           TGF-beta receptor II (TGFbetaRII), which effectively functions to sequester or &quot;trap&quot;&#xD;
           all three TGF-beta isoforms. A phase I study of M7824 (NCT02517398) demonstrated a&#xD;
           manageable safety profile and clinical efficacy among patients with heavily pre-treated&#xD;
           advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that M7824 is safe and improves outcomes in patients with checkpoint&#xD;
           naive or refractory urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the activity of M7824 as determined by objective response rate (ORR) in two&#xD;
      metastatic urothelial carcinoma cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Checkpoint inhibitor naive&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 1A: cisplatin ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 1B: refractory post-platinum therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Checkpoint inhibitor previously treated patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 2A: previously achieved a CR/PR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 2B: previously had SD/PD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic urothelial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may have been previously treated with prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen or&#xD;
           targeted agent. Patients may have received any number of prior cytotoxic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an open label, non-randomized, single arm phase II trial of M7824 in checkpoint&#xD;
           inhibitor naive and previously treated patients with urothelial carcinoma of the&#xD;
           bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  M7824 (intravenous 1200 mg fixed dose) will be delivered every 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive treatment in cycles consisting of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A maximum of 75 subjects will be enrolled in this trial.&#xD;
