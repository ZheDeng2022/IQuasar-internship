  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS), also known as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), is an&#xD;
      immune mediated life-threatening disease. There is no uniform recommendation for salvage&#xD;
      treatment of HLH. Based on the results of current clinical trials, the marketing situation of&#xD;
      the drug in China, and the use requirements of pegylated recombinant human granulocyte&#xD;
      stimulating factor(PEG-rhG-CSF), this study was conducted in patients who received the DEP&#xD;
      rescue therapy or dexamethasone combined with VP-16 maintenance therapy. The aim of this&#xD;
      study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PEG-rhG-CSF(Jinyouli®) for the recovery of&#xD;
      neutropenia after chemotherapy in patients with hemophagocytic syndrome.&#xD;

    <description>PEG-rhG-CSF is a sustained-duration form of rhG-CSF, a recombinant methionyl form of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), similar to rhG-CSF, PEG-rhG-CSF increases the proliferation and differentiation of neutrophils from committed progenitor cells, induces maturation, and enhances the survival and function of mature neutrophils, resulting in dose-dependent increases in neutrophils.</description>
