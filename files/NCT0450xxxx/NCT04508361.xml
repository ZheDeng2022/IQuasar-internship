  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to see if people's health related quality of life (how they feel about their&#xD;
      health) changes over a 12 week period if they do not receive any change in their medicines.&#xD;
      The investigators would like people to complete four questionnaires then repeat them after&#xD;
      three months. The investigators need to do this to in order see what difference they should&#xD;
      expect to detect if they give people treatment that works.&#xD;

      Study Design This will be a questionnaire study, which will involve administering&#xD;
      questionnaires to patients with sarcoidosis at baseline and after six and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can either complete the questionnaires whilst they are attending clinic, or&#xD;
      alternatively return the questionnaires via a pre-paid postal envelope. The questionnaires&#xD;
      will be administered at the same time; no other study measures will be taken subsequently.&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical information will be collected from the patients' medical records.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) - ranges from 10 to 50 with higher values representing greater fatigue. There are a specified cut-off values for clinically significant fatigue (score &gt;= 22) and severe fatigue (score &gt;= 35).The questionaire was administered at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form 36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form 36 (SF-36) -ranges between 0 (maximum disability) and 100 (no disability). The SF36 score can be converted to utility scores using values within the questionnaire. The questionaire was administered at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kings' Sarcoidosis Questionnaire (KSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Kings' Sarcoidosis Questionnaire (KSQ) ranges between 0 and 100 with higher numbers representing better health. The questionaire was administered at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global rating of concept scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Global rating of concept scale. This is a ranking between 6 options to rate overall quality of life from no problem to very severe problem. The questionaire was administered at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The global rating of change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from 6 weeks to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The global rating of change. This is a scoring out of 15 options to rate change in quality of life. It ranges between -7 and 7 with positive values representing an improvement. The questionaire was administered at 6 weeks and 12 weeks.</description>
