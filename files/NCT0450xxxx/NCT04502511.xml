  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: There is large heterogeneity in disease states of critically ill patients at ICU&#xD;
      admittance and there is also large heterogeneity in their disease severity during ICU stay.&#xD;
      Still, some patients may show remarkable similarities in disease patterns. There is a lack of&#xD;
      understanding of causal mechanisms that lead to divergent outcomes in critically ill&#xD;
      patients, and at the same time different diseases may share common underlying, yet&#xD;
      unidentified, causal pathways that could explain similarities between different diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To explore the association between patient characteristics and the severity of&#xD;
      organ failure in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU Study design: Prospective cohort&#xD;
      study Study population: Adult critically ill patients in the ICU Intervention (if&#xD;
      applicable): not applicable Main study parameters/endpoints: Maximum severity of organ&#xD;
      failure observed during ICU stay measured by the maximum SOFA score and quality of life at&#xD;
      one year follow-up&#xD;

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: &lt;All patients will undergo physical examination, including ultrasound evaluation&#xD;
      upon ICU admission according to standard practice care. The burden will be a blood sample&#xD;
      (and urine sample) at admission. Blood sample will be obtained by arterial line (or venous&#xD;
      access) which is part of standard ICU care. So there will be no additional puncture for this&#xD;
      study. Collection of variables during ICU stay will all be either part of standard clinical&#xD;
      care or include extra physical examination or ultrasound evaluation. For follow-up patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated by phone at 6 months and at 12 months by home-visit. This is also already&#xD;
      part of the investigator's evaluation of quality of care. Except for blood sampling, all&#xD;
      study related procedures have previously been approved by the Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      (IRB). The patient will experience no individual benefit.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 and 12 months after ICU discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be evaluated by questionnaires at 6 and 12 months follow-up.Follow-up data will include survival status and data on quality of life.&#xD;
Patients psychological functioning will be evaluated using the Short Form 20 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).&#xD;
Patients physical functioning data will be measured by the KATZ ADL index and the Clinical Frailty Score. In addition, the Euro-Qol (EQ-5d) will be used.&#xD;
Social functioning data will be collected using the General Functioning 6 scale (GF6) which is a subscale of the GF12 and is a quick and effective tool to assess the overall functioning of families. Data will be collected from both patients and family members. Return to work will only be evaluated at 12 months follow-up by 4 extra questions concerning the patients return to work.&#xD;
In addition we will explore and validate extended modifications on the total and domain level of the organ failure assessment score (SOFA+).</description>
