  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study to provide continued supply of parsaclisib&#xD;
      as monotherapy or in combination therapy with itacitinib to participants from&#xD;
      Incyte-sponsored studies of parsaclisib.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide continued use of parsaclisib as monotherapy or in&#xD;
      combination with itacitinib to participants who are currently enrolled in an Incyte-sponsored&#xD;
      study and receiving the same treatment, who have at least stable disease, who are obtaining&#xD;
      clinical benefit (in the opinion of the investigator) on the current study treatment, as&#xD;
      defined by the parent Protocol, and who are unable to access parsaclisib as monotherapy or in&#xD;
      combination with itacitinib outside a clinical study.Participants will continue on the same&#xD;
      dose and schedule as the ones being administered in the Incyte-sponsored parent Protocol at&#xD;
      the time of the rollover. The study will collect and assess safety information with regards&#xD;
      to AEs.&#xD;
