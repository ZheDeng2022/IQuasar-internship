      The aim of this randomized controlled study determine the efficacy of calorie restriction&#xD;
      intermittent fasting diet in metabolic parameters and weight management among metabolic&#xD;
      syndromes adults. It was done on metabolic syndrome patients, aged 18-65 years at an academic&#xD;
      institution in Istanbul,Turkey. Subjects were divided into two groups; IER (Intermittent&#xD;
      Energy Restriction-intervention group, calori restriction of 300-500kcal/d combined with 16:8&#xD;
      model Intermittent Fasting) and CER (Countinous Energy Restriction- control group continous&#xD;
      restriction of 300-500kcal/d). Assessment was ascertained at baseline and 12 weeks. Blood&#xD;
      samples were analyzed for lipid profile, fasting plasma glucose, ınsulin, HOMA-IR. Blood&#xD;
      pressure and body composition were evaluated.&#xD;

      Aim The aim of this study; determine the efficacy of calorie restriction intermittent fasting&#xD;
      diet in metabolic parameters and weight management among metabolic syndromes adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Participants who referred by clinician, as medical doctors after physical assesment&#xD;
      selected in this study were recruited among patients with metabolic syndrome referring to the&#xD;
      diet clinic local in Turkey. The criteria of inclusion were metabolic syndrome patients, aged&#xD;
      18-65 years had body mass index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m2 with no history of mental or physical&#xD;
      disabilities.Subjects should also not be practicing Muslim Ramadan fasting or had changed&#xD;
      their dietary pattern 12 weeks before the study. Eligible subjects were approached to&#xD;
      participate. Only those who agreed to participate were explained of all the information&#xD;
      pertaining to this study and were consented. This study was approved by Istanbul Medipol&#xD;
      University Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The aim of A randomized controlled study was carried out to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of calorie restriction intermittent fasting diet in metabolic parameters and weight&#xD;
      management among metabolic syndromes adults. Subjects were randomly assigned into two groups;&#xD;
      intervention IER (Intermittent Energy Restriction) and control CER (Continuous Energy&#xD;
      Restriction). Randomization, first participant assigned IER group an each eligible&#xD;
      participant was randomly assigned to either CER group or IER group. Those who were assigned&#xD;
      to two groups needed to adhere dietary regime, with a reduction of 300-500kcal/d from the&#xD;
      habitual energy intake for 12 weeks intervention period. Diet menus were prepared taking into&#xD;
      account the individual characteristics. IER participants abide by intermittent fasting which&#xD;
      time restricted 16:8 model diet. During 16 hours; such as at 04.00 pm- 08.00 am or 05.00 pm -&#xD;
      09.00 am or 07.00 pm - 11.00 am fasting hours, no food and calorie drink. But participants in&#xD;
      fasting hours can drink water, sugar free tea and mineral water, coffee without sauce. On the&#xD;
      other 8 hours, need to adhere energy restriction diet. Subjects were also provided with&#xD;
      seven-day food menu guidelines. Those who were assigned to two groups need to maintain their&#xD;
      present lifestyle. Analysis was carried out at two time points: baseline and week 12. In&#xD;
      order to ensure good compliance, subjects were contacted once a week via telephone calls.&#xD;
      Food diaries and were fasting log book presumed to the participants during each assessment&#xD;
      meeting. Subjects were given detailed instruction verbally and a reference guide on how to&#xD;
      fill up the food diaries and fasting log. Individual and group counseling were provided&#xD;
      before and during the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition, Blood Pressure, Biochemical markers Height was measured using SECA-213&#xD;
      portable stadiometer (SECA, Hamburg, Germany). Body composition was measured using TANITA&#xD;
      SC-330, body composition analyzer (TANITA Corp. Tokyo, Japan). All measurements were made in&#xD;
      the morning at participants fasted state. This instrument was calibrated each time before&#xD;
      measurement. Data from this instrument including body weight, BMI, body fat percentage, fat&#xD;
      mass, fat free mass and total body water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as; BMI [kg/m2]= Weight[kg] / (Height[m] x Height[m])&#xD;
      Waist circumference was measured by the same dietician with the help of a standard&#xD;
      unstretched tape measure. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured using an automatic&#xD;
      oscillometric device (Omron M2 Basic, Japanese) after participants had rested in a seated&#xD;
      position for 5 min. A blood sample was drawn at baseline and after 12 weeks. Insulin&#xD;
      resistance was estimated with the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) and calculated as;&#xD;
      HOMA-IR= (Fasting plasma glucose [mg/dL] x Serum insulin [IU/L]) / 405&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical markers blood lipids, fasting plasma glucose and Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were&#xD;
      performed with standard methods. Serum concentrations of insulin were measured by&#xD;
      immunonephelometric methods. Adverse events were monitored by standardized questionnaires,&#xD;
      diary and at the last study visit by interview.&#xD;
