      Combined Phase II/III, multi-center, prospective, single-blinded trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten (10) patients with who previously underwent successful and uncomplicated MRgFUS&#xD;
      thalamotomy for essential tremor will undergo a contralateral treatment. The incidence of&#xD;
      side effects will be determined at 1 and 3 months postoperatively, graded per the CTCAE v5&#xD;
      and analyzed by a data safety monitoring board. Upon successful review, this Phase II trial&#xD;
      will be converted to a Phase III trial of utility that will enrol 40 additional patients. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be the change in QUEST score at 12 months postoperatively, as well as a&#xD;
      patient-reported assessment of Health Utility. Secondary outcomes will include objective&#xD;
      tremor, gait and speech assessments (filmed and scored by blinded evaluators), as well as&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires and adverse events questionnaires. Outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      immediately after the procedure, as well as 1, 3, 12, 24 and 36 months post-operatively.&#xD;
