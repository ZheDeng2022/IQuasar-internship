    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a type of heart disease that leads to need of admissions to the&#xD;
      hospital during worsening of symptoms. These admissions are expensive and very inconvenient&#xD;
      for patients. The investigators have previously shown that monitoring of patients with a&#xD;
      using a small wearable sensor combined with a mathematical model can detect worsening of HF&#xD;
      before the patient needs medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will test whether the remote monitoring and prediction of HF&#xD;
      worsening can be used to find out when patients are at risk, change their treatment and avoid&#xD;
      a hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 240 Veterans with HF and randomly assign half of them to monitoring and&#xD;
      communication of the information on HF worsening to their medical teams. The investigators&#xD;
      hope to find our how to best use this approach in routine care of HF. The investigators also&#xD;
      plan to determine if this approach will indeed led to less admissions to the hospital among&#xD;
      these patients, shorter hospital stays and better quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) represents a major health burden, with 80% of the HF health care costs&#xD;
      attributable to hospitalizations. In a pilot multicenter study funded by the VA Center for&#xD;
      Innovation, the investigators demonstrated that multivariate physiological telemetry using a&#xD;
      small wearable sensor has a high compliance rate and provides accurate early detection of&#xD;
      impending readmission for HF. In this study the investigators will implement non-invasive&#xD;
      remote monitoring within the VA system and perform a feasibility evaluation of the&#xD;
      intervention and its programmatic effectiveness after implementation. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      the implementation of this program will be feasible and acceptable to clinicians working in&#xD;
      VA HF clinics. The investigators also hypothesize that algorithmic response to an alert&#xD;
      generated by the predictive algorithm using a continuous stream of remote monitoring data&#xD;
      will be feasible and provide the basis for further testing of this approach to decrease the&#xD;
      risk of hospitalization for HF and improve other key clinical outcomes. The specific aims of&#xD;
      our study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Implement remote monitoring into the clinical workflow of HF care. Aim 1a. Design&#xD;
      implementation strategies for non-invasive remote monitoring and algorithmic response to&#xD;
      clinical alerts generated by the predictive analytics platform. In HF programs at five VA&#xD;
      medical centers, eligible patients will be enrolled at the time of hospital discharge for HF&#xD;
      exacerbation and receive a wearable monitor and a smartphone with cellular service. Data&#xD;
      continuously uploaded to a secure server will be analyzed by the predictive analytics&#xD;
      algorithm and a clinical alert will be generated when physiological derangements correlated&#xD;
      with impending HF exacerbation are identified. A clinical response algorithm will provide&#xD;
      instructions for management response to the alert, to include medication changes and/or&#xD;
      urgent/non-urgent outpatient assessment. The intervention will include electronic health&#xD;
      record integration. The investigators will design implementation processes for this program&#xD;
      using the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services&#xD;
      (i-PARiHS) framework, adapted for the VA QUERI. The investigators will design 3 phases of&#xD;
      implementation: 1) implementation intervention planning through workflow analysis, technology&#xD;
      assessments, and recipient/stakeholder interviews; 2) formative evaluation of pilot&#xD;
      implementation at two vanguard sites to test initial acceptability, reliability, and&#xD;
      equipment performance; and 3) implementation fidelity monitoring by assessing consistency,&#xD;
      safety and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1b. Evaluate implementation outcomes, including clinician and patient perceptions and&#xD;
      adoption of the use of ambulatory remote monitoring data. The investigators will use both&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative research methods to examine the eight core dimensions of&#xD;
      implementation outcomes. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews will be done to assess&#xD;
      clinician and patient perceptions of acceptability and feasibility. Adoption behaviors will&#xD;
      be tracked including alert response rates and appropriateness of decisions. Fidelity of&#xD;
      implementation will be monitored by assessing compliance with all aspects of the study&#xD;
      protocol. Penetration and sustainability will be evaluated by assessing variation in&#xD;
      implementation outcomes across the five study sites as well as participant perceptions from&#xD;
      the qualitative work at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Conduct a feasibility study of non-invasive remote monitoring in chronic HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2a. Define key characteristics that will inform design of a pivotal trial of non-invasive&#xD;
      remote monitoring aimed at reducing rehospitalization and improving quality of life in HF.&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 240 patients hospitalized for HF exacerbation. At enrollment,&#xD;
      subjects will undergo 1:1 randomization to intervention or control arm. While all study&#xD;
      subjects will use the monitoring device for 90 days after discharge, in the intervention arm,&#xD;
      clinicians will be notified of clinical alerts and will follow the response algorithm to&#xD;
      modify HF treatment and/or recommend urgent clinic visit/emergency room visit. In the control&#xD;
      arm, information from the sensor will be collected, but clinical alerts will not be generated&#xD;
      or communicated to providers. The main study outcomes will include the proportion of&#xD;
      randomized patients who meet the algorithm's criteria for at least one alert, the proportion&#xD;
      of time the remote monitor is in use and functioning properly, HF hospitalization rate,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, and health-related quality of life. Implementation factors&#xD;
      identified in Aim 1 will help clarify the results of this aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2b. Identify costs associated with implementation and clinical use of non-invasive remote&#xD;
      monitoring in HF. Correct classification of costs associated with implementation of&#xD;
      non-invasive remote monitoring will set the stage for cost-effectiveness analyses in a future&#xD;
      pivotal trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in technology and in machine learning provide an opportunity for processing&#xD;
      of new sources of real-time patient-level data to generate clinically actionable information.&#xD;
      An important knowledge gap is how to best implement this technology-based approach into&#xD;
      clinical practice. Our study addresses this critical question of clinical implementation, and&#xD;
      will generate feasibility data for a design of a pivotal clinical trial of non-invasive&#xD;
      remote monitoring with predictive analytics during the high-risk period after hospital&#xD;
      discharge. This work has potential to result in changes to care of Veterans with HF and other&#xD;
      chronic health conditions.&#xD;
