  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information regarding the use of a new type of&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) called theta burst stimulation (TBS) for suicidal&#xD;
      ideation in adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The investigators hope to learn&#xD;
      if this TMS treatment improves suicidal ideation over 10 days and clinical outcomes over 1&#xD;
      year of follow-up.&#xD;

      The proposed study will examine sequential bilateral accelerated theta burst stimulation&#xD;
      (aTBS). Three sessions are administered daily for 10 days (5 days per week). During each&#xD;
      session continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) in which 1800 pulses are delivered&#xD;
      continuously over 120 seconds to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (RDPFC) is&#xD;
      administered first, followed by iTBS in which 1800 pulses are delivered in 2 second bursts,&#xD;
      repeated every 10 seconds for 570 seconds (1800 pulses) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (LDPFC). The theta burst stimulation (TBS) parameters were adopted from prior work,&#xD;
      with 3-pulse 50 Hz bursts given every 200 ms (at 5 Hz) with an intensity of 80% of active&#xD;
      motor threshold. The comparison group will receive 3 daily sessions of bilateral sham TBS&#xD;
      treatment for 10 days. Subjects in both groups will take part in a daily psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      treatment program.&#xD;

      The study will enroll outpatient and inpatient adolescents (aged 12-18 years) with Major&#xD;
      Depressive Disorder (MDD) of at least moderate severity defined as a Children's Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale Revised (CDRS-R) Score of 40 or greater and suicidal ideation defined as a score&#xD;
      of 3 or greater on item 13 (Suicidal Ideation) of the CDRS-R.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The use of the MagVenture Cool-B70 A/P coils facilitates blinding of the operator and subjects receiving aTBS or sham treatments. The study team members completing clinical rating scales will also not be allowed in the treatment suite during TBS treatment sessions and will be blinded to treatment assignment. A pre-post treatment expectancy and experience form will ask subjects and parents to make a guess regarding treatment arm (active or sham). Blinded study team members will also be asked to guess treatment assignments for each subject.</masking_description>

The device consists of a magnetic stimulator, MagPro X100 and a magnetic coil used for MT determination, C-B70 and a treatment coil, the Cool-B70 A/P coil. The A/P version of the coil, contains both an active site (A) and a sham (P) site. The magnetic field properties on the active site are identical to that of the standard Cool-B70 coil, cleared for iTBS treatment.</description>
