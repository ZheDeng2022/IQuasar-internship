  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypopharyngeal cancer is an important part of head and neck cancer, with more than 80,000 new&#xD;
      cases in 2018. And it is a highly aggressive cancer often diagnosed at an advanced stage.&#xD;
      which expresses poor survival, the 5-year overall survival (OS) is about only 30%-35%. Given&#xD;
      the complexity of these tumors, their surrounding structures, the frequent comorbidities, and&#xD;
      the improvement of patients' requirements for quality of life, a multidisciplinary treatment&#xD;
      approach should be applied to achieve the best oncological outcomes and to improve functional&#xD;
      results. This benefi t of induction chemotherapy has been recorded in patients with both&#xD;
      resectable and unresectable disease. It has also been observed in patients with laryngeal&#xD;
      cancer treated for organ preservation. However, whether the addition of induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy to chemoradiotherapy improves efficacy compared with chemoradiotherapy alone is&#xD;
      unclear in hypopharyngeal cancer.We tried to observe the clinical treatment efficiency, toxic&#xD;
      and side effects, progression-free survival time, overall survival time and quality of life&#xD;
      of anlotinib in the treatment of patients with refractory head and neck carcinoma. Provide&#xD;
      patients with a more optimal treatment plan and improve survival.&#xD;

      We will prospectively collect 160 patients who were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to&#xD;
      receive either induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (group A) or&#xD;
      definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (group B). Data will be stored in a private database.&#xD;
      The process of data collection will be supervised and regular data examination will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
