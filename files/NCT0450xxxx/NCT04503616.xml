  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label, optimal 2-stage Simon design phase Ib-II clinical trial.&#xD;
      Adult patients with hematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic HSCT from first- or&#xD;
      second-degree haploidentical donor are eligible for the study if they meet the standard&#xD;
      criteria defined in our institutional standard operation procedures (SOPs), meet all&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, and do not satisfy any exclusion criteria. Patients will receive&#xD;
      non-myeloablative, reduced-intensity or myeloablative conditioning regimen followed by&#xD;
      peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells. Patients will receive cyclophosphamide, abatacept,&#xD;
      and short-duration tacrolimus for GvHD prophylaxis.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Grade II-IV acute GvHD by day +120</measure>
    <time_frame>120 days</time_frame>
    <description>The first day of acute GvHD of any grade will be used to calculate the cumulative incidence for that grade (e.g., onset of grade III 70 days post-transplant - time to grade III is 70 days). This end point will be evaluated through day +120 post-transplant. The diagnosis of acute GvHD is based on clinical and pathological evaluation by the principal investigator in collaboration with the treating physician.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of Chronic GvHD</measure>
    <time_frame>365 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The first day of chronic GvHD will be used to calculate the cumulative incidence of chronic GvHD. This endpoint will be evaluated through day +365 post-transplant.&#xD;
Based on the organ scoring the severity of cGVHD is defined as follows:&#xD;
Mild cGVHD: involvement of 1-2 organs with maximum scores of 1 in all affected organs or sites.&#xD;
Moderate cGVHD: 1. involvement of 1-2 organ involvement with a maximum score of 2 in any affected organ or site (except for lungs). 2. involvement of 3 or more organs with maximum score of 1 in all affected organs or sites.&#xD;
Severe cGVHD: a lung score of 2 or a score 3 in any organ or site.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Primary graft failure</measure>
    <time_frame>45 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Graft failure is defined as failure to achieve neutrophil engraftment by day +28 or lack of donor chimerism &gt; 50% by day 45, not due to the underlying malignancy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Poor graft function</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of secondary graft failure</measure>
    <time_frame>730 Days</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relapse rate</measure>
    <time_frame>730 Days</time_frame>
    <description>evaluated to day +730 and is considered the date in which the disease for which transplant is performed is evident by methods of disease detection.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>GvHD and relapse-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>730 Days</time_frame>
    <description>evaluated to day +730 and considers the number of participants that are without reported grade III-IV acute GvHD, chronic GvHD requiring systemic therapy and have not experienced relapse or death.</description>
