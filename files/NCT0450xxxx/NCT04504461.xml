    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair has become one of the elective techniques, attributing&#xD;
      the advantages of minimally invasive procedures to it. However, the high costs related to the&#xD;
      need for hospitalization and materials make them a limitation at the time of its indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to evaluate the feasibility of performing this procedure in an outpatient&#xD;
      surgery center and the cost analysis of an outpatient procedure regarding the same in the&#xD;
      setting of hospitalization.&#xD;

      A retrospective analysis was performed on a prospective database in which all patients older&#xD;
      than 18 years were included, in which a laparoscopic inguinal hernioplasty was performed in&#xD;
      the period between August 2015 and June 2018 in the unit of ambulatory surgery of the&#xD;
      Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires. The same corresponds to an autonomous unit controlled by a&#xD;
      health facility with hospitalization, as established by the Asociación Argentina de Cirugía&#xD;
      in the Organization Guide and procedures in Ambulatory Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic repair using a transabdominal preperitoneal technique (TAPP) was proposed for&#xD;
      patients with a clinical diagnosis of bilateral inguinal hernia or a recurrent unilateral&#xD;
      hernia operated primarily through the anterior approach following the indications for&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery proposed by the European Hernia Society&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demographic data of the patients considered for this study were: age, gender, body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI), anesthetic risk according to ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) score,&#xD;
      comorbidities, bilateral primary or unilateral recurrent hernia, history of previous&#xD;
      abdominal surgeries and associated midline hernias The details of the surgical procedure and&#xD;
      the ambulatory surgery regimen, as well as possible postoperative complications, were&#xD;
      explained to all patients in the preoperative consultation and an informed consent was&#xD;
      signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthetic technique was the same for everyone. The patients were operated under general&#xD;
      anesthesia. Anesthetic induction was performed with propofol 2 mg / kg EV and fentanyl 2 ug /&#xD;
      kg EV. Rocuronium 0.6 mg / kg EV was used to facilitate laryngeal mask placement. The&#xD;
      anesthetic level was maintained with air, oxygen, sevoflorane at 1.5% expired and with&#xD;
      remifentanil (0.25 at 0.5 ug / kg / min) based on the demand of the patient's plan. It was&#xD;
      ventilated mechanically in controlled mode. As intraoperative analgesia, ketorolac 1 mg / kg&#xD;
      according to renal function or diclofenac 1 mg / kg was used in patients with a history of&#xD;
      bronchospasm. This was associated with 8 mg of dexamethasone. Antibiotic prophylaxis during&#xD;
      anesthetic induction was performed with cefazolin 2 gr / kg EV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 100% of the cases, the surgical technique used was TAPP. The patient was asked to urinate&#xD;
      prior to the transfer to the operating room to avoid the placement of a urinary catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the patient in the supine position, pneumoperitoneum was performed by umbilical scar&#xD;
      with closed Veress needle technique. The abdomen was insufflated with a pressure of 12 mmHg.&#xD;
      A 10-mm trocar was placed at the umbilical level and two 5-mm trocars were placed on both&#xD;
      flanks outside the rectus sheath. In the event that the patient presents with an associated&#xD;
      midline hernia, optic trocar was inserted due to hernia defect. It was approached first on&#xD;
      one side and then on the contralateral side. After the opening of the peritoneum, dissection&#xD;
      of the preperitoneal space and reduction of the hernial content, a polypropylene mesh&#xD;
      (Prolene®, Ethicon Johnson &amp; Johnson) of 15 x 12 centimeters was placed covering the&#xD;
      myopectineal orifice from the symphysis pubis medially, until the anterosuperior iliac spine&#xD;
      laterally. In patients with bilateral hernia, two meshes were placed, one on each side&#xD;
      respectively, surpassing the midline. The mesh was fixed with tuckers made of resorbable&#xD;
      material (Securetrap®) or unabsorbable material (Protack®) according to the preference of the&#xD;
      surgeon in charge of the procedure. The peritoneum was closed with continuous suture of slow&#xD;
      absorbable material (Vycril®) or slow reabsorbed barb suture (Stratafix®). Local infiltration&#xD;
      of all wounds was performed with ropivacaine at a dose of 3 mg / kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical time was recorded as intraoperative variables, which was defined as minutes from the&#xD;
      preparation of the surgical site to the closure of the skin; the type of hernia according to&#xD;
      Nyhus classification and the presence of intraoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, the patients were transferred to the recovery room. During the&#xD;
      postoperative recovery an analgesic scheme was stipulated according to need. The rescues were&#xD;
      made according to the evaluation of the nurse and the treating anesthetist and consisted of&#xD;
      the following levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First level: ketorolac 30 mg EV or diclofenac 75 mg EV. In patients with decreased&#xD;
           glomerular filtration, paracetamol 1000 mg EV was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second level: morphine 1 - 3 mg EV. When the requirements of the ambulatory surgery&#xD;
           guide of the Asociación Argentina de Cirugía listed in table N° 1 were fulfilled, the&#xD;
           patient was discharged from hospital. The same was in charge of the responsible surgeon,&#xD;
           who delivered the postoperative indications verbally and in writing, confirming the&#xD;
           understanding of them by the patient and the companion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of stay in the unit was recorded, as well as the need to administer analgesics&#xD;
      during the same and pain according to the visual analog scale (EVA) at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility is expressed as the percentage of patients who were referred from the outpatient&#xD;
      surgery unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data about postoperative complications were collected prospectively through ambulatory&#xD;
      controls previously stipulated at 7, 30, 180 and 360 days. They are classified into early (up&#xD;
      to 30 days of the procedure) and late. The first included seroma, surgical site infection and&#xD;
      hematoma; and late trocar hernias, recurrence and postoperative pain. Chronic postoperative&#xD;
      pain is one that persists beyond the third month after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first ambulatory control consultation at 7 days, patients were asked to rate their&#xD;
      level of satisfaction with the procedure by choosing one of the four categories: not&#xD;
      satisfied, not very satisfied, satisfied and very satisfied For the study of costs in&#xD;
      addition to outpatients, those patients who underwent laparoscopic inguinal hernia in the&#xD;
      inpatient setting during the period analyzed were included in the analysis. In this way, two&#xD;
      branches of study were drawn up, one corresponding to patients operated on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis and the other to patients operated through a hospital regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being a surgical procedure performed under a different hospital regime, a cost minimization&#xD;
      study was carried out taking the average cost of performing an ambulatory procedure versus&#xD;
      the same requiring admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When considering the economic situation of the República Argentina in the time under study&#xD;
      (devaluation of the peso argentino weight of 100% and inflation of approximately 30% per&#xD;
      year), continuous patients operated between December 2016 and April 2017 were taken, which&#xD;
      represents the average of the period under study, as representative samples of each branch.&#xD;
      For each patient, the surgical time, the persistence time in the ambulatory anesthetic&#xD;
      recovery room or the hospitalization room, and the time of postoperative hospitalization were&#xD;
      recorded in a database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The materials used during surgery and anesthesia were previously standardized so that all the&#xD;
      patients who underwent this procedure used the same resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost department of the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires was responsible for collecting&#xD;
      the costs of each of these patients. They were divided into fixed costs per procedure, per&#xD;
      hour/operating room, per hour in the ambulatory surgery recovery room, per hour in the&#xD;
      recovery room of the central operating room and per day of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The costs were calculated in Argentine Pesos (AP) and converted into US Dollars (USD) taking&#xD;
      into account the exchange rate in January 2017: 1 USD = 16.30 PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The categorical data were described as percentages and the quantitative data as mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation or median and interquartile range according to the observed distribution.&#xD;
      To compare means of quantitative variables, Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was used&#xD;
      according to the observed distribution. Chi-square or Fisher's test was used for the rest of&#xD;
      the variables. A p &lt;.05 was considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regression models were constructed to adjust for confounding potentials.&#xD;
