  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is most often defined as a syndrome of physiological decline in late life,&#xD;
      characterized by marked vulnerability to adverse health outcomes. Intervention such as&#xD;
      exercise, especially resistance exercise, has proven to be effective to improve frail&#xD;
      condition in the elderly in the previous literature. However, blood flow restriction (BFR)&#xD;
      training, a new resistance exercise training method, need merely lower resistance power and&#xD;
      shorter training duration compared with traditional resistance exercise. Previous researches&#xD;
      also demonstrated BFR can increase muscle mass and muscle strength in the healthy elderly but&#xD;
      the effect of BFR training on the pre-frail or frail elderly is unknown. The aim of this&#xD;
      study will test the effect of BFR training on muscle strength and functional performance in&#xD;
      pre-frail or frail elderly. Participants aged over 60 years old with clinical frailty score&#xD;
      between 3 to 5 will be recruited. Participants will be assigned to two groups using&#xD;
      randomized block design with BFR training and control group. Structured questionnaire and&#xD;
      physical function measurement will be used to assess the pre-intervention condition and&#xD;
      outcome of different interventions. The participants will be assessed before training&#xD;
      (pre-test), 3 weeks after training, and 6 weeks after training (post-test), and followed up&#xD;
      at one and three months after training. Physical function measurement will include hand grip,&#xD;
      muscle mass over trunk and extremity, muscle strength of lower extremity, gait speed and&#xD;
      timed up and go test. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to test the&#xD;
      pre-test, 3-week, post-test and follow-ups difference between the two groups.&#xD;
