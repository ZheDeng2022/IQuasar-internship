      Background - Preeclampsia/eclampsia, a pregnancy specific multi-systemic disease, is&#xD;
      associated with considerable maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Prevention&#xD;
      and/or treatment of convulsion with magnesium sulphate, among others, is life-saving. Despite&#xD;
      different regimens that have been tried, the minimum effective dose of MgSO4 for the&#xD;
      prevention of eclampsia in patients with preeclampsia and treatment of convulsion in those&#xD;
      with eclampsia has not been determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives - To compare the maternal and perinatal outcomes and maternal side effects in&#xD;
      eclamptic and preeclamptic participants treated with low dose regimen of MgSO4 with those&#xD;
      treated with the Pritchard regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods - This will be a prospective, single blinded randomized controlled&#xD;
      study of low dose versus Pritchard regimens of MgSO4. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to the either arm of the study. Efficacy and adverse effects of the drug on the mother and&#xD;
      baby will be noted. Data will be collated, tabulated and then statistically analysed using&#xD;
      the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) Results - Conclusion will be drawn and&#xD;
      recommendation made from the findings in the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Preeclampsia complicates 5-7% of all pregnancies globally. However,&#xD;
      hospital-based studies in Nigeria have reported rates ranging between 1.2% and 6.3%, while a&#xD;
      study in Abakaliki recorded 0.99% for severe preeclampsia and 0.76% for eclampsia. Severe&#xD;
      preeclampsia and eclampsia are associated with increased maternal and perinatal morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 63,000 maternal deaths&#xD;
      occur annually from preeclampsia/eclampsia and associated complications, with 98% of these&#xD;
      deaths occurring in developing countries. Perinatal adverse outcomes are usually due to&#xD;
      prematurity associated with preterm delivery, as well as intrauterine fetal death from&#xD;
      intrauterine growth restriction and placental abruption. Early recognition therefore,&#xD;
      combined with prompt management, is often required for good maternal and perinatal outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definitive treatment for severe preeclampsia or eclampsia is delivery of the placenta. In&#xD;
      affected women, positive maternal and perinatal outcomes depend on the woman having timely&#xD;
      access to a treatment package which include effective inpatient monitoring, optimal timing of&#xD;
      childbirth, presence of skilled attendant at birth and administration of antihypertensive as&#xD;
      well as anticonvulsive therapy. Of all the anticonvulsants that have been tried in the&#xD;
      management of preeclampsia and eclampsia, magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) has been established as&#xD;
      the anticonvulsant of choice both for prevention of convulsions in severe preeclampsia and&#xD;
      for prevention of recurrent convulsions in eclampsia. It has been shown to be superior to&#xD;
      diazepam, phenytoin, and lytic cocktail (a mixture of chlorpromazine, promethazine and&#xD;
      pethidine) in reducing the occurrence of eclamptic convulsion and the associated maternal&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. It also has beneficial effects on fetuses, reducing the risks of low&#xD;
      Apgar scores in the 1st and 5th minutes, the risk of cerebral haemorrhage, as well as the&#xD;
      need for intubation and admission into newborn intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium sulphate belongs to the class of electrolytes anti-dysrrhythmic drugs. It is a&#xD;
      sterile, non-pyrogenic concentrated solution of magnesium sulphate heptahydrate in water for&#xD;
      injection. It is administered by the intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) routes as an&#xD;
      electrolyte replenisher or anticonvulsant. It has been adjudged to be the most effective,&#xD;
      safe and low-cost anticonvulsant drug for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Though the mechanism&#xD;
      of action is not completely understood, several hypotheses have been put forward to explain&#xD;
      its beneficial effects in patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia. These include dilatation&#xD;
      of cerebral blood vessels thereby reducing cerebral ischaemia, blockade of the&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the brain and also causing peripheral vasodilatation.&#xD;
      However, despite its endorsement by the W.H.O. and its widespread availability, MgSO4 is&#xD;
      still underused and incorrectly administered in many low resource settings. This has been&#xD;
      discovered to be due to a number of provider factors and the complexity of treatment regimens&#xD;
      being used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly used MgSO4 regimens are those given intramuscularly and/or intravenously&#xD;
      from the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia and eclampsia to 24 hours post delivery or post&#xD;
      last seizure episode, whichever occurs later. Though these regimens have been found to be&#xD;
      effective, they involve administering large doses of the drug. This usually leads to high&#xD;
      cost of treatment to the affected patients as well as difficulties in monitoring such&#xD;
      patients for drug toxicity (which include neurological deficit and cardiac arrest),&#xD;
      especially in developing countries where manpower and facilities are limited. Therefore,&#xD;
      several attempts have been made either to shorten the duration of administration or reduce&#xD;
      the dosage of MgSO4 with the aim of achieving optimal efficacy, while reducing the side&#xD;
      effects of the drug and the cost of management. These include those in which the loading dose&#xD;
      and maintenance doses were reduced in quantities; those involving reduction of maintenance&#xD;
      dose to 12 hours and those involving giving only the loading dose. No particular regimen has&#xD;
      been generally adopted as the minimum effective dose, although several lower doses have&#xD;
      proved to be effective. Because of their effectiveness which has been demonstrated over time,&#xD;
      it has been suggested that lower doses of MgSO4 may suffice for prophylaxis for patients with&#xD;
      severe preeclampsia as well as treatment for those with eclampsia, without jeopardising&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though the reason for the success recorded with the low dose regimen used in Dhaka was&#xD;
      attributed to the low body mass index of the population, several other studies in other&#xD;
      places with varying dosages and different weight distribution have also recorded varying&#xD;
      degrees of success. Therefore small body mass index (BMI) alone may not be enough to explain&#xD;
      the whole phenomenon. Some authorities have also shown that there is no association between&#xD;
      treatment failures and patients' BMI. or with serum magnesium levels. A systematic review in&#xD;
      Nigeria in 2016 supported the fact that there were no studies that had demonstrated the&#xD;
      lowest effective dose of MgSO4 to manage preeclampsia/eclampsia. Another systematic review&#xD;
      also recommended further studies to identify the minimum effective dose of MgSO4 for the&#xD;
      management of preeclampsia/eclampsia. Therefore, any regimen that will involve minimal cost&#xD;
      and side effects; and at the same time be as effective as the current doses being&#xD;
      administered, will go a long way in reducing the challenges of affordability of the drug and&#xD;
      that of its side effects. It is against this background that this study is being carried out&#xD;
      to compare the efficacy of a lower dose of MgSO4 in patients with severe pre-eclampsia and&#xD;
      eclampsia to that of the Pritchard's regimen among our women population with a view to&#xD;
      recommending it for use if the efficacy is found to be comparable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study background The study will be carried out at the Obstetric and Gynaecology division of&#xD;
      Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, South-east,&#xD;
      Nigeria. The department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology is one of the clinical departments in&#xD;
      the hospital. There are 52 obstetric bed spaces including antenatal and postnatal wards. The&#xD;
      department has five teams which are sub-divided into two units each. Each unit is manned by&#xD;
      at least two consultants. Resident doctors are distributed to cover all the units. The&#xD;
      department runs antenatal clinics managed by the consultants and resident doctors, assisted&#xD;
      by midwives and other health workers. Antenatal clients are booked daily on every week day&#xD;
      and are assigned consultants according to the units/teams running antenatal clinic each day.&#xD;
      The average antenatal booking is about 4,200 clients per annum, while the total antenatal&#xD;
      clinic attendance averages 21,000 per annum, with an average annual delivery rate of 3,100.&#xD;
      The department has established protocols for management of specific cases which are in&#xD;
      accordance with international best practices, and are displayed in the labour wards,&#xD;
      antenatal ward and the accident and emergency unit of the hospital. These protocols serve as&#xD;
      guides as patient care is still individualised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cases of severe preeclampsia and eclampsia, the departmental protocol is to stabilise the&#xD;
      patient and deliver through the most expeditious route, though considerations may be given in&#xD;
      certain cases of severe preeclampsia to allow for fetal growth for one or two weeks provided&#xD;
      maternal and fetal clinical and laboratory parameters are stable. One of the steps taken&#xD;
      during the period of stabilization is the administration of MgSO4 so as to avoid fits or its&#xD;
      recurrence. The most commonly used MgSO4 regimen in the department is the Pritchard regimen&#xD;
      in which MgSO4 is given as intravenous loading dose of 4g over 10 minutes, while 5g is&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly in each buttock statim. Then 5g of MgSO4 is then administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly every 4 hours until 24 hours after delivery or 24 hours after the last&#xD;
      seizure episode, whichever occurs later, provided no sign of toxicity from the previous dose&#xD;
      is noted. This is chosen because it involves less man-power for administration and monitoring&#xD;
      of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Participants to be included in this study will be women with severe&#xD;
      preeclampsia and eclampsia that will be admitted and managed at the study facility who meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria. Detailed history will be obtained and thorough examination will be&#xD;
      carried out on all patients. Relevant investigations, which include blood group and Rhesus&#xD;
      type, complete blood count, platelet count, liver function tests, kidney function tests,&#xD;
      coagulation profile and urine analysis for proteinuria, will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination The minimum sample size will be determined using statistical&#xD;
      formula for non-inferiority study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N= 2×[Z1-α/2+Z1-β]2 × P × (1-P) do N = number of patients per group Z = the standard normal&#xD;
      deviate for a one or two sided study, usually set at 1.96.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d0 = clinically acceptable margin of equivalence which will be set at 0.05 P = proportion of&#xD;
      patients in both arms who developed convulsion following administration of MgSO4 from a&#xD;
      previous related study (0.2)50 α = type I error = ≤5% β = type II error =≤ 20% N = 2 ×&#xD;
      (1.96+0.845)2 × 0.2(1-0.2) 0.05 N = 2 × 7.868 × 0.2 × 0.8 0.05 N = 2.517768 0.05 N = 50.36 ≈&#xD;
      50 This will represent the number of patients per group. Twenty percent of this minimum&#xD;
      sample size will be added to correct for any attritions that may occur in the course of the&#xD;
      study. The final sample size on each arm of the study will now be 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' selection The participants will be randomized by means of a computer generated&#xD;
      random numbers, by a statistician, using the software Research Randomizer®. Using this&#xD;
      software, sixty numbers will be randomly generated from a pool of one hundred and twenty&#xD;
      numbers (1-120) and these numbers will be assigned to group A (low dose) while the remaining&#xD;
      sixty numbers will automatically be assigned to group B (Pritchard).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: will receive 4g of 20% intravenous (I.V.) MgSO4 (Magphate®) given over 10 minutes,&#xD;
      followed by 3g of 50% intramuscular (I.M.) MgSO4 in each buttock statim. Then, maintenance&#xD;
      doses will be given as 2.5g of 50% MgSO4 administered intramuscularly 4 hourly for 24 hours,&#xD;
      for those with severe preeclampsia and for 24 hours post delivery or post last seizure&#xD;
      episode, whichever occurs last, for participantsts with eclampsia (low dose regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: will receive loading dose as 4g of 20% MgSO4 I.V. over 10 minutes, followed by 5g of&#xD;
      50% MgSO4 I.M. in each buttock. Maintenance doses will be given as 5g of 50% MgSO4 I.M. 4&#xD;
      hourly in alternate buttock until 24 hours for patients with eclampsia and for 24 hours after&#xD;
      delivery or after last fit, whichever occurs later, for patients with eclampsia (Pritchard&#xD;
      regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These numbers (1-120) will be inscribed on brown envelopes and a piece of paper with the&#xD;
      inscription 'low dose' or 'Pritchard' will be placed with the respective drug accordingly&#xD;
      inside these envelopes and sealed. All the envelopes will be kept in a locker that will be&#xD;
      made accessible to all the members of the research team. Participants will be made to know&#xD;
      what the drug is meant to do for them during the counselling session and the possible side&#xD;
      effects but will not know which arm of the study they belong (single blinding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, who meet the inclusion criteria, having signed the informed consent form, will&#xD;
      be given sequential study numbers and the corresponding numbered opaque sealed envelope will&#xD;
      then be allocated to the study cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug administration Participants allocated to the low dose arm, loading dose of magnesium&#xD;
      sulphate will be administered starting with 4g of 20% MgSO4 I.M. over 10 minutes by the&#xD;
      researcher/assistant, followed by 3g of 50% MgSO4 I.M. in each buttock statim. This will then&#xD;
      be followed by administration of 2.5g of 50% MgSO4 I.M. 4 hourly in alternate buttock for 24&#xD;
      hours, for patients with severe preeclampsia and for 24 hours after delivery or last fit,&#xD;
      whichever occurs later for patients with eclampsia. For those on the Prichard regimen, the&#xD;
      loading dose will be given as 4g of 20% I.V. over 10 minutes, followed by 5g of 50% MgSO4&#xD;
      I.M. in each buttock. This will then be maintained by 5g of 50% I.M. MgSO4 4 hourly for 24&#xD;
      hours for patients with severe preeclampsia and for 24 hours after delivery or last&#xD;
      convulsion, whichever occurs later, for cohorts with eclampsia. Participants' vital signs&#xD;
      will be checked before MgSO4 administration. Toxicity will also be checked for as earlier&#xD;
      outlined. If maintenance dose is found to be contraindicated in any of the patients based on&#xD;
      her clinical status or presence of signs of toxicity, such participants will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring Participants will be monitored clinically for signs of toxicity. This will be done&#xD;
      by checking for deep tendon reflex which should be present, respiratory rate which should be&#xD;
      not be less than 16 cycles per minute and hourly urine output which should be at least 30ml&#xD;
      per hour. One gram of calcium gluconate will be provided for each patient on MgSO4 to be&#xD;
      given in case of toxicity. For those who fit while on the low dose, 2g of 20% MgSO4 will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously over 10 minutes while the patient is converted to the Pritchard&#xD;
      regimen. Other causes of convulsion will also be sought for. If any of the participants on&#xD;
      Pritchard regimen fits, she will be given 2g of 20% MgSO4 intravenously over 10 minutes while&#xD;
      re-evaluating the woman for other possible causes of convulsion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data will be collated, tabulated and then statistically analysed using&#xD;
      the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) (IBM) software (version 22, Chicago USA).&#xD;
      Continuous variable will be presented as mean ± standard deviaton (SD), while categorical&#xD;
      variables will be presented as numbers and percentages. Chi-square test will be used for&#xD;
      comparison between groups of qualitative variables while normal z-test, risk ratio and&#xD;
      confidence interval at 95% will be used for comparison between groups of quantitative&#xD;
      variables. A difference with a p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration Ethical clearance was obtained from the Research and Ethics committee&#xD;
      of Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Nigeria. A signed-written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from each participant before recruitment into the study. The&#xD;
      participants will be made to understand that declining participation will have no&#xD;
      consequences in her obtaining adequate care. The participants will be assured that their&#xD;
      identity would be kept in confidence by the investigator.&#xD;
