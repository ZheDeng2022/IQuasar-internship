      In this study, the investigator plan to prescribe Methylprednisolone pulse therapy in&#xD;
      Kawasaki disease patients with coronary artery lesions or aneurysm formation beyond acute&#xD;
      stage to investigate the role for vasculitis of KD or regression of dilatation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kawasaki disease is the most common systemic vasculitis in children. Coronary artery&#xD;
      aneurysms may develop in 20-25% of untreated patients. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) can&#xD;
      reduce coronary-artery aneurysms to 3-5%. Numerous studies and clinical trials had pointed&#xD;
      out that corticosteroid treatment (pulse therapy or not) could lower the incidence of&#xD;
      coronary artery abnormality in high-risk KD patients. However, the therapeutic effect of&#xD;
      corticosteroid in KD patients with aneurysm formation after acute stage was never mentioned.&#xD;
      There is no effective treatment for aneurysm formation available in KD after acute stage.&#xD;
      Methylprednisolone pulse therapy (MP pulse) was used for treatment of KD during acute stage&#xD;
      since more than 20 years ago. MP pulse plus IVIG seems not benefit for KD patients but&#xD;
      benefit for IVIG resistant KD patients or for high-risk group of CAL formation/ IVIG&#xD;
      resistance group. MP pulse therapy is well document used in autoimmune disease vasculitis&#xD;
      such as SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyosis...etc. Taking together, MP pulse is&#xD;
      effective and safe for KD patients during acute stage. In this study, the investigators plan&#xD;
      to use MP pulse in KD patients with CAL or aneurysm formation beyond acute stage to&#xD;
      investigate the role of vasculitis of KD or regression of dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators conducted a prospective study of methylprednisolone pulse therapy&#xD;
      (MP pulse) for KD patients with coronary aneurysm or dilatation formation. The investigators&#xD;
      will enroll these patients to receive methylprednisolone pulse (MP pulse, 30mg/kg, Max:1g/day&#xD;
      for continue 3 days) for treatment. Together with other anti-inflammatory oral medicine&#xD;
      including monteleukast, Dextromethorphan(DXM), prednisolone, and ketotifen as supplementary&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of this study is the regression of coronary artery aneurysm after MP pulse&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the hypothesis and specific aim, the investigators plan to do in the following 3 years:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During the 1st year, the investigators will enroll for 5-10 cases for safety surveys&#xD;
           including blood pressure monitoring, inflammatory markers, liver function, renal&#xD;
           function, electrolyte imbalance, growth problems as Phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the 2nd and 3rd year of this study, the investigators will enroll for 20-30 cases for&#xD;
           an effective survey as Phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will help clinicians to treat aneurysm formation or coronary artery&#xD;
      dilatation in KD patients and reduce the activity limitation of patients, reduce the medical&#xD;
      resource in those patients. The investigators may provide the first treatment for aneurysm in&#xD;
      KD.&#xD;
