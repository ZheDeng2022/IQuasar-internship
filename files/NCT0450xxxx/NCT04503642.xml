  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection is a frequent complication after abdominal surgery. The wound closure&#xD;
      is done at the end of the procedure when the attention of the entire team may be affected&#xD;
      because of tiredness and reduced attention of the surgical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study, the investigators aim to test if an exchange of the surgical team by a&#xD;
      specialised wound closure team may reduce the impact of surgical site infection.&#xD;

    <description>SSI that occur after surgery will be assessed according to the criteria developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infections will be categorized as incisional (superficial or deep) infections or organ-space infections. Superficial SSI (type 1) involve only skin and subcutaneous tissue and exclude stitch abscesses. Deep SSI (type 2) involve deeper soft tissues, like fascia and muscle, at the site of incision. Organ-space SSI (type 3) involve any organ or body cavity</description>
