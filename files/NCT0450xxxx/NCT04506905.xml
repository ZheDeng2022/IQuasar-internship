  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2-Part Randomized Clinical Study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of alternate MK-8189 titration regimens. Part 1 will assess multiple dose&#xD;
      once-daily titration regimens of MK-8189 in young adult participants with schizophrenia. Part&#xD;
      2 will assess multiple once-daily doses of MK-8189 in elderly participants with schizophrenia&#xD;
      and healthy elderly participants.&#xD;
