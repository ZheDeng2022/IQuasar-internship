  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective phase II trial which is designed to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of IMRT combined with concurrent chemotherapy and anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody in&#xD;
      locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma with induced chemotherapy resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria include histologically confirmed locally advanced NPC according to the&#xD;
      American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging System (the eighth edition); Eastern&#xD;
      Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; at least one measurable&#xD;
      lesion based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1;&#xD;
      normal complete blood count, normal hepatic function and normal renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include previous radiotherapy, a history of any other type of malignancy;&#xD;
      pregnancy or lactation; allergy to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody; obvious dysfunction of&#xD;
      liver, renal, cardiac or lung function; uncontrolled infection; systemic metastasis or&#xD;
      distant metastasis; patients with severe gastrointestinal diseases, and patients with mental&#xD;
      disorders affecting patient participation in trial judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full-set pretreatment evaluation will be performed to every patient. All patients in this&#xD;
      study will receive intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The primary endpoints of&#xD;
      this study is progression-free survival (PFS) and adverse events (AE) rate.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective phase II trial which is designed to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of IMRT combined with concurrent chemotherapy and anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody in&#xD;
      locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma with induced chemotherapy resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria include histologically confirmed locally advanced NPC according to the&#xD;
      American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging System (the eighth edition); Eastern&#xD;
      Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; at least one measurable&#xD;
      lesion based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1;&#xD;
      normal complete blood count (white blood cell counts ≥4×1012/L, hemoglobin level ≥100g/L and&#xD;
      platelet counts ≥100×1012/L), normal hepatic function (total bilirubin level ≤1.5 mg/dl,&#xD;
      alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels ≤1.5 times the upper limit of&#xD;
      normal) and normal renal function (creatinine ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include previous radiotherapy, a history of any other type of malignancy;&#xD;
      pregnancy or lactation; allergy to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody; obvious dysfunction of&#xD;
      liver, renal, cardiac or lung function; uncontrolled infection; systemic metastasis or&#xD;
      distant metastasis; patients with severe gastrointestinal diseases, and patients with mental&#xD;
      disorders affecting patient participation in trial judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full-set pretreatment evaluation will be performed to every patient.All patients in this&#xD;
      study will receive intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the induction chemotherapy phase, TP regimen (Docetaxel 75mg/m2, D1 + DDP 25mg/m2, D1-3,&#xD;
      repeat every 3 weeks) or GP regimen (Gemcitabine 1.0g/m2, D1, 8 + DDP 25mg/m2 , D1-3, repeat&#xD;
      every 3 weeks) will be used. Cetuximab 400mg/m2 will be used one week before radiotherapy and&#xD;
      250mg/m2/week during IMRT, or nimotuzumab 200mg/week; meanwhile, cisplatin 80mg/m2 will be&#xD;
      used every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated every week during CCRT based on the evaluation&#xD;
      criteria of adverse reactions of CTCAE V4.0. Tumor response is assessed at the end of CCRT&#xD;
      according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1.&#xD;
      Radiation-related acute and late toxicities are graded according to the Radiation Therapy&#xD;
      Oncology Group (RTOG). Late toxicities are evaluated beyond three months from the end of&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of CCRT, all patients will be followed up every 3 months during the&#xD;
      first years, every 6 months for the following 2-5 years, and annually thereafter. Local&#xD;
      recurrence is confirmed by nasopharynx MRI or histological biopsy. Regional recurrence is&#xD;
      confirmed by fine needle aspiration or surgical biopsy. Distant metastases is detected by&#xD;
      imaging examinations including PETCT, bone Emission Computed Tomography (ECT), CT, MRI or&#xD;
      confirmed by histological confirmation of biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints of this study is adverse events (AE) rate and progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS). PFS is calculated from the date of enrollment to the date of disease progression or&#xD;
      the date of death for any cause.&#xD;
