    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial of PR-ESSENCE treatment for youth with challenging behavior in&#xD;
      two youth treatment homes, including 60-70 youth. Inclusion criteria: Youth aged 12-17 years,&#xD;
      staying at least 3 months at the home, with intellectual function in the normal range&#xD;
      according to WISC-test and clinical judgment, and exhibiting significant problem behaviors as&#xD;
      measured by Broset Violence Checklist (BVC). Subjects are randomized to 10 weeks of&#xD;
      PR-ESSENCE treatment or to the control condition &quot;treatment as usual&quot;. After the control&#xD;
      period, the control group will receive 10 weeks of PR-ESSENCE treatment. Outcome is assessed&#xD;
      at baseline, post-treatment/control period, and 3-6 months post-treatment (at the time when&#xD;
      the youth is planned to move from the home) with global assessments of problem severity and&#xD;
      improvement by blinded rater (CGI-I, CGI-S), ratings of SNAP-IV (ADHD and oppositional&#xD;
      symptoms), ECBI (behavior problems) and RPQ (relation problems) by the youth's contact&#xD;
      person, and self-ratings of psychiatric symptoms and self-concept with Becks Youth&#xD;
      Inventories. BVC ratings are also made daily by contact persons and teachers during the whole&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PR-ESSENCE is a problem-solving training program developed by our research team, inspired by&#xD;
      Dr Greene´s model &quot;Collaborative and Proactive Solutions (CPS)&quot;. We recently completed an RCT&#xD;
      with PR-ESSENCE at the Gillberg Centre, Gothenburg University, including 108 children and&#xD;
      adolescents who had complex neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, ADHD, ODD, Tourette,&#xD;
      learning difficulties etc and challenging behaviors. The study showed significant global&#xD;
      improvements in behavior problems with a large effect size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PR-ESSENCE model is designed to train and develop mutual problem solving strategies for&#xD;
      children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders (ESSENCE, an umbrella term coined&#xD;
      by Gillberg 2010 = Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neuropsychiatric Clinical&#xD;
      Examinations, which puts focus on the considerable overlap several of these syndromes have).&#xD;
      Many youth who are placed in youth treatment homes due to challenging and risk-taking&#xD;
      behaviors have been shown to have ESSENCE impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a randomized controlled trial of PR-ESSENCE treatment for youth with&#xD;
      challenging behavior in two youth treatment homes in southwestern Sweden, Bjorkbacken (girls)&#xD;
      and Nereby (boys). We plan to include 60-70 youth. Inclusion criteria: Youth aged 12-17&#xD;
      years, staying at least 3 months at the home, with intellectual function in the normal range&#xD;
      according to WISC-test and clinical judgment, and exhibiting significant problem behaviors as&#xD;
      measured by Broset Violence Checklist (BVC). Exclusion criteria: Intellectual disability,&#xD;
      bipolar syndrome, psychosis, substance use, or other unstable psychiatric or medical&#xD;
      condition which would make study participation unsuitable. Psychoactive medication is allowed&#xD;
      if stable at least one month before baseline, and during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline a medical and neuropsychiatric history is taken by psychologist and physician (a&#xD;
      standard assessment done for all youth placed at the homes), including rating of history of&#xD;
      risk behaviors with Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (YLS/CMI), and a&#xD;
      DSM-5-diagnostic screening (DSM-5-CCSM) for psychiatric symptoms. Intellectual level will be&#xD;
      tested with WISC-V. The participants will do self-ratings of psychiatric symptoms and&#xD;
      self-concept with Becks Youth Inventories. The therapists interview parents/carers about&#xD;
      history of neuropsychiatric symptoms with the A-TAC-interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are randomized to 10 weeks of PR-ESSENCE treatment or to the control condition&#xD;
      &quot;treatment as usual&quot;. After the control period, the control group will also receive 10 weeks&#xD;
      of PR-ESSENCE treatment. Outcome is assessed at baseline, post treatment/control period, and&#xD;
      3-6 months post-treatment (at the time when the youth is planned to move from the home) with&#xD;
      global assessments of problem severity and improvement by blinded independent rater (CGI-I,&#xD;
      CGI-S), ratings of SNAP-IV (ADHD and oppositional symptoms), ECBI (behavior problems) and RPQ&#xD;
      (relation problems) by the youth's contact person, and self-ratings of psychiatric symptoms&#xD;
      and self-concept with Becks Youth Inventories. BVC ratings are made daily by contact persons&#xD;
      and teachers during the whole study. During treatment, therapists rate every week with a&#xD;
      Problem Rating Scale how many problem situations are completely or partly solved.&#xD;
