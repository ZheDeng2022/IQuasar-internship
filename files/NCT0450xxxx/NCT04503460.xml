  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the adverse effects&#xD;
      associated with the use of long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) in asthma. Participants with&#xD;
      mild asthma will be enrolled into a single-arm, unblinded trial in which they receive 2 weeks&#xD;
      of salmeterol xinafoate monotherapy, followed by a 2-week washout period, followed by 2 weeks&#xD;
      of salmeterol xinafoate / fluticasone propionate combination therapy. The induction of asthma&#xD;
      disease-relevant pro-inflammatory mediators in the airways will be measured at each stage and&#xD;
      correlated with relevant clinical parameters.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) alone to treat asthma has been associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality rates. Between 2012 and 2013, 3% of patients who died from asthma in the&#xD;
      UK were found to be on LABA monotherapy, despite guidelines recommending that LABAs must&#xD;
      always be administered with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Monotherapy with the LABA&#xD;
      salmeterol has been linked to a significant increase in asthma-related mortality rates when&#xD;
      used without ICS. When salmeterol is used with ICS, it is not associated with an increased&#xD;
      risk of serious asthma-related events and is associated with fewer exacerbations than when&#xD;
      using ICS alone. The purpose of this study is to understand the mechanisms underlying why&#xD;
      LABA use on its own causes worse outcomes in asthma patients. If the mechanisms can be&#xD;
      successfully understood, this could provide further compelling evidence to optimise safe of&#xD;
      these medicines in airway disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study will be: to determine whether LABA monotherapy with&#xD;
      salmeterol for 2 weeks in asthmatic patients induces disease-relevant mediators (as&#xD;
      identified through ex vivo studies) in the airways in vivo; and to determine whether LABA/ICS&#xD;
      combination therapy with salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate for 2 weeks in the same&#xD;
      asthmatic patients will abolish the induction of disease-relevant mediators in the airways in&#xD;
      vivo. If it can be shown that the levels of these inflammatory mediators increase in the&#xD;
      airways of asthmatic patients when they are on salmeterol xinafoate monotherapy, and that&#xD;
      this effect is decreased when asthmatic patients are on salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone&#xD;
      propionate combination therapy, this will provide evidence for a mechanism underlying the&#xD;
      adverse effects of salmeterol in asthmatic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will be to determine the impact of LABA monotherapy with salmeterol&#xD;
      xinafoate for 2 weeks and LABA/ICS therapy with salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate&#xD;
      for 2 weeks on the following parameters in asthmatic patients: lung function (assessed by&#xD;
      spirometry); airway inflammation (assessed by measuring fractional exhaled nitric oxide);&#xD;
      airway hyperresponsiveness (assessed by histamine challenge testing); asthma symptom control&#xD;
      (assessed by the Asthma Control Questionnaire-6); and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor&#xD;
      (BDNF) concentration and platelet BDNF concentration.&#xD;
