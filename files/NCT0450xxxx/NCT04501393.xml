  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research in developing patient fasting guidelines was developed years ago. On a physiological&#xD;
      basis, patients with a longer fasting time may have less residual gastric content and lower&#xD;
      risk of pulmonary aspiration. The recent Practice Guidelines for Preoperative Fasting and the&#xD;
      Use of Pharmacologic Agents to Reduce the Risk of Pulmonary Aspiration of The American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) was published in March 2017. Current practice consists of&#xD;
      2-hour fasting period for clear oral fluid (including water, pulp-free juice and tea or&#xD;
      coffee without milk), 4- hour fasting period for breast milk and 6-hour fasting period for&#xD;
      non-human milk and solid food. However, there are only few supportive and suggestive&#xD;
      scientific evidences. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines for preoperative fasting to enhance the quality of pediatric anesthesia care and&#xD;
      promote patient safety.The investigators plan to enroll adults aged 18-60 years, who are&#xD;
      scheduled for esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD), in order to study the effects of fasting&#xD;
      time and the actual intragastric volume which may help us establish a comprehensive fasting&#xD;
      guideline.&#xD;

      Research in developing patient NPO guidelines was developed years ago. On a physiological&#xD;
      basis, patients with a longer fasting time may have less residual gastric content and lower&#xD;
      risk of pulmonary aspiration. The recent Practice Guidelines for Preoperative Fasting and the&#xD;
      Use of Pharmacologic Agents to Reduce the Risk of Pulmonary Aspiration of The American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) was published in March 2017. Current practice consists of&#xD;
      2-hour fasting period for clear oral fluid (including water, pulp-free juice and tea or&#xD;
      coffee without milk), 4- hour fasting period for breast milk and 6-hour fasting period for&#xD;
      non-human milk and solid food. However, there are only few supportive (category A) and&#xD;
      suggestive (category B) scientific evidences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since Maltby et al showed results of patient's safety in elective surgical patients who had&#xD;
      clear oral fluid intake 2 hours before surgery in 1986, the published clinical evidence is&#xD;
      still insufficient to address the relationship between pulmonary aspiration and fasting time&#xD;
      . For breast milk, infant formula and solid food, the latest Practice Guidelines for&#xD;
      Preoperative Fasting and the Use of Pharmacologic Agents to Reduce the Risk of Pulmonary&#xD;
      Aspiration in 2011 also follow previous suggestion of fasting time because of inadequate&#xD;
      updated supportive clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current clinical practice guidelines for&#xD;
      preoperative fasting to enhance the quality of pediatric anesthesia care and promote patient&#xD;
      safety. Andersson et al. reviewed 10,015 pediatric anesthesia charts retrospectively and&#xD;
      found an incidence of 3 cases of pulmonary aspiration in 10,000 pediatric anesthesia patients&#xD;
      who were allowed to drink clear liquid fluids until called to operative rooms . This approach&#xD;
      promotes patient safety by minimizing a patient's dehydration status and reduced&#xD;
      intraoperative hypotensive events. Furthermore, shortened fasting times also decreases&#xD;
      patient irritability and improves parental satisfaction in preoperative experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enroll adults ages 18-60 years old, who are scheduled for&#xD;
      esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) at Siriraj hospital. This observational study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 2 stages; (1) preoperative period (2) intraoperative period. Patients'&#xD;
      demographic information will be collected along with NPO history including times, volume and&#xD;
      type of fluid/ food intake in the preoperative period. Intragastric volume and pH from each&#xD;
      patient's stomach at the beginning of EGD procedure will be measured in the intraoperative&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that the information from this study will help us understand the&#xD;
      effects of NPO time and the actual intragastric volume which may help establish a&#xD;
      comprehensive NPO guideline.&#xD;
