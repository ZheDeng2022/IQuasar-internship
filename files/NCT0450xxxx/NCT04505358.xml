    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to&#xD;
      assess the biological activity, safety and pharmacokinetics of PU-AD compared to placebo in&#xD;
      ALS. It will be conducted in approximately 20 sites in the US. Approximately 30 subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled in this study; subjects will be randomized 3:2 to receive either PU-AD 30 mg or&#xD;
      matching placebo qd, added onto any current stable background treatment.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to&#xD;
      assess the biological activity, safety and pharmacokinetics of PU-AD compared to placebo in&#xD;
      ALS. It will be conducted in approximately 20 sites in the US. Approximately 30 subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled in this study; subjects will be randomized 3:2 to receive either PU-AD 30 mg or&#xD;
      matching placebo qd, added onto any current stable background treatment. Subjects who meet&#xD;
      all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to participate in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a Screening Period (including background treatment stabilization, if&#xD;
      required) (4 weeks), Treatment Period (24 weeks) and a safety Follow up Visit (4 weeks [±1&#xD;
      week] after the last dose of investigational medicinal product [IMP]). The expected study&#xD;
      duration is up to 32 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Screening visit will take place within 4 weeks prior to dosing, to assess eligibility of&#xD;
      subjects. Eligible subjects will be randomized and then return to the site for baseline&#xD;
      assessments at Week 1. During the 24 week Treatment Period, subjects will be administered 30&#xD;
      mg PU AD or matching placebo qd, orally, on an empty stomach (1 hour prior to food or 2 hours&#xD;
      after), at about the same time each day.&#xD;
