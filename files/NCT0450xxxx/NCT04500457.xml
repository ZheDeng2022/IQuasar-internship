      This study is examining the efficacy of a computerized, exposure-based, intervention for&#xD;
      perfectionism.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a two-week computerized&#xD;
      exposure-based treatment for perfectionism (ETP). Individuals with elevated perfectionism&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to ETP or a waitlist (WL) control condition. ETP will consist of&#xD;
      three tasks in which they will repeatedly make mistakes, repeated for five sessions over a&#xD;
      two-week period (one session every 3 days).&#xD;
