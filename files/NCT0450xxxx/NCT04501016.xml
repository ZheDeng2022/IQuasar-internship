  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use remains prevalent among Veterans. Although effective smoking cessation&#xD;
      interventions exist, long-term term quit rates remain sub-optimal. The project will&#xD;
      investigate the feasibility of a stepped care approach to treating tobacco use that includes&#xD;
      enhancements based on initial response to treatment to augment the investigators' existing&#xD;
      tailored tobacco treatment intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rural tobacco users (cigarette smokers, smokeless tobacco users, and users of other forms of&#xD;
      tobacco) from the Iowa City VA Health Care System will be proactively recruited using&#xD;
      information obtained from the electronic medical record. All participants will receive the&#xD;
      investigators' tailored, six session smoking cessation intervention developed over a series&#xD;
      of projects funded by ORH. This includes a counseling protocol tailored to tobacco users'&#xD;
      individual needs and associated risk factors as well as pharmacotherapy selected using shared&#xD;
      decision making. Participants who are unable to quit initially will be provided with enhanced&#xD;
      counseling based on self-monitoring and scheduled reduced smoking. Those who are able to quit&#xD;
      using tobacco during the initial treatment phase will be given an extended, four-session&#xD;
      counseling protocol that incorporates new content based on established interventions from&#xD;
      positive psychology in an effort to reduce relapse.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will initially receive a six-session telephone intervention. Standard cognitive behavioral treatment strategies will be included. Participants will be screened for elevated depressive symptoms, risky alcohol use, and concerns about weight and and offered supplemental behavioral counseling related to these issues as appropriate. Those that are unable to quit tobacco initially will receive an enhanced, four-session counseling module focused on reduced scheduled smoking. Those who do quit tobacco use initially will receive four sessions of extended counseling based on positive psychology intervention strategies.</description>
