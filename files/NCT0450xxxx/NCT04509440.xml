  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anserine bursitis is a common etiology of medial knee pain. It could be severe enough to&#xD;
      limit the patient's functional abilities with affection of the quality of life. The etiology&#xD;
      of AB is unknown. It could be bursitis, tendinitis or other unknown etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of AB includes conservative and surgical treatment. Conservative treatment&#xD;
      consists of non-pharmacologic treatment and pharmacologic treatment. Local corticosteroid&#xD;
      injection is a treatment for refractory chronic anserine bursitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neural prolotherapy is the subcutaneous perineural injection of isotonic dextrose 5% in water&#xD;
      solution at the fascial penetration point of the sensory nerve where it reaches the&#xD;
      subcutaneous plane and along its course. It can be used for the treatment of chronic anserine&#xD;
      bursitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to determine the efficacy of neural prolotherapy subcutaneous perineural&#xD;
      injection versus corticosteroid local soft tissue injection therapy for relieving pain and&#xD;
      improvement of function among patients with chronic anserine bursitis.&#xD;

      Anserine bursitis is a common etiology of medial knee pain. It could be severe enough to&#xD;
      limit the patient's functional abilities with affection of the quality of life. The etiology&#xD;
      of AB is unknown. It could be bursitis, tendinitis or other unknown etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of AB includes conservative and surgical treatment. Conservative treatment&#xD;
      consists of non-pharmacologic treatment and pharmacologic treatment. Their aim is pain&#xD;
      relieve, with subsequent improvement of function and quality of life. The non-pharmacologic&#xD;
      treatment consisted of activity modification with avoidance of precipitating activities and&#xD;
      physiotherapy. The pharmacologic treatment consists of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,&#xD;
      analgesics whether oral as acetaminophen or topical preparations; or local soft tissue&#xD;
      injection of corticosteroid. Surgical treatment is indicated after failure of conservative&#xD;
      treatment in chronic severe and resistant cases only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local corticosteroid injection is a treatment for refractory chronic anserine bursitis. The&#xD;
      mechanism of action of corticosteroid is the suppression of the inflammatory process&#xD;
      associated with anserine bursitis. Subsequently, improvement of anserine bursitis takes&#xD;
      place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neural prolotherapy is the subcutaneous perineural injection of isotonic dextrose 5% in water&#xD;
      solution at the fascial penetration point of the sensory nerve where it reaches the&#xD;
      subcutaneous plane and along its course. It can be used for the treatment of chronic anserine&#xD;
      bursitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of action of neural prolotherapy in anserine bursitis could be due to&#xD;
      stimulation the release of a group of growth factors that enhance soft tissue healing in&#xD;
      response to isotonic dextrose 5% in water solution injection. Subcutaneous injection of&#xD;
      isotonic dextrose 5% in water solution was found to stimulate human cells to start&#xD;
      proliferation, increase in cell protein and DNA synthesis. It stimulates the release of a&#xD;
      group of growth factors as transforming growth factor-Î² and other growth factors. Another&#xD;
      mechanism of neural prolotherapy is the treatment of neurogenic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to determine the efficacy of neural prolotherapy subcutaneous perineural&#xD;
      injection versus corticosteroid local soft tissue injection therapy for relieving pain and&#xD;
      improvement of function among patients with chronic anserine bursitis.&#xD;
