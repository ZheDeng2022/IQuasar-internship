  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of our study is to focus on the efficiency of standard fluid resuscitation&#xD;
      in promoting tissue perfusion in severe burns patients (&gt;15% TBSA). The incidence of&#xD;
      microcirculatory perfusion alterations, according to a predefined arbitrary cut off value, in&#xD;
      patients with severe burns injury (&gt;15%TBSA) will be assessed during standard resuscitation&#xD;
      in the first 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to assess differences in microcirculatory perfusion alterations&#xD;
      between early (&lt;12 hours post burn injury) and late standard resuscitation (&gt;12 hours post&#xD;
      burn injury) with addition of albumin to the regime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And to measure several biomarkers of glycocalyx shedding, oxidative stress and inflammation.&#xD;

      Rationale: There are valid concerns that resuscitation in burns shock is inadequate. A&#xD;
      tendency to over resuscitate patients seem to exist. Current guidelines were developed 35&#xD;
      years ago and clinical burn resuscitation has not advanced significantly, despite ongoing&#xD;
      research. The main goal of resuscitation is achieving organ perfusion and tissue oxygenation.&#xD;
      Inadequate fluid resuscitation of severe acute burns may result in hypovolemic shock and&#xD;
      death. Excessive fluid resuscitation may result in fluid overload, lung edema,&#xD;
      intra-abdominal hypertension, abdominal compartment syndrome and burn depth conversion with&#xD;
      increased requirement for escharotomies, fasciotomies and skin grafting. Monitoring of&#xD;
      adequacy of resuscitation in burns patients has always been guided by systemic hemodynamic&#xD;
      variables (macro circulation) like blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume and urinary&#xD;
      output, being urine output the major indicator of successful resuscitation. Whether these end&#xD;
      points are successful in achieving adequate perfusion and oxygen transport to the tissues is&#xD;
      unknown and relies on the assumption that there is a hemodynamic coherence between the macro&#xD;
      and microcirculation whereby improving the macro circulation causes a parallel improvement in&#xD;
      the microcirculation Objective: The main objective of our study is to focus on the efficacy&#xD;
      of standard fluid resuscitation in promoting tissue perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single-center, prospective, observational clinical study in the Maasstad&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All adult patients who are admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with severe&#xD;
      burns over 15%TBSA and resuscitated with the standard resuscitation protocol will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Measurement of sublingual microcirculation with vessel&#xD;
      density and flow parameters. Also skin perfusion maps (Laser Speckle Imaging) will be&#xD;
      recorded. Blood and urine samples will also be used for measuring glycocalyx shedding&#xD;
      products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microcirculation assessment and laser speckle imaging are non-invasive procedures, and there&#xD;
      are negligible risks. Blood tests will be used for measuring glycocalyx shedding products,&#xD;
      this is an invasive procedure which may increase the risk of contamination, patient&#xD;
      discomfort and in some extreme cases blood sample collection may be a burden on patient&#xD;
      haemoglobin levels which is prone to decrease in critical patients. Assessment is essential&#xD;
      for determining whether action is required to change our existing resuscitation regime for&#xD;
      critically ill burned patients. If the results show that the current resuscitation regime is&#xD;
      suboptimal, then motivation for changing the existing practice can lead to improved clinical&#xD;
      care and a reduction in over- or under resuscitation in the ICU environment with its&#xD;
      potential harmful effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks associated with participation can be considered negligible and the burden can be&#xD;
      considered minimal in this observational study. The patients taking part in this study will&#xD;
      have no direct benefit.&#xD;

    <measure>Measurement of microcirculatory perfusion alterations in severe burns patients during standard fluid resuscitation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in perfusion parameters will be measured on admission (time zero, T=0), four hours after admission (T=4), eight hours after admission (T=8), twelve hours after admission (T=12) and twenty-four hours after admission (T=24</time_frame>
    <description>The main objective of our study is to measure standard microcirculatory perfusion parameters during standard resuscitation at different time points after a severe burn injury. These perfusion parameters are total vessel density (TVD), proportion of perfused vessels (PPV), functional capillary density (FCD) and focus depth.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Microcirculatory perfusion alterations after administration of albumin.</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in microcirculatory perfusion parameters will be measured directly after administration of albumin. This will be 12 hours after starting fluid resuscitation.</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary objectives are to measure changes in standard microcirculatory parameters before and after administration of albumin. Albumin will be administered 12 hours after admission of the patient.</description>
