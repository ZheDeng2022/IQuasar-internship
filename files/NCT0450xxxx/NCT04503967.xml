  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with unresectable or metastatic gastric or esophageal cancer, with first-line&#xD;
      treatment applied are to be recruited in the study. In the current study, the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of anlotinib hydrochloride combined with nivolumab as second-line or salvage&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be evaluated in Chinese patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma and&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. 48 patients could provide adequate precision rather than&#xD;
      controlling type I&amp;II error.&#xD;
