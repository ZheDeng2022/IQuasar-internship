      Deep learning applied to plain abdominal radiographic surveillance after Endovascular&#xD;
      Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a condition in which the abdominal aorta, a large artery,&#xD;
      dilates gradually, secondary to a degenerative process within its wall. This can lead to&#xD;
      rupture of the weakened wall with subsequent exsanguination into the abdomen. This scenario&#xD;
      is usually fatal. The diameter of the aneurysm positively correlates with the risk of&#xD;
      rupture. Aneurysm size is therefore the primary determinant when considering whether or not&#xD;
      to electively repair AAAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has become the standard treatment for AAAs in the vast&#xD;
      majority of patients. It is a minimally invasive technique that aims to exclude the aneurysm&#xD;
      from the circulation by placement of a synthetic &quot;stent-graft&quot; within the aortic lumen.&#xD;
      Metallic barbs as well as radial force maintain stent-graft position in non-aneurysmal aorta&#xD;
      above the aneurysm as well as in the iliac arteries below the aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 1 evidence has consistently demonstrated improved perioperative survival with EVAR as&#xD;
      compared to traditional open surgery. However, there are concerns regarding the long-term&#xD;
      durability of EVAR stent-grafts, with 1 in 5 patients requiring further surgery to the&#xD;
      aneurysm in the 5 years after the operation. This is often due to failure of the position and&#xD;
      integrity of the stent-graft. Therefore, standard international practice is to keep patients&#xD;
      are life-long surveillance after EVAR. This is usually in the form of plain radiographs in&#xD;
      combination with either computerised tomography (CT) or duplex ultrasound scans, all&#xD;
      performed on an annual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stent-grafts are visible on plain radiographs of the abdomen and by comparing series of&#xD;
      images taken over time, it is possible to diagnose a myriad of stent-graft problems including&#xD;
      migration, disintegration and distortion. But these changes can be subtle on plain&#xD;
      radiographs and difficult to spot, even to the most trained human eye. As a result, patients&#xD;
      undergo more detailed scans that unfortunately carry a risk of nephrotoxicity and&#xD;
      radiation-induced malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our research is to improve the diagnostic potential of plain radiographs by&#xD;
      applying modern deep learning computer algorithms for interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of deep learning has shown great success in recent&#xD;
      years on numerous challenging problems. The success of deep learning is largely underpinned&#xD;
      by advances in powerful graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs enable us to speed up training&#xD;
      algorithms by orders of magnitude, bringing run-times of weeks down to days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will explore the use of artificial intelligence in interpreting series of&#xD;
      anonymised plain radiographs to identify features of a failing stent-graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A deep-learning algorithm will be applied to post-EVAR plain radiographs that have already&#xD;
      been performed at our institution in England over the last 10 years. We will then compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the machine in identifying stent-graft related problems to the known&#xD;
      outcomes identified by human interpretation previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will rely on recent advances in deep learning techniques. It is expected that&#xD;
      deep learning will bring good performance for EVAR surveillance in line with its successful&#xD;
      application in domains such as the recognition of digits, Chinese characters, and traffic&#xD;
      signs where computers have produced better accuracy than humans.&#xD;
