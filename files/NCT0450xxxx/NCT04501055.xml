      This is a multicentre randomized controlled trial in comparison of the perineal nerve block&#xD;

      This trial is a prospective, multicentre, randomized controlled study in which all men plan&#xD;
      to undergo a transperineal prostate biopsy. This study aims to determine whether the perineal&#xD;
      nerve block approach is better than the periprostatic block in the pain control in men&#xD;
      undergo a transperineal prostate biopsy.&#xD;
