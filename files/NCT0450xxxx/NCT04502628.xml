  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potentially curative&#xD;
      therapy for many malignant or nonmalignant hematological diseases. Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC)&#xD;
      is one of the common and major causes of morbidity in patients undergoing allo-HSCT. Its&#xD;
      incidence ranges from 7 to 52%, and its manifestations range from painless microscopic&#xD;
      hematuria to severe bladder hemorrhage, leading to clot formation within the urinary tract&#xD;
      and even renal failure. This complication results in much pain to the patient and increasing&#xD;
      treatment cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late-onset HC (two weeks after stem cell infusion) has been associated with reactivation of&#xD;
      viruses, including cytomegalovirus, polyoma BK and JC viruses, and adenovirus types I and II.&#xD;
      Former studies have confirmed that the bladder is also considered to be one of the immune&#xD;
      attacked organs in acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). The classic treatments for HC&#xD;
      include hydration, alkalization, and bladder irrigation, immunosuppressant reduction, and&#xD;
      platelet transfusion. Patients with viral infection may be treated with antiviral agents, but&#xD;
      their efficacy is limited. When the HC was considered to be associated with aGVHD, some&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids will be added in. However, too intensive&#xD;
      immunosuppressive measures leave the patients susceptible to infection and, in turn,&#xD;
      increases the accidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM). The mechanism underlying the&#xD;
      development of HC remains largely unidentified, and its optimal treatment has not yet been&#xD;
      established. It is important to explore novel, less-toxic, higher effective, and&#xD;
      cost-effective strategies to improve HC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elevated levels of available oxygen and partial pressure of arterial oxygen provide the&#xD;
      main benefits of Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in clinical practice that addresses these&#xD;
      areas of inadequate or poor tissue healing. HBOT is utilized as primary or adjunctive therapy&#xD;
      for many medical conditions in which tissue damage is triggered by hypoxic injury. The&#xD;
      pharmacological and physiologic effects of HBOT have direct and indirect mechanisms and&#xD;
      effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) most beneficial to that of wound healing and&#xD;
      antibacterial treatments. HBOT can stimulate fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, and&#xD;
      wound healing. It has been shown effective in the treatment of radiation-induced HC by&#xD;
      promoting fibroblast proliferation and capillary angiogenesis, decreasing edema, and&#xD;
      facilitating damaged hypoxic urothelium. Based on the above clinical and pre-clinical&#xD;
      practice, the investigators deduce that HBOT may benefit patients with HC after HSCT. In the&#xD;
      investigators' limited early-onset investigation, the investigators found HBO was largely&#xD;
      successful in 20 patients suffering HC post-allo-HSCT, showed a quick resolution or&#xD;
      improvement of HC. The investigators also observed more rapid responses in patients who&#xD;
      started HBOT earlier after the diagnosis of HC. The investigators confirmed that HBOT was&#xD;
      effective and well-tolerated in the patients, regardless of the infective- or non-infective-&#xD;
      caused HC. Therefore, the investigators design this prospective, randomized, and single-arm&#xD;
      clinical trial to establish the definitive efficacy and safety of HBOT in patients with HC&#xD;
      after allo-HSCT.&#xD;
