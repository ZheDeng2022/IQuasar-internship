  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research is to compare the effects of two different exercise&#xD;
      programs on gait function in older adults. The investigators want to determine if&#xD;
      participation in lateral stepping exercise program for six weeks will improve gait functions&#xD;
      compared to forward walking exercise program.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research is to compare the effects of two different exercise&#xD;
      programs on gait function in older adults. It is expected that improved control of foot&#xD;
      placement in the lateral stepping task will transfer to improved control during typical&#xD;
      forward walking. Moreover, it is expected that lateral stepping gait training will have a&#xD;
      greater effect on recurrent fallers older adults than on the non-fallers older adults and&#xD;
      young adults. It is also expected that the above beneficial results will be retained in a&#xD;
      follow-up test six weeks after completion of the intervention and will result in improvements&#xD;
      in common clinical balance tests that are used to assess fall risk. Therefore, in the current&#xD;
      proposal, older adults aged 65 years of age and over are being asked to participate.&#xD;
