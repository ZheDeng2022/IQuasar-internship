  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burn injury causes continuous catabolism of the skeletal muscle resulting in decreased muscle&#xD;
      strength, muscle mass and impairment of functional mobility. Purpose: The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the efficacy of combination of exercise training and protein&#xD;
      supplementation on lean body mass (LBM) and muscle strength in patients with severe burn.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty participants with severe burn &gt; 30% total body surface area (TBSA) were randomly&#xD;
      distributed into 4 equal groups of 15 participants per group. Group A (Protein+ Exercise&#xD;
      group) received oral protein supplementation, exercise program and traditional burn care,&#xD;
      group B (Protein group) received oral protein supplementation and traditional burn care,&#xD;
      group C (Exercise group) received exercise program and traditional burn care, group D&#xD;
      (Control group) received traditional burn care. LBM was measured using Dual-energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DXA) while muscle strength was measured using Biodex 3 Dynamometer System&#xD;
      before treatment and 12 weeks after treatment.&#xD;

    <description>After healing of the burn (6 weeks after injury), participants in group A and group C started resisted exercise program with a qualified therapist for 1 hour three times/week on nonconsecutive days over 12 weeks. In addition, aerobic exercises were conducted on the treadmill. Peak oxygen consumption was assessed for all patients by using the exercise test on treadmill before participation in aerobic exercises.</description>
