      The primary aim of this study is to assess cardiovascular changes (blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate, electrocardiogram/ECG) in response to mild fluid-restriction dehydration and subsequent&#xD;
      rehydration in healthy young and old people. Secondary aims are to assess changes in body&#xD;
      composition, mood, and hunger in response to mild dehydration and rehydration.&#xD;

      PARTICIPANTS: Forty healthy (no regular prescription medication use) male and females,&#xD;
      between the ages of 18-70 years, will be recruited for this randomized-control cross-over&#xD;
      study. Ideally, the investigators hope to recruit twenty &quot;younger&quot; (18-50) and twenty &quot;older&quot;&#xD;
      (50-70) participants for this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be required to participate in two separate trials (a control and&#xD;
      dehydration-rehydration trial, in randomized order), separated by at least a week. All&#xD;
      menstruating females will be tested during the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle&#xD;
      (i.e. within the first 14 days after the onset of the menstrual period). All participants&#xD;
      will present to the lab in the evening for pre-testing and then in the morning for&#xD;
      mid-testing/post-testing. With both pre-testing and mid-testing/post-testing each taking ~90&#xD;
      minutes each, plus 12-hours of fluid deprivation or regular food/fluid intake overnight, the&#xD;
      total time participating in collective study activities would be approximately 30-hours (~15&#xD;
      hours per trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES: For each of the two study trials, participants will come to the lab in the&#xD;
      evening for pre-testing and then the following morning for mid-testing/post-testing (one&#xD;
      trial). Hydration status will be assessed using blood (venipuncture), urine (spot sample),&#xD;
      body weight, and thirst rating (100mm visual analogue scale). Cardiovascular variables will&#xD;
      be assessed via heart rate, ECG, and blood pressure. Body composition will be measured using&#xD;
      a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. Mood will be assessed using the Profile of&#xD;
      Mood States (POMS) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participants present to the lab, pre-test blood, urine, body weight and composition,&#xD;
      mood and thirst/sodium/hunger ratings will be obtained. Then, to enhance sweat water losses,&#xD;
      each participant will be asked to walk on a motorized treadmill at a self-selected speed for&#xD;
      60-minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Dehydration-Rehydration trial, participants will be asked to refrain from&#xD;
      ingesting any fluid (fluid restriction) for at least 12-hours overnight (i.e. from leaving&#xD;
      the lab that evening until coming into the lab the next morning) to facilitate dehydration.&#xD;
      After mid-testing, the participants will be allowed free access to water for a 60-minute&#xD;
      rehydration period to quench their thirst (&quot;ad libitum&quot; drinking). At the end of this&#xD;
      60-minute rehydration period, post-test measures will be repeated. During the control trial,&#xD;
      the participants can eat and drink as they please during the 12-hour overnight period.&#xD;
