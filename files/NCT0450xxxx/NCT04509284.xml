  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent pain after treatment for breast cancer is a major clinical problem, affecting&#xD;
      25-60 % of the patients and is a source of considerable physical disability and psychological&#xD;
      distress. Thus, the development of novel interventions to improve pain management for these&#xD;
      patients is of clinical importance. Resistance training (RT) is a promising tool to combat a&#xD;
      variety of undesirable adverse effects due to breast cancer treatment. Further, research&#xD;
      suggests that it may also be able to provide pain-relieving benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Resistance training will improve pain perception and physical function in the&#xD;
      short- and long term compared to a non-training control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide with more than a million new cases&#xD;
      diagnosed every year [1]. Fortunately, due to better treatment options, the population of&#xD;
      long-term survivors is increasing. This poses new demands for knowledge on how to manage late&#xD;
      effects to the treatment regimen. Persistent pain after treatment for breast cancer is a&#xD;
      common and underestimated problem as well as it can be a source of considerable physical&#xD;
      disability and psychological distress [2]. Hence, the development of novel interventions to&#xD;
      improve pain management is of high clinical relevance. Resistance training (RT) is a&#xD;
      promising clinical therapeutic tool to improve a variety of adverse effects to breast cancer&#xD;
      treatment [3] and may provide several pain-relieving benefits [4]. However, the efficacy of&#xD;
      this modality for managing persistent pain after breast cancer treatment is currently&#xD;
      unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to investigate if individualized RT can&#xD;
      modulate persistent pain after breast cancer treatment, thereby improving our understanding&#xD;
      of how this modality may benefit patients and contribute to clinical guidelines for pain&#xD;
      management in this clinical population.&#xD;
