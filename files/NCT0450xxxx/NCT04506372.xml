  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized clinical trial to determine the effect of continuation&#xD;
      versus withdrawal of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor&#xD;
      blockers (ARB) in the perioperative period on postoperative complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiotensin inhibitors including angiotensin convertying enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), and&#xD;
      angiontensin receptors blockers (ARB) are frequently used to treat patients with chronic&#xD;
      hypertension. These drugs reduce morbidity and mortality on the long term. However, when&#xD;
      patients who use ACEI or ARB undergo surgery, hypotension may occur in the perioperative&#xD;
      period, which may can lead to organ hypoperfusion and damage. On the other hand, when ACEI&#xD;
      and ARB are temporarily discontinued in the perioperative period, hypertension may occur&#xD;
      which also may lead to complications. Therefore, before surgery the anesthesiologist advises&#xD;
      the patient to continue or to temporarily withdraw this drug. Importantly, it is currently&#xD;
      unclear which strategy is best, and international guidelines are disconcordant on this point.&#xD;
      Policy varies between hospitals and even between anesthesiologists: in some hospitals,&#xD;
      patients are advised to temporarily withdraw the ACEI/ARB, whilst in other hospitals patients&#xD;
      are advised to continue this drug. The latest research on this topic suggests that&#xD;
      perioperative continuation of ACEI/ARB may lead to more complications, but definitive&#xD;
      evidence is lacking. Therefore it is important to perform a randomized trial to compare the&#xD;
      two options: perioperative continuation versus withdrawal of ACEI/ARB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to determine the effect of continuation versus withdrawal of&#xD;
      ACEI and ARB in the perioperative period on postoperative complications, expressed as acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI), myocardial injury, and quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who use ACEI/ARB chronically for treatment of hypertension and who are scheduled for&#xD;
      an elective intermediate to high risk non-cardiac surgical procedure with an expected&#xD;
      postoperative length of hospital stay of at least 2 days, are eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
      Patients who use a combination pill of ACEI/ARB with a diuretic are eligible as well.&#xD;
      Patients who use a combination pill ACEIwith another drug will be excluded, as well as&#xD;
      patients who use other drugs acting on the renin aldosterone angiotensin system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is the withdrawal of ACEI/ARB in the perioperative period, i.e. 24 hours&#xD;
      before surgery until 24-48 hours after surgery. The ACEI/ARB medication is resumed on the&#xD;
      second or third day after surgery, as soon as the clinical condition allows based on&#xD;
      judgement by the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention will be compared to perioperative continuation of ACEI/ARB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for this study is postoperative acute kidney injury, defined according to&#xD;
      the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include postoperative myocardial injury, intraoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      hypotension and hypertension, length of stay in the hospital or nursing home, kidney function&#xD;
      loss and end-stage renal disease within three months after surgery, major cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, heart failure, arrhythmia,&#xD;
      stroke) within three months after surgery, all-cause mortality within three months after&#xD;
      surgery and a quality of life (QoL) assessment.&#xD;
