  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic screening is effective for timely detection of, and intervention for, suicidal&#xD;
      ideation and other mental health symptoms. The VA eScreening program is a patient self-report&#xD;
      electronic screening system that has shown promise for the efficient and effective collection&#xD;
      of mental and physical health information among Veterans. However, additional effectiveness&#xD;
      and implementation research is warranted to evaluate the impact of eScreening within VHA.&#xD;
      This study will address questions of the impact of eScreening compared to screening as usual,&#xD;
      while evaluating a multi-component implementation strategy (MCIS) for optimal enterprise&#xD;
      rollout of eScreening in VA Transition Care Management clinics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of an electronic screening&#xD;
      program called eScreening compared to standard of care paper and/or verbal screening methods&#xD;
      in VHA Transition Care Management (TCM) programs. This is a mixed methods hybrid 2,&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation, stepped-wedge (SW) trial of eScreening in eight sites. The&#xD;
      following eight sites are implementation sites where no research-related activities will be&#xD;
      conducted: Oklahoma City VA Health Care System, Chillicothe VA Medical Center, Orlando VA&#xD;
      Medical Center, VA Western Colorado Health Care System, VA Puget Sound Health Care System,&#xD;
      Roseburg VA Health Care System, VA Salt Lake City Health Care System, West Palm Beach VA&#xD;
      Medical Center. These sites will implement screening as part of routine clinical care. They&#xD;
      will not collect data and will not obtain independent IRB approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study investigators will collect the following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMR data: EMR data will extracted from the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) database. EMR data&#xD;
      will consist of 1) the number of Veterans that enrolled in the healthcare system and the date&#xD;
      and time they enrolled (144 Veterans average per month across sites), 2) the date and time&#xD;
      that they received PC-PTSD-5+I9, PHQ-2 +I9, AUDIT-C, CSSR-S, and the disposition&#xD;
      (positive/negative screen), 3) date and time they received comprehensive suicide risk&#xD;
      evaluation (CSRE), and 4) mental health care referrals. These data will be used to calculate&#xD;
      the overall rate of screening completion and referral to mental health care and the average&#xD;
      length of time to screening completion. The investigators will also collect age, sex, race,&#xD;
      and ethnicity data to include as covariates in the models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      eScreening system: the investigators will use the eScreening reports functionality to pull&#xD;
      eScreening usage data for the sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff participants: approximately 4-8 Transition Care Management staff (primarily social&#xD;
      workers, but could include Medical Support Assistants or other professionals) at each of the&#xD;
      8 VHA sites who have direct or indirect involvement with implementation of eScreening will be&#xD;
      asked to take part in this research. Participation will involve one 30-minute individual&#xD;
      telephone survey/interview, two 60-minute individual telephone interviews, and one 20-minute&#xD;
      online survey. The interviews and surveys will focus on assessing the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the eScreening implementation strategy; factors affecting adoption,&#xD;
      implementation, and sustained use of eScreening; and post implementation outcomes. All data&#xD;
      from staff will be collected virtually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following is a detailed description of the study procedures, timeline, data, and&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 6-month start up period involving planning and site randomization, the stepped-wedge&#xD;
      trial will begin. This stepped-wedge trial relies on sequential roll-out to participating&#xD;
      sites over time, while using other sites as controls until they begin implementation and&#xD;
      facilitation. The eight participating sites will be stratified by size (a combination of&#xD;
      number of TCM staff and average number of post-9/11 Veterans enrolled per month) and block&#xD;
      randomized to four step/crossover cohorts of two sites each. All step/crossover cohorts will&#xD;
      go through a 3-month pre-implementation (Pre-Imp) phase, followed by a 9-month active&#xD;
      implementation using the eScreening MCIS. The eScreening MCIS will begin with a 3-month&#xD;
      period that will include eScreening software provision, training, RPIW, and blended&#xD;
      facilitation followed by 6 months of ongoing blended facilitation (9 months total). After the&#xD;
      active implementation, all sites will have a 9-month sustainment period. Multiple types of&#xD;
      data will be collected, including electronic medical record data, staff measures and&#xD;
      interviews, field notes, and time motion tracking (described below). Data collection will&#xD;
      begin at pre-implementation for each site and continue through sustainment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Start up (0 to 6 months):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and internal facilitators. Sites will be stratified by size, block randomized&#xD;
      into four step/crossover cohorts, and engaged in selecting the internal facilitators, who&#xD;
      will be serving as site eScreening implementation champions during the study. During site&#xD;
      selection, the investigators identified champions who support the use of eScreening and who&#xD;
      have established relationships with the TCM team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finalize Materials. The qualitative lead co-investigator along with the PI and the&#xD;
      implementation science expert will guide the development and pilot testing of the study&#xD;
      questionnaires, time and adaptation trackers, and interview guides using PRISM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lean/Six Sigma RPIW training. The investigators' team has over 7 years of experience&#xD;
      implementing eScreening in diverse clinical settings, using the RPIW approach. To prepare for&#xD;
      formal RPIW facilitation, two external facilitators will be trained to facilitate eScreening&#xD;
      RPIWs, including the primary facilitator (master's level) and a backup (the PI) by a&#xD;
      blackbelt level Lean/Six Sigma expert in the Systems Redesign program at San Diego Healthcare&#xD;
      System. As part of the training, the external facilitators will facilitate two formal&#xD;
      eScreening RPIWs with implementation sites not participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finalize training materials. The investigators' team has developed an eScreening VA Pulse&#xD;
      Site to make accessing technical information and training materials easy for staff. The site&#xD;
      includes frequently asked questions, tutorial videos, a technical manual and user guide, a&#xD;
      large amount of training information, and the eScreening playbook. In collaboration with the&#xD;
      eScreening OIT team, the investigators will update these materials to include the most recent&#xD;
      information on eScreening and to support the training protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stakeholder Meeting: Building upon several preliminary meetings with national and facility&#xD;
      stakeholders, the investigators will host a formal teleconference start-up meeting with&#xD;
      National TCM leadership, site internal facilitators, VA OIT eScreening Program Manager, VA&#xD;
      Innovations staff, and the PI and co-investigators and research staff. The aim of this&#xD;
      meeting is to orient everyone to the goals of the study, communicate the national stakeholder&#xD;
      preferences for the content and frequency of interactions, and identify and address possible&#xD;
      logistical barriers and facilitators. The 2-hour meeting will use a storyboard format to&#xD;
      describe procedures and generate discussion through a structured focus group format employed&#xD;
      in prior work. These meetings will occur every six months during the study. An external VHA&#xD;
      advisory group, which includes Veterans, will review the research materials and plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stepped-Wedge Trial (7 to 45 months):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on preliminary work, the investigators anticipate a sample of 45 TCM and related staff&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this study. Patient level data will be collected from EMR (for which the&#xD;
      investigators will apply for a HIPPA waiver), and no Veterans will directly participate.&#xD;
      Recruitment procedures will be reviewed, and adjusted, if needed, in the startup period, but&#xD;
      the proposed procedure will be as follows: 1) Internal facilitators, TCM staff and eScreening&#xD;
      implementation-related stakeholder staff at each site will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study; 2) An informational session about the study's leadership and purpose, selection of&#xD;
      participants, and use of data will be conducted. Potential staff participants will be&#xD;
      informed that their participation is entirely voluntary and their decision about&#xD;
      participation will not affect their employment, merit, or promotion. Following this&#xD;
      informational session, research staff consent interested participants. After consent has been&#xD;
      signed, enrolled staff members will receive a link to an online survey and will be scheduled&#xD;
      for a preliminary interview by the evaluation lead. If staff turnover occurs, the&#xD;
      investigators will attempt to assess the staff member prior to leaving and replace and train&#xD;
      another participant with similar functions within the clinic. Each of the four step/crossover&#xD;
      cohorts will go through the following phases sequentially during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-implementation (Pre-Imp) phase. This phase will last 3 months during which the research&#xD;
      team will work with the internal facilitators to: 1) gather pre-implementation information&#xD;
      including detailed information on the processes in place for TCM screening upon enrollment ;&#xD;
      2) identify points of contact for iPads and other logistical needs; 3) establish&#xD;
      communication with TCM staff and others working with the TCM staff; 4) recruit staff&#xD;
      participants for the study; and 5) begin ongoing tracking of process data from field notes&#xD;
      and time motion tracking. TCM staff names, clinic names, note titles, scheduling the RPIW,&#xD;
      and clinical reminders completed by program staff will be gathered and used for subsequent&#xD;
      development of user accounts and content customization during the implementation phase. The&#xD;
      implementation team will also provide psychoeducation to the staff on the importance of&#xD;
      screening. This phase will serve as an attention control condition to which the baseline&#xD;
      control and intervention conditions will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During pre-implementation, TCM teams will continue usual screening procedures. These involve&#xD;
      interview or self-report, paper-based collection of post-9/11 screening measures, including&#xD;
      the system-wide standardized assessments of depression, PTSD and alcohol use (PHQ-2 +I9,&#xD;
      PCPTSD +I9, and Audit-C, respectively). Patients who score positive on the PHQ-2 +I9, PCPTSD&#xD;
      +I9 are then administered the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), which collects&#xD;
      more information regarding risk of suicide. Veterans who are positive on C-SSRS then receive&#xD;
      a Comprehensive Suicide Risk Evaluation and are referred for appropriate follow-up. A&#xD;
      detailed description and flow map of the current screening process at each site will be&#xD;
      developed by the external facilitator (research team) and internal facilitator (site staff)&#xD;
      with information from the TCM staff prior to the implementation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Implementation (MCIS): The eScreening MCIS was developed over the past seven years and&#xD;
      consists of: 1) eScreening software provision, 2) training, 3) RPIW, and 4) ongoing blended&#xD;
      facilitation. The investigators developed the MCIS to address specific eScreening&#xD;
      implementation barriers found in prior research. In order to address system level barriers&#xD;
      related to OIT support, the investigators developed a technical support infrastructure for&#xD;
      eScreening using existing VA IT resources (see LOS) as part of eScreening provision. The&#xD;
      training component addresses educational barriers regarding eScreening use and the research&#xD;
      available. Blended facilitation also addressed educational barriers as well as, technology&#xD;
      related and other unforeseen challenges. The RPIW process will address, leadership support,&#xD;
      staff buy-in, resources needed and by engaging all stakeholders in the process and developing&#xD;
      a site-specific and clear plan for implementation. The RPIW specifically includes a section&#xD;
      where the team generates possible barriers and solutions in day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      eScreening. eScreening is a VHA program that allows Veterans to answer self-report screening&#xD;
      questions via an iPad connected to the VHA secure Wi-Fi. eScreening reads from and writes to&#xD;
      the VHA EMR. The highlighted features of eScreening include: 1) the ability for Veterans to&#xD;
      enter screening information directly without the involvement of a clinician; 2) immediate&#xD;
      scoring of measures; 3) an editable note generated in the EMR; and 4) clinician alerts for&#xD;
      positive mental health screens that require follow-up for suicide risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training. eScreening training will be virtual and asynchronous and include a 1-hour&#xD;
      instructional PowerPoint that will be presented by the external facilitator. The PowerPoint&#xD;
      is followed by an hour of tutorial videos showing all steps of (creating assessments, adding&#xD;
      Veterans, saving to VistA, searching for assessments, creating scheduled appointment&#xD;
      assessments, accessing reports). Hands-on training for users will be available in group&#xD;
      format or individually by the training staff as requested by the TCM site staff. Additional&#xD;
      training materials can be accessed via the eScreening Pulse site which include a series of&#xD;
      quick guides to address eScreening customization, assessment set-up and dashboard use.&#xD;
      Frequently asked questions will also be available on the Pulse site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RPIW. The 3-day RPIW will facilitated virtually by the external facilitator with assistance&#xD;
      from the onsite internal facilitator and will include the TCM team, related staff (i.e.,&#xD;
      medical support staff, clerks), and other site stakeholders. The first day of the process&#xD;
      will train participants in the RPIW principles and will introduce a summary of the&#xD;
      information gathered in the Pre-Implementation Phase, including a graphic of the current&#xD;
      state process map which will then be refined and finalized. The second day consists of&#xD;
      collective efforts to map a targeted future state, conduct a gap analysis, and identifying&#xD;
      relevant factors and barriers unique to the site. The third day is dedicated to the&#xD;
      repetition of action planning, execution, and reevaluation to finalize the targeted state and&#xD;
      identify clinically meaningful goals for improvement. Using a Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA)&#xD;
      framework, the plans to achieve the target state are enacted with a detailed plan that&#xD;
      includes who, what, when for each step in the plan. Due to the flexibility of eScreening and&#xD;
      the implementation strategy, each TCM program may choose to integrate eScreening into their&#xD;
      workflow based on the specific needs of their program, available resources, and other&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blended facilitation. Blended facilitation will include a primary external facilitator from&#xD;
      the eScreening team who will work with the site internal facilitator to schedule meetings,&#xD;
      training sessions, and phone calls. The external facilitator will be the main point of&#xD;
      contact for implementation-related questions. The internal facilitator, selected during the&#xD;
      startup period, will work with the external facilitator to navigate internal site systems&#xD;
      (i.e., local leadership, OIT, logistics) and serve as a champion for the eScreening project&#xD;
      at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Data Sources &amp; Timing for Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a mixed-methods design and will collect a combination of quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative data from multiple stakeholders and at multiple time points. A general overview&#xD;
      of the data sources and data collection time points are provided in this section. More&#xD;
      specific data collection and analysis considerations are provided under each aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data sources and timing for data collection. Quantitative data collection&#xD;
      includes data from the EMR, the eScreening system, and surveys that will be completed by&#xD;
      staff participants. The investigators will extract EMR data at the beginning and end of&#xD;
      Pre-Imp, at the end of the MCIS period, and at 9 months post-MCIS. The investigators will use&#xD;
      the eScreening reports functionality to pull eScreening usage data for each cohort after the&#xD;
      MCIS period and 9 months post-MCIS. The investigators will conduct a Pre-Imp individual&#xD;
      telephone survey/interview using the feasibility and acceptability scales developed by Weiner&#xD;
      et al (2017). The investigators will also use a secure online survey system (i.e., Qualtrics&#xD;
      or RedCap) to collect survey elements based on the PRISM and its RE-AIM outcomes after the&#xD;
      active implementation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data sources and timing for data collection. Qualitative data will be collected&#xD;
      using field notes and interviews. The investigators will take field notes using a structured&#xD;
      template during telephone meetings/calls throughout the pre-implementation and implementation&#xD;
      stages including initial contact, during the RPIW, and the facilitation contact sessions.&#xD;
      Research staff will take extensive field notes to describe the clinical environment, work&#xD;
      flows, patient population, and relational atmosphere. Individual telephone interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted with purposefully selected site staff during pre-implementation,&#xD;
      post-implementation, and the sustainment phase. Interviews will focus on factors affecting&#xD;
      adoption, implementation, and sustained use of eScreening. Both mindset and practical issues&#xD;
      will be explored to illustrate implementation issues, challenges, and underpinnings of&#xD;
      success. A specific set of probes will outline, and diagram tasks involved step-by-step to&#xD;
      document barriers and facilitators and when communication and coordination were needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 Data collection and analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate eScreening, compared to paper and verbal screening, guided by the RE-AIM&#xD;
      outcomes of PRISM in 8 TCM programs, using a cluster randomized, stepped wedge design.&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1 (Reach): Compared to paper and verbal screening, eScreening will yield a&#xD;
      significantly higher rate of screening. Hypothesis 2 (Effectiveness): 2a: Compared to paper&#xD;
      and verbal screening, eScreening will result in significantly less time for mental health and&#xD;
      suicide screening. 2b: Compared to paper and verbal screening, eScreening will result in&#xD;
      significantly higher rate of referral to needed care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. The investigators will obtain a HIPAA waiver to collect the following data:&#xD;
      1) the number of Veterans that enrolled in the healthcare system and the date and time they&#xD;
      enrolled (144 Veterans average per month across sites), 2) the date and time that they&#xD;
      received PC-PTSD-5+I9, PHQ-2 +I9, AUDIT-C, CSSR-S, and the disposition (positive/negative&#xD;
      screen), 3) date and time they received comprehensive suicide risk evaluation (CSRE), and 4)&#xD;
      mental health care referrals. These data will be used to calculate the overall rate of&#xD;
      screening completion and referral to mental health care during the baseline control period&#xD;
      and the average length of time to screening completion. The same data will be collected for&#xD;
      the previous nine months post- implementation and sustainment. Based on the average&#xD;
      enrollment data for the investigators' sites over the past year, approximately 27,600&#xD;
      Veterans will enroll in VA healthcare during the 27-month baseline control, Pre-Imp, post&#xD;
      MCIS, and Sustainment data time-periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power calculation: the investigators powered the study for the intervention&#xD;
      effect of the effectiveness outcomes in Aim 1. The investigators assumed a common&#xD;
      intervention effect across all cohorts/steps and Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) to&#xD;
      account for clustering, including a fixed effect for cohort/step of crossover to account for&#xD;
      secular trends and an indicator of intervention phase change (e.g., control vs. intervention)&#xD;
      to provide intervention effects. Power was calculated based on established methods for SW&#xD;
      trials. The investigators set type I error rate alpha = 0.05, Cohen's d (or h for binary&#xD;
      outcomes) effect size = 0.1, power = 0.8, and assumed an intraclass correlation (ICC) = 0.20,&#xD;
      which is a conservative estimate based similar studies. Under these assumptions, the&#xD;
      estimated sample size needed for the proposed study is approximately N = 5,000 participants.&#xD;
      Data from the investigators' pilot study show effect sizes that are all above this detectable&#xD;
      effect sizes. Given that 144 new post-9/11 Veterans are enrolled on average across&#xD;
      implementation sites each month and the investigators will collect data at each site over a&#xD;
      24-month period, the study is sufficiently powered to detect effect sizes observed in similar&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing. Data analyses will proceed in stages and will&#xD;
      follow the recommendations of the Prevention Science and Methodology Group for randomized&#xD;
      field trials. Preliminary data screening and cleaning will require examination of the data&#xD;
      distributions for normality and missing data patterns at both the univariate and multivariate&#xD;
      level. Missing data are expected to be limited and are readily incorporated in HLM if the&#xD;
      data can be assumed to be missing at random using Maximum Likelihood estimation. If the data&#xD;
      are determined not to be missing at random, missing data mechanisms will be built into the&#xD;
      target statistical models. HLM will be used as the primary statistical model due to the&#xD;
      nested (or clustered) structure of the data (veterans [level 1] nested within TCM clinics&#xD;
      [level 2] nested within implementation site [level 3]), with random assignment occurring at&#xD;
      the implementation site level. HLM is a flexible modeling strategy that allows for the&#xD;
      integration of fixed and random effects in nested/clustered data structures with normal and&#xD;
      non-normal response variables. Demographic information about participants during the MCIS and&#xD;
      control phases will be statistically compared within and between sites to ensure&#xD;
      comparability. Any characteristics that differ between the intervention and control groups&#xD;
      will be included as covariates in subsequent models to minimize bias. Fixed effects will be&#xD;
      included in each model to account for study phase (i.e., baseline control, Pre-Imp/attention&#xD;
      control, MCIS, and sustainment) and step/crossover cohort, to account for secular trends. The&#xD;
      investigators will also be able to test interactions between study phase and step to&#xD;
      determine whether intervention effects differed by cohort and whether intervention effects&#xD;
      varied between TCM clinics within implementations sites. Separate models will be tested to&#xD;
      determine whether a greater proportion of Veterans were screened for mental health and&#xD;
      suicide risk (Reach) and referred to care (Effectiveness) during the MCIS and/or sustainment&#xD;
      phases relative to the baseline and/or attention control phases. Additional models will test&#xD;
      whether the mean number of days between enrollment and screening were lower (Effectiveness)&#xD;
      during the MCIS and/or sustainment phases relative to the baseline and attention control&#xD;
      phases. In all analyses, the investigators will set statistical significance at =0.05 and use&#xD;
      Holm-Bonferroni adjustments for 5 tests and false discovery rate methods for &gt;6 tests. When&#xD;
      multiple correlated outcomes (dependent outcomes) are analyzed with each hypothesis,&#xD;
      corrections will be calculated based on the effective number of independent tests when&#xD;
      applying the multiple comparison procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 Data collection and analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact of the MCIS, guided by&#xD;
      the RE-AIM outcomes of PRISM, adoption, implementation, and maintenance using mixed methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. The investigators will use a mixed methods approach and collect both&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative data guided by the RE-AIM outcomes of PRISM. For the replication&#xD;
      cost, the investigators will use the a time tracker previously used for VA implementation&#xD;
      efforts. The tool will be customized for this study and used to incrementally capture all&#xD;
      facilitation activity by the external facilitator. Activities will then be quantified and&#xD;
      used to develop a replication cost estimate by site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data analysis. The investigators will use descriptive statistics to summarize&#xD;
      quantitative measures for each PRISM outcome using 50% as a benchmark. Adoption will be&#xD;
      calculated as the overall number and proportion of TCM clinics that are willing to initiate&#xD;
      eScreening, relative to the total number of TCM clinics across implementation sites and&#xD;
      within each implementation site, as well as the overall number and proportion of providers&#xD;
      who are willing to adopt eScreening relative to the total number of providers across&#xD;
      implementation sites, across TCM clinics at each implementation site, and within each TCM&#xD;
      clinic. Implementation will be calculated as the proportion of TCM clinics and providers&#xD;
      within clinics who implement eScreening. The investigators will also calculate mean ratings&#xD;
      of the acceptability and feasibility of the MCIS across providers within TCM clinics and&#xD;
      across implementation sites. Time tracker data will be analyzed using the VA general ledger,&#xD;
      which includes all labor costs including employee benefits and employer contributions to&#xD;
      taxes. Indirect costs should be incurred in proportion to direct costs and will be estimated&#xD;
      based on VA Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) guidance. Maintenance will be calculated&#xD;
      as the proportion of TCM clinics and providers within clinics who implement eScreening during&#xD;
      the sustainment phase (i.e., the 9-month period following initial implementation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data analysis. Study investigators or an experienced, trained member of the study&#xD;
      team will conduct semi-structured interviews. Interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed&#xD;
      by the VA CTSP, and entered into the qualitative software program, ATLAS.ti. A key aspect to&#xD;
      this analysis is to answer these questions: What influences adoption of eScreening by&#xD;
      providers? What factors influenced the implementation of eScreening? What factors promote&#xD;
      maintenance? The analysis will also answer the bigger question of why providers do or do not&#xD;
      implement eScreening, including understanding any practical clinic work flow reasons for use&#xD;
      or non-use, or key underlying characteristics of eScreening program or provider. The analysis&#xD;
      will consider emergent themes using an editing approach. Two project team members will&#xD;
      independently code the semi-structured interview data collected. A third team member will&#xD;
      assess coding quality and resolve conflicts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Convergent analysis. Using a mixed-methods convergent design, the qualitative research core&#xD;
      team will analyze the data concurrently with the quantitative data to explain and&#xD;
      support/refute the quantitative data and add to insights regarding future implementation&#xD;
      research and dissemination efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 Data collection and analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Describe and compare high and low eScreening reach sites guided by contextual&#xD;
      constructs of PRISM using qualitative comparative analysis to explore factors influencing the&#xD;
      reach of eScreening and the use of the eScreening MCIS. In Aim 3, qualitative data from&#xD;
      contextual elements of PRISM will be used to construct comparative analysis between high and&#xD;
      low eScreening reach sites. Questions and measures assessing the PRISM contextual dimensions&#xD;
      will be included in the proposed interviews and field notes (qualitative data) and will also&#xD;
      be informed by the proposed surveys and EMR data (quantitative data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis. Qualitative data will be analyzed as described for aim 2, but the&#xD;
      investigators will use a template approach for the analysis using constructs from contextual&#xD;
      factors. The investigators will use codes identified and created based on the PRISM&#xD;
      constructs and other emergent themes to tag the relevant transcript quotations. Quotation&#xD;
      reports will list the associated quotations verbatim by site. Sites will be divided by high&#xD;
      vs. low reach using a cutoff score of 30% (from Aim 1), based on prior work. Qualitative&#xD;
      comparative analysis (QCA) will allow us compare high and low eScreening reach sites to&#xD;
      identify factors influencing the implementation of eScreening and the impact of the MCIS&#xD;
      using systematic cross-case comparison to better understand causal complexity. The&#xD;
      investigators will list and count different combinations of variables in the data set, and&#xD;
      then apply logical inference rules to evaluate whether alternative inferences are supported&#xD;
      by the data. Using the investigators' outcome of interest (i.e. high reach) and a list of&#xD;
      conditions (i.e. contextual factors) that may be associated with that outcome the&#xD;
      investigators will develop calibration metrics using a crisp dichotomous set. Calibration&#xD;
      involves considering how each site is related to the pre-defined PRISM concept using specific&#xD;
      decision rules. The investigators will establish a codebook detailing the conditions and&#xD;
      decision rules. Third, the investigators will calibrate the data. Specifically, using coded&#xD;
      data, each site will be calibrated dichotomously as either &quot;having&quot; (1.0) or &quot;not having&quot;&#xD;
      (0.0) each condition. After the investigators' sites are calibrated, the investigators will&#xD;
      construct a truth table, using Stata, to analyze logical combinations of conditions to&#xD;
      determine if specific combinations share the outcome. Using Boolean logic, the investigators&#xD;
      will minimize the truth table to arrive at pathways to the outcome. The pathways will then be&#xD;
      assessed using the consistency and coverage parameters of fit. A thematic analysis of site&#xD;
      interview data will be used to supplement QCA findings.&#xD;
