  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability after multiple-dose&#xD;
      administrations of macitentan with titration regimen starting from Dose 1 once daily (qd) up&#xD;
      to Dose 2 qd in Japanese healthy adult male participants (Part 1) and to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of food on pharmacokinetics of macitentan and its active metabolite (ACT-132577) in Japanese&#xD;
      healthy adult male participants with macitentan Dose 3 tablet (Part 2).&#xD;

    <measure>Part 1: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to that medicinal product. The following are the AEs of special interest in this study: Hypotension: symptomatic hypotension or potentially clinically meaningful decrease in blood pressure, Edema/fluid retention: clinically relevant signs and symptoms of edema and/or fluid retention, Hemoglobin decrease/anemia: events of hemoglobin decrease from baseline of greater than (&gt;) 20 gram per liter (g/L), Liver events: liver aminotransferase abnormalities.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the&#xD;
             results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal&#xD;
             reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the&#xD;
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This&#xD;
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood pressure (after the participant is supine for 5 minutes) between 90 and 140&#xD;
             millimeter of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90 mmHg diastolic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A participant must wear a condom when engaging in any activity that allows for passage&#xD;
             of ejaculate to another person. Male participants should also be advised of the&#xD;
             benefit for a female partner to use a highly effective method of contraception as&#xD;
             condom may break or leak. Recommended highly effective methods of contraception in&#xD;
             this study for female partners of male participants to use in addition to the male&#xD;
             participant wearing a condom during include: oral hormonal contraception, intrauterine&#xD;
             device, intrauterine hormone-releasing system and bilateral tubal occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A participant must agree not to donate sperm for the purpose of reproduction during&#xD;
             the study and for a minimum 90 Days after receiving the last dose of study&#xD;
             intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nonsmoker or smoker habitually smokes no more than 10 cigarettes or equivalent of&#xD;
             e-cigarettes, or 2 cigars, or 2 pipes of tobacco per day for at least 6 months before&#xD;
             first study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or current clinically significant medical illness including (but not&#xD;
             limited to) cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease,&#xD;
             coagulation disorders (including any abnormal bleeding or blood dyscrasias), lipid&#xD;
             abnormalities, significant pulmonary disease, including bronchospastic respiratory&#xD;
             disease, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below&#xD;
             80 (milliliter per minute) mL/min calculated using Cockcroft-Gault equation), thyroid&#xD;
             disease, neurologic or psychiatric disease, infection, or any other illness that the&#xD;
             investigator considers should exclude the participant or that could interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of the study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry, or&#xD;
             urinalysis at screening or at admission to the study site as deemed appropriate by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are squamous and&#xD;
             basal cell carcinomas of the skin or malignancy, which is considered cured with&#xD;
             minimal risk of recurrence)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to macitentan or its excipients&#xD;
