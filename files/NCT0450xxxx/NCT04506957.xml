      This study is a data collection/sampling project for transcutaneous continuous Pulse&#xD;
      CO-Oximetry and accessories (SW-Version Radical-7® Pulse CO-Oximeter with the Masimo rainbow&#xD;
      SETTM, V1.6.2.4i Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA, USA, and the RD rainbow SET-2, Rev-O&#xD;
      Fingersensor). The device received the CE Mark in 2012 and is approved by the Swiss Medic for&#xD;
      clinical use. The Radical-7 device isolates multiple (7+) wavelengths of light of arterial&#xD;
      signals using adaptive filters. It provides continuous noninvasive monitoring of arterial&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (RadSpO2), pulse rate (RadPR), carboxyhaemoglobin saturation (SpCO),&#xD;
      methaemoglobin saturation (SpMET), total haemoglobin concentration in g/dl (SpHb) and/or&#xD;
      respiration rate (RRa). Additionally, Low Signal IQ (Low SIQ), Perfusion Index (PI), Pleth&#xD;
      Variability Index (PVI), total arterial oxygen content (SpOC), Haematocrit (SpHCT), Signal&#xD;
      identification Quality (SIQa), Respiration Indicator (RI) are displayed.The purpose of this&#xD;
      prospective study is to investigate the reliability of non-invasive continuously measured&#xD;
      SpHb by the Masimo Radical-7® Pulse co-oximeter (Radical 7 device) under steady state&#xD;
      conditions by comparison against simultaneously invasive measured arterial haemoglobin&#xD;
      concentrations (CoOxHb) in major spine surgery patients, in which high blood loss was&#xD;
      expected&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this investigation is the comparison of CoOxHb, HCT and SaO2 values of a&#xD;
      blood gas analyzer (ABL 825, Radiometer Medical A/S) with simultaneously measured SpHb values&#xD;
      of the Radical 7 device during the procedure of major spine surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is the reliability of SpHb to detect CoOxHb and its changes&#xD;
      during the process Secondary endpoint is the reliability of RadSpO2, RadPR, SpHCT and SpMET&#xD;
      to detect SaO2, PR, HCT and MetHb and its changes during the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients scheduled for major spine surger&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age 18 years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Written consent of the participation after clarification about the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No consent to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No German comprehension&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Black skin patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients with COVID-19 illness All patients were monitored based on the institutional&#xD;
           routine monitoring for major spine surgery (continuous 2-channel electrocardiogram, a&#xD;
           continuous invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring via fluid-filled cather system,&#xD;
           inserted in the radial artery mainly of the non-dominant hand, SpO2, and in the case of&#xD;
           high-risk patient a triple-lumen central venous line). Then a single use finger sensor&#xD;
           (MasimoSet RD rainbow SET SpHb SpMet-Sensor) is attahed to the ring finger of the hand,&#xD;
           where the catheter is introduced in the radial artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the surgery routinely, arterial blood samples are drawn before induction of&#xD;
      Anaesthesia, every 45 min and after acute blood loss during surgery. With each blood sample&#xD;
      for a blood gas analysis the SpHb, SpMet, PI, PVI and the low SQI are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No additional blood sampling is necessary to perfom this investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients will be included and the duration of the study is 24 month's Sample size&#xD;
      calculation was performed with the StatsDirect Statistical Software Version 2.8.0 2013&#xD;
      (StatsDirect Ltd, Altrincham, UK) and revealed a sample size of 95 paired SpHb and CoOxHb&#xD;
      measurements to achieve a power of 0.9, α = 0.05 to detect a mean difference (bias) of CoOxHb&#xD;
      and SpHb of 0.50 g/dl with an estimated standard deviation (SD) of 1.0g/dl. The mean&#xD;
      difference is determined based on previous investigations. Continuous variables are tested&#xD;
      for normal distribution with the Kolmogorov-Smirnow test. Normally distributed data are&#xD;
      expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD); median, interquartile range (IQR ; 25th to 75th&#xD;
      percentile) and [maximum] are specified when the data were not normally distributed.&#xD;
      Categorical variables are presented as number and percentage (%). For subgroup analysis&#xD;
      continuous variables are compared using the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, when appropriate.&#xD;
      All tests are two-sided and a P-value &lt; 0.05 was determined to be significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all determinants that might have an impact on the fault detection of the SpHb stepwise&#xD;
      multiple regressions analysis was performed. Correlation is evaluated by Spearman rank test.&#xD;
      To determine agreement of the methods, the Bland Altman analysis for repeated measurements is&#xD;
      performed for SpHb and CoOcHb.&#xD;
