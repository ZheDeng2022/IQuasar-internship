  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effects of amino acids on the rate of water absorption and availability as a&#xD;
      precursor fluid for sweat. Young and healthy (male or female) volunteers will take part in&#xD;
      three experimental trials. In each trial, volunteers will be given one of two commercially&#xD;
      available sports drinks or a commercially available sport drink with added amino acids in a&#xD;
      double-blinded, randomised, crossover design. Each drink will be a single 550 mL bolus. All&#xD;
      beverages will be labelled with deuterium (D2O). Trials will be compared for temporal&#xD;
      accumulation of deuterium in plasma over the course of 60 minutes and in urine (60 min).&#xD;
      Whole blood measurements of haemoglobin and haematocrit will also be made and plasma volume&#xD;
      changes calculated. It is hypothesised that the amino acid trial will increase the rate of&#xD;
      fluid absorption.&#xD;
