      The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of eating disorders in type 1&#xD;
      insulin-dependent diabetes patients&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of developing an eating disorder is increased in type 1 diabetes patients and&#xD;
      associated with a poor prognosis in terms of glycemic control, metabolic complications,&#xD;
      degenerative complications, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the terminology &quot;diabulimia&quot; has emerged to characterize an eating disorder&#xD;
      specific to type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes patients, with insulin under dosage with a view&#xD;
      of losing or controlling weight and that can contribute to a deterioration of the body&#xD;
      composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of eating disorders in an adult&#xD;
      cohort with type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes.&#xD;

    <description>To determine eating disorder prevalence in differentiated adult men and women with type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes.&#xD;
Patients answer to the SCOFF-F questions :&#xD;
do you make yourself sick because you feel uncomfortably full?&#xD;
do you worry that you have lost control over how much you eat?&#xD;
have you recently lost more than one stone in a 3 month period?&#xD;
do you believe yourself to be fat when others say you are too thin?&#xD;
would you say that food dominates your life?&#xD;
Every &quot;yes&quot; attributes one point and gives a final score between 0 and 5; a score ≥2 indicates an eating disorder.</description>

A &quot;yes&quot; answer means that patient underdoses insulin treatment.</description>
