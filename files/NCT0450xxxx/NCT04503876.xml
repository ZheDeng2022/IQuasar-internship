  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PEEP titration is a recommended during invasive mechanical ventilation of ICU patients.&#xD;
      However, little is known about the right way to conduct this titration. PEEP titration can be&#xD;
      conducted by a stepwise increase in PEEP level, or following an ARM and a consecutive&#xD;
      stepwise decrease in PEEP level. Those 2 methods will be explored in intubated ICU patients&#xD;
      either with healthy lung or ARDS lungs. Physiological exploration will include end-expiratory&#xD;
      lung volume measurements, driving pressure, compliance and electro-impedance tomography at&#xD;
      each PEEP level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Management of ICU patients may require the use of ventilatory support requiring tracheal&#xD;
      intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any mechanically ventilated patient is exposed to the formation of atelectasis (collapsed&#xD;
      pulmonary alveoli), which occurs systematically after endotracheal tube insertion, after any&#xD;
      de-recruiting action (tracheal suction, disconnection) or simply if protective ventilation is&#xD;
      used, combining small tidal volumes (6 to 8 mL/kg of theoretical ideal body weight - IBW) and&#xD;
      an end-expiratory positive pressure (PEEP) that is sometimes insufficient. It is thus&#xD;
      proposed to perform alveolar recruitment maneuvers (ARMs), which remove atelectasis by&#xD;
      temporarily increasing intrathoracic pressure. To avoid alveolar re-collapse, it is necessary&#xD;
      to apply a sufficient level of PEEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The opening pressure (P) necessary for the re-expansion of a collapsed alveolus is inversely&#xD;
      proportional to its radius (r), following Laplace law P = 2.γ/r where γ is the surface&#xD;
      tension. The pressure necessary to the re-expansion of a collapsed cell depends on its&#xD;
      radius. Amato's team has showed in 2006 that within the same lung, several levels of alveolar&#xD;
      aeration and thus several opening pressures coexist. The distribution of pressures was&#xD;
      bimodal, with a peak around 30 cmH2O and a second around 40 cmH2O. Consequently, to allow&#xD;
      complete re-expansion of atelectasis within a lung, it is necessary to apply a pressure at&#xD;
      least equal to 30 cmH2O. The application of insufficient pressures cannot be expected to&#xD;
      result in complete re-expansion of the lung, but rather in an increase in aeration of already&#xD;
      aerated alveoli (whose radius is larger and whose opening pressure is much lower), what, in&#xD;
      turn, can lead to over-distension. This is probably what can happen if the PEEP is increased&#xD;
      without any previous ARM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of an ARM can also lead to an overdistension phenomenon during a reduced&#xD;
      period of time (20 to 30 seconds), contrary to the direct application of a high PEEP which&#xD;
      could led to an overdistension lasting a much longer period of time (possibly several hours)&#xD;
      and aggravated with each administration of a tidal volume (and thus several times per&#xD;
      minute). Chronic lung exposure to overdistension phenomena can induce a disintegration of&#xD;
      alveolar collagen fibers (volotrauma), leading to local inflammation (biotrauma) and systemic&#xD;
      inflammation by releasing pro-inflammatory molecules (cytokines...) into the bloodstream and&#xD;
      led to apoptosis in distant organs (kidney, digestive tract for example).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimization of mechanical ventilation requires the search for the optimal PEEP:&#xD;
      insufficient, it cannot prevent atelectasis formation; too high, it would lead to alveolar&#xD;
      overdistension. In current practice, the PEEP is determined arbitrary or following a stepwise&#xD;
      titration, either by incremental or decremental steps. To date, scientific literature is not&#xD;
      unequivocal concerning the use of ARMs and their safety. Thus, some teams prefer not to use&#xD;
      ARMs and usually apply an upward PEEP level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concepts presented above are valid both in patients with healthy lungs and in patients&#xD;
      with &quot;sick&quot; lungs, the archetype and most severe form of which is acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS), which is a frequent pathology in ICU (10 to 20% of patients admitted). Its&#xD;
      definition is based on the Berlin criteria published in 2012. The morality varies between 30&#xD;
      and 40% depending on the severity of the respiratory impairment. Management of patients&#xD;
      suffering from ARDS requires an optimization of oxygenation, which is based first of all on&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, whether invasive or not. Since the ARDS Network study published in&#xD;
      2000 in the New England Journal of Medicine, it has been globally accepted that tidal volumes&#xD;
      should be reduced to no more than 6 mL/kg IBW. Ventilatory management is based on concepts of&#xD;
      &quot;baby lung&quot; and &quot;open lung&quot;. These concepts explain that it is mandatory to consider that the&#xD;
      lung volume available for mechanical ventilation is very small compared to the healthy lung&#xD;
      volume (baby lung) and that the reduction in tidal volume must be accompanied by adjustments&#xD;
      to keep the lung &quot;open&quot;, combating the formation of atelectasis by the use of sufficient PEEP&#xD;
      and ARMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Far from this pulmonary pathology, any mechanically ventilated patient, whether in the ICU or&#xD;
      operating theatre, must benefit from a protective strategy. Any inadequate adjustment of the&#xD;
      ventilation parameters can lead to lung lesions induced by mechanical ventilation (VILI,&#xD;
      Ventilator Induced Lung Injuries) and to lesions similar to those observed during ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose to explore the impact on pulmonary aeration and ventilatory parameters&#xD;
      of two different strategies of PEEP optimization during invasive mechanical ventilation in&#xD;
      healthy lungs and ARDS ICU patients. This randomized controlled study would allow us to&#xD;
      validate our hypotheses, depending on the respiratory mechanics and patient's pulmonary&#xD;
      disease.The final aim of this study is to determine the effects of a strategy based on the&#xD;
      application of an ARM followed by decremental PEEP titration, compared to an incremental PEEP&#xD;
      strategy without ARM, on pulmonary and ventilatory physio-(patho)-logical parameters in ICU&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

The study consists of comparing pulmonary pathophysiological parameters for different PEEP levels. The first strategy implies the use of an ARM followed by a stepwise decremental PEEP titration whereas the second considers a stepwise incremental PEEP titration without any previous ARM, during controlled invasive mechanical ventilation.

    <description>PEEP will be titrated in a stepwise decremental fashion following a standardized alveolar recruitment maneuver (ARM). The ARM is a progressive increase of intra-thoracic pressure (pressure controlled mode), with a constant driving pressure of 10 cmH2O and PEEP steps (10-15-20-25-30-35 and 40 cmH2O), reaching a maximum pressure of 50 cmH2O, allowing full recruitment. PEEP steps will be conducted every 2 cmH2O (from 20 to 6 cmH2O), every 5 minutes.</description>
