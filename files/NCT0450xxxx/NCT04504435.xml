  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, first time in human (FTIH)&#xD;
      study to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of a single dose of GSK3494245. The study&#xD;
      will consist of 3 cohorts, conducted in a sequential manner. Cohorts 1 and 2 will consist of&#xD;
      a single ascending dose (SAD), crossover design where each participant will receive a maximum&#xD;
      of 3 ascending oral doses of GSK3494245 and 1 placebo dose under fasted conditions. At each&#xD;
      dose level, GSK3494245 and placebo will be administered in a 3:1 ratio, within each period,&#xD;
      according to the randomization schedule in a blinded manner. Cohort 3 will comprise of a&#xD;
      2-way crossover which includes 1 dosing regimen under fasted then fed conditions and 1&#xD;
      regimen under fed then fasted conditions in a 1:1 ratio. The fed conditions will investigate&#xD;
      the effect of safety, tolerability and PK of a single dose of GSK3494245 following food&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
