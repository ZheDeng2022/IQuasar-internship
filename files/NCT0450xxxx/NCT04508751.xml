  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an ongoing public health problem that is difficult to treat. There is evidence&#xD;
      that obesity has fetal origins. Body composition, including visceral, subcutaneous, brown,&#xD;
      and hepatic fat have been found to be important predictors in obesity and metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can quantify body composition that does not require&#xD;
      radiation but is motion limited. The investigators have developed a motion-compensated MRI&#xD;
      sequence, also known as &quot;free breathing&quot; MRI. In this study, the investigators plan to obtain&#xD;
      free-breathing MRIs of pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy. MRIs will be&#xD;
      obtained from healthy mothers, mothers with growth-restricted fetuses, and mothers with&#xD;
      gestational diabetes. The different types of adipose tissue will be measured and compared&#xD;
      between groups and correlated to birth growth parameters. The goal is this study is to assess&#xD;
      if motion-compensated MRI can help predict early growth patterns in infancy.&#xD;

      1.1 OBJECTIVE This study's goals are to: 1) use free-breathing magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (FB-MRI) to measure fetal body composition in the third trimester and 2) determine how the&#xD;
      FB-MRI quantitative measurements compare to growth parameters at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 HYPOTHESES AND SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish the investigators' objectives, the aims and hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective study in women with healthy pregnancies and women with fetuses that have&#xD;
      intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and gestational diabetes, the investigators will&#xD;
      quantify fetal subcutaneous, visceral, and brown adipose tissue volumes and proton-density&#xD;
      fat fraction (PDFF) using FB-MRI in the third trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Using a FB-MRI technique the investigators will find the following,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The growth-restricted fetus will have less visceral, subcutaneous, and brown adipose&#xD;
           tissue volume and PDFF when compared to healthy fetuses and fetuses whose mothers have&#xD;
           gestational diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fetuses whose mothers have gestational diabetes will have a greater subcutaneous and&#xD;
           visceral adipose tissue volume and PDFF compared to healthy fetuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective study in pregnant women and their fetuses, the investigators will compare&#xD;
      volume and PDFF measurements of fetal visceral, subcutaneous, and brown adipose tissue&#xD;
      obtained with FB-MRI to birth growth parameters of these infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The volume and PDFF of fetal visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue will&#xD;
      correlate positively with birth weight and length z-score.&#xD;

    <description>Patient will have a fetal MRI performed in the third trimester. All MRI scans will be performed on 3 T scanners (e.g., Skyra or Prisma, Siemens). Our newly developed FB-MRI quantification technique leverages a multi-echo 3D stack-of-radial sampling trajectory with golden-angle acquisition ordering to suppress motion artifacts and enable free-breathing imaging of the abdomen in around 5 minutes. In addition, our FB-MRI technique is compatible with data under sampling to accelerate the free-breathing scan to 1-2 min. In this study, we will optimize the parameters of our FB-MRI technique (spatial resolution, spatial coverage, acceleration factor) to balance trade-offs between scan time, image quality, fat quantification accuracy, and patient comfort/compliance. Subjects will be provided ear plugs to limit amount of noise from MRI machines.&#xD;
Maternal demographics, pregnancy clinical course and infant growth parameters will be recorded.</description>
