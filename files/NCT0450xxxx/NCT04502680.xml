  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase-II study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of maintenance treatment with eribulin mesylate following standard&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy in triple negative breast cancer patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease with high relapse rates and&#xD;
      poor overall survival. This study explores the role of maintenance treatment with eribulin&#xD;
      following standard adjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC. Patients will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      eribulin mesylate maintenance treatment or observation after standard adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the disease free survival (DFS). The secondary objective&#xD;
      is to evaluate the overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and the safety of&#xD;
      eribulin mesylate maintenance treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient volunteers and signs an informed consent form;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years old, female;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient was diagnosed as triple-negative breast cancer by histopathology (ER&#xD;
             negative (IHC ER positive percentage &lt;1%), PR negative (IHC PR positive percentage&#xD;
             &lt;1%), HER2 negative (IHC-/+ or IHC++ but FISH/CISH- )), and there is no evidence of&#xD;
             metastasis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients underwent radical or breast conserving surgery combined with sentinel lymph&#xD;
             node biopsy for primary breast cancer. Margins free of disease and ductal carcinoma&#xD;
             in-situ (DCIS) are required. Lobular carcinoma is not considered a positive margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients who have previously received neoadjuvant therapy for triple-negative&#xD;
             breast cancer containing anthracyclines and taxanes, the postoperative efficacy&#xD;
             evaluation did not reach pathological complete remission (non-PCR), that is, the&#xD;
             primary breast and/or metastatic regional lymph nodes still have histological evidence&#xD;
             of malignant tumors other than carcinoma in situ;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients who have not received neoadjuvant therapy for triple-negative breast&#xD;
             cancer, ≥1 ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes have pathological tumor involvement after&#xD;
             surgery. Or the patient's postoperative lymph nodes are negative, but at least meet&#xD;
             one of the following conditions:&#xD;

                  limit of normal (ULN) *1.5; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate&#xD;
                  aminotransferase (AST) ≤ULN*2.5;&#xD;
