  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is enough evidence to suggest that scrub typhus and spotted fever group rickettsioses&#xD;
      are common causes of febrile illness in India. Serological evidence also exists for murine&#xD;
      typhus, but is rarely tested for. Incidence, risk factors, clinical features and molecular&#xD;
      epidemiology of these three infections are poorly understood. Delays in disease recognition&#xD;
      and treatment may cause thousands of preventable deaths across India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the research are to determine the incidence and risk factors of scrub&#xD;
      typhus, spotted fever and murine typhus by severity, to determine clinical features of these&#xD;
      neglected and often unrecognized infections. Further to study the effect of previous&#xD;
      infection on incidence and severity of subsequent infections. Finally to study the&#xD;
      association between vector parameters and scrub typhus risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled will be 30,000 individuals who will be followed up for the development of fever&#xD;
      using active and passive surveillance. Active surveillance will include household screening&#xD;
      every 3-6 weeks. Fever cases occuring in the past two months will be tested for Scrub typhus,&#xD;
      murine typhus and spotted fever IgG/IgM. 4000 individuals will be followed up by annual&#xD;
      serological testing to identify asymptomatic infections. Participants notifying the study&#xD;
      team with ongoing fever will undergo blood testing for acute diagnosis of rickettsial&#xD;
      infection (IgM, PCR). In addition, we will enroll fever cases at study clinics who are not&#xD;
      part of the main cohort. The research includes spatial and socio-economic risk factor&#xD;
      analysis. Rodents carrying mite larvae will be trapped to compare the intensity of mite&#xD;
      infestation between areas of high and low risk for human scrub typhus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data on incidence, burden of disease and environmental determinants of scrub typhus,&#xD;
      spotted fever and murine typhus will be used for health care planning and information&#xD;
      campaigns for the public and medical professionals.&#xD;

      The aim of the cohort study is to better understand the epidemiology, sero-epidemiology and&#xD;
      transmission of scrub typhus, murine typhus and tick-borne spotted fever. The overall focus&#xD;
      of the work will be on scrub typhus, being the most important of the three from the public&#xD;
      health perspective. We aim to determine the &quot;severity pyramid&quot; of serological, symptomatic&#xD;
      and severe infection. The results from this study will help clinicians to understand the&#xD;
      natural course of scrub typhus infection, health policy makers to estimate the global burden&#xD;
      and the scope for community-based interventions, and immunologists to better understand the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of single and repeat infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Estimate the incidence of symptomatic and severe scrub typhus infection in the&#xD;
           community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Estimate the incidence of serological (asymptomatic) scrub typhus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Estimate the effect of previous scrub typhus infection (sero-positive at baseline) on&#xD;
           the risk of subsequent infection and disease severity (subclinical vs clinically&#xD;
           apparent). This includes the effect of antibodies in mothers on the risk of severe&#xD;
           infection in young children via residual maternal antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Estimate the effect of potential risk factors such as age, gender, occupation,&#xD;
           water/sanitation access and comorbidity on the risk of scrub typhus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Estimate the effect of spatial-temporal risk factors for scrub typhus by identifying&#xD;
           high risk areas, accounting for human population density and land use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Compare the rate of rodent trappings and vector parameters of chiggers between high risk&#xD;
           and low risk areas identified under 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Estimate the disease burden associated with scrub typhus and the economic impact of&#xD;
           scrub typhus in terms of loss of earnings and health expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Estimate the incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic murine typhus and spotted fever&#xD;
           infection and explore associated socio-demographic, spatial and vector-related risk&#xD;
           factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OVERVIEW&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a population-based cohort study over two years (i.e. two scrub typhus&#xD;
      seasons) in about 30,000 people living in approximately 40 villages with a sero-prevalence of&#xD;
      at least 15% (see flow diagram above). These individuals will be followed-up through active&#xD;
      surveillance for recent febrile illnesses (clinical cohort). For passive surveillance,&#xD;
      participants will be encouraged to notify the study team in case of fever or come to one of 4&#xD;
      local study clinics. At study clinics we will also enrol fever cases who are not part of the&#xD;
      clinical cohort, i.e. have not been enrolled prior to their fever. The study will include a&#xD;
      smaller cohort (sero-cohort) for serological surveillance of 4000 people drawn from the&#xD;
      30,000 people of the clinical cohort. Longitudinal serological surveys linked to active&#xD;
      surveillance are essential to estimate true attack rates unbiased by disease severity. The&#xD;
      sero-cohort will consist of three annual blood testing in the same group of participants over&#xD;
      two scrub typhus seasons (baseline, inter-season, endline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population- A pilot study showed that scrub typhus infection is highly focal This&#xD;
      makes it difficult to define a target population for the purpose of making inferences. We&#xD;
      will define the target population in terms of the village level sero-prevalence. The aim is&#xD;
      to correlate the incidence of scrub typhus with the sero-prevalence at village level. This&#xD;
      will allow using the results of the study to predict the expected incidence and burden of&#xD;
      scrub typhus in other settings with a known sero-prevalence, and eventually estimate the&#xD;
      global burden of scrub typhus (not part of the study but a potential extension of the work).&#xD;
      The target population for the study is therefore &quot;villages in which the IgG sero-prevalence&#xD;
      is at least 15%&quot;.&#xD;
