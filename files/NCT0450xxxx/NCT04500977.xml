  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants were graduates of our previously implemented diabetes prevention program&#xD;
      (DPP), in which women learned the health dangers involved in a sendentary life style, and&#xD;
      unhealthy diet, a lack of planned physical activity, insufficient personal health management,&#xD;
      and smoking. The importacne of adopting a healthy lifestyle, and how to achieve this goal was&#xD;
      stressed. The 24 graduates most motivated to empower others were chosen to take part in this&#xD;
      12 session leadership program. In the leadership program, women were taught more about the&#xD;
      manner in which to bring about a change in one's health by adopting a healthy lifestyle,&#xD;
      leadership, and facilitation skills and the development, implementation, and evaluation&#xD;
      process required to conduct a community program that will impact society as a whole. Women&#xD;
      learned how to map needs and resources, define goals and objectives, implement and evaluate a&#xD;
      community based program. Following frontal training, three action grousp were established.&#xD;
      Each group was responsible for developing and implementing a program in the community.&#xD;
      Programs based on initiatives set during the first stage of the DPP included: working in&#xD;
      schools to promote a healthy lifestyle, community work targeting non-working/homemaker women&#xD;
      ages 25+, enhancing physical activity in the community, and empowering teens. Together, all&#xD;
      of these initiatives: increased awareness of fast food dangers, increased awareness to the&#xD;
      dangers of nargillah smoking, and increased awareness as to the importance of physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
