  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at the safety and effectiveness of different drugs in treating COVID-19 in&#xD;
      people who have been hospitalized with the infection. Participants in the study will be&#xD;
      treated with either a study drug plus current standard of care (SOC), or with placebo plus&#xD;
      current SOC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a master protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational&#xD;
      agents aimed at modifying the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, or directly&#xD;
      enhancing viral control in order to limit disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol is for a randomized, blinded, controlled platform study that allows&#xD;
      investigational drugs to be added and dropped during the course of the study. This allows for&#xD;
      efficient testing of new drugs against placebo and standard of care (SOC) treatment within&#xD;
      the same study. When more than one drug is being tested at the same time, participants will&#xD;
      be randomly allocated to treatments or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by study site pharmacy and disease severity. There are 2&#xD;
      disease severity strata: Participants without organ failure (severity stratum 1); and&#xD;
      participants with organ failure (severity stratum 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly review interim analyses&#xD;
      and summarize safety and efficacy outcomes. For investigational drugs with minimal&#xD;
      pre-existing safety knowledge, the pace of enrollment with be initially restricted, and there&#xD;
      will be an early review of safety data by the DSMB. For the study of each agent, at the&#xD;
      outset of the trial, only participants in disease severity stratum 1 will be enrolled. This&#xD;
      will continue until approximately 300 participants are enrolled and followed for 5 days. The&#xD;
      exact number will vary according to the speed of enrollment and the timing of DSMB meetings.&#xD;
      Prior to expanding enrollment to also include patients in disease severity stratum 2, safety&#xD;
      will be evaluated and a pre-specified futility assessment by the DSMB will be carried out&#xD;
      using 2 ordinal outcomes assessed at Day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both ordinal outcomes are used to assess futility because it is currently unclear whether the&#xD;
      investigational agents under study will primarily influence non-pulmonary outcomes, for which&#xD;
      risk is increased with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in part, through mechanisms that may be&#xD;
      different from those that influence pulmonary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For investigational agents passing this futility assessment, enrollment of participants will&#xD;
      be expanded, seamlessly and without any data unblinding, to include participants in disease&#xD;
      severity stratum 2 as well as those in disease severity stratum 1. Future interim analyses&#xD;
      will be based on the primary endpoint of sustained recovery and will use pre-specified&#xD;
      guidelines to determine early evidence of benefit, harm or futility for the investigational&#xD;
      agent. Participants will be followed for 18 months following randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The international trials within this protocol will be conducted in several hundred clinical&#xD;
      sites. Participating sites are affiliated with networks funded by the United States National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health (NIH) and the US Department of Veterans Affairs.&#xD;
