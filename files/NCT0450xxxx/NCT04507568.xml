  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, investigator initiated, randomized controlled study of&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer who will be receiving radiation therapy as per SOC. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomized in either the person-centered model-of-care versus the standard model of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the person-centered model-of-care will have a 30 minute education&#xD;
      session with a radiation therapist in addition to RT SOC procedures. Patients randomized to&#xD;
      the standard model of care will be treated as per SOC. Questionnaires will be administered to&#xD;
      both arms at baseline, and at the first and last day of treatment. In addition to the main&#xD;
      study, patients will have the option to participate in a semi-structured one on one interview&#xD;
      upon completion of their radiotherapy course.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy plays an integral role in the definitive treatment of breast cancer by&#xD;
      reducing the risk of locoregional recurrence and improving patient outcomes. Despite the&#xD;
      availability of supportive care services, many patients have unmet needs which may lead to&#xD;
      unexpected negative outcomes. Anxiety can affect patients' ability to cope, interfere with&#xD;
      treatment and self-manage their own care. Strategies to improve cancer care include patient&#xD;
      navigators or case managers, early interventions and self-management of side effects to&#xD;
      reduce treatment-related toxicities. Therefore, minimizing distress from treatment and&#xD;
      engaging patients by personalizing care according to their unique needs will optimize use of&#xD;
      supportive care services and improve clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cochrane review demonstrated that information and supportive care sessions delivered by&#xD;
      non-physician healthcare providers improves both emotional wellbeing and quality of life in&#xD;
      breast cancer patients. A prospective randomized, Australian study by Halkett et al.&#xD;
      demonstrated that an education intervention delivered one-on-one by Radiation Therapists&#xD;
      effectively reduces breast cancer patients' psychological distress and improves preparedness&#xD;
      for treatment. This highlights the importance of early and accessible education resources&#xD;
      where patients experience direct access to the radiation therapy team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further research is required to investigate the efficacy of person-centered model on patient&#xD;
      experiences and relevant clinical outcomes. Specifically, it is expected this model will&#xD;
      reduce patient anxiety, improve preparedness for radiation therapy through education, and&#xD;
      improve patient self-management of radiation-toxicities. The proposed study focuses on&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer because of the experience in testing the model on this group and&#xD;
      their relatively uniform treatment at all Ontario cancer centres, which will facilitate&#xD;
      translation of this model in the future. A randomized controlled study will determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of the person-centered model versus standard care, and generate high-quality&#xD;
      evidence in an unbiased setting that was not possible in the prior clinical pilot phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personalizing patient experiences in radiotherapy, coupled with improvements in treatment&#xD;
      quality and supportive care, may improve clinical outcomes including toxicity and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
