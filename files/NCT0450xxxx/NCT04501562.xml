      Specific Aim 1: To determine longitudinal changes in CV ageing (changes in CV imaging) over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There are differences in rates of CV ageing over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To study determinants of CV ageing To assess how biological pathways affect&#xD;
      CV ageing by studying the relationships between biological signatures measured in&#xD;
      longitudinal biospecimens are associated with CV ageing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Antecedent biological markers are associated with progression of CV ageing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine the impact of CV ageing progression on the development of&#xD;
      clinical CVD and the overall physical, cognitive and functional health of the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Those with stable CV imaging phenotypes have lower incidence of clinical CVD and&#xD;
      also better overall health in ageing, compared to those with rapid deterioration (unhealthy&#xD;
      CV ageing).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Singapore, elderly residents aged 65 years and above make up 10.5% of our population and&#xD;
      this is expected to double in 2030 (Singapore Department of Statistics, Ministry of Manpower,&#xD;
      Registry of Birth and Deaths, September 2014). Cardiovascular diseases account for the&#xD;
      majority of disability-adjusted life years by broad cause group, accounting for 20% of&#xD;
      399,675 life years lost due to mortality and ill-health in 2010 (Source: Estimates from the&#xD;
      Singapore Burden of Disease Study 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While chronological ageing is inevitable, a clear understanding is needed as to how ageing&#xD;
      becomes a critical risk component of CVD for some individuals, and the mechanisms through&#xD;
      which ageing results in such a vulnerable phenotype that leads towards clinical CVD.&#xD;
      Following that, clinical tools and clinical guidelines to reduce cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      other health burdens contributed by ageing may be formulated. Such strategies may potentially&#xD;
      reduce burdens and cost of healthcare provision to the ageing population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposal will generate data that identifies functional and structural changes in the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system that occur in during ageing. Using a longitudinal design, this research&#xD;
      will provide high quality evidence that distinguishes healthy from unhealthy cardiovascular&#xD;
      ageing, and reveal determinants and impact of CV ageing over time on CVD and associated&#xD;
      health outcomes.&#xD;
