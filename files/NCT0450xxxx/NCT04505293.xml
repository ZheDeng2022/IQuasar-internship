  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and&#xD;
      negative predictive values of the a portable near-infrared-based device (portable NIR-based&#xD;
      device), the InfraScanner 2000™, to detect intracranial hematomas (epidural hematomas (EDH)&#xD;
      and/or subdural hematomas (SDH)) in patients hospitalized at Mbarara Regional Referral&#xD;
      Hospital (MRRH) who have sustained or who are suspected to have sustained head trauma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When applicable (conscious patient and/or family or legally authorized representative is&#xD;
      present) the study will be introduced to the patient and relevant parties prior to the&#xD;
      research team approaching the patient. While head trauma frequently results in impaired&#xD;
      cognition and/or consciousness, and due to the urgency of these circumstances patients are&#xD;
      often not accompanied by kin, whenever appropriate, the purpose of the research and the&#xD;
      procedure will be explained in detail with all questions answered to the patient's and/or&#xD;
      representative's satisfaction. Because patients who sustain head trauma injuries typically&#xD;
      remain within the hospital for multiple days for monitoring and care, each participant may&#xD;
      undergo multiple Computed Tomography (CT) scans over the course of his or her&#xD;
      hospitalization, affording the opportunity of one to numerous measurements from each patient&#xD;
      during his or her hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon presentation to the casualty unit at MRRH and following each CT scan, the study team&#xD;
      will approach the patient to scan the patient's cranium with the InfraScanner 2000™ (Image&#xD;
      A). If permission is granted, the study team member sequentially measure the optical&#xD;
      absorption for each of the 8 quadrants of the scalp (frontal, temporal, parietal, and&#xD;
      occipital bilaterally) (Image B). The device is engineered such that the light emitter and&#xD;
      receiver are spaced 4 cm apart, allowing the light's intensity to be measured between&#xD;
      adjacent light guides (Image C). This entire procedure, including greeting and scanning the&#xD;
      patient should take &lt;10 minutes. Subsequent CT scan(s) the patient receives determines the&#xD;
      number of potential data collections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient and/or representative may refuse a scan during any encounter, and as such, the&#xD;
      scan will not be done. For each patient scanned with the InfraScanner 2000™ they will be&#xD;
      de-identified with a subject number, with age, sex, gender, skin color, hair color, hair&#xD;
      thickness, mechanism of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and mean time elapsed between CT&#xD;
      scan and near-infrared measurement. These data will be stored in de-identified form on the&#xD;
      Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database and/or Microsoft Excel 2016 on a secured&#xD;
      network drive within the Department of Neurosurgery at Duke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection period for each research subject concludes 30-days following his or her&#xD;
      initial measurement with the InfraScanner 2000™, patient discharge, or patient death.&#xD;

    <description>All patients entered onto the trial will undergo at least one cranial scanning using the InfraScanner 2000™ upon arrival to the casualty unit at MRRH following CT. Patients will be scanned using the InfraScanner 2000™ following each subsequent CT as allowed by patient or representative. Patients will know the results of the CT but not the InfraScanner 2000™. The standard for comparison will be determined as follows. A CT result that is positive for hematoma will be considered a true positive and a CT result that is negative for hematoma will be considered a true negative. In cases where the results of the CT are negative for hematoma and the results of the InfraScanner 2000™ are positive consideration of further follow-up will be given on a case-by-case basis.</description>
