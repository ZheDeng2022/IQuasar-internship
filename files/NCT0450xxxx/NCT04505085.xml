  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a&#xD;
      community-delivered physical activity program for fathers and their children ages 2-5 years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate the feasibility of a community-based father-child physical&#xD;
      activity promotion program. The investigators will work with a local Parks and Recreation&#xD;
      department to recruit and deliver programming to three cohorts of fathers and their children&#xD;
      2-5 years old. To evaluate program feasibility, the investigators will assess recruitment&#xD;
      efforts, program attendance, and participant engagement and satisfaction with the program.&#xD;
      The investigators will also assess change in father-child outcomes post program including&#xD;
      objectively measured physical activity, fathers' parenting, and father involvement.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A non-randomized quasi-experimental design will be used to evaluate the feasibility of the Active Dads Healthy Families intervention, and provide preliminary data of changes over time and between three forms of the intervention. The investigators will recruit three cohorts totaling 45 father-child dyads (15 per cohort) to take part in the 8-week program delivered by Parks and Recreation. The primary outcome is program feasibility.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The intervention will include outdoor education and physical activity opportunities at various outdoor parks. The program will be held one day a week for eight consecutive weeks. Parks and Recreation will facilitate and run the program. Each session will last 60 minutes and include a brief educational discussion and opportunities for various games and activities. Each session will have a special theme relevant to the outdoors. Families will also receive a home toolbox to facilitate activity and learning outside of the program. Feedback on physical activity will be provided at the beginning and the end of the program.</description>
