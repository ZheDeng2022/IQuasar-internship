      Randomized clinical trial, international, multicentre, single-blind, two parallel groups,&#xD;
      pragmatic. It will be carried out by investigators in several Latin American countries&#xD;
      (Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru) and with random allocation 1:1 of the participants to&#xD;
      Usual Care Group (UCG) or Intervention Group (IG). Each country will select 5 trial sites&#xD;
      that will recruit 0-60 participants. Finally, 1050 subjects will be involved in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome are the changes in function and quality of life as measured by changes in&#xD;
      the scores used to assess them between baseline and 1-year follow-up. Function will be&#xD;
      assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery-SPPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is focused on an older population (≥ 65 years) with diabetes and a frail or&#xD;
      prefrail status&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational program in small groups: 7 sessions in the clinical trial sites (2 sessions a&#xD;
      week for the first 3-4 weeks) Exercise program (16 weeks): learning phases in clinical trial&#xD;
      site for 3-4 first week (coincident with the educational program sessions) and the rest at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptation of targets of HbA1c and blood pressure (BP). UCG Usual care group consists in&#xD;
      level of care usually given in Health Care system.&#xD;

      International, multicentre, single-blind, two parallel groups, pragmatic randomised Research&#xD;
      Clinical Trial. It will be carried out by investigators in several Latin American countries&#xD;
      (Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru) and with random allocation 1:1 of the participants to&#xD;
      Usual Care Group (UCG) or Intervention Group (IG). Each country will select 5-7 trial sites&#xD;
      that will recruit 51 participants (255 participants per country) except Mexico which will&#xD;
      select 2 sites to recruit 50 participants each one (100 participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a National lead investigator in each involved country. This National lead&#xD;
      investigator will be trained by the general coordinator team in the procedures of the study.&#xD;
      Each National lead investigator will be responsible for the training in his/her country. In&#xD;
      each country, the lead will select the recruitment trial sites (5-7 in each country) and each&#xD;
      trial site will recruit 51 participants approximately except in Mexico (see above). All data&#xD;
      will be collected in an eCRF (electronic case report form) platform designed specifically for&#xD;
      this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is focused on an older population (≥ 65 years) with diabetes and a frail or&#xD;
      prefrail status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: To assess the effectiveness of a multi-modal intervention in subjects with&#xD;
      type 2 Diabetes Mellitus aged ≥ 65 years who are frail or pre-frail in terms of function and&#xD;
      quality of life in comparison with usual clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in the frailty status (trajectories of frailty: frail to prefrail; frail to&#xD;
           robustness; prefrail to robustness and vice versa).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence rate of symptomatic hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic coma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence rate of hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence rate of permanent institutionalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carer burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory biomarkers of prognostic value for response to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual clinical practice is the level of usual health care that a patient with diabetes&#xD;
      receives from their local national health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Optimal glycosylated hemoglobin range between 7.6-8.5% (60-69 mmol/mol) and optimal&#xD;
           blood pressure: &lt;150/90 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physical exercise program that will be used will be the Vivifrail program, developed in&#xD;
           Europe (Erasmus + UE). Vivifrail includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Strength exercises for arms and legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Balance and gait, to avoid falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Resistance. The duration of the training program will be 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nutritional and educational program: The intervention is designed to increase diabetes&#xD;
           knowledge, develop practical self-care skills for diabetes, and increase the likelihood&#xD;
           of improving glycemic control safely. The intervention aims to minimize the risk of&#xD;
           hypoglycemia, ensure optimal nutritional status, and help maintain functional status.&#xD;
