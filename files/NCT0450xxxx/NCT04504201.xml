  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comorbidities in breast cancer survival account for 49% of overall survival difference&#xD;
      between black and white women. Many obesity-related comorbidities disproportionately affect&#xD;
      black women, therefore pointing to a need to address obesity related comorbidities in&#xD;
      survival disparities in early breast cancer patients. This study tinvestigates how messages&#xD;
      and messaging about healthy weight can be tailored for racially diverse breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors with obesity in order to ensure that clinic-based communications between patients&#xD;
      and their oncology provider are patient-centered and culturally sensitive.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this research is to collect essential input for the future development of&#xD;
      a quality improvement intervention to foster &quot;Patient-Center Communication about Healthy&#xD;
      Weigh in clinical practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Understand patient-centered perspectives on health weight communication with oncology&#xD;
           clinicians by conducting focus groups&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Understand oncology clinician perspectives on patient center communications for healthy&#xD;
           weight interactions through semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
