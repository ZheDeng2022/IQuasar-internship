    <textblock>
      International guidelines recommend giving positive pressure ventilation (PPV) by face mask to&#xD;
      newborns who do not breathe or have a slow heart rate at birth. Preterm infants are at high&#xD;
      risk of developing respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and many are treated with continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Though the&#xD;
      majority of preterm infants breathe spontaneously at birth, many clinicians routinely apply a&#xD;
      face mask to preterm infants shortly after birth in the delivery room (DR) to give them CPAP.&#xD;
      However, applying a face mask may inhibit spontaneous breathing in newborns. In this study,&#xD;
      premature babies will be randomly assigned to have a face mask routinely applied for CPAP&#xD;
      shortly after birth; or to have a face mask selectively applied only for PPV if they are not&#xD;
      breathing or have a slow heart beat in the first 5 minutes of life, or for CPAP if they have&#xD;
      signs of respiratory distress after 5 minutes. The investigators will determine whether fewer&#xD;
      participants who have the mask selectively applied receive PPV in the DR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Newly born babies have fluid-filled lungs that they must quickly aerate after birth. Compared&#xD;
      to infants born at term, preterm babies have greater difficulty in establishing and&#xD;
      maintaining aeration of their lungs; this leaves them at increased risk of developing&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Infants who develop RDS are treated with nasal&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and may progress to treatment with surfactant and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Neonatal Task Force of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) makes&#xD;
      recommendations on the treatment of infants at birth. ILCOR recommends assessing the&#xD;
      breathing and heart rate (HR) of all newborns, and:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Giving positive pressure ventilation (PPV) to babies who have a HR &lt; 100bpm, gasping or&#xD;
           apnoea&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Considering giving CPAP to babies who have laboured breathing or persistent cyanosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most preterm infants breathe spontaneously at birth. Despite this, the majority of preterm&#xD;
      infants have a facemask applied for respiratory support immediately after birth, usually&#xD;
      before the HR has been determined. Clinicians presumably do this to give early support to&#xD;
      infants they believe are at high risk of developing RDS in an attempt to prevent or lessen&#xD;
      the severity of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is little evidence that giving preterm infants prophylactic nasal CPAP may be superior&#xD;
      to supportive care with oxygen. A study that compared nasopharyngeal CPAP to supportive care&#xD;
      with oxygen performed before antenatal steroids were routinely given found no difference in&#xD;
      the rate of development of RDS with the application of CPAP. Two more recent studies did not&#xD;
      show that early application of nasal CPAP reduced the rate of intubation or treatment with&#xD;
      surfactant. In these studies CPAP was given by nasal prongs and was started at 15 - 30&#xD;
      minutes of life, not immediately with a facemask. There is no evidence that facemask CPAP&#xD;
      immediately after birth prevents or reduces the severity of RDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of a face mask has been demonstrated to inhibit spontaneous breathing in many&#xD;
      term infants. Cold gas flow, such as that provided by a T-piece, can inhibit spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing in term infants. Application of a face mask for breathing support appears to&#xD;
      inhibit breathing in a greater proportion of preterm infants. Considerable force is applied&#xD;
      to the head when face mask PPV is given to a mannequin in the supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routinely applying a face mask for respiratory support may be unnecessary in many premature&#xD;
      babies. It may inhibit their spontaneous breathing and result in them receiving facemask PPV&#xD;
      more frequently in the DR. It may also affect how well they breathe in the first day of life&#xD;
      and increase the rate of treatment with nasal CPAP in the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION AND GROUP ASSIGNMENT Participants will be randomly assigned to &quot;SELECTIVE&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;ROUTINE&quot; groups in a 1:1 ratio. The group assignment schedule will be generated in blocks of&#xD;
      4 using a random number table, and will be stratified by gestational age (23 - 27, 28 -&#xD;
      31+6). It will be kept on a concealed from investigators and treating clinicians. Group&#xD;
      assignment will be written on cards and placed in sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque&#xD;
      envelopes. Infants of multiple gestations will be randomised as individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The envelopes will be contained in 2 boxes for GA strata and kept in the NICU. The next&#xD;
      envelope in the sequence will be taken from the appropriate box and brought to the DR, where&#xD;
      it will be opened just before delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MASKING It is not possible to mask caregivers to group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALL INFANTS Infants in both groups will have their umbilical cord clamped at or after 1&#xD;
      minute of age; they will not have a mask applied for respiratory support during this time.&#xD;
      Infants will then be transferred to resuscitaire, placed supine under radiant heat and have a&#xD;
      hat applied. All infants will be placed in polyethylene bag. A pulse oximeter will be placed&#xD;
      on the right wrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A T-piece device (Neopuff, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare, Auckland NZ; or Dräger Resuscitaire&#xD;
      (Drager healthcare, Lübeck, Germany) and round face mask (Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare,&#xD;
      Auckland NZ) of appropriate size for the baby will be used to give respiratory support to&#xD;
      infants in both groups. The T-piece will have gas flow set at 8 - 10 L/min, with settings&#xD;
      PEEP 6cmH2O, and PIP 25cmH2O. There will be an air/oxygen blender in the circuit and the FiO2&#xD;
      will be initially set at 30%. The FiO2 will not be adjusted before 5 minutes of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELECTIVE GROUP Infants assigned to the &quot;SELECTIVE&quot; group will be placed supine to breathe&#xD;
      spontaneously. If SpO2 &lt; 70% at 5 minutes and their respiratory effort is good, they will be&#xD;
      given give free flow oxygen (i.e. the mask will be placed in front of, but not directly in&#xD;
      contact with, the infant's face). The FiO2 may be increased at 1 minute intervals thereafter,&#xD;
      aiming for SpO2 ≥ 90% at 10 minutes of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants in the &quot;SELECTIVE&quot; group will have mask PPV if they are apnoeic or have HR &lt; 100bpm&#xD;
      at any time in the DR. Clinicians may consider applying facemask to give CPAP if the infants&#xD;
      breathing is laboured (i.e. there are signs of respiratory distress - grunting,&#xD;
      intercostal/subcostal/sternal recessions) after 5 minutes of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROUTINE GROUP Infants assigned to the &quot;ROUTINE&quot; group will be placed supine on the&#xD;
      resuscitaire and have facemask CPAP applied as soon as possible after they arrive. If SpO2 &lt;&#xD;
      70% at 5 minutes, the FiO2 may be increased at 1 minute intervals, aiming for SpO2 ≥ 90% at&#xD;
      10 minutes of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants in the &quot;ROUTINE&quot; group will have facemask PPV if they are apnoeic or have HR &lt; 100bpm&#xD;
      at any time in the DR. Mask respiratory support may be withdrawn as and when desired by&#xD;
      clinical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESUCE TREATMENT All other treatments - i.e. endotracheal intubation for PPV, chest&#xD;
      compressions, adrenaline, volume - w ill be given at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      clinicians and in accordance with ILCOR recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION To show a reduction in the proportion of babies receiving PPV with&#xD;
      routine application from 60% to 40% with selective application with 80% power and α of 0.05,&#xD;
      the investigators need to recruit 200 infants.&#xD;
