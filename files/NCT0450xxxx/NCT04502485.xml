  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the application of water exchange method to upper&#xD;
      endoscopy. We hypothesize that water exchange during upper endoscopy could reduce patient&#xD;
      discomfort. The primary outcome will be the patient discomfort score during upper endoscopy.&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes will include cleanliness score, techniques adequacy score, findings of&#xD;
      the EGD, and willing to repeat the procedure, as well as the patient and endoscopist&#xD;
      satisfaction score with the method.&#xD;

    <description>Air will be minimally insufflated to partially open the lumen and any residual fluid will be suctioned when the scope passes through the esophagus. Upon entering the fundus of the stomach the air button will be turned off. Air pocket and gastric fluids will be removed by suctioning. Distilled water, delivered by a 50-ml syringe in 10ml-to-20 ml increments, will be infused to dislodge debris and air bubbles adhering the gastric mucosa and open the lumen. The infused water will be removed to keep the lumen almost completely collapsed before the scope advance further. Air will be opened when the scope enter the prepylorus area where there is usually an air pocket. The scope will enter the duodenal bulb and 2nd portion of duodenum where withdrawal inspection will start.</description>
