      This is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase I/II clinical study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride in combination&#xD;
      with pegaspargase in patients with extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type&#xD;
      (NKTCL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase I/II clinical study with a&#xD;
      dose-escalation stage (part 1) and a dose-expansion stage (part 2). In part 1, patients with&#xD;
      treatment-naïve, relapsed/refractory extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (nasal type)&#xD;
      will be assigned to receive sequentially higher doses of liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride&#xD;
      plus a standard dose of pegaspargase every 21 days (a cycle). The dose escalation initially&#xD;
      will follow an accelerated titration design for the first two dosing groups, then follow a&#xD;
      classic 3+3 design. All dose-escalation decisions will be based on the safety data generated&#xD;
      from the currently highest dose group. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride will be determined in part 1. In&#xD;
      part 2, additional patients will be recruited into two groups,the treatment-naïve group and&#xD;
      the relapsed or refractory group, to receive liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride at the RP2D&#xD;
      combined with a standard dose of pegaspargase. All patients will receive the treatment until&#xD;
      disease progression, or observation of unacceptable grade 3 drug-related adverse events (a&#xD;
      maximum of 6 cycles).&#xD;
