  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the proposed research is to understand how human listeners learn&#xD;
      speech categories. The project takes a prospective approach with adult second-language&#xD;
      learners, blending empirical, methodological and theoretical advances from laboratory studies&#xD;
      with explicit classroom instruction. The central hypothesis is that incidentally-acquired&#xD;
      nonlinguistic perceptual building block categories may support speech perception and&#xD;
      production in a second language. The project will advance important theoretical debates about&#xD;
      the cross-talk between general auditory representations and speech categories and will&#xD;
      provide a novel approach to nudging adult learners off learning plateau typically encountered&#xD;
      in classroom instruction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Robust speech communication requires that listeners learn linguistically-relevant&#xD;
      representations for stable language regularities, such as the speech sounds (phonemes) that&#xD;
      convey meaning. In an increasingly multilingual society, as many as twenty percent of&#xD;
      Americans accomplish this across multiple languages. Yet, second language acquisition is&#xD;
      especially challenging among adult language learners, for whom learning typically involves&#xD;
      explicit classroom instruction. Troublingly, research documents that instruction routinely&#xD;
      results in a 'learning plateau' whereby language abilities stagnate or even atrophy despite&#xD;
      continued instruction. There is a need to establish effective new approaches to nudge adult&#xD;
      language learners off this plateau. This project integrates theoretical and methodological&#xD;
      developments in auditory category learning with approaches to classroom-based L2 instruction.&#xD;
      Specifically, incidental category learning (in which learners' attention is directed away&#xD;
      from to-be-learned categories by an engaging videogame) taps into category learning systems&#xD;
      distinct from those engaged in more explicit learning. Moreover, incidental learning of&#xD;
      nonspeech sound categories leads to activation of putatively speech-selective cortex&#xD;
      associated with speech categorization, suggesting potential representational cross-talk. This&#xD;
      guides the central hypothesis of the project: incidental learning of nonspeech perceptual&#xD;
      building block categories may provide a 'back door' through which to influence adult L2&#xD;
      learners' speech acquisition and to move them off the classroom learning plateau. An&#xD;
      intensive 8-week incidental training study with a 3-month retention interval will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis (Aim 1). Comparison of incidental nonspeech training with explicit L2 speech&#xD;
      training will assess whether this cognitive 'back door' may be more effective in promoting L2&#xD;
      speech perception and production than explicit training with L2 speech and will determine the&#xD;
      extent to which each interacts with classroom instruction in the L2 (Aim 2). Far transfer and&#xD;
      retention of incidental category learning will be established across measures that extend&#xD;
      beyond L2 categorization to speech production, word learning, and phonological representation&#xD;
      (Aim 3). The results will reveal whether nonspeech, auditory categories sharing common&#xD;
      perceptual dimensions with second language categories scaffold L2 acquisition, the degree to&#xD;
      which explicit instruction may support or interfere with new auditory categories, whether&#xD;
      incidental learning is retained after training, and whether learning gains transfer to&#xD;
      support other language-learning tasks. In blending empirical, methodological, and theoretical&#xD;
      advances from laboratory studies with explicit classroom learning it will be possible to&#xD;
      determine the interplay between incidentally-acquired nonlinguistic perceptual building block&#xD;
      categories and an emerging L2. This will advance important theoretical debates about the&#xD;
      cross-talk between general auditory representations and speech categories and will provide a&#xD;
      novel approach to L2 pedagogy.&#xD;
