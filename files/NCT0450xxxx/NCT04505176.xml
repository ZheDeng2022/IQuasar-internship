  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intratracheal surfactant treatment is applied in Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS)&#xD;
      Continious Positive Airway Pressure(CPAP) treatment. In recent clinical studies, two similar&#xD;
      methods have been studied with a thin catheter without endotracheal intubation in the&#xD;
      application of surfactant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our neonatal intensive care unit, respiratory support is given with nasal CPAP and&#xD;
      Humidified Heated High Flow Nasal Cannula (HHHFNC) instead of classical invasive (intubated)&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation methods. In CPAP method, heated and humidified air is given a certain&#xD;
      pressure (6-8 cmH2O), while in HHHFNC method, heated humidified air is given at a certain&#xD;
      flow rate (6-8 L / min). This study was planned to compare the results of infants who were&#xD;
      given surfactant with MIST (Minimal Invazive Surfactant Treatment) method under CPAP or&#xD;
      HHHFNC support in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in premature babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surfactant application, babies will be monitored (as in all babies in the NICU)&#xD;
      saturation, peak heart rate, perfusion index (the ratio of nonpulsatile flow in the capillary&#xD;
      bed) and t values will be recorded. For all these reasons, monitoring of PI (Perfusion&#xD;
      Index), PVI (plethysmographic variability index) and continuous transcutaneous PCO2 and PO2&#xD;
      values are of great importance for the prevention of mortality and morbidity, as well as&#xD;
      monitoring of oxygen saturation values with pulse oximetry in premature babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our hospital, it was planned to take a total of 40 patients born under 32 weeks and less&#xD;
      than 1500 grams (20 patients being in the HHHNFC, 20 patients in the CPAP group). Patients&#xD;
      will be consecutively distributed to two groups until they reach the specified number of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it was aimed to monitor continuous oxygen saturation, PI, PVI, transcutaneous&#xD;
      PO2 and PCO2 measurements just before, during and after the surfactant application and to&#xD;
      compare the results of babies who received nCPAP and HHHFNC support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, all data will be entered in an SPSS (Statistical Package for the&#xD;
      Social Sciences) file and study statistics will be made. A database will be created using&#xD;
      SPSS software. A p value of &lt;0.05 was determined as the limit of significance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In premature babies (born before 37th week of pregnancy), surfactant production is&#xD;
      insufficient since lung maturation has not been completed yet. Accordingly, surface tension&#xD;
      increases in alveoli and it is difficult to keep the alveoli open, gas exchange is&#xD;
      insufficient, and as a result, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) occurs in premature&#xD;
      babies. Severe respiratory failure occurs in the baby, it must be connected to the mechanical&#xD;
      ventilator, even if hypoxia cannot be corrected, the baby may be lost. Intratracheal&#xD;
      surfactant treatment is applied in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome, which&#xD;
      develops due to surfactant deficiency. With surfactant treatment, death due to RDS,&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation requirement, morbidity due to lung disease, hospitalization times in&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care units have been reduced and survival rates of premature babies have&#xD;
      increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraracheal surfactant treatment is applied in RDS treatment. In recent clinical studies,&#xD;
      two similar methods have been studied with a thin catheter without endotracheal intubation in&#xD;
      the application of surfactant. One of these methods; Developed in Germany, it is LISA (the&#xD;
      application of surfactant, which is less invasive), which is currently widely used in Europe.&#xD;
      In the LISA(Less invasive surfactant administration) method, surfactant is given after&#xD;
      placing a thin flexible catheter into the trachea with the help of a laryngoscope (Magill's&#xD;
      forceps may or may not be used) while the baby is in CPAP. The second method is the&#xD;
      application of surfactant, which was developed in Australia and given by using a hard thin&#xD;
      vascular catheter into the trachea while the baby is being followed up in CPAP only under&#xD;
      direct laryngoscope without using forceps. This method is called MIST (minimally invasive&#xD;
      surfactant treatment). In both methods, the aim is to give the surfactant warmed up to body&#xD;
      temperature slowly in a few minutes with the help of an injector in a baby with spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing under CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current RDS review (2019), it was emphasized that noninvasive respiratory support is&#xD;
      the most appropriate way to support the breathing of preterm infants. Non invasive methods;&#xD;
      CPAP is specified as bi-level CPAP, HHHFNC, positive pressure ventilation with nasal&#xD;
      interval. CPAP devices provide gas flow under controlled pressure with probes firmly placed&#xD;
      in the nose. Through the distension pressure; Supporting the opening of the upper airway,&#xD;
      continued lung expansion and prevention of end-expiratory alveolar collapse (lung closure at&#xD;
      the end of breath). Thus, it is easier to release the endogenous surfactant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heated high flow air support (HHHFNC) moistened with nasal cannula; It has been used as an&#xD;
      alternative to nasal CPAP since 2013 RDS guideline. The utility mechanism allows the removal&#xD;
      of carbon dioxide in the nasopharyngeal area, provides the anatomical dead space to be washed&#xD;
      with air flow, reduces the disadvantage of the anatomical dead space. It also provides&#xD;
      CPAP-like support thanks to its high flow rates. It reduces breathing work. It helps to&#xD;
      reduce the FiO2 level, typically using a flow rate of 4-8 L / min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the RDS review updated in 2019, early surfactant should be applied in infants&#xD;
      with RDS. According to the latest recommendation, surfactant should be given if the baby's&#xD;
      FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) need is over 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our neonatal intensive care unit, respiratory support is given with nasal CPAP and HHHFNC&#xD;
      instead of classical invasive (intubated) mechanical ventilation methods. In CPAP method,&#xD;
      heated and humidified air is given a certain pressure (6-8 cmH2O), while in HHHFNC method,&#xD;
      heated humidified air is given at a certain flow rate (6-8 L / min). This study was planned&#xD;
      to compare the results of infants who were given surfactant with MIST method under CPAP or&#xD;
      HHHFNC support in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in premature babies. No&#xD;
      blood will be collected from the babies included in this study, and nothing that will not be&#xD;
      applied to babies who are not included in the study. If these babies need surfactant&#xD;
      according to the chest X-ray and oxygen demand in the breathing air, surfactant support will&#xD;
      be given by MIST method. In the follow-up of these babies, after the surfactant application,&#xD;
      the follow-up application for each baby will be carried out; Blood gas will be taken in the&#xD;
      second and sixth hour, and a chest radiograph will be taken in the sixth hour. The mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation settings of the patient are made according to the values here. For example, the&#xD;
      pressure given in case of insufficient oxygenation, the amount of oxygen is increased, the&#xD;
      pressure given in case of hypercarbia is increased, the pressure is decreased in case of&#xD;
      hypocarbia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This measurement shows only partial carbon dioxide (PCO2) and partial oxygen (PO2) pressures&#xD;
      in that instant blood gas. It is of great importance to protect the premature babies being&#xD;
      monitored in the intensive care unit from hypoxia and hypercarbia, as well as the pressure,&#xD;
      volume, oxygen-related trauma and injuries given by iatrogenically invasive or non-invasive&#xD;
      respiratory support. Unnecessarily high supply of oxygen can cause oxygen radical damage and&#xD;
      increase the risk of diseases associated with oxygen radical damage (premature retinopathy,&#xD;
      necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia). With&#xD;
      the improvement of lung compliance and recovery of gas after surfactant treatment, carbon&#xD;
      dioxide excretion may accelerate and hypocarbia may develop. Hypocarbia can cause&#xD;
      intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia in premature babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surfactant application, babies will be monitored (as in all babies in the NICU)&#xD;
      saturation, peak heart rate, perfusion index (the ratio of nonpulsatile flow in the capillary&#xD;
      bed) and t values will be recorded. For all these reasons, monitoring of PI, PVI and&#xD;
      continuous transcutaneous PCO2 and PO2 values are of great importance for the prevention of&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity, as well as monitoring of oxygen saturation values with pulse&#xD;
      oximetry in premature babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our hospital, it was planned to take a total of 40 patients born under 32 weeks and less&#xD;
      than 1500 grams (20 patients being in the HHHNFC, 20 patients in the CPAP group). Patients&#xD;
      will be consecutively distributed to two groups until they reach the specified number of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it was aimed to monitor continuous oxygen saturation, PI, PVI, transcutaneous&#xD;
      PO2 and PCO2 measurements just before, during and after the surfactant application and to&#xD;
      compare the results of babies who received nCPAP and HHHFNC support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, all data will be entered in an SPSS file and study statistics will&#xD;
      be made. A database will be created using SPSS software. A p value of &lt;0.05 was determined as&#xD;
      the limit of significance.&#xD;
