      The aim of the study is to find out if the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) crews are using&#xD;
      the non-technical skills (e.g. communication, decision making, situational awareness etc.) in&#xD;
      the real practice and how well they use them.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to find out if the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) crews are using&#xD;
      the non-technical skills (teamwork and team leading, communication, decision making,&#xD;
      situational awareness and task management) in the real practice and how well they use them.&#xD;
      According to the observations of individual crews by field supervisors the use of&#xD;
      non-technical skills will be compared between different groups (e.g. resuscitation, trauma,&#xD;
      medical problems, non-emergency situations etc.). The comparison between the collaborators of&#xD;
      the study is not the subject of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis: The EMS crews are using all of the aspects of non-technical skills&#xD;
      appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The field supervision is also the limitation of the study because it is done by different&#xD;
      observers / supervisors, the observation therefore might by affected by subjective feelings.&#xD;
      To minimise the subjective view of the situation all of the field supervisors undergo a&#xD;
      uniform training of non-technical skills and how to observe and evaluate them.&#xD;

    <description>The measurement of non-technical skills usage will be evaluated according to the form developed and published by Cooper et al. (2010) as a Team Emergency Assessment Measure (TEAM) tool based on the Likert scale - Never/Hardly ever (0), Seldom (1), About as often as not (2), Often (3), Always/Nearly always (4).</description>

    <description>Teamwork The work of the team consists of information exchange and coordination of all activities performed. In-team communication is always calm and assertive, and team members support each other.&#xD;
Task management With the right planning and preparation of individual activities, the likelihood that all standards of care and best practices will be followed increases.&#xD;
Situational awareness Situational awareness refers primarily to the collection of information, its understanding and, on that basis, prediction of direction into which the situation will develop. Maintaining situational awareness is crucial in order to move towards the right goal.&#xD;
Decision-making With good situational awareness, one is able to keep in mind all information needed to make the correct decision at the right time. In some cases, it is advisable to consult with other team members or to verify their consent to the proposed procedure.&#xD;
Communication Communication is a vital tool when working in a team.</description>
