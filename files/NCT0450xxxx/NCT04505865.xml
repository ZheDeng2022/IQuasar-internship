  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effect of 8 weeks of a stress reduction intervention on&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque inflammation in adults with stable coronary artery disease, as&#xD;
      quantified by positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in&#xD;
      individuals with increased psychosocial stress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled imaging study will be performed to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      mindfulness-based stress reduction via a mind body program on arterial inflammation in&#xD;
      individuals with self-identified high levels of stress and stable coronary artery disease.&#xD;
      Individuals will undergo baseline FDG-PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and will then&#xD;
      be randomized to the stress-reduction intervention group or no intervention groups by blocks&#xD;
      (1:1) with stratification by age and sex. The stress reduction sessions focus on developing&#xD;
      an understanding of stress physiology and the physiology of the relaxation response, on&#xD;
      developing a regular practice of eliciting the relaxation response, and on learning cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral and positive psychology/resilience skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening period, patient acceptability for the study will be assessed based on&#xD;
      medical history, concomitant medications, physical examination, and clinical laboratory test&#xD;
      results. Acceptability for study participation will be confirmed for subjects who identify as&#xD;
      having increased levels of stress and/or a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score &gt;=14. Once the&#xD;
      patient has passed screening, they will undergo baseline imaging followed by randomization&#xD;
      and group assignment. Approximately 12 weeks after randomization, all individuals will return&#xD;
      for follow-up imaging and evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDG PET/MRI scans will be performed during the study for baseline and follow up to assess the&#xD;
      intervention's impact on the brain as well as systemic and arterial inflammation along with&#xD;
      other changes in related biomarker and imaging parameters. The Perceived Stress Scale will be&#xD;
      delivered prior imaging during both imaging visits to measure perceived psychological stress.&#xD;
      During both imaging sessions, subjects will be exposed to overt faces to measure signals&#xD;
      during brain imaging.&#xD;

    <description>The stress reduction program is a multimodal mind-body resiliency program that incorporates 3 core components into each session:&#xD;
1) Elicitation of the Relaxation Response through mind-body techniques; 2) discussion about stress awareness to learn how to identify personal stressors and experiences of stress; and 3) coping strategies and adaptive perspective-taking to promote positive well-being.</description>
