      The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is a relationship between&#xD;
      echocardiographic measurements regarding closure of PDA and serum D-Dimer and Fibrinogen&#xD;
      levels in premature infants born before 32nd gestational week and weighing less than 1500&#xD;
      grams.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ductus arteriosus (DA) is located between the main pulmonary artery and descending aorta in&#xD;
      embryonal life, with dense spiral-located smooth muscle cells in the media layer, and the&#xD;
      intima layer is thicker than the aorta. It must be open in fetal life; in this way, the blood&#xD;
      flowing from the right ventricle to the collapsed lungs is directed to the descending aorta.&#xD;
      DA usually closes &quot;functionally&quot; by constriction of the media during the first three days&#xD;
      after labor. In the second week after birth; endothelial folding, subendothelial&#xD;
      proliferation and coagulation processes results in &quot;anatomical&quot; permanent closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When not closed, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is formed resulting in shunting from aorta to&#xD;
      pulmonary artery. Probability of patency is inversely related with birth weight. Risk of&#xD;
      pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and loss of pulmonary&#xD;
      function increases due to increased pulmonary flow from left to right shunt. Renal,&#xD;
      mesenteric and cranial blood supply are impaired due to reduced peripheral circulation. As a&#xD;
      result, impaired renal function and necrotizing enterocolitis may develop. Risk of&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral hypoxia and premature retinopathy due to variable blood&#xD;
      supply. It has been associated with increased mortality in newborns due to increased&#xD;
      morbidity. On physical examination, hyperdynamic precordium, viable pulses and left&#xD;
      ventricular hypertrophy are observed. Large PDAs are characterized by prominent pulmonary&#xD;
      conus, increased pulmonary vascularization and cardiomegaly on telecardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of PDA is confirmed by echocardiography. Symptomatic PDA treatment and follow-up is&#xD;
      mostly followed by echocardiography. Detailed echocardiographic examination can only be&#xD;
      performed by a Pediatric Cardiologist, but it is not possible to evaluate DA at any time. It&#xD;
      is necessary to benefit from significant changes in specific hematological parameters that&#xD;
      may accompany DA closure in order to detect and predict these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main mechanisms involved in anatomic permanent closure in DA is platelet&#xD;
      aggregation and coagulation. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study in the&#xD;
      literature investigating whether there is a relationship between Fibrinogen and D-dimer&#xD;
      levels and anatomical closure of DA. It is postulated that circulating fibrinogen levels will&#xD;
      decrease and D-dimer levels increase as a by-product due to thrombosis in the lumen during DA&#xD;
      closure. It is predicted that in infants in whom DA does not close and remain open,&#xD;
      fibrinogen levels will be higher and D-dimer levels will be lower than infants in whom DA is&#xD;
      closed. It is also suggested that echocardiographic DA measurements will correlate with serum&#xD;
      Fibrinogen and D-Dimer levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is a relationship between&#xD;
      echocardiographic measurements regarding closure of PDA and serum D-Dimer and Fibrinogen&#xD;
      levels in premature infants born before 32nd gestational week and weighing less than 1500&#xD;
      grams.&#xD;
