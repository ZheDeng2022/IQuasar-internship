    <textblock>
      Noninvasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a low-intensity neuromodulation&#xD;
      technique of minimal risk that has been used as an experimental procedure for reducing&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and symptoms of other brain disorders. Though tDCS applied to prefrontal&#xD;
      brain areas is shown to reduce symptoms in some people with major depressive disorder (MDD),&#xD;
      the extent of antidepressant response often differs. Methods that map current flow directly&#xD;
      in the brain while a person is receiving tDCS and that determine how functional neuroimaging&#xD;
      signal changes after a series of tDCS sessions may help us understand how tDCS works, how it&#xD;
      can be optimized, and if it can be used as an effective antidepressant. Investigators will&#xD;
      address these questions in a two-part randomized double blind exploratory clinical trial. For&#xD;
      this part of the study, investigators will determine relationships between target engagement&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes (mood) and functional sub-constructs of cognitive control and emotion&#xD;
      negativity bias, and whether imaging markers at baseline predict changes in antidepressant&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred people with depression (50 in each group) will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      HD-tDCS or sham-tDCS for a total of 12 sessions each lasting 20 minutes occurring on&#xD;
      consecutive weekdays. At the first and last session, subjects will receive 20-30 minutes of&#xD;
      active or sham HD-tDCS in the MRI scanner, which will allow investigators to map tDCS&#xD;
      currents, and track changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) pre-to- post treatment&#xD;
      using completely non-invasive methods. At the first and last session and mid-way through the&#xD;
      trial, participants will also complete a series of clinical ratings and neurocognitive tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive neuromodulation technique,&#xD;
      applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can reduce depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      improve cognitive control in major depressive disorder (MDD). Such findings suggest&#xD;
      modulation of top down prefrontal-limbic circuits, which are functionally distinct from&#xD;
      ventro-limbic networks and include reciprocally connected DLPFC and dorsomedial anterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex (dACC). However, substantial variation in tDCS response is observed in MDD.&#xD;
      This may be due to imprecise stimulation protocols and suboptimal engagement of the neural&#xD;
      circuits mediating antidepressant response. Methods that optimize electrode placement and&#xD;
      account for individual variation in anatomy and that map current flow directly in the brain&#xD;
      may inform the mechanisms and potential clinical utility of tDCS. A new tDCS technique, high&#xD;
      definition (HD) tDCS, offers more focal stimulation than conventional tDCS (C-tDCS). The&#xD;
      degree to which C-tDCS or HD-tDCS engage dorsal prefrontal-limbic neural circuits is unknown,&#xD;
      yet is vital for understanding, confirming and subsequently improving possible therapeutic&#xD;
      effects. Innovative MRI techniques that are able to map tDCS currents in vivo and that track&#xD;
      changes in regional cerebral blood flow occurring with tDCS over time can provide direct&#xD;
      evidence of neural effects. Based on a) theoretical modeling of tDCS current flow, b) studies&#xD;
      showing hypo-metabolism, decreased CBF or activity in dorsal prefrontal-limbic networks, c)&#xD;
      modulation of these regions with treatment, and, c) our prior results showing significant&#xD;
      relationships in between change in dACC rCBF and clinical response to electroconvulsive&#xD;
      therapy (ECT), an established brain stimulation treatment, we will test for the tDCS&#xD;
      engagement and modulation of the DLPFC and dACC using tDCS current mapping performed in vivo&#xD;
      and perfusion MRI. MRI-guided neuronavigation will be used to optimize and standardize&#xD;
      electrode placement for DLPFC stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, using HD-tDCS that optimal target engagement of DLPFC and larger rCBF changes&#xD;
      in the DLPFC and dACC compared to C-tDCS in the first part of the trial, we will define&#xD;
      relationships between target engagement and change in mood and behavior. Patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe MDD (N=100, n=50 in each group) will be randomized to Active or Sham left&#xD;
      anodal DLPFC HD-tDCS. Patients will complete MRI scans including tDCS current mapping and&#xD;
      pCASL as well as two functional imaging tasks probing cognitive control and emotion&#xD;
      negativity bias, recruiting prefrontal-limbic circuitry, before and after completing a 12-day&#xD;
      trial of 20-minute tDCS sessions.&#xD;
