      Apatinib mesylate may be an effective treatment for recurrent atypical/malignant meningioma.&#xD;
      This prospective clinical study is now planned to verify the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      apatinib mesylate in the treatment of relapsed atypical/malignant meningioma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF is related to the abnormal angiogenesis of meningioma&#xD;
      and can also activate other growth factor pathways. Meningiomas are vascular tumors. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that the expression of VEGF in atypical meningiomas is twice that of benign&#xD;
      meningiomas, and VEGF in anaplastic meningiomas is 10 times that of benign meningiomas.&#xD;
      Therefore, anti-angiogenesis therapy may be more effective for higher grade meningiomas.&#xD;
      Previous clinical studies have confirmed that anti-angiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab,&#xD;
      sunitinib and PTK 787 can slow down tumor growth and prolong progression-free survival for&#xD;
      recurrent atypical/malignant meningioma. In summary, apatinib mesylate may be an effective&#xD;
      treatment for recurrent atypical/malignant meningioma. This prospective clinical study is now&#xD;
      planned to verify the effectiveness and safety of apatinib mesylate in the treatment of&#xD;
      relapsed atypical/malignant meningioma.&#xD;
