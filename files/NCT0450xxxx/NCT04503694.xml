  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, phase II study of nivolumab in combination with&#xD;
      regorafenib in subjects with locally-advanced rectal cancer who are eligible for a curative&#xD;
      treatment including pre-operative SCRT and TME. The study is based on the Simon's two-stage&#xD;
      design and a maximum of 60 subjects will be enrolled. In addition to the standard efficacy&#xD;
      interim analysis according to the statistical design, a safety interim analysis will be&#xD;
      performed on the first 6 subjects who have completed the study treatment to ensure safe&#xD;
      continuation of the study investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be treated according to the following sequential treatment plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction systemic period 1: This consists of treatment with nivolumab (240 mg&#xD;
           intravenously, on day 1 and 14) and regorafenib (80 mg/day orally, from day 1 to 14)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard SCRT: This consists of 25 Gy delivered in 5 fractions (from day 21 to 25)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction systemic period 2: This consists of treatment with nivolumab (240 mg&#xD;
           intravenously, on day 28, 42 and 56) and regorafenib (80 mg/day orally, from day 28 to&#xD;
           49)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery: Surgical resection will be performed according to the principles of TME&#xD;
           (between day 74 and 87, i.e., between 7 to 8 weeks after completion of SCRT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy: Administration of adjuvant chemotherapy will be left to the&#xD;
           discretion of the treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also includes translational procedures (i.e. collection of tumour biopsies, blood&#xD;
      samples and stool samples at pre-specified time points) for exploratory molecular and immune&#xD;
      contexture analyses. These are mandatory for all study subjects.&#xD;
