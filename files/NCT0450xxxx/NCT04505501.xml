      Reducing HIV persistence in lymph nodes by Interleukin-15 (IL-15) Receptor super-agonist&#xD;
      (N-803) in Individuals with Acute HIV Infection&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, unblinded, controlled trial to investigate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and immunomodulation effect of combining N-803 with antiretroviral therapy (ART)&#xD;
      during acute HIV infection (AHI). The study will be conducted at one study site, the Thai Red&#xD;
      Cross AIDS Research Centre (TRCARC) in Bangkok, Thailand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be asked to undergo LN Bx at baseline (untreated AHI), prior to&#xD;
      initiating dolutegravir-based ART. N-803 will be administered subcutaneously at weeks 0, 3, 6&#xD;
      (total 3 doses) and will be initiated together with ART. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      undergo a second inguinal LN Bx on the opposite groin approximately at week 6 (no later than&#xD;
      1 week after completion of study agents). They will be followed for safety parameters at&#xD;
      weeks 8 and 12, after which they will roll over to the RV412, WRAIR#2178 safety monitoring&#xD;
      protocol. The study duration for individual participants will be approximately 12 weeks. The&#xD;
      study may include additional optional procedures at baseline and week 6 such as&#xD;
      leukapheresis, brain MRI imaging and lumbar puncture, according to participants' consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that N-803 initiated with ART during AHI, will be safe, and will lead to a&#xD;
      reduction of HIV reservoir size in LN, demonstrated by decreased frequencies of vRNA+ and&#xD;
      vDNA+ cells in the LNs, in comparison with ART alone.&#xD;
