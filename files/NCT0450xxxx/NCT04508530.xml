  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>CY-BOCS score - Primary</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement of neuropsychiatric symptomatology and behavior in PANS patients determined by clinician-rated Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) score. The mean changes in the total CY-BOCS score from Baseline to Week 9 will be compared between Panzyga and placebo treatment to demonstrate superiority. The CY-BOCS scale score is a clinician-rated, semi-structured interview for rating the presence or absence, as well as the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms.The CY-BOCS yields a total obsession score, a total compulsion score and combined total score (maximum total CY-BOCS score=40).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CY-BOCS score - Secondary</measure>
    <time_frame>18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CY-BOCS score at the end of the follow-up period at Week 18 will be compared to the Week 9 scores within the (Panzyga - Placebo) treatment sequence group</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression</measure>
    <time_frame>18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess behavioral changes via the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessment. The Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating 1 = normal; not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill. The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and is rated as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent OC Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess behavioral changes via the Parent OC Impact Scale - COIS-RP assessment. The Child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale-Revised consists of parallel 33-item parent and child-report versions assessing impairment due to OCD across multiple functional domains. Items are rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much).</description>

    <description>To assess behavioral changes via the Child OC Impact Scale COIS-RC assessment. The Child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale-Revised consists of parallel 33-item parent and child-report versions assessing impairment due to OCD across multiple functional domains. Items are rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SNAP-IV 26 item Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess behavioral changes via the Swanson, Nolan, And Pelham Scale - Version IV (SNAP-IV) 26 item Scale. It is a 26-item, parent- or teacher-reported scale which elicits reporting on each of the DSM cardinal symptoms of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), and Conduct Disorder (CD) in children and adolescents. The 26-item scale also includes items on aggression, mood, and school performance and behavior. It is used extensively in ADHD and disruptive behavior disorder intervention trials and is sensitive to change</description>

    <measure>Parent Tic Questionnaire (PTQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess behavioral changes via the Parent Tic Questionnaire (PTQ). The PTQ assesses tic severity in the past week, allowing for individual parent ratings of tic presence or absence.</description>
