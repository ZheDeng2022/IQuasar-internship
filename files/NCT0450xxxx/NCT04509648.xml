  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the toxicities and efficacy of hypofractionated&#xD;
      regional nodal radiotherapy (RNI) for one week in breast cancer patients treated with&#xD;
      mastectomy or breast conserving surgery. Hypofractionated radiotherapy will be delivered to&#xD;
      chest wall or whole breast and regional lymph regions (including&#xD;
      supraclavicular/infraclavicular region, internal mammary nodes, and any part of the axillary&#xD;
      bed at risk). Eligible breast cancer patients will be followed for at least 1 years to&#xD;
      evaluate the acute and late radiation-induced toxicities, locoregional recurrence, over&#xD;
      survival, distant metastasis, and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible breast cancer patients will receive hypofractionated radiotherapy of 5.2 Gy in 5&#xD;
      fractions within one week and a sequential tumor bed boost of 5.2 Gy in 2 fractions to the&#xD;
      conserved breast. The dose is prescribed to ipsilateral chest wall or whole breast and&#xD;
      regional lymph regions (including supraclavicular/infraclavicular region, internal mammary&#xD;
      nodes, and any part of the axillary bed at risk). All patients are treated with intensity&#xD;
      modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique. The primary endpoint is ≥2 grade any acute&#xD;
      radiation induced toxicity event. patients will be followed for at least 1 years to evaluate&#xD;
      the acute and late radiation-induced toxicity, locoregional recurrence, over survival,&#xD;
      distant metastasis, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of the required number of cases based on an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80% with&#xD;
      a maximal tolerable toxicity difference of 10% during and within 6 months after RNI comparing&#xD;
      to conventional radiotherapy and lost rate of follow up of 10%. In total 197 patients are&#xD;
      needed to be recruited.&#xD;
