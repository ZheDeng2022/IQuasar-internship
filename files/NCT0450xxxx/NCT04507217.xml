      This is a phase II, Open-Label, Multicenter, Prospective Clinical Study to Investigate the&#xD;
      Efficacy and Safety of Tislelizumab Combined with Pemetrexed/ Carboplatin in Patients with&#xD;
      Brain Metastases of Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. The primary end point is PFS,&#xD;
      and secondary endpoint is ORR, OS, DoR and Neurocognitive impairment. during the study, the&#xD;
      exploratory objectives including (1) PD-L1 expression, TMB, and other potential predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers, correlated with response to treatment (2) Progression-free survival based on&#xD;
      intracranial response (iPFS) according to RECIST 1.1 and RANO-BM&#xD;
