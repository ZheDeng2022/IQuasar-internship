  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) afflicts many war Veterans, but often they are reluctant&#xD;
      to seek help despite availability of effective treatments. Family members are key sources of&#xD;
      support who can help encourage such Veterans to initiate mental health services. Toward that&#xD;
      goal, VA provides telephone coaching to family members through its Coaching Into Care (CIC)&#xD;
      program to help get their Veterans into care. While CIC enjoys high caller satisfaction, it&#xD;
      has shown only modest success getting Veterans into care. Blended interventions that include&#xD;
      professional support and technology-based interventions offer promise for improving&#xD;
      effectiveness of services. Therefore, this study tests an intervention that blends CIC calls&#xD;
      with a web program called VA Community Reinforcement and Family Training (VA-CRAFT). VA-CRAFT&#xD;
      is a translation of an empirically-validated model intended to help Veterans by training&#xD;
      their family members to effectively promote care-seeking. If successful, this approach will&#xD;
      support families and help more Veterans receive needed mental health care for PTSD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent, potentially debilitating&#xD;
      condition afflicting many war Veterans. While efficacious treatments are available, most&#xD;
      individuals with PTSD do not receive any mental health care. VA faces an ongoing challenge of&#xD;
      engaging Veterans with PTSD in effective services. Recognizing the powerful influence of&#xD;
      families on Veteran wellbeing, VA has called for increased involvement of family members in&#xD;
      the care of Veterans with PTSD. In response, VA has created a national telephone-based&#xD;
      support service called Coaching Into Care (CIC) to work with family members of Veterans with&#xD;
      mental health problems who are reluctant to seek treatment. Program evaluation data show that&#xD;
      CIC is highly valued by callers, but that only about 25% of callers with Veterans not already&#xD;
      in care, report that their Veteran sought care over the next six months. The proposed study&#xD;
      is a test of an innovative approach to improve outcomes by blending coaching calls with a&#xD;
      web-based program called VA Community Reinforcement and Family Training (VA-CRAFT). VA-CRAFT&#xD;
      is a translation of an empirically-validated model intended to help Veterans by training and&#xD;
      supporting their family members to better care for themselves, more effectively manage their&#xD;
      relationships, and have effective care-seeking conversations with their Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary work suggests that VA-CRAFT may be a powerful adjunct for CIC services. In a&#xD;
      prior HSR&amp;D-funded pilot, the investigators' team found that family members who completed the&#xD;
      relatively brief VA-CRAFT course alone (without any coaching) had greater decreases in&#xD;
      caregiver burden than wait-list controls. However, qualitative interviews also suggested that&#xD;
      participants often did not raise the issue of treatment with their Veteran loved one due to&#xD;
      not believing such a conversation would be successful. The investigators developed&#xD;
      CIC+VA-CRAFT with the goal of capitalizing on the strengths of both approaches (CIC and&#xD;
      VA-CRAFT) and increasing family members' motivation, perceived ability to have&#xD;
      treatment-seeking conversations with the Veteran, and success at engaging their Veterans in&#xD;
      care. Initial findings from a second, NC-PTSD-funded pilot suggest that this brief, blended&#xD;
      intervention is feasible, acceptable, and potentially more effective than CIC alone in&#xD;
      enhancing Veteran mental health treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: The primary objective is to investigate the effectiveness of CIC+VA-CRAFT&#xD;
      in improving Veteran treatment initiation above CIC only, without compromising the high&#xD;
      caller satisfaction of the CIC program. To accomplish this, the investigators will use a&#xD;
      two-group randomized controlled trial. Spouse/partners who believe their Veteran needs PTSD&#xD;
      treatment will be randomized to CIC+VA-CRAFT or CIC only (i.e., TAU). Assessments will occur&#xD;
      at baseline, post-treatment (month 3), and follow-up (month 6). To maximize generalizability&#xD;
      of findings to the intended population, recruitment will use targeted social media&#xD;
      advertising and referrals from the existing CIC program. Specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the effectiveness of CIC+VA-CRAFT for Veteran mental health service&#xD;
      initiation. The investigators hypothesize that spouse/partners in CIC+VA-CRAFT will report&#xD;
      higher rates of mental health service initiation for their Veterans than will participants in&#xD;
      the CIC only condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Investigate caller satisfaction with CIC+VA-CRAFT relative to CIC only. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that satisfaction with CIC+VA-CRAFT will be non-inferior to&#xD;
      satisfaction with the CIC program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Conduct a process evaluation to inform potential future implementation of&#xD;
      CIC+VA-CRAFT. Qualitative interviews with spouse/partners, their Veterans, and study and CIC&#xD;
      coaches, will be used to inform future implementation of the CIC+VA-CRAFT intervention into&#xD;
      the CIC program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explore potential within-condition improvements and between-condition changes on&#xD;
           spouse/partner and family outcomes. The investigators will test for these effects on&#xD;
           measures of caregiver burden, psychological distress, quality of life, and family&#xD;
           conflict and cohesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore potential intervention mediators and moderators of Veteran mental health&#xD;
           treatment initiation. The investigators will explore if self-efficacy, outcome&#xD;
           expectancy, and treatment conversations mediate the effect of the intervention on mental&#xD;
           health treatment initiation. Demographic variables, perceived Veteran symptomatology,&#xD;
           and partner symptomatology will be explored as moderators of the effect of the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this research is to establish an efficacious, efficient, scalable, and&#xD;
      satisfying family outreach intervention that will significantly increase mental health&#xD;
      service initiation among a high priority Veteran population while addressing the needs of&#xD;
      their primary supporters, their family members. This proposal has been developed in&#xD;
      collaboration with the existing VA CIC and VA-CRAFT programs and involves the leadership of&#xD;
      these programs to facilitate the blended intervention's rapid dissemination should the trial&#xD;
      prove successful.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Coaching Into Care plus VA-CRAFT consists of four 45-min. telephone coaching calls over 8-12 weeks, delivered by a coach following a manual. Calls focus on supporting and holding the participant accountable for using the VA-CRAFT for PTSD web-based course. This course is based on Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) which is intended to help family members of Veterans with PTSD who are resistant to seek treatment for PTSD to initiate care as well as promote the family member's wellbeing and improve their relationship with the Veteran. Calls are designed to: 1) help participants maintain motivation to complete VA-CRAFT lessons in a timely fashion by using reinforcement and motivational techniques; 2) consolidate information and implement skills that they are learning in the course through lesson review, role plays, and problem solving; and, 3) normalize and validate the challenges of having a loved one with PTSD who is reluctant to seek care (i.e., supportive caring).</intervention_model_description>
