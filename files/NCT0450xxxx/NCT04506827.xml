  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Lateral maxillary sinus augmentation (MSA) is a predictable bone regeneration&#xD;
      technique in case of atrophy of the posterior-upper maxilla. Aimed at obtaining quantity and&#xD;
      quality of bone suitable for receiving osseointegrated implants, its success is largely due&#xD;
      to the skill of the surgeon, but also to the characteristics of the biomaterial used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Twenty-four patients needing MSA were included in the study. The patients were&#xD;
      randomly allocated to 3 different groups: Anorganic Bovine Bone Mineral (ABBM) as control,&#xD;
      Tricalcium Phosphate (TCP) with or without hyaluronic acid (HA) as test groups. Nine months&#xD;
      after MSA bone biopsies were harvested for the histomorphometric analysis. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      were mean bone gain, intraoperative and post-operative complications, implant insertion&#xD;
      torque, implant failure and patient related outcome measures (PROMs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The implant-prosthetic rehabilitation of the atrophic maxilla requires the creation of&#xD;
      sufficient volumetric quantity of bone, through regeneration techniques, necessary to&#xD;
      position the implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maxillary sinus augmentation (MSA) is probably the most predictable and best performing&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present randomized controlled study aims to evaluate and compare, histomorphometrically&#xD;
      and clinically three different bone substitutes such as: ABBM, Tricalcium Phosphate (TCP)&#xD;
      with or without the addition of hyaluronic acid (HA) that were used for lateral MSA. This&#xD;
      study population will be followed until the 3rd year. This study describes histological&#xD;
      differences between the three groups at 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients enrolled in the study received a session of oral hygiene and a periodontal&#xD;
      examination before the surgical procedure to obtain a more favorable oral environment for&#xD;
      wound healing. A CBCT was mandatory for all included cases to verify that the maxillary sinus&#xD;
      was clear and that the residual bone height was 3 mm or less. All the enrolled patients&#xD;
      received 2 gr. of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (or 600 mg. of clindamycin for those who&#xD;
      were allergic to penicillins) as a pre-medication one-hour before surgery. All patients&#xD;
      rinsed for 1 minute with 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash (and twice a day for the following 3&#xD;
      weeks). Local anesthesia was administered, a mid-crestal incision with mesial and distal&#xD;
      release were performed to access the lateral bone wall of the maxillary sinus, subsequently,&#xD;
      ultrasound bone surgery (Piezosurgery ®, Carasco, Italy) with specific tips was used for the&#xD;
      bone window osteotomy (Figure 1-A). The Schneiderian membrane was reflected and lifted up&#xD;
      medially with flat sinus curettes. Once the sinus membrane was completely lifted a&#xD;
      bioabsorbable pericardium membrane (Smartbrane, Regedent AG, Zurich, Switzerland) was applied&#xD;
      to protect it (Figure 1-B). The randomization sealed envelopes were opened and the clinician&#xD;
      allocated the patients to one of the three experimental groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group that received Demineralized Bovine Bone Mineral (Bio-Oss Cancellous,&#xD;
           Geistlich, Wolhunsen, Switzerland);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test group 1 that received TCP with particle size ranging from 250 to 1000 µm (Osopia,&#xD;
           Regedent, Zurich, Switzerland);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test group 2 that received TCP as in test group1 plus crosslinked Hyaluronic Acid&#xD;
           (Hyadent BG, Regedent, Zurich, Switzerland) with a ratio 2 to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the bony window was repositioned, stabilized and covered with a resorbable pericardium&#xD;
      membrane. Nine months after the MSA a CBCT analysis was required to evaluate the total bone&#xD;
      height gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the treatment plan, between one and three implants, bone level (BL) or tissue&#xD;
      level (TL), of two different manufacturers (Institut Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland and&#xD;
      Sweden &amp; Martina, Due Carrare, Italy) were positioned. While preparing the osteotomy implant&#xD;
      site a bone biopsy was harvested using a trephine. The implant insertion torque was measured&#xD;
      in Ncm for each implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were prescribed 1gr amoxicillin + clavulanic acid twice daily for 7 days (for&#xD;
      those who were allergic to penicillin 300mg clindamycin 3 times daily for 7 days) as&#xD;
      post-operative prophylaxis. All patients received 8mg of dexamethasone immediately after&#xD;
      surgery and 4 mg of dexamethasone per day were prescribed for the following 5 days.&#xD;
      Analgesics were prescribed (1gr paracetamol 3 times daily) according to patients' need. The&#xD;
      use of removable temporary restorations was not recommended during the healing period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an osseointegration period of 3 months, the implants were restored. The prosthetic&#xD;
      procedures were similar for all groups, impressions were taken with a polyether rubber&#xD;
      material (Impregum, Espe Dental AG, Seefeld, Germany) and a customized impression tray. Final&#xD;
      Zirconia screw-retained restorations were delivered after a period of 2/3 weeks, peri-apical&#xD;
      radiographs were taken and oral hygiene instructions were given to all participants in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
