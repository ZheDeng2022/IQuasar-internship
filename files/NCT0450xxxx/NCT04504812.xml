  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent public health need to reduce reliance on opioids for effective long-term&#xD;
      pain management, particularly in knee osteoarthritis (KOA). This effectiveness trial will&#xD;
      compare commonly recommended treatments to reduce pain and functional limitations in&#xD;
      KOA.These results will lead to improved patient selection for treatment and inform evidence&#xD;
      based guidelines by offering well-tested, effective, non-surgical alternatives.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is one of the leading causes of chronic pain and disability&#xD;
      worldwide, affecting over 30% of older adults. It represents a major global health and&#xD;
      economic burden to individuals and society. The rates of KOA have more than doubled in the&#xD;
      past 70 years and continue to grow sharply, given increases in life expectancy and population&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI). Surgery is often employed to treat KOA, but it is associated with a&#xD;
      high rate of persistent pain, and is not a permanent solution. Numerous nonsurgical therapies&#xD;
      have been advocated to treat pain in patients with KOA yet are not often used in clinical&#xD;
      care. The limited pain relief and functional improvement seen in a subset of knee OA&#xD;
      sufferers has led to a high rate of opioid use and disability in this population. The&#xD;
      overarching goal of this study is to conduct a sequential parallel group randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of conservative behavioral&#xD;
      and non-opioid pharmacological treatments (Phase 1) and, among those that indicate interest&#xD;
      in obtaining further treatment and those not eligible for conservative treatment, the&#xD;
      benefits of procedural interventions (Phase 2). This study will also evaluate whether&#xD;
      clinical and psychosocial phenotypes predict short- and longer-term treatment response. The&#xD;
      results of this study will examine the effectiveness of each tested intervention and provide&#xD;
      meaningful information regarding effectiveness across key subgroups of participants.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Using a stepped care model, Phase 1 participants will be randomly assigned to minimally invasive treatments, including best practices, best practices plus duloxetine, and best practices plus duloxetine combined with a web-based pain coping skills training program. Those who note interest in additional treatment following completion of Phase 1, as well as those that are not eligible for Phase 1 treatment, will be randomly assigned to more aggressive procedures: intra-articular hyaluronic acid, steroid and local anesthetic injection, or a nerve procedure that would either include a long acting block or nerve ablation.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Intensity as assessed by the Modified 4-item BPI Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks post-treatment for Phase 1; Baseline and 12 weeks post-treatment for Phase 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified 4-item BPI Pain scale consists of 3 items from BPI Pain Intensity and 1 item from BPI Pain Interference. This is a continuous measure that will be calculated as the average of worst, average, current knee pain, and pain upon walking.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Interference as assessed by the BPI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks post-treatment for Phase 1; Baseline and 12 weeks post-treatment for Phase 2</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI Pain Interference domain assesses self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of one's life. The BPI measures how much pain has interfered with seven daily activities, including general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep. BPI pain interference is typically scored as the mean of the seven interference items. BPI Interference ranges from 0-10 with higher scores reflecting greater pain interference in activities of daily living.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Physical Functioning as assessed by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks post-treatment for Phase 1; Baseline and 12 weeks post-treatment for Phase 2</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS evaluates function for participants with osteoarthritis of the knee that is related to injury and degeneration. The KOOS short form includes 12 items and measures pain, functional limitation and quality of life. Physical functioning questions cover everyday activities such as rising from sitting, standing getting in and out of the car and twisting/pivoting on the knee. Scores range from 0-100 with lower scores indicating worse knee symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 8 weeks post-treatment for Phase 1; At 12 weeks post-treatment for Phase 2</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC scale evaluates all aspects of participants' health and assesses if there has been an improvement or decline in clinical status. It is a 7-item scale that ranges between &quot;a great deal worse&quot; to &quot;a great deal better.&quot; Higher scores reflect greater improvement in clinical status.</description>

    <ipd_description>After last subject enrollment and all follow up procedures have been completed, the Helping to End Addiction Long-Term (HEAL) Pain Management Effectiveness Research Network Data Coordinating Center at the University of Utah will prepare a final study database for the trial, which will then be used for statistical analyses and publication of findings from the trial.The Trial will provide a resource of data concerning methods for managing pain and reducing opioid addiction, and the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will produce a database that can be used by non- Effectiveness Research Network (ERN) investigators.The DCC will also prepare a data dictionary that provides a concise definition of every data element included in the database. If specific data elements have idiosyncrasies that might affect interpretation or analysis, this will be discussed in the dictionary document. Data elements that are considered unreliable will be deleted, and this will be noted in the documentation.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>These policies are expected to focus primarily on the timing of data release. The investigator's preliminary plan is to release the database (defined below) at the time of publication of the primary manuscript, or within 12 months of last patient procedure, whichever comes first. Implementation of the plan will follow the HEAL Public Access and Data Sharing Policy as outlined at https://heal.nih.gov/about/public-access-data</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Access to the releasable database housed in the NIH-assigned repository will be in accordance with procedures and regulations of the NIH or specific institute. The data coordinating center will not provide any support for investigators using the releasable database.</ipd_access_criteria>
