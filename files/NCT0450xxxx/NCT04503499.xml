  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurological problems both lead to many respiratory problems primarily and events secondary&#xD;
      to neurological diseases or symptoms can be the cause of respiratory failure. The addition of&#xD;
      respiratory failure will adversely affect the course of the neurological picture, making&#xD;
      treatment more difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardiopulmonary functions of hemiplegia patients decrease due to the decrease in the&#xD;
      expansion of the thoracic part on the hemiplegic side and insufficient respiratory muscles.&#xD;
      In addition, common symptoms in stroke patients, including limited use of ankylosis and&#xD;
      muscle movements, cause oxygen deficiency and increased metabolic demands. After stroke,&#xD;
      thoracic expansion is reduced upon paralysis of the diaphragm and respiratory muscles.&#xD;
      Continuation of this condition can lead to muscle fibrosis. As a result, the level of&#xD;
      thoracic expansion decreases during breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A decrease in thoracic spine mobility correlates with a decrease in forced vital capacity&#xD;
      (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1). The increase in the rigidity&#xD;
      of the chest wall affects the ventilator pumping mechanism, reducing the level of rigidity&#xD;
      (increasing the mobility of the chest wall) is recommended as a way to improve lung function.&#xD;

    <measure>Chest circumference measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Chest circumference measurement will be measured from the axillary (3rd costa), epigastric (xiphoid) and subcostal (mid xiphoid-umbilicus) areas, and measuring will be done by tape measure in inspiration and expiration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced expiratory volume</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Forced expiratory volume will be performed in a sitting position using a portable spirometer (Spirobank; Medical International Research, Rome, Italy) according to the American Thoracic Society rules. Participants will rest before the test to prevent fatigue. While the patient is sitting in a comfortable position on the chair, his nose will be closed with a clip and the mouthpiece will be placed and the measurement will be made. The patient will be asked to perform deep and long-term expiration after deep and severe inspiration after performing calm breathing three times. The measurement will be repeated three times.</description>

    <description>Peak Expiratory Flow test will be performed in a sitting position using a portable spirometer (Spirobank; Medical International Research, Rome, Italy) according to the American Thoracic Society rules. Participants will rest before the test to prevent fatigue. While the patient is sitting in a comfortable position on the chair, his nose will be closed with a clip and the mouthpiece will be placed and the measurement will be made.

    <measure>Maximal Expiratory Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal expiratory pressure will be assessed using an electronic pressure transducer (MicroRPM; Micro Medical Ltd., Kent, UK). It will be measured according to maximal expiratory pressure Black and Hyatt. In Maximal Expiratory Pressure measurement from the patient; After doing maximal inspiration in a comfortable sitting position, his nose will be closed with a clip and he will be asked to make maximum expiration from the mouthpiece. The measurements will be repeated three times and the highest values will be recorded.</description>

    <description>Respiratory muscle endurance measurement will be performed with the Power Breath (HaB International Ltd. Southam, UK) portable device. Power Breath resistance will be adjusted by taking 60% of the maximal inspiratory pressure. The test time will be calculated and recorded in seconds. Power Breath resistance is adjusted in a comfortable sitting position, the clip will be recorded while the clip is attached to the nose and the mouthpiece of the device is inhaled.</description>
