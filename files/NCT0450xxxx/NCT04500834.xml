      Metal allergen patch test study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single application of an investigational patch test panel containing 11 hydrogel metal&#xD;
      allergens and a corresponding patch test panel containing 11 petrolatum metal allergens will&#xD;
      be applied to the upper back of human subjects to test diagnostic efficacy and safety. Patch&#xD;
      test panels will be removed after being worn for approximately 48 hours. Study will require 6&#xD;
      visits over the course of 21 days; patch application, patch removal and 4 patch test site&#xD;
      evaluation visits at days 4, 7, 14 and 21.&#xD;

             (other than nickel or gold), being tested on this study or strong suspicion of metal&#xD;
             contact allergy based on results of the Qualification Questionnaire, part 2 Type of&#xD;
             Metal Exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Unable to become pregnant or willing to use an acceptable method of contraception to&#xD;

             T-cell lymphoma that may confound the evaluation of allergic contact dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Inability to comply with patch test study requirements including multiple return&#xD;
             visits and activity restrictions (e.g., protecting test panels from excess moisture&#xD;
             due to showering or vigorous activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participation in a clinical trial of an investigational drug, treatment or device&#xD;
