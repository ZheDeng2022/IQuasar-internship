    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer, undergoing&#xD;
      resection of all gross visible disease at the primary site and in the lymph nodes. A total of&#xD;
      36 patients who have had or will require surgery to remove cancer cells prior to starting&#xD;
      chemoradiation may be enrolled. All eligible patients will receive de-intensified&#xD;
      cisplatin-based chemoradiation, with high-risk patients receiving a higher dose and longer&#xD;
      treatment period than other patients on the study. The study will assess whether a&#xD;
      de-intensified version of standard chemoradiation treatment will be just as effective in&#xD;
      treating HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer while causing less side effects than standard&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II study that will enroll patients with HPV-associated&#xD;
      oropharyngeal cancer, undergoing resection through trans-oral robotic surgery (TORS) of all&#xD;
      gross visible disease at the primary site and in the lymph nodes. A total of 36 patients at&#xD;
      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and its affiliates (Tower Hematology-Oncology, Torrance Memorial&#xD;
      Physician Network) who have had or will require surgery to remove cancer cells prior to&#xD;
      starting chemoradiation may be enrolled. All eligible patients will receive de-intensified&#xD;
      cisplatin-based chemoradiation, with high-risk patients receiving a higher dose and longer&#xD;
      treatment period than other patients on the study. The treatment period will last 3 to 5&#xD;
      weeks depending on whether the patient is considered high-risk or not. The study will assess&#xD;
      whether a de-intensified version of standard chemoradiation treatment will be just as&#xD;
      effective in treating HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer while causing less side effects&#xD;
      than standard dosing.&#xD;

    <description>The scale ranges from 0 to 4 (0 - no, 2 - sometimes, 4- yes) for each question identifying problems with hearing loss, as self-reported by patients.

    <measure>Mean change in patient-reported outcomes using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL, and six single items. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems. Most questions are scored 1 to 4, with exception to global health questions scored from 1 to 7. The raw scores are then standardized by a linear transformation, so that scores range from 0 to 100; a higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning, or a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Mean change in patient-reported outcomes using University of Michigan Xerostomia-Related Quality of Life Scale (XeQoLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>XeQOLS is a patient-reported, 15-item scale that measures four domains: physical functioning, pain/discomfort, personal/psychologic functioning, and social functioning. Patient responses to all four domains are averaged, and the total scores range from 0 to 4; an increased xerostomia burden is indicated by a higher score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in patient-reported outcomes using 5-level version of the EuroQol five dimensional instrument EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises of five dimensions: (MOBILITY, SELF-CARE, USUAL ACTIVITIES, PAIN / DISCOMFORT and ANXIETY / DEPRESSION), with each dimension having five response levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, unable to /extreme problems - severity level of each dimension are coded from 1 to 5, respectively. The visual analog scale (EQ VAS) attached to this questionnaire records the respondent's overall self-rated perception of current health status on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are scored from 0 to 100, 100 being the 'The best health you can imagine' and 0 indicating 'The worst health you can imagine'</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in patient-reported outcomes using the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The MDADI is a patient-reported, 20-item scale that quantifies four domains: an individual's global (G), physical (P), emotional (E), and functional (F) perceptions of their swallowing ability. Two summary scores can be obtained from the MDADI: 1) global and 2) composite. The global scale is a single question, scored individually, to assess the overall impact that swallowing abilities have on quality of life (&quot;my swallowing impacts my day-to-day life&quot;). The composite MDADI score summarizes overall performance on remaining 19-items of the MDADI, as a weighted average of the physical, emotional, and functional subscale questions. Summary and subscale MDADI scores are normalized to range from 20 (extremely low functioning) to 100 (high functioning). Five possible responses to the items on the MDADI are: strongly agree, agree, no opinion, disagree, and strongly disagree, and scored on a scale of 1 to 5 respectively.</description>
