  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has derived a pandemic in which its evolution and&#xD;
      complications depend on the immune capacity of the host. The virus has been characterized by&#xD;
      presenting an inflammatory cascade, increased by the overproduction of proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, the decrease in metalloenzymes and also the rapid spread of the virus. There are&#xD;
      several lines of treatment, however, nutritional treatment only considered a caloric intake.&#xD;
      For this reason, this study will evaluate the evolution of patients with COVID-19 assisted by&#xD;
      nutritional support system and the effect of this therapy in reducing complications and&#xD;
      comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: Will the nutritional support system reduce complications in stage III&#xD;
      positive COVID-19 patients with comorbidities (type 2 DM, SAH, overweight / obesity with BMI&#xD;
      &lt;35), with a better benefit than that achieved with the conventional nutritional treatment ?.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The nutritional support system will reduce the complications of patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 in stage III with comorbidities. General Objective: To determine the effect of the&#xD;
      use of a nutritional support system on complications in patients with COVID-19 in stage III&#xD;
      with comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: A controlled, blinded, randomized clinical trial will be conducted in patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19, hospitalized at the ISSEMYM Toluca Arturo Montiel Rojas Medical Center, who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria. The evolution of the group of patients receiving the nutritional&#xD;
      support system (NSS) and the normal diet implemented by the hospital will be evaluated&#xD;
      against the group of patients receiving only the diet, using clinical examination, laboratory&#xD;
      and cabinet tests during their hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: for independent groups with normal distribution, Student's T will be&#xD;
      applied. If the distribution does not meet normality criteria, a Mann Whitney U will be&#xD;
      performed; Two-way ANOVA will be applied to monitor the groups over time with normal&#xD;
      distribution. If the distribution does not meet normality criteria, a Friedman test will be&#xD;
      performed, in both cases post hoc tests will be performed. The results will be analyzed using&#xD;
      version 6 of the Graphpad Prism software.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients in the COVID-19 area, who are treated at the ISSEMYM Toluca Arturo Montiel Rojas&#xD;
      Medical Center, located in Paseo Tollocan, Av. Baja Velocidad km 575, Barrio de Sta Clara,&#xD;
      Toluca de Lerdo, México; both sexes, with the presence of comorbidities (type 2 DM, SAH,&#xD;
      overweight or obesity BMI &lt;35) and in stage III of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive cases. With systematic randomized allocation using a sequence of random numbers&#xD;
      built with the Excel program divided into two groups. Once the participants of the COVID-19&#xD;
      area have been selected, patients and / or family members will be spoken to to explain the&#xD;
      protocol and obtain the signatures of the letters of informed consent. Assignment to the&#xD;
      research group will be carried out randomly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patients have been admitted to the study, the following will be carried out: test of&#xD;
      COVID-19 by means of PCR, thorax tomography, complete clinical history, Mini Nutritional&#xD;
      Assessment (MNA), food diary, list of clinical variables designed by us, complete blood&#xD;
      count, coagulation profile, serum electrolytes, blood chemistry (6-elements), lipidic&#xD;
      profile, liver function tests, ferritin, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and&#xD;
      D-dimer. Anthropometric measurements will also be carried out (height, weight, BMI, muscle&#xD;
      mass %, fat % and visceral fat%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up will be carried out daily for 21 days or earlier, if they are discharged from&#xD;
      the hospital due to improvement in the evolution, at that moment the patient concludes the&#xD;
      study. The following points will be supervised, recording the information in files and&#xD;
      photos, since the hospital security protocol does not allow to extract stationery from the&#xD;
      COVID-19 area:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Application and consumption of NSS supplementation as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Morning and evening vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Daily clinical evaluation (It includes variables such as oxygen flow, activity level,&#xD;
           integrity of the hair, skin and nails, evaluation of the sense of taste and smell, pain,&#xD;
           gastrointestinal symptoms, bowel movements, prescribed medications, mood, among others).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Anthropometric measurements using a scale every 2 days (only if the patient is stable&#xD;
           and can maintain balance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Food diaries of each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Laboratory studies every 3 days (previously mentioned).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the same way, the following will be taken into account: the number of days hospitalized,&#xD;
      number of patients who progress to ventilation, number of patients who die, number of&#xD;
      patients who are extubated and number of days after extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis will be carried out for each continuous variable. These variables will&#xD;
      be expressed as mean ± standard deviation and standard error. It will be done according to&#xD;
      the distribution of the data; For independent groups with a normal distribution, Student's T&#xD;
      will be applied. If the distribution does not meet normality criteria, a Mann Whitney U will&#xD;
      be performed; For the follow-up of dependent groups with normal distribution, two-way ANOVA&#xD;
      will be applied. If the distribution does not meet normality criteria, a Friedman test will&#xD;
      be performed, in both cases post hoc tests will be performed, taking into account that a&#xD;
      significant value of p of &lt; 0.05. The results will be analyzed using version 6 of the&#xD;
      Graphpad Prism software.&#xD;

Hypertension is a persistent BP reading of 140/90mmHg or more. It is asked in the baseline period within the clinical history (approximately 10 minutes). Diagnosis is not made upon admission because the physiological stress caused by COVID-19 increases BP and can lead to false positives.</description>

          <title>Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration</title>
          <description>MCHC indicates the amount of hemoglobin per unit volume. In contrast to MCH, MCHC correlates the hemoglobin content with the volume of the cell. It is expressed as g/dl of red blood cells or as a percentage value. The normal values for MCHC are 34 ± 2 g/dl.&#xD;
Laboratory samples are taken in the baseline period. The time to obtain the blood sample is approximately 1 minute.</description>

          <description>Is generated by the urea cycle enzymes, which are mainly in the liver but are also ubiquitously expressed at low levels in other tissues. As a terminal product, is subsequently excreted out of the organism after generation. The normal range of urea nitrogen in blood or serum is 5 to 20 mg/dl.&#xD;
Laboratory samples are taken in the baseline period and the time to obtain the blood sample is approximately 1 minute.</description>
