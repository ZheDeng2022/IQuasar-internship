  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fiber as part of the plants can be provided through eating grains, fruits and vegetables. As&#xD;
      source of fiber, exclusively breastfed infants do not need additional dietary fiber because&#xD;
      breast-milk provides oligosaccharides to maintain the bulk for normal gastrointestinal&#xD;
      movements together with gut probiotics. However, after the period of six months of exclusive&#xD;
      breastfeeding, then complementary foods are the initial sources of fiber of children aged&#xD;
      6-59 months diet, e.g. cereals, fruits and legumes should then be introduced. However,&#xD;
      investigators should consider on the effect of plant foods as a non-haem iron food source&#xD;
      that is less bioavailable for iron absorption. There are other dietary factors that inhibit&#xD;
      iron bioavailability, i.e. phytates in grains and rice, vegetables protein, calcium and&#xD;
      phosphorus in cow's milk and cheese. iron deficiency is remained common globally, especially&#xD;
      for children age 6-24 month in which it can developing into a severe condition, i.e. iron&#xD;
      deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency as well as anemia is closely related to delay child growth&#xD;
      and development, negatively associated with height-for-age, and anemia are at risk for poorer&#xD;
      cognitive, motor, social-emotional, and neurophysiologic development in the short- and&#xD;
      long-term outcome. The aim of this study is to see the association between fiber intake from&#xD;
      different type of milk consumption sources and dietary habits to gastrointestinal health,&#xD;
      anemia and growth status among children aged 6-36 months.&#xD;

      This study is an observational cross-sectional study to get fiber intake profile among&#xD;
      children aged 6-36 months in relation to cow's and non-cow's milk consumption,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms, hemoglobin value and nutritional status. The participants in this&#xD;
      study are children aged 6-36 months who are recruited from selected Puskesmas (Health Care&#xD;
      Center) in Jakarta and Bandung after provided with informed consent from children's parents.&#xD;
      To get proportion of low fiber intake with a degree of reliability 95% and significance level&#xD;
      of 5%, then 400 subjects is needed as a minimal sample size in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children's parents will be interviewed about socio-demographic characteristics of the&#xD;
      subjects, gastrointestinal symptoms during the past two weeks using VAS (Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale) on frequency of bowel movements in a week, parents's education, family income, and&#xD;
      child's food intake. The children's weight and height will be measured and blood sample will&#xD;
      be taken.&#xD;
