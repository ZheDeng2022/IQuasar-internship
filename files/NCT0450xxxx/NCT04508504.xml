  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial seeks to evaluate the analgesic&#xD;
      efficacy of the pericapsular nerve group block in the setting of outpatient hip arthroscopy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pericapsular nerve group, or PENG block, has been recently described and shows promise in&#xD;
      providing analgesia to the hip joint. The analgesic value of this block in the setting of hip&#xD;
      arthroscopy is unknown. This study aims to compare a preoperative PENG block to placebo block&#xD;
      prior to outpatient hip arthroscopy under general anesthesia. The primary outcome measure is&#xD;
      immediate postoperative pain as measured by numerical rating score in the post-anesthesia&#xD;
      care unit (PACU). Secondary outcomes include opioid consumption, opioid-related adverse&#xD;
      events, patient satisfaction, chronic opioid usage, and pain scores at other time points.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups with a computer generated arm assignment. The sealed envelopes will be opened immediately prior to nerve block. One group will receive a PENG block and the other will receive a placebo block. The provider performing the block will not be blinded, however all other members of the care team, the patient, and the investigator collecting data will be blinded to the randomization.</masking_description>

    <description>Maximum pain score within the first 30 minutes after emergence in the post-anesthesia care unit. Pain will be assessed by numerical rating score (0-10, where 0 is no pain, and 10 is the worst possible pain).</description>

    <measure>PACU opioid consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Beginning with emergence from anesthesia and ending with discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit (typically 2 hours).</time_frame>
    <description>Total morphine milligram equivalents required by patients in the post-anesthesia care unit, prior to discharge from the outpatient surgery center. Following emergence from anesthesia, pain will be assessed in regular intervals, with administration of IV and oral opioids according to numeric rating scale and clinical assessment. Opioid administration stops when patient numerical rating score is &lt;4, when patient endorses manageable pain level, when side effects of opioids are intolerable, or for other concerning clinical conditions as determined by the anesthesiologist of record.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive a preoperative ultrasound-guided pericapsular nerve group block with 20 mL 0.5% ropivacaine in a manner consistent with Gir√≥n-Arango et al 2018 (PMID:30063657). Using appropriate sterile precautions, and procedural sedation with up to 2 mg IV midazolam, an ultrasound (SonoSite S-Nerve or Export) equipped with either a linear 15-6 megahertz (MHz), or a curvilinear 5-2 MHz transducer (habitus-dependent) is used to identify the anterior inferior iliac spine, iliopubic eminence, and psoas muscle. After skin localization with 1-2 mL 1% lidocaine, a 22g 80 mm echogenic block needle (Pajunk SonoBlock II Facet) is advanced lateral to medial, in plane with the ultrasound beam, beneath the psoas tendon to the iliopubic eminence. 20 mL 0.5% ropivacaine is injected beneath the psoas tendon and above the iliopubic eminence, in 5 mL increments with periodic aspiration to prevent intravascular injection. The needle is withdrawn, and the needle entry site wiped clean.</description>

    <description>Patients in the placebo group will receive a subcutaneous injection of 5 mL 0.9% normal saline. Using appropriate sterile precautions, and procedural sedation with up to 2 mg IV midazolam, an ultrasound (SonoSite S-Nerve or Export) equipped with either a linear 15-6 megahertz (MHz), or a curvilinear 5-2 MHz transducer (habitus-dependent) is used to identify the anterior inferior iliac spine, iliopubic eminence, and psoas muscle. After skin localization with 1-2 mL 1% lidocaine, a 22g 80 mm echogenic block needle (Pajunk SonoBlock II Facet) is advanced lateral to medial, in plane with the ultrasound beam, 1-2 cm beneath the skin, remaining in the subcutaneous tissue. 5 mL of 0.9% normal saline is injected, with periodic aspiration to prevent intravascular injection. The needle is withdrawn, and the needle entry site wiped clean.</description>
