      A tourniquet is often used in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to achieve better visualization,&#xD;
      reduce intra-operative bleeding and facilitate cement interdigitation. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      associated risks include skin burns, soft tissue and muscle damage, injury of calcified&#xD;
      vessels, increased swelling and stiffness of the joints, nerve injury, paralysis, and&#xD;
      thromboembolic events. The automatic lower limb pneumatic tourniquet system (Zimmer) was&#xD;
      applied to reduce blood loss during surgery. A prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      was performed to investigate the best tourniquet strategy in TKA. The participants were&#xD;
      randomly allocated to groups with different tourniquet strategies: Group 1) tourniquet&#xD;
      inflation from skin to cement hardening (skin to cement); Group 2) tourniquet inflation only&#xD;
      from cementation (cement only) and Group 3) tourniquet inflation from skin incision to skin&#xD;
      closure (skin to skin). In addition to the blood loss and early postoperative outcomes, pain,&#xD;
      soft tissue injury, and rehabilitation were also strictly monitored with a longer follow-up&#xD;
      duration up to 6 months.&#xD;

      A tourniquet is often used in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to achieve better visualization,&#xD;
      reduce intra-operative bleeding and facilitate cement interdigitation. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      associated risks include skin burns, soft tissue and muscle damage, injury of calcified&#xD;
      vessels, increased swelling and stiffness of the joints, nerve injury, paralysis, and&#xD;
      thromboembolic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The automatic lower limb pneumatic tourniquet system (Zimmer) was applied to reduce blood&#xD;
      loss during surgery. The skin under the tourniquet was covered by cast padding. The operated&#xD;
      leg was elevated and exsanguinated before inﬂating the automatic pneumatic tourniquet. There&#xD;
      are three main strategies for the use of a tourniquet in TKR: A) inflate before incision and&#xD;
      deflate following cement hardening ('skin to cement'); B) inflate prior to cement application&#xD;
      and deflated following hardening ('cement only'); C) inflate before incision and deflate&#xD;
      following completion of skin closure ('skin to skin'). The optimal timing of tourniquet&#xD;
      application during primary TKA is still a matter of debate. Most previous reports have failed&#xD;
      to show signiﬁcant differences among different tourniquet strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kvederas et al. compared these three strategies in a randomized double-blind clinical trial,&#xD;
      and demonstrated that the estimated blood loss was highest when the tourniquet was inﬂated&#xD;
      just before cement application and deﬂated after its hardening ('cement only'), while&#xD;
      inﬂation of tourniquet before skin incision and its deﬂation after hardening of cement ('skin&#xD;
      to cement') tends to give better early postoperative mobilization. However, this was an&#xD;
      interim report with limited number of patients, and only limited outcome parameters were&#xD;
      reported, which were insufﬁcient to draw ﬁrm conclusions regarding the differences in&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore we performed this prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a decent&#xD;
      sample size to investigate the best tourniquet strategy in TKA. In addition to the blood loss&#xD;
      and early postoperative outcomes, we also strictly monitored pain, soft tissue injury, and&#xD;
      rehabilitation with a longer follow-up duration up to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the operations were performed through the medial parapatellar approach by the same&#xD;
      experienced joint replacement surgeon. All patients underwent primary TKA with minimally&#xD;
      invasive techniques and cemented prostheses (EvolutionTM medial pivot, MicroPort, USA). An&#xD;
      intramedullary guide was used for both tibial and femoral cuts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The automatic lower limb pneumatic tourniquet system was applied to reduce blood loss during&#xD;
      surgery. The skin under the tourniquet was covered by cast padding. The operated leg was&#xD;
      elevated and exsanguinated before inﬂating the automatic pneumatic tourniquet. One of the&#xD;
      three tourniquet treatment strategies was used, as determined by the group allocation of the&#xD;
      patient. In all the three groups, the tourniquet was inﬂated to a pressure of 280 mm Hg. The&#xD;
      wound was closed after wound irrigation and hemostasis and then was wrapped with elastic&#xD;
      bandages. One drainage was applied postoperatively in all patients and was kept until 24h to&#xD;
      monitor blood loss.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A randomization list was generated prior to recruitment using a computer software (Random Allocation Software Version 1.0.0, Isfahan, Iran). The participants were randomly allocated to either of the 3 groups with different tourniquet strategies: Group 1) tourniquet inflation from skin to cement hardening (skin to cement); Group 2) tourniquet inflation only from cementation (cement only); Group 3) tourniquet inflation from skin incision to skin closure (skin to skin). The surgeon opened a sealed envelope containing the allocation right before the operation in the theatre. The evaluators who examined and collected the data were blinded to the patients' allocation to the study groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Blood Loss</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>We calculated the intraoperative blood loss by measuring the suction volume and weighing the sponges. Hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels were examined preoperatively, and on Day 1 to Day 4 after surgery. Change of Hb and Hct was calculated as the value of postoperative D1 to D4 minus preoperative value. The number of patients undergoing blood transfusion were recorded. The criterion for a blood transfusion was set as a Hb level of &lt;8 g/dL with symptomatic anemia. The calculated blood loss, which reﬂects actual blood loss, was determined with use of a previously described method. Briefly, the patients blood volume (PBV) is calculated using a formula, and multiplying the PBV by the change of haematocrit (preoperative value minus value on postoperative Day 2) will give the estimated total blood loss (ETBL).</description>
