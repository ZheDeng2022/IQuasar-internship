  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the available Hybrid closed loop system is MiniMed 670G (Medtronic Diabetes,&#xD;
      Northridge, CA, USA), which is indicated for children above 7 years old, adolescents and&#xD;
      adults with Type 1 Diabetes. Several studies have shown improved HbA1c, time in target range,&#xD;
      and SG variability in children, adolescents and adults with Type 1 Diabetes, where&#xD;
      participants were experienced with using CSII therapy, assuming that the success of HCL&#xD;
      systems depend on prior use of pump therapy. A recent study, published by diabetes team from&#xD;
      Sidra Medicine, Doha has showed that children and adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes on MDI&#xD;
      therapy can successfully initiate the HCL system, using a concise structured 10-day protocol,&#xD;
      achieving better outcomes than in previous studies, where participants had previous&#xD;
      experience with diabetes related technology and longer initiation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AHCL system, Minimed 780G is CE-marked includes additional functionality aiming to&#xD;
      provide further protections from highs. The user can choose the algorithm to target a glucose&#xD;
      level of 100 or 120 mg/dL. Like for the MiniMed 670G HCL system, users can also choose the&#xD;
      algorithm to temporarily target a glucose value of 150 mg/dL. In addition, the AHCL system&#xD;
      has the ability to administer correction bolus automatically, targeting 120 mg/dL. The AHCL&#xD;
      algorithm was evaluated with a model-based algorithm design platform incorporating a virtual&#xD;
      patient simulator, where additional changes were made (lower target ranges and automated&#xD;
      correction boluses ( )). A recent study including 12 patients with type 1 diabetes on AHCL&#xD;
      system, has shown no episodes of hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis, while maintaining 99%&#xD;
      time spent in closed loop and high time in ra1]\nge ( ). AHCL decreased Auto Mode exits and&#xD;
      alerts, and improves glycaemia without compromising safety, despite multiple food and&#xD;
      exercise challenges ( ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sidra Medicine is the only center for childhood diabetes in Qatar. Around 80% of type 1&#xD;
      diabetes patients are using a device (insulin pump/glucose sensor) and around 45% are using&#xD;
      sensor-augmented pump (SAP)/HCL systems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, single-center, clinical investigation in subjects with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes on AHCL insulin pump in a period of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include an 9-month extension phase, to which participants may voluntarily&#xD;
      decide to take part in, cumulating a total of one-year period duration. Visits wil be&#xD;
      scheduled every 3 months, as per routine practice. TIR, HbA1c, demographics and clinical data&#xD;
      will be analyzed on 3 months period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 33 subjects (age 7-17 years) will be enrolled in order to reach 30 subjects who&#xD;
      will complete the 3 months study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After reviewing the patient's eligibility and interest, the investigators will obtain&#xD;
      informed consent and assent as appropriate. The investigators will start the clinical process&#xD;
      for initiating an insulin pump, which is typically done with pre-pump classes. A clinically&#xD;
      obtained HbA1c assessment will be performed via fingerstick and DCA 2000 at baseline and 3&#xD;
      months during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of demographics and medical history, data for diabetes devices (eg meters,&#xD;
      sensors, pumps) and brief clinical physical exam including vital signs and skin assessment&#xD;
      will be obtained via Hospital Electronic Medical File (Cerner Millennium) and will be kept as&#xD;
      electronic data on a separate research server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different continuous baseline values will be checked for normality of distribution using&#xD;
      the mean-median comparison, skewness and kurtosis (-3 to +3), spread, Kolmogorov-Smirnow and&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wild tests, outliers, histograms and Q-Q-plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initiation protocol consisted of four main stages: AHCL system compatibility assessment,&#xD;
      AHCL system training, Manual Mode and Auto Mode stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1. AHCL system compatibility assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1 will be used to select participants for the study, based on inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria (explained below) as well as patients' interest. It consists of 2 sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AHCL System Introduction session (Clinic visit), one-hour duration (groups of 8-12 patients),&#xD;
      where the AHCL system will be explained. Individuals' responsibilities (e.g. bolusing before&#xD;
      meal, calibrating the system 3-4 times per day, responding to alerts and alarms, downloading&#xD;
      pump data from home) and expectations (e.g. improvements in glycemic control, less glucose&#xD;
      variability, hypoglycemia minimization, workload of diabetes management) will be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AHCL System readiness session, 1-hour duration, where evaluation will be performed on carb&#xD;
      counting, bolus for carbs and correction, SMBG. Participants will send food log diary and&#xD;
      phone call consultation will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: AHCL system training&#xD;
&#xD;
      A similar approach currently used in Sidra for MiniMed 670G system initiation will be used in&#xD;
      the study. AHCL system training will be performed in groups (three to five individuals and&#xD;
      their parents/guardians). The program includes three sessions of two to three hours on three&#xD;
      consecutive days. CGM will be initiated the first day of the training, for education and&#xD;
      observational purposes and for baseline data collection (no insulin delivery by the pump)&#xD;
      Details are explained in the table:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session will be provided by two educators from 12pm to 3pm. Timing of the long acting&#xD;
      insulin injection will be moved two hours ahead each day during training sessions, to reach&#xD;
      12pm the day before the HCL system initiation in Manual Mode, to avoid the use of temporary&#xD;
      basal at insulin pump initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: Manual Mode Participants will initiate the use of the AHCL system in Manual Mode&#xD;
      (Clinic visit) with suspend before low feature for 72 hours to allow the algorithm to collect&#xD;
      insulin utilization and CGM data to establish personalized Auto Mode initiation parameters.&#xD;
      Sidra's validated protocol for SAP initiation (Auto-Generator app), also used in 10-day&#xD;
      initiation protocol, with review of CGM data (step 2) will be used: in short, the protocol&#xD;
      inputs the current insulin program (MDI), calculates a 10 to 20% reduction of total daily&#xD;
      dose, with a 40/60 basal/bolus distribution in four or five basal rates. Insulin to&#xD;
      carbohydrate ratio (ICR) settings utilizes the formula of 300-450/Total Daily dose (TDD) and,&#xD;
      the formula of 90-110/TDD (mmol/l) with two CF settings, the nighttime CF factor is set&#xD;
      10-20% higher than the daytime CF. Active insulin is set time (3 hours), suspend before low&#xD;
      feature is turned on with a threshold of 3.0-3.8 mmol/l (55-70 mg/dl) and glucose target&#xD;
      range from 5.0 mmol/l to 7.2 mmol/l (90-130 mg/dl).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4: Auto Mode The Auto Mode feature of the AHCL system will be activated 72 hours after&#xD;
      manual mode initiation (virtual visit, using Skype Meet) and will be used continuously for 84&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient/family will upload data into the CareLink system, and the data will be reviewed&#xD;
      by a member of the clinical team. Adjustments to system settings will be suggested to the&#xD;
      family as clinically appropriate. The rationale for system setting adjustments will be&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits will be performed on 7, 14, 28 days of aHCL initiation. After the first&#xD;
      month of aHCL system, visits will be every three months during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HbA1c will be obtained using point of care DCA Vantage Analyzer (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany)&#xD;
      at baseline and at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will submit the proposal to Local and National Ethics Committee in Qatar to get&#xD;
      Ethical approval before commencing the study.&#xD;
