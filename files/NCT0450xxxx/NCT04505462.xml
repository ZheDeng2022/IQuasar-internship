  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end-stage kidney disease have hyperphosphatemia and accumulated uremic toxin&#xD;
      level due to decreased urine excretion ability. Unhealthy diet causes altered mineral&#xD;
      metabolism, elevated uremic toxin level, immune dysregulation, and inflammation. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that therapeutic diet intervention reverses altered mineral&#xD;
      metabolism, elevated uremic toxin level, immune dysregulation, and inflammation. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators crafted 7-day special healthy diet to illustrate the clinical&#xD;
      implications of therapeutic diet for dialysis patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in patients with end-stage kidney&#xD;
      disease (ESKD) is far greater than those in the general population. Emerging evidence&#xD;
      suggests that unhealthy diet causes altered mineral metabolism, disturbance of gut microbiota&#xD;
      (dysbiosis) with elevated uremic toxin level, immune dysregulation, and inflammation; these&#xD;
      abnormalities are strongly related to development of CVD. Little is known about the&#xD;
      relationship between therapeutic diet intervention and cardiovascular risk in patients with&#xD;
      ESKD. Recently, the study of the investigators showed that ESKD patients undergoing&#xD;
      hemodialysis who consumed very low-phosphate diet, phosphate-to-protein ratio (PPR) value of&#xD;
      8 mg/g, experienced an extra reduction of serum phosphorus level by 0.61 mg/dL compared with&#xD;
      that of low-phosphate diet, PPR value of 10 mg/g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to explore the effect of 7-day therapeutic diet intervention on&#xD;
      changes of altered mineral metabolism, uremic toxin production, immune dysregulation and&#xD;
      inflammation, highlighting the important role of dietary modification in dialysis population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is to conduct a randomized controlled trial with cross-over design at a hemodialysis unit&#xD;
      of tertiary teaching hospital in Northern Taiwan. Subjects with aged older than 20 years,&#xD;
      ESKD undergoing maintenance dialysis for more than three months, having adequate dialysis and&#xD;
      serum intact parathyroid hormone less than 800 pg/mL will be included. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned into two groups: those in group A will receive study diet for 7 days,&#xD;
      followed by 4-week washout period and then receive 7-day usual diet. The opposite order of&#xD;
      diets will be prescribed in group B. The study meals are prepared in the hospital cafeteria.&#xD;
      Dietary compositions of the study diets were analyzed before the start of the study. The&#xD;
      study outcome measures are difference in change-from-baseline values of altered mineral&#xD;
      metabolism, uremic toxin production, immune dysregulation and inflammation between the&#xD;
      therapeutic diet and the usual diet.&#xD;
