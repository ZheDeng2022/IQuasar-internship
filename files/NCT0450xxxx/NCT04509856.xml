  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was aimed to research the effect of teach-back educational method on diabetes knowledge&#xD;
      level and clinical parameters in type 2 diabetes patients undergoing insulin therapy. This is&#xD;
      a randomized-controlled trial. Teach-back method will used for intervention group, routin&#xD;
      diabetes education will used for control group. The primary outcome is diabetes knowledge&#xD;
      levels (DKL), and secondary outcome is clinical patameters (fasting blood glucose, HbA1c,&#xD;
      blood pressure). DKL and clinical parameters will measured and compared between two groups&#xD;
      before and three months after the interventions.&#xD;

    <description>The DKL will be measured through a self-structured questionnaire containing 11 items. The questionnaire contains three answers: &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;I do not know.&quot; The right answer will be accepted as two points, the wrong answer as zero points, and the &quot;I do not know&quot; answer will be accepted as one point. The total scores ranges from 0-22. Higher scores of the questionnaire indicates that the higher DKL.</description>

    <description>In the teach-back method, after teaching new information to the patient, the patients were asked to explain that new information in their own words. Then the patients' knowledge and the adequateness of their explanations were determined. The patient should repeat the instructions in their own words. In this way, the healthcare professional can evaluate how the patient understands the information. If the patient repeated the information correctly, the teach-back phase for that information was completed, and progression for new information was resumed. However, if there was a deficiency or error in the information, it was corrected and repeated by the healthcare professional.</description>
