  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common and lethal cancers worldwide, especially in&#xD;
      China, and the median overall survival for patients with advanced, metastatic GC remains only&#xD;
      about 1 year. Several molecular profiling studies have demonstrated that a proportion of&#xD;
      gastric cancer harbour actionable molecular alterations which shows a predictive benefit from&#xD;
      a specific therapy (in any cancer type). In the current study, the efficacy of precision&#xD;
      treatment for gastric cancer guided by multidimensional molecular biology profiling will be&#xD;
      observed. The analysis focused on the overall survival outcomes for patients whose tumours&#xD;
      harboured actionable molecular alterations and who received appropriately matched therapy.&#xD;
