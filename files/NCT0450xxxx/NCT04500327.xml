  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability and suitability of the Drive app (app&#xD;
      under test) to measure sleep parameters during CPAP use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single arm exploratory study without blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current users of CPAP therapy will be recruited for this study and will be provided with a&#xD;
      smartphone (app under test installed) and a non-contact motion sensor in their home&#xD;
      environment. These devices will measure sleep metrics such as sleep stages and breathing&#xD;
      metrics that may be associated with sleep disordered breathing. Usage and setup instructions&#xD;
      will be provided for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will contribute up to 7 overnight recordings in the home environment and will&#xD;
      complete daily questionnaires detailing their experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may be completed in two distinct phases, with an analysis performed after each&#xD;
      phase. Each phase is expected to last up to six weeks with the overall study duration taking&#xD;
      up to 12 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study may be completed in two distinct phases, with an analysis performed after each&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (Exploratory): A minimum of 10 and up to 12 participants will be recruited to&#xD;
      identify any issues in using the app when used in conjunction with CPAP therapy (e.g. missed&#xD;
      signals, inappropriate classification of breathing signals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (Iterative Updates): Where changes to the algorithm or user interface are required,&#xD;
      an additional 30 and up to 35 participants may be tested to provide design confidence.&#xD;
      Conversely, if substantial issues are experienced and the time and effort required to address&#xD;
      the issues is sufficiently large, the study may terminate before completion of phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each phase is expected to last up to six weeks with the overall study duration taking up to&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to visit ResMed twice. The first visit will involve briefing of&#xD;
      the study, consent form signatures, briefing on trial equipment and setup/usage instructions.&#xD;
      The second (last) visit will involve going through the daily questionnaires with&#xD;
      participants, collecting trial equipment and providing reimbursement for the study.&#xD;

    <description>This will be based on:&#xD;
Subjective data from daily questionnaires sent out to participants&#xD;
Comparison between Drive app data with the non contact motion sensor and CPAP data&#xD;
The questionnaire has yes/no questions and a likert scale (from 0-10) that participants fill in to indicate how representative each nights sleep hypnogram is. For e.g. if the participant was awake between 12am-1am but the app reports that the subject is in deep sleep, this will be captured in the questionnaire.&#xD;
Metrics including accuracy, correlation, total cohens kappa will be used for each signal recorded by the app which will be used to compare to the data from the reference devices.</description>
