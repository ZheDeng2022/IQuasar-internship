  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy and affects&#xD;
      3-6% of adults in the United States. In patients with severe or refractory symptoms, carpal&#xD;
      tunnel release (CTR) represents the definitive management option, and over 550,000 CTRs are&#xD;
      performed annually in the United States with over 90% of patients reporting clinical&#xD;
      improvement. Currently available CTR techniques include mini-open CTR via a single, 1-3 cm&#xD;
      palmar incision (mOCTR), endoscopic CTR via one (wrist) or two (wrist and palm) 1-2 cm&#xD;
      incisions (ECTR), and ultrasound guided CTR via a single &lt; 1 cm wrist or palmar incision&#xD;
      (USCTR). The primary objective is to assess the impact of USCTR vs mOCTR in a military&#xD;
      population. This study is a multi-site prospective randomized comparative trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with CTS will be randomized to a study arm and receive treatment with ultrasound&#xD;
      guided carpal tunnel release (USCTR) vs. traditional mini-open carpal tunnel release (mOCTR).&#xD;
      All patients will be followed for a period of 24 months with respect to standard clinical&#xD;
      data, military relevant data, and validated patient related outcome measures (PROMs). Data&#xD;
      will be collected at 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12&#xD;
      months, and 24 months post-CTR procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that USCTR using the SX-One MicroKnife® will safely and&#xD;
      more-effectively improve symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome compared to traditional mOCTR,&#xD;
      with less loss of military duty days.&#xD;

Each item is scored on a scale of 1-5 and a final score of 0 to 100 is calculated, with higher scores representing greater degrees of upper extremity disability (0 points indicate no disability and 100 points indicates maximum disability).</description>
