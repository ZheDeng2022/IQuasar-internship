  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to compare non-healing colonic ulcers in patients with&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with iatrogenic colonic ulcers (biopsy sites) in healthy&#xD;
      control patients and patients with rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis. Patients will be&#xD;
      biopsied at baseline and again at a follow-up visit in a &quot;biopsy of the biopsy&quot; approach.&#xD;
      These biopsies will be used to reveal patterns about gene expression and mitochondrial&#xD;
      function during ulcer healing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction of mucosal healing in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with reduced&#xD;
      hospitalizations, surgeries, and reduced cancer risk. However, previous studies have shown&#xD;
      that 54-69% of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients fail to heal ulcers after several weeks of&#xD;
      treatment, and roughly half do not maintain remission at one year. The single most important&#xD;
      factor in preventing severe medical consequences, like colon removal surgery or cancer, is&#xD;
      treatment to completely heal the top layer of the intestine as quickly as possible. Healing&#xD;
      is a complex process and the dysfunction observed in colitis can only be fully understood by&#xD;
      comparison to healing in non-IBD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective trial involving three groups of patients: 1) IBD patients with active&#xD;
      disease, newly treated with anti-TNF therapy (biologic failure or na√Øve); 2) non-IBD patients&#xD;
      with rheumatoid/psoriatic arthritis who are receiving anti-TNF therapy, and 3) healthy&#xD;
      control patients. Biopsies will be collected at baseline during standard of care endoscopy&#xD;
      and at a follow-up research endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will probe mechanisms of ulcer healing by analyzing gene expression patterns and&#xD;
      mitochondrial function.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mayo Endoscopic Score</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Mayo Endoscopic Score will be calculated at baseline and at follow-up in patients with ulcerative colitis only. The Mayo Endoscopic score is evaluated for the macroscopically most severely inflamed segment: 0 for normal or inactive disease; 1 for erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability; 2 for marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions; 3 ulcerations or spontaneous bleeding. Segmental scores range from 0-3; higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Segmental SES-CD Score</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Simple Endoscopic Score (SES) will be calculated at baseline and follow-up in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) only. The SES-CD score incorporates ulcer size, narrowing, and the area affected by disease or ulceration. Scores range from 0-12; lower scores indicate remission while higher scores indicate severe endoscopic activity.</description>
