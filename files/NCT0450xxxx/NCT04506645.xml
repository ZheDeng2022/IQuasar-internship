  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) doses of REGN5381 in healthy normotensive and otherwise healthy hypertensive&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of single IV doses of REGN5381 on blood pressure (BP) and heart&#xD;
           rate (HR) in healthy normotensive and otherwise healthy hypertensive adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of single IV doses of REGN5381 on cardiac stroke volume (SV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single IV doses of REGN5381&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of single IV doses of REGN5381&#xD;
