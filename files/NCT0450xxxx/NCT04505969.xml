    <textblock>
      This pilot research is aimed to assess the needs of patients and health workers involved in&#xD;
      Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) management in Nigeria. To achieve this, a questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered to SCD patients or parents of children affected by SCD. Another questionnaire&#xD;
      will be administered to doctors and nurses working with SCD patients. A focus group&#xD;
      discussion with patients/parents willing to participate will be also scheduled. Participants&#xD;
      from the following centres will be involved: Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital Kaduna State&#xD;
      University, Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital Zaria, National Hospital Abuja, Federal&#xD;
      Medical Centre Katsina. Data will be qualitatively and quantitatively analysed and presented&#xD;
      as aggregated data. Consent from all the study participants will be sought. Questionnaires&#xD;
      will be coded and no personal data will be disclosed to authorised third parties.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to understand the needs of SCD patients and health&#xD;
      workers involved in SCD management, with particular reference to the disease management in&#xD;
      the clinical centre. This is a descriptive, mixed method prospective questionnaire-based&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is intended as a pilot experience to verify the feasibility of the action through a&#xD;
      structured survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two questionnaires have been developed: one will be administered to 30 SCD patients or&#xD;
      parents/legally designated representatives of children affected by SCD and 30 Professionals&#xD;
      working with SCD patients (mainly doctors and nurses) in four clinical centres in Nigeria for&#xD;
      a total of 120 patients and 120 health workers. A focus group discussion will be run with the&#xD;
      SCD patients/parents. Following the pilot study, a wider survey will be launched involve&#xD;
      patients, parents and healthcare professionals in the whole country and in other centres&#xD;
      involved in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for this study will be collected using triangulation methods. A simple random and&#xD;
      purposive sampling techniques will be used to select respondents for the study. The collected&#xD;
      data for this study will be presented and analysed using SPSS and thematic analysis. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in four centres in Nigeria: Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital Kaduna&#xD;
      State University (BDTH), Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital Zaria (ABUTH), National&#xD;
      Hospital Abuja (NHA), and Federal Medical Centre Katsina (FMC). The study will be performed&#xD;
      in the framework of the &quot;African Research and Innovative initiative for Sickle cell&#xD;
      Education: Improving Research Capacity for Service Improvement&quot; project (GA 824021 - ARISE -&#xD;
      H2020-MSCA-RISE-2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARISE is the EU (Horizon 2020) 4-year funded project between European, African, US and&#xD;
      Lebanon institutions for research staff exchanges, started on 1st of January 2019. Fondazione&#xD;
      per la Ricerca Farmacologica Gianni Benzi Onlus coordinates the ARISE project.&#xD;
