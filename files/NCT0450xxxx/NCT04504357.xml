  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The near-elimination of HIV transmission with antiretroviral therapy (ART) has provided the&#xD;
      world with a clear path to end the HIV epidemic through the mass provision of ART at&#xD;
      diagnosis, i.e. test-and-treat. Despite the substantial prevention benefits of ART, the&#xD;
      investigators found minimal knowledge of treatment-as-prevention (TasP) in two&#xD;
      population-based surveys recently conducted in South Africa. In addition, current public&#xD;
      health messaging and clinical HIV counselling in South Africa do not emphasize the prevention&#xD;
      benefits of ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this formative research study the investigators will develop an app-based educational&#xD;
      video intervention that will provide information on Undetectable = Untransmittable (U=U) that&#xD;
      is locally-appropriate and can be integrated into routine HIV counselling. The intervention&#xD;
      will be piloted in a clinical trial of patients in South Africa receiving HIV post-test and&#xD;
      adherence counselling services, to determine feasibility and acceptability, impact on U=U&#xD;
      knowledge and attitudes, impact on stigma and psychological well being, and preliminary&#xD;
      evidence for ART uptake and adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study builds on a longstanding collaboration between Boston University and the Health&#xD;
      Economics and Epidemiology Research Office (HE2RO) at the University of Witwatersrand in&#xD;
      Johannesburg, South Africa. The study is highly innovative because the investigators take a&#xD;
      novel approach - disseminating information on the prevention benefits of ART - to improve the&#xD;
      wellbeing of people living with HIV (PLWH) and motivate early uptake of ART in South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that selling treatment-as-prevention on its merits could&#xD;
      substantially improve the wellbeing of PLWH and increase demand for ART, enabling countries&#xD;
      to maximize the impact of test-and-treat.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Phase 1- A video-based &quot;app&quot; will be developed to provide HIV patients with information on&#xD;
      TasP/U=U. The investigators will design a series of short video modules on the prevention&#xD;
      benefits of ART leading to viral suppression and package them as a tablet-based app to&#xD;
      augment existing HIV counseling. In collaboration with the Prevention Access Campaign,&#xD;
      locally-appropriate videos will be developed on (a) the science of TasP/U=U including risks,&#xD;
      (b) benefits to self (e.g. psychological benefits, ability to have children), (c) benefits to&#xD;
      partners (e.g. secondary prevention), (d) benefits to society (e.g. AIDS-free generation),&#xD;
      and (e) TasP self-efficacy, including viral load (VL) literacy, disclosure, and couples&#xD;
      testing. Content will be developed with HIV counselors, PLWH, and other stakeholders in an&#xD;
      Intervention Mapping exercise. After training clinic staff, the videos will be shown in&#xD;
      clinic waiting rooms and the tablet-based &quot;app&quot; will be integrated into HIV counseling&#xD;
      sessions. Intervention content will also be pushed to participants via SMS, and the app will&#xD;
      be shared with those with smart phones. The intervention will be pre-tested in focus groups&#xD;
      (n=3) and interviews (n=20) with counselors and patients. (NOTE: THE RESPONDENTS FOR PHASE 1&#xD;
      ARE NOT INCLUDED IN CLINICAL TRIAL REPORTING.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2- A clinical trial will be conducted using two recruitment periods at three public&#xD;
      sector clinics to establish intervention acceptability, effects on knowledge and attitudes,&#xD;
      and preliminary impact on ART uptake, adherence, and viral suppression in a pilot trial and&#xD;
      demonstration project (n=135).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During recruitment period 1 (n=90), patients completing HIV post-test or adherence counseling&#xD;
      will be referred to study staff and randomized 1:1 to no intervention (Arm A) vs. &quot;controlled&#xD;
      exposure&quot; to the tablet-based U=U app (Arm B). In recruitment period 2 (n=45), U=U videos&#xD;
      will be shown in clinic waiting rooms and the tablet-based app will be integrated into&#xD;
      routine counseling (Arm C) in a &quot;clinical exposure&quot; demonstration project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be cross-randomized to monthly text messages reinforcing intervention&#xD;
      content. For all study arms, investigators will assess feasibility and acceptability,&#xD;
      resonance of different key messages and videos, knowledge and attitudes related to TasP,&#xD;
      internalized stigma and mental health, HIV prevention altruism, and behaviours related to&#xD;
      disclosure, risk-taking, and care-seeking in surveys at enrolment, post-test, and 6 months.&#xD;
      ART uptake, appointment adherence, and 6-month VL will be assessed in clinical records.&#xD;
      Qualitative exit interviews will be conducted with participants and staff (n=30).&#xD;
