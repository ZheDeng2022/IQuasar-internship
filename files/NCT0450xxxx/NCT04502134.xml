  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to extract effusions and damaged tendons during tendon repair&#xD;
      therapy in patients with tendon tears. Then, we would analyze tendon-related transcription&#xD;
      factors from histology and cytology, and compare changes in tendon with ultrasound images.&#xD;
      Helps to understand the mechanism of tendon lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to past studies, it is often observed that changes in extracellular matrix, growth&#xD;
      factors, and cytokines in degenerative tendons, indicating that the tendon is constantly&#xD;
      changing. This change will in turn produce a change in the morphology of the tendon tissue in&#xD;
      the ultrasound image. However, there have been few studies in the past literature on the&#xD;
      correlation between constant changes in tendon-specific transcription factors and&#xD;
      characterization on clinical ultrasound images. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to&#xD;
      extract the effusion and damaged tendon while performing tendon repair therapy in patients&#xD;
      with tendon tears, and to analyze the tendon-related transcription factors from histology and&#xD;
      cytology to understand the changes in tendon homeostasis. At the same time, the&#xD;
      interpretation of clinical ultrasound images was combined to establish the relationship&#xD;
      between the biochemical factors of the cell tissues of chronic tendon lesions and the&#xD;
      clinical ultrasound image. This study will help us to understand the mechanism of chronic&#xD;
      tendinopathy.&#xD;
