  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teikoku Seiyaku Co., Ltd. (Japan) is developing a new Esflurbiprofen Hydrogel Patch (EFHP), a&#xD;
      transdermal product containing 165 mg of the S-enantiomer of flurbiprofen (S-flurbiprofen) as&#xD;
      its active pharmaceutical ingredient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present clinical trial will be conducted to characterise maximum observed systemic&#xD;
      exposure of the newly developed EFHP (Test) vs. &quot;Froben 100 mg&quot; (Reference, containing 100 mg&#xD;
      racemic flurbiprofen in a 1:1 ratio). Characterisation will be performed under steady state&#xD;
      conditions in order to bridge the available safety information on the basis of the comparison&#xD;
      of maximum observed systemic exposure by means of AUC0-24h,ss,P vs. AUC0-24,ss,T and&#xD;
      Cmax,ss,P vs. Cmax,ss,T of S-flurbiprofen.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single centre, open-label, randomised (order of treatments), balanced, multiple dose&#xD;
      trial will be performed in a 2-period, 2-sequence-crossover design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Test Product (patch) will be applied once daily over 14 consecutive days, whereby each&#xD;
      patch will remain applied for 24 h. Blood sampling will be performed after the 1st patch&#xD;
      application over 24 h in order to characterise the single dose application and after the 14th&#xD;
      patch application over 72 h in order to characterise pharmacokinetic parameters after&#xD;
      multiple dosing including elimination phase. In between through values will be taken in the&#xD;
      morning of specified study days to characterise steady-state built-up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Reference product will be administered after a light meal as single oral doses of 100 mg&#xD;
      flurbiprofen three times daily (i.e. every 8 h) over 4 days. Blood sampling will be performed&#xD;
      after the 10th tablet administration over 72 h in order to characterise pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters after multiple dosing including elimination phase. In between through values will&#xD;
      be taken in the morning of study days 1 to 4 to characterise steady-state built-up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial will be performed as a cross-over investigation with intra-individual&#xD;
      comparison, thus reducing variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters, which is supposed to&#xD;
      be higher between subjects than within an individual subject.&#xD;
