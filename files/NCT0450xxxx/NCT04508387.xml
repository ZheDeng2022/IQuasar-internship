  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: It is recommended to heat and humidify CO2 in laparoscopic surgery to prevent&#xD;
      postoperative pain and hypothermia but information about its effects on hemodynamic and&#xD;
      respiratory parameters is limited. The investigators aimed to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      standard and heated-humidified CO2 on hemodynamic and respiratory parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: One hundred patients who underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign&#xD;
      pathology were divided into two groups: Group CD (cold-dry) patients were administered&#xD;
      standard CO2, while Group HH (heated-humidified) patients were administered 95% humidified&#xD;
      insufflation at 37°C. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, body temperature, pain score&#xD;
      and blood count parameters were recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sample consisted of 100 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II&#xD;
      patients aged 40-65 who underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign pathology. The&#xD;
      patients were divided into two groups according to a randomization scheme created by a&#xD;
      computer: Group CD (cold-dry) patients were administered dry CO2 via insufflator at room&#xD;
      temperature (21°C), while Group HH (heated-humidified) patients were administered 95%&#xD;
      humidified CO2 insufflation at 37°C. The study was planned as a randomized and double-blind&#xD;
      study, where patients were not informed of their group.During the operation and in the&#xD;
      postoperative period, the patients were followed up by two different anesthetists. All&#xD;
      patients were given information and training on the anesthesia method, the use of the&#xD;
      patient-controlled-analgesia (PCA) device and the visual analog scale (VAS) the day before&#xD;
      the operation. The patients' demographic data (age, weight, height, etc.) and their basal&#xD;
      systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures and heart rates were measured prior to the&#xD;
      operation and recorded on the case report form.&#xD;
