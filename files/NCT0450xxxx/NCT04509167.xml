  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is a pilot clinical trial using personalized neoantigen peptide vaccines with&#xD;
      an adjuvant (Montanide ISA-51 VG), in patients with different types of cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Cancer cells express unique peptide antigens recognized by CD8+ cytotoxic T&#xD;
      lymphocytes (CTL), which are typically 8-10 amino acids long and are presented in association&#xD;
      with Class I MHC molecules. The peptides recognized by helper (CD4+) T-cells are presented in&#xD;
      association with Class II MHC molecules and are usually longer (13-18 amino acids in length),&#xD;
      although peptide elution studies have indicated no apparent restriction on peptide length.&#xD;
      Selected peptides can induce circulating T cell responses in most patients, and that&#xD;
      vaccination with a mixture of peptides is immunogenic in up to 100% of patients. The&#xD;
      magnitude of T cell responses sometimes is substantial, with 1-5% of circulating CD8 T cells&#xD;
      reactive to single antigens. T cell responses to vaccines may be durable for months or years,&#xD;
      but are at least as likely to be transient, sometimes declining even while still receiving&#xD;
      vaccines. However, T cells induced by vaccination can recognize and lyse cancerous cells&#xD;
      expressing the relevant protein and MHC, and peptide vaccines induce promising&#xD;
      immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though MHC-restriction of individual peptides limits their use to a subset of patients, there&#xD;
      are mixtures of a dozen peptides restricted by HLA-A1, A2, A3, or A11 can be prepared as a&#xD;
      stable mixture and can induce immune responses in 85% of patients with cancer who express one&#xD;
      or more of those MHC molecules, without negative effects from competition among the peptides.&#xD;
      Other experience supports the ability to induce T cell responses to multiple peptides when&#xD;
      vaccinating with peptide mixtures. Since antigenic peptides are easily degraded by proteases&#xD;
      in the body, it is difficult for the receptors expressed on the immune cells to identify&#xD;
      antigen epitopes, and they do not generate a strong immune response to pathogens. An&#xD;
      epitope-based vaccine with a reasonable design is composed of epitope peptide/s, a delivery&#xD;
      system, and an adjuvant. For multi-epitope vaccines, since the traditional carriers and&#xD;
      adjuvants are associated with poor efficacy, vaccine designs with built-in adjuvants have&#xD;
      been proposed. Therefore, a built-in adjuvant exhibiting both the functions of a transmission&#xD;
      system and a traditional adjuvant, is constructed within the vaccine to improve the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of epitope peptides by stimulating the innate immune response required for an&#xD;
      adaptive immune response. To achieve this goal, the epitopes are regularly fused with&#xD;
      adjuvant proteins or displayed on the surface of some particular biomaterials (e.g.,&#xD;
      liposomes, gold nanoparticles, and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)) and the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the epitopes are significantly increased by this immune complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This research is a pilot clinical trial using a personalized neoantigen peptide&#xD;
      vaccine. Approximately 100 patients with cancer and whose sequencing studies show the&#xD;
      presence of neoantigens will receive the personalized multi-peptide vaccine. Peptide vaccines&#xD;
      will be given with an adjuvant (Montanide ISA-51 VG) by intradermal injection (~0.5 mg of&#xD;
      each peptide) in the arm every week for a maximum of 8 weeks; the treatment will be&#xD;
      discontinued if disease progresses or if there is deterioration of the patient's general&#xD;
      condition. All patients will give written informed consent; their data will be coded and&#xD;
      fully anonymized. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Regenerative Medicine&#xD;
      Institute and conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
