  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemokine receptor CXCR4 is normally expressed on T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, monocytes,&#xD;
      macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils as well as hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells&#xD;
      (HSPC) in the bone marrow. 68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT represents a promising method for the in&#xD;
      vivo assessment of the CXCR4 expression status in cancer patients, especially in hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies. This prospective study is going to investigate whether metabolic&#xD;
      characterization by 68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT may be superior for diagnosis, risk&#xD;
      stratification, and the prognostic evaluation in lymphoproliferative diseases.&#xD;

      Lymphoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The marginal zone lymphoma, plasma cell lymphoma, T-cell-lymphoma frequently do not present&#xD;
      with an elevated FDG uptake. However, lymphoma is a frequent cancer with high CXCR4&#xD;
      expression. The previous studies showed 68Ga-pentixafor-PET seems to be a highly selective&#xD;
      and specific method for the in vivo quantification of CXCR4 expression. Thus, our study is&#xD;
      going to investigate the value of 68Ga-pentixafor-PET/CT for the diagnosis and prognostic&#xD;
      evaluation of CXCR4 expression in lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple myeloma:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells&#xD;
      producing a monoclonal immunoglobulin. Minimal residual disease (MRD) status is an important&#xD;
      predictor of clinical outcome in MM. But it is difficult to assess the accurate MRD status&#xD;
      because of the significant heterogeneity characterizing with 18F-FDG PET/CT. Studies showed&#xD;
      Chemokine receptor CXCR4 was expressed in MM cells and CXCR4-targeting molecular&#xD;
      imaging-68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT could be a promising technique to evaluate the extent of MM&#xD;
      with higher accuracy. This prospective study is going to investigate the value of&#xD;
      68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT for the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of CXCR4 expression in MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukemiaï¼š Leukemia is the second largest family of hematological malignancies after the&#xD;
      lymphomas, and, depending on the subtype, may show a considerable overlap of histological&#xD;
      features with the latter. The four main kinds of leukemia are, in the order of their&#xD;
      prevalence. Imaging has traditionally played a limited role in the work-up of leukemias, with&#xD;
      regard to detection, staging, and response assessment. 18F-FDG PET/CT is not recommended for&#xD;
      routine evaluation of CLL, because the disease shows low uptake in the majority of cases.&#xD;
      Although, the clinical utility of MRI lies in the detection of bone marrow abnormalities that&#xD;
      are suspicious for leukemia in adult and pediatric patients with unclear musculoskeletal&#xD;
      symptoms with its reduced radiation dose (in comparison with PET/CT). However, it may become&#xD;
      more attractive with the use of newer, non-FDG PET radiotracers. High CXCR4 expression is&#xD;
      known to be associated with poor prognosis in CLL. Recently, the feasibility of&#xD;
      68Ga-Pentixafor PET has also been demonstrated for CLL and AML. This prospective study is&#xD;
      going to investigate the value of 68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT for the diagnosis and prognostic&#xD;
      evaluation of CXCR4 expression in leukemia.&#xD;
