  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been recognized as an effective,&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic treatment for a variety of CP conditions. However, little is known about&#xD;
      the neurologic mechanisms underlying ACT. The investigators conducted an ACT intervention in&#xD;
      women (n=9) with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      data were collected pre- and post-ACT, and changes in functional connectivity (FC) were&#xD;
      measured using Network-Based Statistics (NBS). Behavioral outcomes were measured using&#xD;
      validated assessments such as the Acceptance &amp; Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II), the Chronic&#xD;
      Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale&#xD;
      (CES-D), and the NIH Toolbox Neuro-QoLTM (Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders) scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results suggest that, following the four-week ACT intervention, participants exhibited&#xD;
      reductions in brain activation within and between key networks including self-reflection&#xD;
      (default mode, DMN), emotion (salience, SN), and cognitive control (frontal parietal, FPN).&#xD;
      These changes in connectivity strength were correlated with changes in behavioral outcomes&#xD;
      including decreased depression and pain interference, and increased participation in social&#xD;
      roles. This study is one of the first to demonstrate that improved function across the DMN,&#xD;
      SN, and FPN may drive the positive outcomes associated with ACT. This study contributes to&#xD;
      the emerging evidence supporting the use of neurophysiological indices to characterize&#xD;
      treatment effects of alternative and complementary mind-body therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain (CP), which causes more disability than&#xD;
      any other medical condition in the U.S. at a cost of $560-$635 billion per year. Opioid&#xD;
      analgesics are frequently used to treat CP. However, long term use of opioids can cause brain&#xD;
      changes such as opioid-induced hyperalgesia that, over time, increase pain sensation. Also,&#xD;
      opioids fail to treat complex psychological factors that worsen pain-related disability,&#xD;
      including beliefs and emotional responses to pain. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be&#xD;
      efficacious for CP. However, CBT does not focus on important factors needed for long-term&#xD;
      functional improvement, including attainment of personal goals and the psychological&#xD;
      flexibility to choose responses to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a mindfulness-based therapy that focuses on&#xD;
      enabling individuals to accept what is out of their control, and to commit to valued actions&#xD;
      that enrich their lives. ACT was developed in 1986 by Stephen C. Hayes who began to examine&#xD;
      how language and thought influence internal experiences. By emphasizing acceptance instead of&#xD;
      avoidance, ACT differs from many other forms of cognitive behavioral therapy. Although not&#xD;
      originally designed for CP, ACT has been shown to be efficacious in terms of clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, adherence to treatment, and retention, earning the status of a &quot;well-established&quot;&#xD;
      treatment for CP from the American Psychological Association. ACT aims to increase&#xD;
      psychological flexibility, and has been associated with improved health outcomes in many&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trials, including three systematic reviews specific to CP.&#xD;
      Psychological flexibility is defined as an individual's ability to &quot;recognize and adapt to&#xD;
      various situational demands; shift mindsets or behavioral repertoires when these strategies&#xD;
      compromise personal or social functioning; maintain balance among important life domains; and&#xD;
      be aware, open, and committed to behaviors that are congruent with deeply held values.&quot; ACT&#xD;
      is a &quot;third wave&quot; behavioral treatment that has been shown to be efficacious for treating CP,&#xD;
      as well as co-morbid conditions and factors (e.g., goal selection) related to long-term&#xD;
      functional improvement. Additionally, patients who participate in ACT report greater&#xD;
      long-term satisfaction compared to CBT. ACT is transdiagnostic and associated with&#xD;
      improvements in physical functioning and pain-related disability, as well as decreases in&#xD;
      emotional distress regardless of perceived pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) allows for data to be collected&#xD;
      while individuals with CP rest in the MRI scanner for a short period of time (&lt;10 minutes).&#xD;
      Thus, data provides information about the natural state of brain function in CP without&#xD;
      having to apply any external sensory or cognitive stimulation. Analysis methods of rsfMRI&#xD;
      have focused on multiple regions in the brain, targeting inherent and altered measures of&#xD;
      connectivity between brain regions and within brain networks. Further, alterations in brain&#xD;
      structure and function have been demonstrated in multiple CP syndromes. Prior imaging&#xD;
      research has suggested that CP results in abnormal hyper-connectivity of brain networks&#xD;
      associated with self-reflection (default mode, DMN), emotion (salience, SN), and cognitive&#xD;
      control (frontal parietal, FPN) networks. While ACT has been successful in helping those with&#xD;
      CP create a more functional and personally meaningful life, a critical gap in the&#xD;
      understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying ACT remains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only two prior investigations have used fMRI to assess neural mechanisms of ACT-based&#xD;
      interventions for CP. The first investigated task fMRI activation using pressure evoked pain.&#xD;
      Participants with fibromyalgia showed increased activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (vlPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) post-ACT after 12 weeks of ACT. Additionally,&#xD;
      results showed pain-evoked changes in connectivity between the vlPFC and thalamus after ACT.&#xD;
      Researchers in the second investigation conducted an 8-week ACT intervention vs. health&#xD;
      education control (HEC) for participants with comorbid CP and opioid addiction. Focusing on&#xD;
      DMN and pain regions in the brain, participants receiving ACT exhibited decreased activation&#xD;
      during evoked pain in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), insula,&#xD;
      anterior cingulate cortex (aCC), posterior cingulate cortex (pCC), and superior temporal&#xD;
      gyrus (STG) compared with HEC participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, ACT was delivered to nine women with CP. fMRI was used to identify&#xD;
      changes in brain networks underlying ACT-related behavioral outcomes in CP. Based on prior&#xD;
      work examining ACT in CP, the investigators hypothesize that: (1) ACT will reduce&#xD;
      connectivity strength within and between the DMN, SN, and FPN, and that (2) changes in&#xD;
      connectivity strength will correlate with changes in behavioral outcomes from pre- to&#xD;
      post-ACT.&#xD;
