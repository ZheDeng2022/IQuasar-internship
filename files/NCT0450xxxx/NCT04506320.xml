      This is a retrospective observational study of epidemiological surveillance, multicenter,&#xD;
      non-profit, spontaneous, Italian on patients submitted to allo-HSCT among Italian Transplant&#xD;
      Centers GITMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate all consecutive adult patients who received novel drugs after&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from related and unrelated donors between January 1,&#xD;
      2009 to December 31, 2018 in GITMO-affiliated Centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate approximately 300 subjects (with competitive enrolment) from GITMO&#xD;
      investigational centers.&#xD;

      This is a retrospective, observational multicenter, non-profit, spontaneous, Italian study&#xD;
      organized under the auspices of the Gruppo Italiano Trapianti di Midollo Osseo that involves&#xD;
      the principal Centers active in transplantation of any kind of hematopoietic stem cells in&#xD;
      Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple myeloma is a neoplastic plasma cell disorder characterized by clonal proliferation&#xD;
      of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow and the presence of a monoclonal protein in the&#xD;
      blood and/or urine, resulting in myeloma-defining events. The outcomes of patients with&#xD;
      Multiple myeloma have improved significantly due to the introduction of novel agents;&#xD;
      however, the disease remains incurable for most patients. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation has a curative potential by employing the donor immune system to eradicate&#xD;
      malignant plasmacells, commonly referred to as the graft-versus-myeloma effect. However,&#xD;
      despite this proven graft-versus-myeloma effect, the associated severe toxicity as&#xD;
      treatment-related mortality mainly induced by myeloablative conditioning strategies and,&#xD;
      above all, high relapse rate are important concerns and the place and role of allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in Multiple myeloma remain challenging. In this&#xD;
      regard, the International Myeloma Working Group together with the Blood and Marrow Transplant&#xD;
      Clinical Trials Network, the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, and the&#xD;
      European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation agreed that allogeneic hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation should be considered an appropriate therapy for all eligible&#xD;
      patients with early relapse (occurring within 24 months) after primary therapy that included&#xD;
      the new proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs and autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation and/or high-risk features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation might represent an interesting platform&#xD;
      for the use of rescue treatments based on novel drugs after the relapse. This observation&#xD;
      might reflect the fact that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can modify the&#xD;
      biology of the disease, directly targeting the myelomatous plasma cells as well as the&#xD;
      microenvironment, and the well-documented graft-versus-myeloma effect induced by reactive&#xD;
      allogeneic T cells may persist after relapse and contribute to an enhanced disease response.&#xD;
      Novel agent-based combinations should be considered also in association with donor lymphocyte&#xD;
      infusion. Monoclonal antibodies have emerged as the new option for treatment of patients with&#xD;
      relapsed and refractory MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This scenario might represent a good opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of novel agents&#xD;
      before and after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objectives of this study are to retrospectively investigate the outcome of&#xD;
      patients with Mieloma multiple after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and&#xD;
      the first purpose of this study is to describe the overall survival at 2 years after&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are described Progression Free Survival, the incidence of acute and&#xD;
      chronic graft versus host disease, describe the hematological and non-hematological toxicity&#xD;
      of drugs administered after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and describe&#xD;
      the Non-relapse- mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored using database Promise and specific e-CRFs. Data Center will perform&#xD;
      extensive consistency checks and issue. Query Forms in case of inconsistent data. Follow-up&#xD;
      period for the evaluation of survival will be from the date of transplant until 24 months&#xD;
      post-transplant or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice, the&#xD;
      current Italian and European laws and regulations, in agreement with the declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki. The protocol has been written and the study will be conducted according to The&#xD;
      International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for&#xD;
      Human Use Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, issued by the European&#xD;
      Union. The responsible Local Ethical Committee approval must be obtained before starting the&#xD;
      trial. A copy of the patient informed consent form must be submitted to the appropriate&#xD;
      authority or committee, together with the protocol for written approval. Written approval of&#xD;
      the protocol and informed consent by the responsible and appropriate authority or committee&#xD;
      must be obtained prior to recruitment of patients to the study.&#xD;
