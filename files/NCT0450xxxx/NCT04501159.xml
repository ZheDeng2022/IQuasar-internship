  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease typically requires haemodialysis to help replace kidney function.&#xD;
      However, changes in oxygen uptake during haemodialysis have been linked to increased&#xD;
      all-cause mortality. This complication of haemodialysis is linked to decreasing fluid volume,&#xD;
      compromising blood flow to tissue and leukostasis within pulmonary tissue. However, an&#xD;
      alternative cause of reduced oxygen availability (hypoxia) during haemodialysis is acute&#xD;
      alkalosis. Alkalosis during haemodialysis can cause hypoxia via dysregulated ventilation and&#xD;
      impaired ability for tissue to extract oxygen. Despite strong rationale for these mechanisms,&#xD;
      few studies have fully explored causes of hypoxia during haemodialysis. Greater understanding&#xD;
      may help to mitigate the risk associated with this vital treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise of end-stage renal disease patients who regularly undergo&#xD;
      haemodialysis. Three blood samples will be attained before, during and after haemodialysis to&#xD;
      assess arterial blood gases. In a small subset of patients, white blood cell (WBC) count and&#xD;
      cardiac output will be assessed via a non-invasive cardiac output monitor during treatment.&#xD;
      Regression analysis will be performed to help identify predictors of hypoxia during&#xD;
      haemodialysis. Patient burden is negligible, with blood samples attained from the dialyser as&#xD;
      part of routine treatment. In the patients who agree for cardiac output assessment, the&#xD;
      patient will be required to have four small noninvasive sensor pads placed on the chest.&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed over 3 consecutive treatments during a single week.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Alkalosis may explain multiple complications of HD treatment, most notably hypoxemia. Despite&#xD;
      a strong rationale for these mechanisms, current consensus suggests ischaemia as the&#xD;
      predominant catalyst for hypoxia with HD. However, few studies have characterised pH changes&#xD;
      during HD with many using serum bicarbonate as a proxy of pH status. Nevertheless, these&#xD;
      studies predominantly indicate acute alkalosis occurrence with HD. Despite these findings,&#xD;
      few HD units individualise their bicarbonate prescription or assess pH prior to treatment. Of&#xD;
      554 dialysis facilities worldwide, 49% did not individualise bicarbonate prescriptions.&#xD;
      Non-individualised bicarbonate prescription risks sub-therapeutic serum bicarbonate levels&#xD;
      and sub-clinical hypoxemia during HD. Assumption of acidosis and consistent baseline pH prior&#xD;
      to each HD session may further risk acute alkalosis with HD. Indeed, a normal pH was&#xD;
      identified in 26 ESRD patients on commencing HD whilst prescribed dialysate bicarbonate of 32&#xD;
      mmol/L (7.38 ± 0.06) or 26 mmol/L (7.35 ± 0.06). However, pH increased throughout HD with&#xD;
      acute alkalosis within the 32 mmol/L group (7.48 ± 0.05). These data, suggest individualised&#xD;
      assessment of pH prior to HD could mitigate alkalosis and subsequent hypoxemia. However,&#xD;
      small cohorts, limited studies of pH changes over consecutive HD treatments, and few studies&#xD;
      of links between hypoxemia and pH limit current understanding. This study therefore aims to&#xD;
      explore pH changes and occurrence of hypoxia with HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients (18+) will be recruited irrespective of age, gender, or ethnicity. Due to the&#xD;
      observational nature of the study, no personal benefits will be expressed to the patient.&#xD;
      Signed consent will be attained from a patient after a minimum of 24hrs has been provided on&#xD;
      receipt of the participation information sheet. Any questions will be clearly answered prior&#xD;
      to obtaining consent from the patient. Only patients who have full capacity to give consent&#xD;
      and full understanding of the purpose and procedures of the study will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no foreseen risk to the patient from the study. All blood samples are attained via&#xD;
      arterial-venous catheter which is inserted prior to treatment as part of the patient's&#xD;
      routine haemodialysis. In the small subset of patients who have their cardiac output&#xD;
      assessed, the use of four small non-invasive sensors poses no additional discomfort, risk or&#xD;
      restriction throughout routine haemodialysis treatment. In a previous project using the&#xD;
      noninvasive cardiac output monitor (NICOM), no patient expressed any discomfort whilst using&#xD;
      the device during haemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients involved in the project will be anonymised with a study number for data&#xD;
      collection purposes. No identifiable information will be used during post-hoc analysis.&#xD;
      Signed consent forms or any other identifiable data will be securely logged within the study&#xD;
      site file and secured within the renal research office. Only the chief investigator and renal&#xD;
      research nurses will be aware of patient involvement in the study. Access to identifiable&#xD;
      data will be strictly limited to the chief investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no conflict of interest from the chief investigator or other members of the research&#xD;
      team that may influence the study. After completion of the study, data will be compiled and&#xD;
      drafted for scientific publication with all data securely archived within the study site file&#xD;
      at the renal research department. Any patient expressing interest in the study findings will&#xD;
      be provided with the appropriate information verbally or by a written summary of findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood samples will consist of ~1.5ml which will be analysed immediately after sampling.&#xD;
      Samples will subsequently be disposed of immediately after analysis and not be used for any&#xD;
      subsequent studies.&#xD;
