    <textblock>
      72 patients who have been diagnosed with hypertensive bradyarrhythmia were selected and&#xD;
      randomly divided into research group and control group. The research group received regular&#xD;
      medication against hypertension and the personalized formulas based on syndrome&#xD;
      differentiation, meanwhile the control group only received the regular medication. The five&#xD;
      symptoms (palpitation, short of breath, angina, dizzy and lumbar debility) were graded and&#xD;
      used for evaluation of treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To test the effect of Chinese herb against the hypertensive heart disease, we designed this&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial. 72 patients who have been diagnosed with hypertensive&#xD;
      bradyarrhythmia were selected and randomly divided into research group and control group. The&#xD;
      five symptoms (palpitation, short of breath, angina, dizzy and lumbar debility) were graded.&#xD;
      The research group received regular medication against hypertension and the personalized&#xD;
      formulas based on syndrome differentiation, meanwhile the control group only received the&#xD;
      regular medication. 2 weeks after treatment, all the symptoms were graded again.&#xD;
