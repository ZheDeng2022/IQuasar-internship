  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult degenerative (de novo) scoliosis (ADS) is a condition of the ageing population caused&#xD;
      by degenerative changes without pre-existing spinal deformity. Pain is the most frequent&#xD;
      problem, especially low back pain and radicular pain, and seriously affects the daily&#xD;
      activities and health of ADS patients. The current treatment for ADS is not well defined. The&#xD;
      main intervention for ADS treatment is surgical, but surgery is clearly not appropriate for&#xD;
      every patient. Active bodysuits will be designed based on body alignment and pain management&#xD;
      using special design components and incorporating active posture training from a biofeedback&#xD;
      system. Back pain is often localized along the convexity of the curve, and passive support to&#xD;
      the areas of pain, most likely in the lower trunk, hip and lower extremities, should be&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;

      The potential materials that can provide support are 3D printable rigid materials, semirigid&#xD;
      foam padding, Velcro tape and stretchable wide waistbands. The 3D printable materials can be&#xD;
      very versatile in terms of properties and can be further finished with an epoxy resin or&#xD;
      thermoplastics. Different compositions and structures of knitted fabrics will be used in&#xD;
      different areas of the proposed bodysuits to provide a close fit, high breathability and&#xD;
      effective pain management due to extra support. The fastening system includes a magnetic&#xD;
      zipper and pulley system that can be adjusted by pulling on knobs. The pulley system contains&#xD;
      a microadjustable dial, super-strong lightweight lacing, and low friction lacing guides.&#xD;

    <description>The wear trial period will be 9-12 months for each subject depending on the active biofeedback training progress. The bodysuits should provide active biofeedback training to the users. By incorporating the IMU sensors, the body alignment in the sagittal or coronal planes can be detected to provide feedback to the users via a wireless platform. This training will be customized to each individual user and will achieve a uniform body alignment goal that benefits the user. The participants will be assessed using the Scoliosis Research Society questionnaire (SRS-22r), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) measures.</description>
