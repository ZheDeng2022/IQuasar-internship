  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to train Nigerian radiologists to perform ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      breast biopsies on women that present to the hospital with a suspicious breast mass. Before&#xD;
      performing biopsies on patients, the Nigerian radiologists will have already successfully&#xD;
      completed a competency-based mobile health ultrasound-guided breast biopsy-training program.&#xD;
      This program, developed by experts in Nigeria and the United States of America, certifies&#xD;
      that they have the skills required to safely perform these biopsies on patients.&#xD;

    <description>During this study, women with undergo an US-guided breast biopsy by a radiologist instead of what is typically performed in Nigerian hospitals, which is either a blind biopsy or surgical excision. US-guided breast biopsy is the standard of care in the United States of America because the accuracy is better than blind biopsy and equal to surgical excision.</description>
