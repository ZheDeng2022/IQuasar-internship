  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effect of music listening during the preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative stages in patients undergoing retrograde intrarenal surgery(RIRS) on basic life&#xD;
      findings, anxiety, pain, and the amount of analgesic used. This is a randomized controlled&#xD;
      experimental study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted with two groups: the intervention group (n=30) and control group&#xD;
      (n=30). The control group received standard care. In contrast, the intervention group, in&#xD;
      addition to standard care, was listened to the music by the researchers for 15 minutes one&#xD;
      hour before their surgery.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale for Anxiety (VAS-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>VAS-A is a 10 cm long measuring instrument with the score range from 0 to 10 with 0 points showing &quot;no anxiety&quot; and 10 points showing &quot;I feel a lot of anxiety&quot; .</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>VAS scale is a single-dimensional scale that is commonly used to evaluate pain severity. According to VAS, pain intensity is rated as &quot;no pain&quot; with 0 points, and &quot;the most severe pain imaginable&quot; with 10 points. Pain intensity ranges were determined by VAS as follows; mild pain below 3 points, as moderate pain between 3 and 6 points, and as severe pain above 6 points.The VAS pain scale was applied to the patients once on the first postoperative day, for the level of pain they felt.</description>
