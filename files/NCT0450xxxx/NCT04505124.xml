  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) which investigates the effect of a&#xD;
      Future-Self Avatar intervention (FutureMe App) on physical activity (PA) and nutrition. The&#xD;
      Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) and principles from consumer behavior theory were used&#xD;
      to guide the development of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigates the impact of avatar-based interventions on PA and food purchasing&#xD;
      behavior and aims to understand if avatars can help increase the stand-alone effectiveness of&#xD;
      mHealth interventions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consumer behavior is a key determinant for chronic disease risk. Mobile health (mHealth)&#xD;
      technologies are promising in addressing the rise in risky lifestyle behaviors, as they can&#xD;
      be leveraged in large population samples without high human resource or monetary&#xD;
      requirements. However, research shows that mHealth technologies are less effective when used&#xD;
      stand-alone, meaning without intervention components that require human to human interaction.&#xD;
      Leveraging virtual reality in mHealth applications could help increase their stand-alone&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on behavioral biases, and the health-action-process approach (HAPA), this trial&#xD;
      investigates the use of a future-self avatar smartphone intervention (FutureMe app) on&#xD;
      consumers' physical activity and food purchasing behavior. A 12-week field experiment aims to&#xD;
      show that avatar-based health applications can support behavior change towards more active&#xD;
      lifestyles and healthier food choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FutureMe trial has the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To understand if avatar-based applications are more effective in promoting physical&#xD;
           activity and improving food purchasing behavior compared to conventional tracking&#xD;
           applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To understand if providing individualized shopping tips promotes self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To understand if providing consequential health behavior feedback increases behavior-&#xD;
           related control over future health (outcome expectancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To understand if avatar-based applications increase intrinsic motivation compared to&#xD;
           conventional health-tracking applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To understand if self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, user engagement or specific types of&#xD;
           motivation moderate the effect on PA and foor purchasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants recruitment process is supported by a large Swiss health insurance&#xD;
      company. The insurer only provides access to potential study participants and is not involved&#xD;
      in the design or execution of the study. The insurer has no access to participant study data.&#xD;
      Participants are randomized into two groups and either receive the innovative FutureMe&#xD;
      intervention or a control intervention consisting of a more conventional nutrition and&#xD;
      physical activity tracking app (numeric feedback). Participants will download the respective&#xD;
      apps to their personal mobile phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step counts and food purchasing data is collected continuously throughout the trial. The&#xD;
      respective psychological constructs (see outcome overview) are collected at baseline and&#xD;
      after 12 weeks (end of intervention) via an online questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study enable the evidence-based development of scalable interventions for&#xD;
      sustainable physical activity and nutrition behavior change and advance the understanding of&#xD;
      the psychological processes behind health behavior change.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants are blinded. Investigators are also blinded. The intervention is delivered through a mobile phone application (care provider) and automatically and objectively assessed (through sensor and purchasing data).&#xD;
Some constructs are assessed via self-reported questionnaire at baseline, 12 weeks and during the 6 month voluntary follow-up (Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (TSRQ); International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ short-form); Perceived competence maintaining a healthy diet (Williams, Deci &amp; Ryan); Perceived behavior-related control (Renner &amp; Schwarzer)).</masking_description>

    <description>The FutureMe app provides visual and consequential feedback through a future-self avatar, meaning that the avatar changes its body shape and some additional characteristics based on the participants' activity and food purchasing behaviors. The app tracks participants physical activity behavior (steps) by means of their smartphone (integration to GoogleFit and AppleHealth) and motivates them to increase their step counts. The app also connects to participants' grocery loyalty cards to evaluate their food shopping behavior leveraging the Nutri-score concept. The app motivates participants to improve their food purchases through concrete shopping tips provided in-app.</description>
