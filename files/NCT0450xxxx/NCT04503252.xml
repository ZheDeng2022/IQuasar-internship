  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the paucity of pharmacological data on cefazolin treatment of Methicillin-susceptible&#xD;
      S. aureus (MSSA) complicated S. aureus infection (CSAI), the primary purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the probability of pharmacological target attainment (in the blood and&#xD;
      infected tissue) with standard intermittent bolus administration of cefazolin in patients&#xD;
      with CSAI caused by MSSA by determining plasma concentrations of cefazolin and exact Minimum&#xD;
      inhibitory concentration (MICs) of the causative MSSA strains in patients with various&#xD;
      disease severities (e.g. critically ill vs. noncritically ill patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-study quantitative measurement of Torque Teno virus (TTV): The primary purpose of&#xD;
           this sub-study is to describe the viral kinetics of TTV in CSAI patients and to explore&#xD;
           the association of TTV viremia with clinical outcomes and molecular markers of&#xD;
           activation of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-study investigating antibiotic concentrations in sweat as a non-invasive therapeutic&#xD;

             abscess); or deep-seated infections caused by MSSA (e.g. osteoarticular infections,&#xD;
             deepseated abscesses).&#xD;

          -  Not-complicated S. aureus infections: non-bacteremic skin- and soft tissue or small&#xD;
