      An evaluation of a promising Teen Pregnancy Prevention Curriculum, Big Decisions, in ninth&#xD;
      grade students in three high schools in South Texas.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intervention Description Big Decisions is a promising teen pregnancy prevention intervention&#xD;
      that consists primarily of abstinence-plus sexual health education curriculum. The intended&#xD;
      dosage for students is 10 classroom-based sexual health lessons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classroom teachers, who receive three days of training on the curriculum as well as ongoing&#xD;
      technical assistance, deliver Big Decisions lessons to 9th grade students. The lessons take&#xD;
      place during normally scheduled classes over the course of three to five weeks. Classes&#xD;
      include health, biology, and English. The curriculum focuses on helping youth make good&#xD;
      decisions about their sexual health. There are three key messages: (1) having sex with&#xD;
      someone is a big decision, (2) abstinence is the most effective way to avoid both pregnancy&#xD;
      and sexually transmitted infections, and (3) teens who have sex need to use latex condoms&#xD;
      correctly every time to reduce the risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections and use&#xD;
      contraception to prevent pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to a classroom curriculum, Big Decisions also includes a parent component offered&#xD;
      to all families. This includes two parent workshops, a parent workbook, and homework for&#xD;
      parents and children. The parent workshop meets twice during the period of time when students&#xD;
      receive the classroom curriculum. The workshops last for 90 minutes, are offered in both&#xD;
      English and Spanish, and are facilitated by district coordinators and grantee staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison Condition Youth Voices Comparison Condition Description Youth Voices is a benign&#xD;
      comparison intervention that meets for two class sessions over three to five weeks. Classroom&#xD;
      teachers deliver Youth Voices to 9th grade students. Teachers deliver sessions during&#xD;
      regularly scheduled classes similar to Big Decisions. Students in Youth Voices participate in&#xD;
      facilitated discussions about two of seven potential discussion topics (nutrition, physical&#xD;
      fitness and exercise, tobacco and e-cigarettes, participation in sports, driver safety,&#xD;
      environmental health, and safety at work). Students take a vote, and they discuss the two&#xD;
      topics with the most votes during the sessions. Classroom teachers facilitate Youth Voices.&#xD;
      Teachers are trained to deliver both Youth Voices and Big Decisions and can deliver both&#xD;
      programs to different classes during the same implementation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral Outcomes Sexual initiation, condom use at last sex, birth control use at last sex,&#xD;
      ever pregnant or gotten someone pregnant, sex in the past three months, sex without a condom&#xD;
      in the past three months, sex without birth control in the past three months Non-behavioral&#xD;
      Outcomes Intentions to have sex, intentions to use a condom, intentions to use birth control&#xD;
      Sample and Setting HealthyFutures of Texas staff recruited four high schools from three rural&#xD;
      and semi-rural school districts in Texas for participation in the study. The program targets&#xD;
      9th-grade students in each district for participation. Each high school identified one course&#xD;
      required for 9th grade students for program delivery (for example, health, biology, English).&#xD;
      To be eligible for participation, students must (1) be in 9th grade, (2) be enrolled in one&#xD;
      of the courses identified for program delivery, (3) have parental consent, and (4) provide&#xD;
      student assent. The evaluation expects to enroll 2,596 students from 178 classrooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Data Collection This evaluation is a cluster randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      Classrooms are the unit of randomization. Two of the three school districts are implementing&#xD;
      the program and evaluation once a year and the third school district, with two high schools,&#xD;
      is implementing each quarter of the academic year. At the beginning of each round of&#xD;
      implementation, parents provide consent for participation. Two weeks before implementation,&#xD;
      students provide assent and take the baseline survey. The evaluator randomizes the&#xD;
      participating classes the week before implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Youth will be surveyed at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
      Baseline and immediate post-test surveys will be given in the classroom. Surveys will be&#xD;
      collected using a survey link or using paper versions of the survey. The 12-month follow-up&#xD;
      survey will take place in small group settings at the school. Absent students will be&#xD;
      surveyed in-person individually by the district coordinator, by phone, or over the web.&#xD;
      Teachers, district coordinators, and research staff will collect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for an implementation study designed to assess fidelity, attendance, and quality will be&#xD;
      collected through fidelity logs, observations, and attendance sheets.&#xD;
