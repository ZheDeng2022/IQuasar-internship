      This study will be conducted to investigate the effect of whole-body vibration device on&#xD;
      Balance control, postural Stability and mobility after thermal burn injuries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 patients with deep second-degree burn involving the lower limbs and trunk (TBSA: 35-40%),&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned either into the experimental group, received whole body vibration&#xD;
      (WBV) plus the routine physical therapy program or the control group, received the same&#xD;
      routine physical therapy program. All treatment interventions will be applied at a frequency&#xD;
      of three sessions per week for 8 weeks. Anteroposterior stability (APS), Medial lateral&#xD;
      stability (MLS), Time up and go test (TUG) test, and Berg balance scale will be the outcome&#xD;
      measures of the study.&#xD;

    <description>The antero-posterior stability index (APSI) was measured for all cases before and after eight weeks of treatment. This index will be standard deviations assessing fluctuations around the zero point (horizontal) rather than around a group mean. The APSI assessed the fluctuations from the horizontal along the AP on the BSS</description>

    <description>The TUG test used to measure mobility. Participants were asked to raise up from sitting in a chair to a standing position and to walk a distance of 3 m, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down again with their backs flush to the back of the chair and with arms resting on the arm rests. The time for participants to complete the task was measured in seconds with a stopwatch. The best, or lowest time from 3 trials, was used in the analysis</description>

    <description>20 patients will receive vibration training on vibration platform (Power Plate International, Irvine, California, USA) at a frequency of 25-30 Hz and amplitude of 3-5mm, plus traditional physical therapy program 3 sessions per week for total period of 8 weeks. The total duration of the WBV training stimulus will 10 min in first week and progress gradually to 25 min in the 8th week with regular increase by 5 minutes after each 2 successive weeks</description>

    <description>The program consists of 60 minutes supervised and individualized stretching exercise to all involved muscles followed by strengthening for affected muscles, mobilizing exercise for the joints involved to increase the joint range of motion, in addition to scar management techniques including pressure garments, inserts, and physical agent modalities , to avoid scar or contracture formation</description>
