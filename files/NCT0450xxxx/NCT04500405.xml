      In the Emergency Department (ED), patients with acute diverticulitis usually present with&#xD;
      acute abdominal pain. Sometimes, or mostly, it is an exclusive diagnosis, meaning that the&#xD;
      diagnosis would be made after other emergent and acute abdomens are excluded. The recurrent&#xD;
      diverticulitis cost medical burden. The studies focusing on potential risk factors of&#xD;
      recurrent diverticulitis, especially for those after an episode of acute diverticulitis, are&#xD;
      limited.&#xD;

      Diverticular disease of the colon is common in industrial countries and has significant&#xD;
      impact on patient health as well as health care cost. It is common in both Western countries&#xD;
      and some Asian countries. For example, in the past, colonic diverticulosis was rare in Japan;&#xD;
      with detection rates as low as approximately 2% in 1960. The detection rate increased to&#xD;
      approximately 20% in the 1980s and 1990s. Studies have reported that increasing rates of&#xD;
      diverticulosis are caused by westernization of the diet in Asian countries and are becoming a&#xD;
      medical concern. Diverticular disease-associated hospital admissions have risen steeply in&#xD;
      the recent past, which are not completely accounted for by the increasingly aging population&#xD;
      of western countries. Approximately 130,000 hospitalizations occurring every year in the&#xD;
      United States are attributable to diverticular disease. An analysis of the age-adjusted&#xD;
      hospitalization rate of diverticulitis in the United States showed an increase from 62 per&#xD;
      100,000 in 1998 to 76 per 100,000 in 2005. These admission rates increased most in younger&#xD;
      patients (&lt; 45 years old) and have remained unchanged in patients older than 65 years. In&#xD;
      spite of low mortality rate in patients with acute diverticulitis, moderate to severe&#xD;
      comorbidities occur in specific patient group.&#xD;

      Painter and Burkitt hypothesized it in their article in 1960s and 1970s. They based their&#xD;
      hypothesis on the observation that individuals in different geographic locations such as&#xD;
      western industrialized countries versus those in developing countries were noted to have&#xD;
      different rates of prevalence. They postulated that those in industrialized nations tended to&#xD;
      eat processed food that was low in fiber compared with individuals in Africa and Asia, where&#xD;
      the disease was previously unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The USA Health Professional study showed a higher risk of diverticulitis in men with higher&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference [8]. Obesity also&#xD;
      significantly increases costs associated with management of the disease and its complications&#xD;
      [9]. The effect of obesity on the risk of recurrent diverticulitis is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Emergency Department (ED), patients with acute diverticulitis usually present with&#xD;
      acute abdominal pain. Sometimes, or mostly, it is an exclusive diagnosis, meaning that the&#xD;
      diagnosis would be made after other emergent and acute abdomens are excluded. The recurrent&#xD;
      diverticulitis cost medical burden. The studies focusing on potential risk factors of&#xD;
      recurrent diverticulitis, especially for those after an episode of acute diverticulitis, are&#xD;
      limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective cohort study conduct from March, 2012 to September, 2018. The&#xD;
      patients were recruited from National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), NTUH Hsin-Chu Branch&#xD;
      (HCH), and NTUH Yun-Lin Branch. The expected case number in these three hospital is 1000,&#xD;
      400, and 300, respectively. We apply for waive of informed consent due to nature of&#xD;
      retrospective medical record and minimal intervention onto patients.&#xD;
