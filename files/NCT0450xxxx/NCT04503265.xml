  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ATLAS-101 is a Phase I/II clinical trial of AMXI-5001 in adult participants with advanced&#xD;
      malignancies who have previously failed other therapies. The study has two phases. The&#xD;
      purpose of Phase I (Dose Escalation) is to confirm the appropriate treatment dose and Phase&#xD;
      II (Dose Expansion) is to characterize the safety and efficacy of AMXI-5001.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMXI-5001 is an orally available dual PARP (poly adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose&#xD;
      polymerase) and microtubule polymerization inhibitor. ATLAS-101 is a Phase I/II, open label,&#xD;
      multi-center, non-randomized Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion study in participants with&#xD;
      advanced malignancies. Study enrollment is approximately 82 participants. All participants&#xD;
      receive oral AMXI-5001, twice daily, as monotherapy. Following Phase I (Dose Escalation) to&#xD;
      identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose and the Recommended Dose for use in Phase II, additional&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled into the Dose Expansion Phase to further characterize the&#xD;
      safety, pharmacology, and clinical efficacy of AMXI-5001.&#xD;
