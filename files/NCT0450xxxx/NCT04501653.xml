  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will employ functional brain imaging to study the mechanism and immediate and&#xD;
      long-term effects of psilocybin, a serotonin receptor 2A agonist, on cortical and&#xD;
      cortico-subcortical brain networks in healthy adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psilocybin shows promise as a safe, transformational therapeutic across several psychiatric&#xD;
      conditions. However, little is know about its mechanism of action. This study aims to&#xD;
      establish a neuroimaging paradigm for use in future clinical research testing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of psilocybin in various clinical applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will assess both acute (during psilocybin exposure) and sustained (one week&#xD;
      post-exposure) effects of 5-HT2A receptor agonism on brain circuits using resting state&#xD;
      functional connectivity and precision functional mapping (PFM). Using a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled crossover study design, a small number of healthy volunteers will receive either&#xD;
      psilocybin or methylphenidate (MTP) and will undergo MRI (structural, task, blood flow,&#xD;
      extended resting state). After two weeks, participants will return for a second exposure with&#xD;
      the alternate of what they received in the first session. This study involves up to five&#xD;
      separate imaging sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional connectivity will be measured using the following PFM approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Extended functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) image acquisition&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aggressive data cleaning&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analysis designed to examine functional brain connectivity at the individual level&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will allow us to map the effects of 5-HT2A receptor agonism on cortical and&#xD;
      cortico-subcortical brain networks at the individual level with precision that is&#xD;
      unparalleled in the current literature. This is the first step in developing a precision&#xD;
      neuroimaging approach for mechanistic understanding of psilocybin's therapeutic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, this pharmacoimaging paradigm will have potential utility across psychiatric&#xD;
      conditions, allowing us to better understand whether and how psilocybin might &quot;bend the&#xD;
      curve&quot; in treatment course, preventing persistent suffering, disability, and suicide.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will undergo a baseline imaging session, followed by a blinded drug session with psilocybin 25mg, or methylphenidate (MTP) 40mg. Participants will then have a &quot;between&quot; imaging session without medication, followed by another medication imaging session with the agent not used in the first medication session. This will be followed by a final imaging session without medication.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound produced by psilocybin mushrooms, and has been shown to have antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects after one dose of 25 mg. Common side effects are slight elevations in blood pressure and heart rate. Participants will be randomized to receive either psilocybin or control at two separate imaging timepoints in this study.</description>

    <description>Methylphenidate is a stimulant medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy, and is used as an active control for this study because it is metabolized similarly to psilocybin and has similar effects on heart rate and blood pressure. Participants will be randomized to receive either psilocybin or control at two separate imaging timepoints in this study.</description>
