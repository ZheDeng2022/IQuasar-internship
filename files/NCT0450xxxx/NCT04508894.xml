  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, prospective, double-blind study was carried out on 75 ASA Physical Status&#xD;
      I-II adults aged 18-75 years old scheduled to undergo elective and emergency forearm and hand&#xD;
      surgeries under ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block. After obtaining the&#xD;
      local ethics committee of El-Minia university hospital approval and written informed consent&#xD;
      was taken of the patient, this study was conducted from April 2019 to February 2020 in&#xD;
      El-Minia university hospital. The investigators excluded any patient with bleeding disorders,&#xD;
      damage or disease of the brachial plexus, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and patients with&#xD;
      neuromuscular diseases, Patients with a local skin infection at the site of injection or&#xD;
      patients with known hypersensitivity to studied drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative assessment and preparation: A careful assessment of medical history, general&#xD;
      examination including chest, heart, abdomen, site of injection and other systems were carried&#xD;
      out. Routine investigations were done as complete blood picture, ECG (electrocardiogram)&#xD;
      renal and liver functions. An explanation of the visual analog scale was done to each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of the studied medications: The patients were randomly classified into three&#xD;
      groups using computer-generated table numbers each contains (25) patients. Ketamine group&#xD;
      (group K): 20 ml 0.5%bupivacaine and 20 ml 0.9% normal saline plus 1 mg\kg ketamine,&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine group (group D) 20 ml 0.5% bupivacaine and 20 ml 0.9% normal saline plus&#xD;
      1µg\kg dexmedetomidine (precedex® Hospira,Inc., Lake Forest USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (group C) 20 ml 0.5%bupivacaine and 20 ml 0.9% normal saline. All medications&#xD;
      were prepared in similar sterile coated bottles by the supervisor who didn't include in the&#xD;
      anesthetic or operative team, 75 bottles numbered from 1 to 75 were prepared. After&#xD;
      completion of the study, the key was opened by the supervisor Block technique: On patient's&#xD;
      arrival to the operating room, a 20 G intravenous cannula was inserted in a peripheral vein&#xD;
      of unaffected limb and standard monitoring commenced as noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP),&#xD;
      (ECG), and Oxygen saturation (Spo2) (UltraviewSL2700, Spacelaps, USA), all equipment and&#xD;
      drugs for general anesthesia and resuscitation were prepared, the ultrasound device&#xD;
      (Sonosite, Nanomax, USA ) lubricating gel, 21guge 50 mm length, short bevel, insulated&#xD;
      stimulating needle (Laboratoires pharmaceutiques, Vygon, France). Patient lie supine with the&#xD;
      head turned to the other side and ipsilateral arm adducted gently with a flexed elbow. Under&#xD;
      the complete aseptic condition, the identified area and the ultrasound probe was prepared&#xD;
      with anti-septic (Povidone-Iodine 10%) solution and the skin infiltrated with 1-2 ml of&#xD;
      lidocaine 2% solution subcutaneously, the brachial plexus was visualized by placing the&#xD;
      transducer in the sagittal plane in the supraclavicular fossa behind the middle-third of the&#xD;
      clavicle. Two distinct appearances of the supraclavicular brachial plexus was seen, it either&#xD;
      appeared as a grape-like cluster of 5 to 6 hypoechoic circles, located lateral and superior&#xD;
      to the subclavian artery between the anterior and middle scalene muscles at the lower&#xD;
      cervical region or as 3 hypoechoic circles with hyperechoic outer rings, the predetermined&#xD;
      volume of 40 mL of the study drug solution was administered around the brachial plexus after&#xD;
      negative aspiration to avoid accidental intravascular injection, expansion of the brachial&#xD;
      plexus sheath was considered as an indication of correct needle placement, multiple&#xD;
      injections were used to deposit the total amount of the study drugs, skin massage for about 3&#xD;
      minutes was done to facilitate drug distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic data: The hemodynamic variables as HR, MAP and Spo2 were assessed. The&#xD;
           parameters were recorded preoperatively just before the block as a baseline value, at&#xD;
           5,10,20,30,60, 90 minutes during the operative time and at 1,2,4,6,9 and 12 hours after&#xD;
           the end of the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensory block was assessed by pinprick test using a 3-point scale [16] Grade 0 = normal&#xD;
           sensation, Grade 1 = loss of sensation of pinprick (analgesia), and Grade 2 = loss of&#xD;
           sensation of touch (anesthesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor block was determined by thumb abduction (radial nerve), thumb adduction (ulnar&#xD;
           nerve), thumb opposition (median nerve), and flexion of elbow (musculocutaneous nerve)&#xD;
           according to the modified Bromage 3 point scale: Grade 0: Normal motor function with&#xD;
           full flexion and extension of elbow, wrist, and fingers. Grade 1: Decreased motor&#xD;
           strength with the ability to move the fingers only. Grade 2: Complete motor block with&#xD;
           an inability to move the fingers [16].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Onset time for sensory and motor block: the time interval between the end of local&#xD;
           anesthetic administration and complete sensory and motor block by min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensory block duration: the time interval between the complete sensory block and&#xD;
           complete resolution of anesthesia on all the nerves (score 0(&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor block duration: the time interval from complete motor block to complete recovery&#xD;
           of motor function of hand and forearm (grade 0) by hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual analog scale (VAS): postoperative, the patients were familiarized with a 10-point&#xD;
           visual analog scale (VAS) ranged from 0 = no pain, up to 10 = the worse imaginable pain.&#xD;
           VAS was measured at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12 hours. When it equals or &gt;4 the investigators give&#xD;
           IM diclofenac sodium (75 mg amp) (Voltaren, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation,&#xD;
           Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of first analgesic request: The time passed from supraclavicular brachial plexus&#xD;
           block to the patient's first request for analgesic medication by hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total analgesic requirements in 24 hours) diclofenac consumption)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sedation score: was assessed according to the modified Ramsay Sedation Scale 1987(RSS)&#xD;
           from 1-6 as follows: 1 = anxious, agitated, restless; 2 = cooperative, oriented,&#xD;
           tranquil; 3 = responds to commands only; 4 = brisk response to light glabellar tap or&#xD;
           loud noise; 5 = sluggish response to light glabellar tap or loud noise; 6 = no response&#xD;
           [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse effects: any adverse effects such as hypotension (i.e. 20% decrease relative to&#xD;
           baseline), bradycardia (HR &lt;60 beats/min), nausea, vomiting, hypoxemia (SpO2 &lt;90%),&#xD;
           local hematoma, hemothorax, pneumothorax, recurrent laryngeal nerve block, intravascular&#xD;
           injection, Horner's syndrome and signs of local anesthetic toxicity were recorded during&#xD;
           the operation and for 12 hours postoperative.&#xD;
