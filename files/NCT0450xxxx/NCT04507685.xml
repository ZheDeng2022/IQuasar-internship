  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared to other races, Indians have higher insulin resistance, poorer pancreatic function&#xD;
      and a greater risk of developing diabetes, highlighting the importance of early strategies&#xD;
      for improving insulin sensitivity and improving pancreatic function in Indians to prevent&#xD;
      diabetes and lower the risk of heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A low carbohydrate diet can deplete fat from undesirable places, such as fat around organs in&#xD;
      the abdominal cavity. In this study, we will determine if restriction of dietary&#xD;
      carbohydrates will deplete fat in the pancreas and liver, and improve insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      early insulin secretion in Indians. These changes may prevent diabetes from developing.&#xD;
      Hepatic and pancreatic fat will be measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and secretion will be measured during an oral glucose tolerance test. In&#xD;
      addition, this study will investigate if the higher insulin resistance in Indians is due to&#xD;
      genes that cause the inability to store fat in the legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results on the type of diet that is more effective for reducing pancreatic and hepatic&#xD;
      fat is important for informing dietary guidelines on the use of low carbohydrate diets for&#xD;
      diabetes prevention, particularly in Indians who have a higher risk of developing diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to other races, Indians have a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D),&#xD;
      increased insulin resistance (IR) and more rapid decline in β-cell function, highlighting the&#xD;
      urgency and importance of early intervention strategies for improving insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      preserving/improving β-cell function to prevent T2D and mitigate against the increased&#xD;
      vascular disease risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary findings show a reduction in glycemic load selectively depletes visceral and&#xD;
      ectopic lipid and improves insulin sensitivity and β-cell function in non-diabetic adults.&#xD;
      The proposed research will investigate if the phenotypic features increasing T2D risk in&#xD;
      individuals of Indian ancestry (IR and impaired β-cell function) can be favorably modified by&#xD;
      a low glycemic (LG) intervention, and if the increased IR is attributable to genetic factors&#xD;
      regulating adipocyte differentiation and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These research objectives will be achieved through a 24-week randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) comparing isocaloric LG versus control diets in Indians with prediabetes. Compared to&#xD;
      individuals in the control group, those on the LG diet are expected to have greater ectopic&#xD;
      (pancreas, liver, visceral and intramyocellular) fat depletion assessed with MRI/MRS, and&#xD;
      improvements in first phase insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity assessed with the&#xD;
      C-peptide model and oral minimal model, respectively during an OGTT. Reductions in hepatic&#xD;
      and pancreatic lipids will be associated with improvements in first-phase β-cell response.&#xD;
      Individuals with a greater number of risk alleles from a 53-SNP IR genetic risk score will&#xD;
      have lower insulin sensitivity and leg fat, supporting the notion that impaired adipocyte&#xD;
      differentiation leading to limited peripheral adipose expansion capacity is an important&#xD;
      etiological factor underpinning IR cardiometabolic disease in Indians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will broaden the evidence base for effective prevention strategies in this high&#xD;
      risk population by investigating the effect of the proposed diet intervention on underlying&#xD;
      physiological and molecular mechanisms implicated in the pathophysiology of T2D in Indians.&#xD;

    <description>The LG diet will comprise 20% carbohydrate, 30% protein, and 50% fat (&lt;10% saturated fat). It will have a low glycaemic load; include plant and animal protein; non-starchy vegetables and salad greens; and some low-sugar fruit. Participants will be encouraged to incorporate a variety of foods rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats in their diet.&#xD;
The control diet will comprise 50% carbohydrate, 20% protein and 30% total fat (&lt;10% saturated fat). It will reflect the Health Promotion Board's (HPB) recommendations to reduce dietary fat, emphasize wholegrains and include a variety of fruits and vegetables. In contrast to the LG diet, the control diet will have a higher glycaemic load with a greater proportion of energy derived from unrefined carbohydrate foods.&#xD;
Concurrent to the dietary intervention and consistent with physical activity guidelines, all participants will undertake a 60-min structured exercise program incorporating aerobic/ resistance exercises 3-4 days/week.</description>
