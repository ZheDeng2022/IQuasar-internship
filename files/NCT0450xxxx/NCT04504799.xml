  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body composition measurement is an important tool for assessing the physical condition of&#xD;
      sick or healthy people, as well as for monitoring changes in body composition and physical&#xD;
      performance during diet and/or training. Many people self-monitor their body composition&#xD;
      using portable and inexpensive assessment tools, but most of them have not been tested for&#xD;
      accuracy and precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the accuracy and precision of a new portable impedancemeter scale&#xD;
      to measure body composition in comparison with proven techniques, such as 4-electrode&#xD;
      electrical bioimpedance analysis and dual X-ray absorptiometry.&#xD;

      This is an observational, prospective, cross-sectional study to evaluate the accuracy and&#xD;
      precision of the new HAG-B19 in healthy Western adults. A stratified sampling method is used&#xD;
      to recruit a heterogeneous sample of 160 subjects, covering a wide range of ages and body&#xD;
      compositions according to gender specific BMI distributions in the population. Volunteers who&#xD;
      signed the informed consent form are included in the study. A financial compensation of 50.-&#xD;
      CHF is given to each participant (100.- to the 16 participants subjected to the DEXA&#xD;
      measurements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body composition of each subject (FM, LBM and FM%) is assessed with sequential&#xD;
      measurements using 3 HAG-B19 and 3 Nutriguard-M® devices (Data Input, Germany). FM% values&#xD;
      measured by HAG-B19 are compared to values by Nutriguard-M® to assess the accuracy and&#xD;
      precision of HAG-B19 (main objective). Intra- and inter-device variability are obtained by&#xD;
      comparing the 3 repeated measurements and the 3 HAG-B19 devices (secondary objective). In a&#xD;
      subgroup of 16 individuals, the FM% values measured by HAG-B19 are compared to DEXA&#xD;
      measurements (secondary objective). Pearson correlations and Bland-Altman graphs are&#xD;
      performed to assess the agreement of the measurements between the devices and paired t-tests&#xD;
      are used to determine if there is a bias between the devices. The significance of the&#xD;
      statistical analysis is fixed at p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
