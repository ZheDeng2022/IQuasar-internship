  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacogenomics (PGx) guided drug prescribing for&#xD;
      pain and depression in patients with cancer. The investigators aim to understand how PGx&#xD;
      testing can be used to improve medication management for pain and depression, and whether&#xD;
      PGx-guided prescribing improves these symptoms and quality of life compared to historical&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;

      This is a prospective clinical trial of adult cancer patients presenting with pain and&#xD;
      depression, newly referred to the Department of Supportive Oncology, and receiving preemptive&#xD;
      PGx testing for genes related to supportive care prior to the first clinic visit. Genotyping&#xD;
      results will be returned within approximately 4-5 business days. A PGx specialist will&#xD;
      provide detailed clinical interpretations to the referring provider and upload a copy of the&#xD;
      test results into the subject's medical chart. A consultation note will also be placed in&#xD;
      each subject's chart detailing the PGx results. Supportive Oncology clinicians will be&#xD;
      instructed to consult a pharmacist to evaluate PGx test results prior to prescribing&#xD;
      supportive care therapies, especially pain and depression medications. The number of consults&#xD;
      and recommendations will be documented, in addition to test results, demographic data,&#xD;
      medical/medication history, ESAS symptom scores, PHQ9 depression scores, and side effects of&#xD;
      supportive therapy. The number of ambulatory clinic visits and hospitalizations will be used&#xD;
      to estimate health care utilization and costs. Subjects will complete a short survey at the&#xD;
      end of the study period regarding their knowledge about PGx, and whether access to PGx&#xD;
      information improves satisfaction with care and communication.&#xD;

    <description>Determine the impact of PGx on treatment outcomes by measuring pain scores on a scale of 0-10 (0 no pain, 10 worst possible severity) using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) at study visits after the Baseline study visit.
