      Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) was long&#xD;
      thought to be caused by subarachnoid blood-induced vasospasm. Experimental and clinical&#xD;
      evidence suggest activation of several pathophysiological pathways, affecting the cerebral&#xD;
      microcirculation. Recently, lower in-hospital mortality and less non-home discharge was&#xD;
      reported in patients treated with therapeutic low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), compared&#xD;
      to patients with standard, prophylactic LMWH, pointing towards a potential benefit of higher&#xD;
      doses of LMWH in the acute course after aSAH. Treatment with therapeutic LMWH might improve&#xD;
      clinical outcome in endovascularly treated aSAH patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate whether aSAH patients treated with therapeutic LMWH have&#xD;
      a lower 30-day mortality rate compared to patients treated with prophylactic LMWH. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to evaluate whether there are significant differences between patients treated&#xD;
      with therapeutic and prophylactic LMWH in development of DCI, (hemorrhagic) complications&#xD;
      during admission, hydrocephalus, non-home discharge location, quality of life, clinical&#xD;
      outcome and cognitive functioning at three and six months, total health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single center, prospective, phase II randomized clinical trial in aneurysmal SAH patients&#xD;
      ≥18 years old, in whom the causative aneurysm is treated with endovascular coiling less than&#xD;
      72 hours after initial SAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized into 2 groups: (1) Therapeutic dose LMWH group: the standard&#xD;
      prophylactic dose, administered upon hospital admission, will be replaced by nadroparin s.c.&#xD;
      twice daily 5700 IE anti-Xa, starting within 24 hours after coiling and continued until 21&#xD;
      days after ictus of initial SAH. After 21 days, patients will continue with standard care&#xD;
      prophylactic dose until discharge or when mobilized for more than 6 hours per day; (2)&#xD;
      Control group: standard of care treatment with prophylactic dose of LMWH; nadroparin, s.c.&#xD;
      once daily 2850 AxaIU until discharge or when mobilized for at least 6 hours a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: 30-days' mortality. Secondary outcome: DCI, venous thrombo-embolic&#xD;
      complications, occurrence of major and non-major bleeding, hemorrhagic complications after&#xD;
      external ventricular/lumbar drain (EVD/ELD) placement and lumbar puncture (LP), other&#xD;
      SAH-related complications, shunt-dependent hydrocephalus, discharge location, quality of&#xD;
      life, total health care costs, cognitive functioning, clinical outcome.&#xD;

      One in every 20 strokes is caused by aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Mortality&#xD;
      amounts to 32%-39%, and 50% of the survivors experience a permanent disability. Because half&#xD;
      of the patients is younger than 55-years-old, the loss of productive life years has an&#xD;
      enormous economic and social impact. One of the leading causes for morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      after aSAH, is delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), which occurs in 20-40% of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral vasospasm, in reaction to aneurysm wall rupture and subarachnoid blood, was long&#xD;
      considered to be the principal determinant contributing to DCI. This concept has led to&#xD;
      routine treatment with nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, with only modest success on the&#xD;
      prevention of DCI and clinical outcome. Growing experimental and clinical evidence shows that&#xD;
      not necessarily vasospasm, but the activation of several key pathophysiological pathways may&#xD;
      be the principal determinant of DCI. Cortical spreading depressions, endothelial dysfunction,&#xD;
      procoagulant activity causing microthrombosis, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, necrosis&#xD;
      and apoptosis, may all contribute to brain injury after the acute intracranial circulatory&#xD;
      arrest of the initial hemorrhage. Due to this not fully understood complex pathophysiology,&#xD;
      many different treatment strategies have been proposed, of which none seem sufficient for&#xD;
      preventing or treating secondary brain damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heparin is a pleiotropic drug which has over 100 discovered heparin-binding proteins. Since&#xD;
      before 1980, and most recently in 2017, studies have argued the possible beneficial effect of&#xD;
      heparin in aSAH patients. Before 1995, studies in animals and ex vivo suggested that heparin&#xD;
      could relax narrowed vessels, improve blood and cerebrospinal fluid flow and prevent&#xD;
      proliferative angiopathy and cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, in ischemic stroke models in&#xD;
      rats, heparin significantly reduced ischemic damage with a wide therapeutic window. In 2011,&#xD;
      results in vivo showed that vein injection of Ultra-Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin, at doses of&#xD;
      0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, exerted significant neuroprotective effects in rats with focal cerebral&#xD;
      ischemic injury, by significantly reducing the infarct volume, compared with the injury&#xD;
      group. In 2012, a SAH model in rats showed that heparin significantly reduced&#xD;
      neuroinflammation, demyelination, and trans synaptic apoptosis. Recent studies emphasize the&#xD;
      wide-ranging and broad anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory activities of heparin, which&#xD;
      are independent of its anticoagulant effects, as underlying mechanisms of effect. Among&#xD;
      others, heparin binds oxyhemoglobin, blocks the activity of free oxygen radicals, antagonizes&#xD;
      endothelin-mediated vasoconstriction, binds to several cytokines and all chemokines&#xD;
      (anti-inflammatory) and several growth factors (antimitogenic and antifibrotic). In addition,&#xD;
      heparin antagonizes the activation of pathways that seem responsible for ischemic brain&#xD;
      damage in aSAH patients. Henceforth, not DCI prevention in itself, but rather modulation of&#xD;
      several pathophysiological processes could be targeted by heparin-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only study which investigated the effect of postinterventional, continuous i.v.&#xD;
      unfractionated heparin (UFH) (aPTT targeted to 60s for 24 hours up to seven days) in&#xD;
      endovascularly treated aSAH patients, is a recent retrospective study in 394 aSAH patients.&#xD;
      The interventional neuroradiologist determined whether additional heparinization was&#xD;
      necessary, and indications included thrombo-embolic prophylaxis, especially in the case of a&#xD;
      broad aneurysm neck, coil dislocation into the carrier vessel, or intraprocedural thrombus&#xD;
      formation. The 197 patients treated with therapeutic UFH i.v., had less vasospasm and DCI&#xD;
      during admission, compared to patients treated with prophylactic LMWH (40 mg s.c.). In&#xD;
      contrast, there was no beneficial ef-fect on outcome after six months' follow-up. However, as&#xD;
      patients with therapeutic UFH were only treated for 7 days, and DCI continues to develop&#xD;
      until 14 days after aneurysm rupture, this study presumably underestimated the effect of&#xD;
      heparin. Additionally, it has been shown that in critically ill patients the aPTT is not&#xD;
      accurate enough to detect UFH i.v. with the danger of underdosing and overdosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a retrospective analysis of 93 aSAH patients treated with therapeutic LMWH&#xD;
      (nadroparin) (twice daily 5700 AxaIU, subcutaneously until discharge with a median duration&#xD;
      of 17 days) found a significant difference of in-hospital mortality when compared to 65&#xD;
      patients treated with prophylactic dose LMWH (once daily 2850 AxaIU, subcutaneously until&#xD;
      discharge) (5% and 23%, respectively).[26] In addition, discharge to home was significantly&#xD;
      higher in patients who received therapeutic LMWH, compared to low-dose LMWH (40% and 17%,&#xD;
      respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, there is evidence that LMWH in a higher dosage is beneficial for the clinical&#xD;
      outcome of endovascularly treated aSAH patients. Treatment with higher dose LMWH might&#xD;
      significantly reduce 30 days' mortality. The aim of this study is to reproduce this&#xD;
      beneficial effect of therapeutic LMWH in a randomized controlled trial: 'Improving outcome in&#xD;
      SubaraChnoid HEMorrhage wIth NAdroparin' (= ISCHEMIA-study). The ISCHEMIA-study challenges&#xD;
      existing treatment paradigms, which are mostly aimed at blood-induced vasospasm and will be&#xD;
      the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the effect of higher dose LMWH in&#xD;
      aSAH patients.&#xD;
