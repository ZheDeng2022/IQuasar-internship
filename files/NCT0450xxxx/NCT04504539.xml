  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pakistan has uninterrupted circulation of polioviruses and this may threaten the entire&#xD;
      global community. Bivalent OPV (bOPV), which protects against types 1 and 3, is used for&#xD;
      routine immunization. However, type-3 wild poliovirus is on the verge of eradication,&#xD;
      therefore mOPV1 is important to achieve eradication of type-1 poliovirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main rationale of the study is to interrupt WPV1 circulation and stopping the outbreaks&#xD;
      of VDPVs with the help of mOPV1 instead of bOPV2 for routine immunization, which contains&#xD;
      live poliovirus, and will eventually lead to complete eradication and containment of type 1&#xD;
      WPV, vaccine-related (VDPV) and Sabin polioviruses. This study will provide data to National&#xD;
      Immunization Authorities in order to make strategic decisions about their polio vaccination&#xD;
      schedules in anticipation of the potential global bOPV2 to mOPV1 switch and will provide data&#xD;
      on the proposed responses to type 1 poliovirus outbreaks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wild Polio Virus 1 (WPV1) is the only responsible virus for wild polio cases across the&#xD;
      globe. The world has successfully eradicated wild poliovirus (PV) 2 and 3. Poliomyelitis&#xD;
      eradication has entered its last phase with only three remaining endemic countries, of which&#xD;
      Pakistan is one and has highest number of WPV1 cases in 2019. The main stream strategies by&#xD;
      the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has made the substantial progress towards the&#xD;
      eradication of poliomyelitis ever since the World Health Assembly has sanctioned it as an&#xD;
      emerging global Public Health threat. These strategies focus on high-quality immunization&#xD;
      activities (routine and supplemental) that target children from birth to age 5 years with&#xD;
      oral poliovirus vaccines (OPVs), and maintaining a system for acute flaccid paralysis&#xD;
      surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pakistan has uninterrupted circulation of polioviruses and this may threaten the entire&#xD;
      global community and implies impending failure of goal of global eradication. According to&#xD;
      the Polio endgame strategy 2019-2023, Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries in&#xD;
      which WPV transmissions continues to be reported. The genetic sampling and environmental&#xD;
      surveillance have revealed that WPV1 has predominantly persisted in Pakistan and Afghanistan&#xD;
      and are closely linked as they constitute one epidemiological block. Bivalent OPV (bOPV),&#xD;
      which protect against types 1 and 3, is used for routine immunization. However, type-3 wild&#xD;
      poliovirus is on the verge of eradication, therefore mOPV1 is important to achieve&#xD;
      eradication of type-1 poliovirus whose appearance has been continually been confirmed by the&#xD;
      genetic and environmental samplings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main rationale of the study is to interrupt WPV1 circulation and stopping the outbreaks&#xD;
      of VDPVs with the help of mOPV1 instead of bOPV2 for routine immunization, which contains&#xD;
      live poliovirus, and will eventually lead to complete eradication and containment of type 1&#xD;
      WPV, vaccine-related (VDPV) and Sabin polioviruses. The study rationale is in line with the&#xD;
      Goal 1- Eradication of GPEI. This study will provide data to National Immunization&#xD;
      Authorities in order to make strategic decisions about their polio vaccination schedules in&#xD;
      anticipation of the potential global bOPV2 to mOPV1 switch and will provide data on the&#xD;
      proposed responses to type 1 poliovirus outbreaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions and Main Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Objectives of the study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the serum immunity against type 1,2 and 3 polioviruses achieved with two&#xD;
           different mOPV1 routine immunization schedule (mOPV1+fIPV (fractional dose intradermal&#xD;
           IPV); mOPV1+FIPV (full dose intramuscular IPV))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the serum immunity against type 1,2 and 3 polioviruses achieved with two&#xD;
           different mOPV1 routine immunization schedule with bOPV2 routine immunization schedules&#xD;
           (mOPV1+fIPV, mOPV1+FIPV with bOPV2+fIPV, bOPV2+FIPV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the type 2 response after One full dose IPV with mOPV1 and bOPV2 routine&#xD;
           immunization schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the type 2 response after two fractional doses of IPV with mOPV1 and bOPV2&#xD;
           routine immunization schedule&#xD;
