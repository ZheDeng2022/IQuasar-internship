  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of KX-826 following topical multiple ascending dose&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      KX-826 topical solution will be applied to the scalp of healthy male subjects with&#xD;
      androgenetic alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 subjects will be evaluated with 32 subjects randomized to receive active drug&#xD;
      and 8 subjects randomized to receive placebo in a double-blind fashion (10 subjects in each&#xD;
      dose cohort with 8 subjects randomized to receive active drug and 2 subjects randomized to&#xD;
      receive placebo for a total of 4 dose cohorts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort Dose of KX-826 Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 2.5 mg QD for 14 days 10 (8 active + 2 placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 5 mg QD for 14 days 10 (8 active + 2 placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 10 mg QD for 14 days 10 (8 active + 2 placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 20 mg QD for 14 days 10 (8 active + 2 placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will not occur until review of the multiple dose safety from the previous&#xD;
      dose cohort is completed. Safety assessments will include monitoring of AEs, vital signs&#xD;
      (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oral temperature), clinical laboratory&#xD;
      findings, 12-lead ECGs, skin irritation assessments and physical examination findings.&#xD;

The dermal response score will be based on a visual irritation scale (0-7) that rates the degree of erythema, edema and other signs of cutaneous irritation. abnormal vital sign (including blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oral temperatures), 12-lead ECG, hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, RBC count, WBC count, with differential), blood chemistry (BUN, creatinine, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, GGT, LDH, glucose, albumin, total protein, bicarbonate, phosphate, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, total cholesterol, uric acid) and urinalysis (pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, blood, nitrites, leukocytes, urobilinogen, microscopic urine analysis on abnormal findings) during the treatment period will be recorded and reported.</description>
