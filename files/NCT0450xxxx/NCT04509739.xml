  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants' frequency-following response (FFR) to a nonnative lexical tone, reflecting early&#xD;
      sensory encoding of speech in the auditory system will be evaluated pre- and post- music&#xD;
      intervention at 7 mo and 11 mo of age. The lab-controlled music intervention starts at 9 mo&#xD;
      of age and consists of 12 sessions of social and multimodel musical activities with the aim&#xD;
      to synchronize infants' movements with musical beats.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Families with healthy infants with no family history of hearing, speech and communication&#xD;
      disorders will be recruited at 7 months of age to participate in the longitudinal music&#xD;
      intervention study that will last for about 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At recruitment, infants with 3 or more ear infections and infants who have already been/ have&#xD;
      had participated in infant music classes will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will complete a pre-intervention brainstem measures at 7 months of age upon enrolling&#xD;
      in the study: the frequency-following response measure (FFR). Participants will have to&#xD;
      complete the measurement to proceed to the intervention phase. At 9 months of age, families&#xD;
      will start the 12 - session intervention in a controlled laboratory space. In the initial&#xD;
      session, caregivers will be given a brief orientation to intervention, including introducing&#xD;
      them to the musical toys they will be using during the sessions with their infants and the&#xD;
      lab environment. They will also be trained on techniques through which they can synchronize&#xD;
      the infant's movements to the experimenter's movements, such as clapping hand, tapping feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining sessions will be scheduled in groups of 2-3 infant/parent dyads. In each&#xD;
      session, a music CD with 15 minutes of selected children's music will be played and a&#xD;
      musically trained experimenter will facilitate the sessions to engage the infants and parents&#xD;
      to move to musical beats, using different musical toys, such as infant drums and maracas.&#xD;
      Parents will be instructed to not to repeat any of these activities outside of the lab&#xD;
      setting for the period of the study. Upon finishing the intervention, infants will repeat the&#xD;
      FFR measurement at 11 months of age.&#xD;
