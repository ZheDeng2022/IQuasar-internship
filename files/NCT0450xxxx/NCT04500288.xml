  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease related symptoms are reported by 10-20% of the adult&#xD;
      population and of those 50-75% report symptoms during sleep time. The prevalence of nocturnal&#xD;
      GERD (nGERD) is estimated to be about 25% in general population. nGERD causes sleep&#xD;
      fragmentation, difficulty falling asleep, daytime sleepiness, reduced work productivity and&#xD;
      decreased quality of life. Additionally, nighttime gastroesophageal reflux has been&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of GERD-related complications such as severe erosive&#xD;
      esophagitis, peptic stricture, esophageal ulcer, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux has been noted to be&#xD;
      associated with atypical and extra-esophageal manifestations as well as sleep disturbances.&#xD;
      Overall, patients with nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux are more likely to develop a more&#xD;
      severe form of GERD. The mainstay of treatment of nighttime gastroesophageal reflux is a&#xD;
      proton pump inhibitor (PPI). However, nighttime heartburn is the most common breakthrough&#xD;
      symptom in patients with GERD, who failed PPI treatment. Other important therapies for&#xD;
      nighttime GERD include, lifestyle modifications, such as elevating the head of the bed,&#xD;
      avoiding eating at least three hours before bedtime, maintaining appropriate sleep hygiene&#xD;
      and avoiding the right decubitus position. Elevating the upper torso by raising the head of&#xD;
      the bed and avoiding the right-lateral decubitus position have been shown to improve&#xD;
      nocturnal symptoms. Several studies have shown that sleeping in the left decubitus position&#xD;
      decrease esophageal acid exposure by reducing 13-76% of the reflux episodes. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that the right decubitus position increases the rate of transient lower esophageal&#xD;
      sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) accompanied by acid reflux, as compared with the left&#xD;
      recumbent position. Moreover, maintaining the left lateral recumbent position, reduced by 87%&#xD;
      esophageal acid exposure and nocturnal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEFT is a novel electronic wearable device that was developed as a sleep position therapy for&#xD;
      patients who suffer from nighttime gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. It is simple,&#xD;
      noninvasive and low-cost technology which has been developed by Side Sleep Technologies B.V.&#xD;
      Singel, Amesterdam, The Netherland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technology is designed to train patients to sleep on their left side by a gentle&#xD;
      vibration signal once it detects that they are sleeping on their back or right side. Thus,&#xD;
      this technique may reduce gastroesophageal reflux and thus provides relief of heartburn and&#xD;
      regurgitation during sleep time. The purpose of this study is to determine the usefulness of&#xD;
      positional therapy, using the LEFT device, as a nonmedical tool to control GERD-related&#xD;
      nocturnal symptoms.&#xD;

      Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary outcome of the study is to determine if positional therapy, using the LEFT&#xD;
           device, is effective in improving nighttime GERD-related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The secondary outcome of the study is to determine if positional therapy improves&#xD;
           quality of sleep and health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a prospective, pilot study, that will be conducted at the Esophageal and&#xD;
      Swallowing Center outpatient clinic at MetroHealth Medical Center. A total of 15 patients&#xD;
      will be assessed for eligibility for the study. GERD patients will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Esophageal and Swallowing Center outpatient clinic. Subjects with nighttime, GERD-related&#xD;
      symptoms, at least three times a week will be recruited into the study. Nighttime symptoms&#xD;
      are defined in this study as symptoms that awaken patients from sleep during the night.&#xD;
      Subjects that meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will complete baseline pre-treatment&#xD;
      validated questionnaires including, the Demographics Questionnaire, SF-36, GERD symptoms&#xD;
      checklist, Berlin Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Sleep quality questionnaire.&#xD;
      Subsequently, patients will be trained on how to use the LEFT device. Prior to initiation of&#xD;
      the study, the patients will undergo baseline symptoms assessment using the 7-day symptom&#xD;
      record diary. Thereafter, patients will undergo positional therapy using the LEFT device for&#xD;
      a period of one month. During the last week of the month, patients will undergo again the&#xD;
      7-day symptom record diary. On the last day of the month, patients will be asked to complete&#xD;
      the following questionnaires, GERD symptoms checklist, Sleep quality questionnaire, and&#xD;
      SF-36. The device well be returned together with the questionnaires by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The study population will include patients with nocturnal GERD symptoms as&#xD;
      previously defined, from our Esophageal and Swallowing Center outpatient clinic of&#xD;
      MetroHealth Medical Center, main campus. Patients with at least three days of nighttime&#xD;
      symptoms will be included in the study. Patients will be identified by clinical staff&#xD;
      including attending physicians, GI fellows and Internal Medicine residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients seen in the Esophageal and Swallowing Center outpatient clinic will be identified if&#xD;
      they appear to meet the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will be contacted,&#xD;
      followed, scheduled for appointments by the assigned research coordinator with input and&#xD;
      advice as needed by the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study flow 15 Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited into&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First visit - patients will receive baseline questionnaires including, Demographics&#xD;
      Questionnaire, GERD symptoms checklist, Berlin Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Sleep&#xD;
      quality questionnaire and short form 36 (SF-36). In addition, patients will undergo 7- Day&#xD;
      Symptom Record Diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second visit - patients will be trained on how to use the LEFT device. Subsequently, patients&#xD;
      will go through 10 days accommodation to the LEFT device. Thereafter, patients will use the&#xD;
      LEFT device for one month. During the last week of the month, patients will undergo again the&#xD;
      7-day symptom record diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third visit - On the last day of the month patients will fill again the GERD symptoms&#xD;
      checklist, sleep quality questionnaire, SF-36, and return the LEFT device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics Questionnaire All subjects will complete a demographic questionnaire that&#xD;
      evaluates age, education, employment, and annual household income. Data regarding alcohol and&#xD;
      tobacco consumption will also be collected. Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated using an&#xD;
      individual's height and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GERD Symptoms checklist All subjects enrolled in the study will complete a validated GERD&#xD;
      symptom questionnaire. This assesses the occurrence of heartburn, acid regurgitation, chest&#xD;
      pain, trouble swallowing, and respiratory complaints. It will also assess esophageal&#xD;
      abnormalities, surgical history, medication use and health-care utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Berlin Questionnaire Berlin Questionnaire is used to assess risk factors for sleep apnea&#xD;
      including the presence and frequency of snoring, wake-time sleepiness or fatigue, and obesity&#xD;
      or hypertension. The questionnaire is composed of 15 questions divided among 3 different&#xD;
      domains. Determination of the risk for obstructive sleep apnea is based on the responses to 3&#xD;
      different categories. In category 1, high risk is defined as persistent symptoms (more than 3&#xD;
      to 4 times per week) in 2 or more questions about snoring. In category 2, high risk is&#xD;
      defined as persistent (more than 3 to 4 times a week) wake time sleepiness, drowsy driving,&#xD;
      or both. In category 3, high risk is defined as history of high blood pressure or a BMI more&#xD;
      than 30 kg/m2. To be considered a high risk for sleep apnea, a patient has to quality for at&#xD;
      least 2 symptoms categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) This is used for measure patient's subjective measure of a&#xD;
      patient's sleepiness. The test is a list of eight situations in which patients rate their&#xD;
      tendency to become sleepy on a scale of 0, no chance of dozing, to 3, high chance of dozing.&#xD;
      The total score is based on a scale of 0 to 24. The scale estimates whether patients are&#xD;
      experiencing excessive sleepiness that possibly requires medical attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Quality Questionnaire (Sleep heart health study morning survey) This is validated&#xD;
      questionnaire that was developed to determine sleep quality. The questionnaire assesses the&#xD;
      previous night sleep. The questionnaire determines sleep quality by using 9 questions to&#xD;
      assess and individual's perception of sleep quality and behaviors as they are related to&#xD;
      quality of sleep. The questionnaire includes items such as &quot;how many times did you awaken&#xD;
      during night?&quot; and &quot;was your sleep restless or restful?&quot; (rated on Linkert scales from 1 =&#xD;
      restless to 5 = restful).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subjective measure of overall sleep quality is calculated by using the responses from 5&#xD;
      items that are measured on a 5-point Linkert scale, summing them, and obtaining the average.&#xD;
      In the following analysis, overall sleep quality is investigated in relation to other&#xD;
      variables, and each item is also included separately in the analysis. Other variables assess&#xD;
      the number of hours spent in bed, the number of hours slept, the number of awakenings, and&#xD;
      the number of minutes that it took to fall asleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7- Day Symptom Record Diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will keep a daily record of the frequency and severity of each symptom they&#xD;
      experienced for seven days. Symptoms such as daytime heartburn, nighttime heartburn, and acid&#xD;
      regurgitation will be evaluated. The following scale will be used to determine severity of&#xD;
      each symptom:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild: Symptom easily tolerated and did not last long.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate: Symptom caused some discomfort but did not interfere with usual activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe: Symptom caused much discomfort and interfered with usual activities. Disabling:&#xD;
           Symptom unbearable and interfered considerably with usual activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SF-36 This is validated questionnaire that was developed to determine the overall health&#xD;
      status. The SF-36 has eight scaled scores; the scores are weighted sums of the questions in&#xD;
      each section. Scores range from 0 to 100. Lower score = more disability, higher scores = less&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sections include, Vitality, Physical functioning, Bodily pain, General health perceptions,&#xD;
      Physical role functioning, Emotional role functioning, Social role functioning and Mental&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LEFT device: LEFT is a novel reflux wearable device that is noninvasive and low-cost&#xD;
      technology. The device was developed by Side Sleep Technologies B.V. Singel, Amesterdam, The&#xD;
      Netherlands, as a sleep position therapy for patients who suffers from nighttime heartburn&#xD;
      and other acid related symptoms. The technology is designed to train patients to sleep on&#xD;
      their left side only during the night. The device tracks body position during sleep, then&#xD;
      provides a gentle vibration signal once it detects that subjects are sleeping on their back&#xD;
      or right side. This gentle vibration triggers the body to switch to the left side while&#xD;
      asleep. During the adjustable period, the body may awaken from the gentle vibrations during&#xD;
      the first 10 nights. While this may cause a minor sleep disruption as subjects adjust, it is&#xD;
      important to continue to use the LEFT device in order to achieve the desired position&#xD;
      effect.To ease the adjustment period, the LEFT device uses a specifically-designed pattern&#xD;
      during the first 10 nights to progressively train the body to sleep on the left side.The&#xD;
      device should be attached to the breastbone area by a disposable sticker that is replaced&#xD;
      after each use. The LEFT device confirms its activation by vibrating 1 minute after being&#xD;
      turned on and auto-start 20 minutes after being turned on, giving the patient time to fall&#xD;
      asleep. The device also turns itself off automatically after 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective symptom data will be collected from the questionnaires that patients will&#xD;
      complete. The LEFT data will be downloaded from the device, collected and analyzed at&#xD;
      MetroHealth Medical Center. Data will be stored in accordance with internal patient privacy&#xD;
      rules as well as those of the IRB at our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unadjusted comparisons of continuous variables will be performed by appropriate parametric&#xD;
      (t-test) and nonparametric (Mann-Whitney U test). Significant covariates such as age and&#xD;
      gender will be adjusted for by employing multivariate regression models (SPSSv22). Data will&#xD;
      be analyzed using prism and SPSS.&#xD;
