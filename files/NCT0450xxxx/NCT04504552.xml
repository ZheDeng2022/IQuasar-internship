      This trial is designed as a prospective, multi-centre, open-label, single-arm, phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Premalignant Lesions (OPL) may be considered the equilibrium phase of the immunoediting&#xD;
      concept, i.e. a dynamic process between the tumour cells and the immune system including&#xD;
      surveillance by the immune system or tumour progression. Thus, an imbalance in&#xD;
      immunosuppressive microenvironment is a possible key in malignant transformation. In this&#xD;
      regard, the activation of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has a central role, witnessed by the&#xD;
      expression of PD-L1 by multiple cell types within the microenvironment of OPL&#xD;
      (tumour-associated macrophages, fibroblasts, lymphocytes) and by the fact that PD-L1&#xD;
      expression in epithelial and subepithelial cells is associated with malignant transformation.&#xD;
      The use of checkpoint inhibitors in this setting seems to be justified by this rationale.&#xD;
      Employing intermediate end-point markers during preventive strategies against OPL may allow&#xD;
      the conduction of smaller trials, able to give insights for designing larger studies and to&#xD;
      better select the population receiving benefit from the treatment. In this regard, the&#xD;
      evaluation of phenotypic changes (reduction in size or in grade of dysplasia) may not be&#xD;
      enough to assess the potential benefit of an intervention. Modulation of molecular markers&#xD;
      may be more precise indicator of oral cancer risk in patients with OPL. Thus, the change in&#xD;
      LOH at critical loci may be considered intermediate end-point biomarkers of prevention as&#xD;
      well as predictors of cancer risk at baseline. Previous experience with anti-EGFR agents&#xD;
      showed the feasibility of such measures in a prevention trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OPL represent the most common oral precancerous condition, with a potential of malignant&#xD;
      transformation varying from 1% to 47% in different studies. Among molecular markers, the most&#xD;
      effective in predicting oral cancer risk is loss of heterozygosity (LOH), which may appear in&#xD;
      tissues with different histological grade of dysplasia. Patients carrying OPL with LOH at&#xD;
      3p14 and/or 9p21 plus LOH at another locus have an expected 3-year risk of developing oral&#xD;
      cancer of 35%. This chromosomal profile is found in about 28% of OPL. Moreover, when a&#xD;
      patient has previously suffered from oral cavity cancer, the 3-year risk of malignant&#xD;
      transformation for OPL with such a chromosomal profile reaches 69%. The presence of tumour&#xD;
      suppressor genes (TSGs) at these chromosomal loci explains the potential for cancer&#xD;
      development in the presence of such alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical management of small OPL is excision by a cold knife or laser. However, treatment&#xD;
      is not effective to prevent oral cancer in patients. Lesions recur frequently and transform&#xD;
      subsequently, and tumours develop in the same or adjacent anatomical region. For larger OPL&#xD;
      the clinical management is limited to lifelong surveillance. To improve clinical management&#xD;
      of OPLs, the arsenal of treatments should be expanded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study is aimed at treating high-risk OPL with a short course of immunotherapy&#xD;
      (avelumab)&#xD;
