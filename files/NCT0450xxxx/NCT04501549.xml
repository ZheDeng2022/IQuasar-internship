  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in interventional cardiology, bifurcation coronary artery stenoses&#xD;
      (which account for 15-20% of all coronary lesions treated by PCI), remain a challenge for PCI&#xD;
      operators with higher rates of failure, in-stent restenosis, stent thrombosis, and recurrent&#xD;
      clinical events, when compared to simple non-bifurcation lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POMPEI trial is a prospective observational study. We aim to investigate the impact of&#xD;
      morphological plaque characteristics assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) on the&#xD;
      risk of developing side branch occlusion (SBO) in bifurcation PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 27 patients undergoing bifurcation PCI will be recruited into the trial. PCI will&#xD;
      be performed according to local practice.The bifurcation lesion will be imaged by OCT on at&#xD;
      least two time-points for each patient. Plaque morphology will be characterized by OCT.&#xD;
      Off-line quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) will be performed before and after PCI and&#xD;
      the following QCA parameters will be computed: reference vessel diameter (RVD), lesion length&#xD;
      and diameter stenosis (DS) of Main Vessel (MV) and side branch (SB). Blood samples will be&#xD;
      taken prior to PCI and 8-12 hours later to determine peri-procedural myocardial injury and&#xD;
      infarction following PCI by measuring serum Troponin. The OCT data analysis will be performed&#xD;
      in collaboration with Dr Valeria Paradies who has been trained in interventional cardiology&#xD;
      in Rotterdam (The Netherlands) with specific interest in intravascular imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, we will use OCT to detect specific morphological characteristics which are&#xD;
      associated with acute SBO following main vessel stenting. The routine use of OCT during&#xD;
      bifurcation PCI to detect those patients at risk of acute SBO following main vessel stenting&#xD;
      will allow the PCI operator to implement measures for reducing the risk of SBO, thereby&#xD;
      minimizing the risk of peri- and post-PCI angina, preventing peri-procedural myocardial&#xD;
      injury and infarction, and improving clinical outcomes.&#xD;

      We hypothesized that in bifurcation lesion treatment, morphology of the plaque located in the&#xD;
      main vessel may impact on the risk of developing SBO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of POMPEI study as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify correlation between lipid volume content of MV plaque and risk of SBO (TIMI&#xD;
      flow&lt;3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the plaque morphology characteristics associated with SBO in patients undergoing&#xD;
      bifurcation PCI. OCT parameters which will be assessed include: distribution of lipid volume&#xD;
      and lipid arc in the MV and around SB ostium before and after stenting; prevalence of healed&#xD;
      plaque rupture and erosion and its correlation with SBO; correlation between calcium&#xD;
      distribution within the plaque and SBO; correlation between bifurcation angle and SBO; and&#xD;
      correlation between angiographic images of haziness at SB ostium and OCT findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the prevalence of significant SB ostium stenosis in patients undergoing&#xD;
      bifurcation PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the incidences of SBO following bifurcation PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the incidence and extent of peri-procedural myocardial injury and infarction&#xD;
      following bifurcation PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine correlation between SB lesion extension from the ostium and SBO&#xD;
