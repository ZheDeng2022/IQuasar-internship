      The purpose of this study was to reveal the effects of connective tissue manipulation (CTM)&#xD;
      on pain severity, fatigue, sleep quality, general health status, systemic symptoms, anxiety&#xD;
      and depression in women with primary dysmenorrhoea and to determine the effect of treatment&#xD;
      time on recovery in a longterm period. Our primary outcome was intensity of menstrual pain.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes were intensity of sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression and anxiety&#xD;
      status, general health and premenstrual symptoms.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study was to reveal the effects of CTM on pain severity, fatigue, sleep&#xD;
      quality, general health status, systemic symptoms, anxiety and depression in women with&#xD;
      primary dysmenorrhoea and to determine the effect of treatment time on recovery in a longterm&#xD;
      period. Our primary outcome was intensity of menstrual pain. Secondary outcomes were&#xD;
      intensity of sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression and anxiety status, general health and&#xD;
      premenstrual symptoms. The participants included to this study were randomised into two&#xD;
      groups with simple randomisation method. CTM was performed to participants in both groups&#xD;
      included the basic region (Sacral and lumbar), lower thoracic (between T12-T7) and anterior&#xD;
      pelvic regions. In Group 1, starting at the end of the menstrual cycle, CTM was applied for 5&#xD;
      days a week and for 1 cycle (approximately 3 weeks) until the beginning of the next period.&#xD;
      Participants in the Group 2 CTM was started with the completion of menstrual cycle, 5 days a&#xD;
      week and until the other menstrual cycles. At the end of the menstrual cycle, it was&#xD;
      restarted and a total of 2 cycles were applied until the second menstrual cycle started&#xD;
      (approximately 6 weeks). Both short and long strokes were used during manipulation. Each&#xD;
      stroke was repeated for three times first on the right and then on the left side of all&#xD;
      manipulated regions. All sessions were ended with bilateral long strokes to the iliac crest&#xD;
      and subcostal regions. The treatment was started from the basic region and proceeded to other&#xD;
      regions according to the vascular reaction of the connective tissue. Each session lasted 5 to&#xD;
      20 minutes, depending on the size of the treated region. During manipulation, the pad of the&#xD;
      middle finger was in contact with the patient's skin. The finger was placed on the skin at&#xD;
      45° angle with distal interphalangeal joint in flexion and moved to cause traction. During&#xD;
      back treatment, the participant was asked to sit erect, with hips, knees, and ankles at 90°&#xD;
      flexion and thighs and feet are fully supported. During the treatment of anterior pelvic&#xD;
      region, the patient was in a supine position with pillows placed under the head and knees.&#xD;
      Treatment was performed by a trained physiotherapist. The participants' intensity of pain,&#xD;
      fatigue and sleep quality were assessed with Visual Analogue Scale. Depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      anxiety status, general health and premenstrual symptoms were assessed with Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, General Health Questionnaire and Premenstrual Syndrome&#xD;
      Scale, respectively. All measurements were repeated 5 times; baseline, after the first&#xD;
      menstruation following the intervention period, 3th, 6th and 12th months after treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The position of the patients during treatment sessions was sitting with the hips and knees at 90° flexion and feet supported, arms relaxed on the thighs, back naked and straight, allowing optimal tension of the connective tissue. The CTM procedure consisted of treating 3 sections in the back. These sections were basic (sacral and lumbar regions), lower thoracic (L1 through T7) and anterior pelvic. All sessions were ended with bilateral long strokes to the iliac crest and subcostal regions. The physiotherapist applied strokes bilaterally by her middle finger of the right or left hand to the defined zones of the mentioned sections in the back. The treatment started from the basic section, and progress to other regions was decided according to the vascular reaction of the connective tissue. Each session lasted for 5 to 20 minutes, depending on the extent of the treated area.</description>
