    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Advanced treatment regimens have reduced cardiovascular mortality resulting in an&#xD;
      increasingly older myocardial infarction (MI) population in need of cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      (CR) , the majority (74%) is above 60 years. The positive effect of CR is well established;&#xD;
      CR reduces cardiovascular mortality, lowers hospital admissions, and improves quality of life&#xD;
      among patients with ischemic heart disease. These positive effects of CR has also been&#xD;
      established among older patients. The inherent problem lies in the low attendance rate, often&#xD;
      below 50%. Several studies, including studies from Denmark, have shown that low participation&#xD;
      in CR is most prevalent among older, vulnerable female patients. The notion vulnerable covers&#xD;
      patients with low socioeconomic position (SEP), patients with non-western background and&#xD;
      patients living alone, as these groups have particularly low CR attendance. Effective&#xD;
      interventions aiming at increasing CR attendance among these low attending groups are thus&#xD;
      warranted and the current study will seek to address this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: To test feasibility and acceptability of methods used in a peer-mentor intervention&#xD;
      among older female and vulnerable post MI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND METHODS: The study is designed as a one arm feasibility study. Patients (n=20) are&#xD;
      recruited by a dedicated research nurse before discharge from the cardiology department at&#xD;
      Nordsjællands Hospital. Data is collected at three timepoints, baseline, 12 weeks and 24&#xD;
      weeks. The patients (mentees) are matched with peer-mentors. Peer-mentoring (i.e. mentoring&#xD;
      by a person with a similar life situation or health problem as one self) is a low-cost&#xD;
      intervention that holds the potential to improve CR attendance and improve physical and&#xD;
      psychological outcomes among older patients. Peer-mentors are role models who can guide and&#xD;
      support patients overcoming barriers of CR attendance. Peer-mentoring is unexplored in a CR&#xD;
      setting among older, female and vulnerable MI patients; establishing the novelty of the&#xD;
      current study.&#xD;
