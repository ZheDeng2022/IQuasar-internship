      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Neurobehavioral and Biochemical Effects of High Does of Vitamin B6 with Magnesium in&#xD;
      Children with Autism spectrum Disorder: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to examine the effect of higher doses of vitamin B6-magnesium combination in&#xD;
      modification of urinary homovanillic acid excretion and improving behavioral sign symptoms in&#xD;
      a newly diagnosed autistic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized,double blind placebo controlled trial to assess the effects&#xD;
      of high dose of vitamin B6 with magnesium upon autistic children. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted in the Department of Pharmacology and Institute of Pediatric Neurodisorder and&#xD;
      Autism (IPNA) in between July 2019 to July 2020. A total 66 newly diagnosed autistic children&#xD;
      will be selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients will be divided&#xD;
      randomly into 2 groups: Intervention group and Control group. Intervention group will consist&#xD;
      of 33 patients who will receive vitamin B6-magnesium along with standard care of treatment&#xD;
      for three months. Vitamin B6 will be given 150 mg for ages 2-3 years, 200 mg for ages 4-6&#xD;
      years, 300 mg for ages 7-8 years and Magnesium will be given 50 mg 2-4 years, 100 mg for ages&#xD;
      4-8 years. Control group consist of 33 patients who will receive placebo in the same manners&#xD;
      along with standard care of treatment for three months. To see the effects of Vitamin B6 and&#xD;
      Magnesium, Autism Spectrum Disorder would be assessed by Autism Diagnostic Checklist (ADCL)&#xD;
      at baseline and three months after intervention. Urinary homovanillic acid level would also&#xD;
      be performed at baseline and three months after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and of the World Medical&#xD;
      Assembly. Parents of the patient will be informed about the study in easy language and then&#xD;
      informed written consent will be taken. This study has no potential risk to the patients.&#xD;
      Confidentiality will be strictly maintained.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum Disorder is a complex neuro- developmental, incurable disease with lifelong&#xD;
      impacts.Epidemiological studies have shown a rapid increase in the prevalence of ASD&#xD;
      throughout the world including Bangladesh. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated&#xD;
      every 1 in 160 children has an autism spectrum disorder. Various environmental, genetic&#xD;
      ,biochemical, metabolic factors are presumed to be involved in the etiology of ASD.&#xD;
      Researchers found Vitamin B6 with Magnesium has the potential effects to alleviate the core&#xD;
      symptoms of autism. A possible association higher doses of vitamin B6-Magnesium&#xD;
      supplementation may reduce biochemical abnormalities e.g. reduction of urinary excretion of&#xD;
      homovanillic acid and improve neurobehavioral symptoms.Therefore the present study has been&#xD;
      designed to assess the effects of high dose of vitamin B6 with magnesium along with standard&#xD;
      care of treatment upon ASD patients. The study would be randomized, double blind placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial to be conducted in the Department of Pharmacology and the Institute of&#xD;
      Pediatric Neurodisoder and Autism(IPNA), BSMMU in between July 2019 to July 2020. A total 66&#xD;
      newly diagnosed ASD patients will be selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      The patients will be divided randomly into 2 groups: intervention and control. Intervention&#xD;
      group would consist of 33 patients who wlill receive high dose of vitamin B6 with magnesium&#xD;
      orally for three months. Vitamin B6 will be given 50 mg for 2- 3 years, 200 mg for ages 4-6&#xD;
      years, 300 mg for ages 7-8 years and Magnesium will be given 50 mg for 2-3 years, 100 mg for&#xD;
      ages 4-8 years. Control group would also consist of 33 patients who will receive placebo in&#xD;
      the same manners along with standard care of treatment for three months. Comparison between&#xD;
      the two groups will be performed through urinary homovanillic acid estimation at baseline and&#xD;
      three months after the intervention. Neurobehavioral status will be assess by Autism&#xD;
      Diagnostic Checklist (ADCL) at baseline and after three months of intervention. Data would be&#xD;
      analyzed by Scientific Package for Social Science and represented by tables and figures as&#xD;
      applicable. Significance level would be set at 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001. Patients data will be&#xD;
      recorded in a predetermined data sheet. Parents of the patient will be informed about the&#xD;
      study in easy language and then written informed consent will be taken.This study has no&#xD;
      potential risk to the patients.&#xD;
