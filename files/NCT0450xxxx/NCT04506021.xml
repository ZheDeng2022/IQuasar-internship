  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In most babies with biliary atresia (BA) bile ducts on the inside and outside of the liver&#xD;
      are affected eventually leading to a complete blockage of bile flow from the liver. This in&#xD;
      turn causes scarring (fibrosis) in the liver. The surgery called the Kasai procedure and&#xD;
      eventually, a liver transplant could treat biliary atresia. However, children with BA have&#xD;
      poor liver function, poor renal reserve, and poor ability to regulate water and electrolytes.&#xD;
      Therefore, A reasonable and effective perioperative fluid management is more significant.&#xD;
      Considering the high chlorine of saline, the liver burden of Lactated Ringer's solution and&#xD;
      Acetated Ringer's solution, the Bicarbonate Ringer's solution which composition is similar to&#xD;
      plasma, could be the best choice for perioperative fluid management of BA children.&#xD;
      Therefore, we hypothesize that compared with other crystalloids, Bicarbonate Ringer's&#xD;
      solution is a better choice to maintain water, electrolyte and acid-base balance in BA&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
