  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although, suction drainage is routinely used in orthopedic clinical practice, there are still&#xD;
      no precise guidelines on its use in total joint arthroplasty, particularly in total as well&#xD;
      as unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. In fact, drain use is likely associated to an&#xD;
      increased risk of blood transfusion due to the lack of tamponade effect, as well as a higher&#xD;
      infection rate. Furthermore, the drain itself could interfere with knee mobilization,&#xD;
      delaying its functional recovery. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the real&#xD;
      usefulness of suction drainage in perioperative bleeding control in the management of total&#xD;
      as well as unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Knee arthroplasty is currently a widespread treatment either for osteoarthritis (OA) as well&#xD;
      as other joint disorders. Specifically, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is commonly considered&#xD;
      one of the most effective orthopedic procedure in the treatment of end-stage knee OA as well&#xD;
      as various rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, leading to a substantial pain&#xD;
      relief and functional improvement. Besides, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA)&#xD;
      represents a viable alternative in the treatment of unicompartmental knee OA showing a lower&#xD;
      morbidity. Nevertheless, since knee arthroplasty involves soft tissue dissections and&#xD;
      numerous bone cuts, several perioperative complications can be observed. Particularly, the&#xD;
      subsequent local hemorrhage can lead to anemia, functional limitation, nerve palsy as well as&#xD;
      increase in wound tension resulting in healing impairment. Moreover, the local hematoma could&#xD;
      represent a growth environment for bacteria. Although TKA usually shows a higher hemorrhage&#xD;
      rate, some patients undergoing UKA still show the aforementioned complications. Accordingly,&#xD;
      intraarticular suction drainage placement can likely ease the hematoma drain, leading to&#xD;
      swelling decrease, surgical wound healing improvement as well as reduction of postoperative&#xD;
      infections. However, despite suction drainage is routinely used in TKA as well as UKA, there&#xD;
      are still no precise guidelines and its effectiveness remains controversial. Indeed, drain&#xD;
      use is likely associated to an increased risk of blood transfusion due to the lack of&#xD;
      tamponade effect, as well as a higher infection rate. Moreover, the drainage conduit could&#xD;
      obstruct physiotherapy leading to a delayed recovery. Therefore, since fast-track program has&#xD;
      been increasingly applied in the management of TKA and UKA, an early drainage removal is&#xD;
      recommended. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the real usefulness of suction&#xD;
      drainage in perioperative bleeding control in the management of TKA and UKA.&#xD;
