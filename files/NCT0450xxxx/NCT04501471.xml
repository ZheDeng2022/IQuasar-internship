  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an attention controlled randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of the Strong&#xD;
      African American Families-Teen program. The two arm trial tests SAAF-T, a family centered&#xD;
      brief intervention against a similarly designed program that targets nutrition and exercise.&#xD;
      The outcomes examined include substance use and risky sexual behavior.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past, African American adolescents in rural areas have avoided the high-risk behaviors&#xD;
      prevalent among youth in urban areas. Recent epidemiologic data, however, indicate that rural&#xD;
      African American youth use substances and engage in high-risk sexual behavior at rates equal&#xD;
      to or exceeding those in densely populated inner cities (Kogan, Berkel, Chen, Brody, &amp; Murry,&#xD;
      in press; Milhausen et al., 2003). These risk behaviors predict HIV infection, adolescent&#xD;
      parenthood, school dropout, involvement with the criminal justice system, and continued&#xD;
      substance use during early adulthood (Friedman et al., 1996; Miller, Boyer, &amp; Cotton, 2004;&#xD;
      St. Lawrence &amp; Scott, 1996; Tucker, Orlando, &amp; Ellickson, 2003). No developmentally&#xD;
      appropriate, culturally sensitive prevention programs have been developed to deter substance&#xD;
      use and high-risk sexual behavior among the several million African American adolescents who&#xD;
      live in the rural South (Murry &amp; Brody, 2004). To address this public health need, Drs. Brody&#xD;
      and Murry from the University of Georgia and Drs. DiClemente and Wingood from Emory&#xD;
      University designed a multicomponent, family-centered prevention program, the Strong African&#xD;
      American Families-Teen program (SAAF-T). We conducted a randomized prevention trial to test&#xD;
      the program's efficacy. The sample included 502 rural African American families with a&#xD;
      10th-grade student, half of whom will be assigned randomly to a prevention group and half to&#xD;
      an attention-control group. Pre-intervention, post-intervention, and long-term follow-up&#xD;
      assessments of adolescents' substance use and high-risk sexual behavior were gathered from&#xD;
      the entire sample. Specific aims were to test hypotheses that rural African American&#xD;
      adolescents randomly assigned to participate in SAAF-T, compared to attention-control&#xD;
      participants, will demonstrate lower rates of substance use and risky sexual behavior.&#xD;
