  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LINQ™ Respiration study will collect and characterize Reveal LINQ™ derived respiration&#xD;
      data from patients undergoing a simulated 24-hour time period while being monitored with&#xD;
      capnography.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Reveal LINQ™ Respiration study is a Non-Significant Risk IDE, observational,&#xD;
      non-randomized, multi-center, clinical study. The study is expected to be conducted at up to&#xD;
      5 centers in the United States and up to 100 subjects will be enrolled, with no more than 25&#xD;
      subjects enrolled per site. In addition, a minimum of 30% of all enrolled subjects will have&#xD;
      a history of heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled subjects will either have the investigational LINQ HF or ALLEVIATE-HF RAMware&#xD;
      downloaded onto their implanted Reveal LINQ device, Holter monitor and capnography monitor&#xD;
      applied and undergo a series of activity and breathing maneuvers. The expected duration of&#xD;
      subject participation in the study (from start of study procedures to study exit) is&#xD;
      approximately 1.5 hours. The expected total study duration (from time of first enrollment to&#xD;
      the exit of last enrolled subject) is approximately 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Adverse events will be collected throughout the study duration of a subject's&#xD;
      participation in the study, beginning at the time of informed consent.&#xD;

    <description>The study is utilizing an investigational RAMware, either LINQ HF or ALLEVIATE-HF, that will be downloaded onto the subject's market-released Medtronic Reveal LINQ ICM. The investigational RAMware enables the hardware to record and store additional sensor data from which a respiratory rate will be derived.</description>
