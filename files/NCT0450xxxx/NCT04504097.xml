  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV is the leading cause of death for adolescents and young people (AYP) in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa (SSA). Uganda hosts 1.3 million refugees/displaced persons, and more than 80,000 live&#xD;
      in Kampala, most in slums, yet little is known of HIV testing and prevention needs with&#xD;
      displaced/refugee AYP living in Kampala's slums. This study aims to develop, implement and&#xD;
      evaluate an oral HIV-self testing (HIVST) intervention with displaced/refugee AYP aged 16- 24&#xD;
      in Kampala. HIVST is acceptable and properly used with AYP in other SSA regions, yet there&#xD;
      are knowledge gaps regarding the best way to link HIVST to HIV care. This study aims to&#xD;
      explore how m-health (healthcare delivered on mobile-phones), congruent with how AYP learn&#xD;
      and socialize, can improve linkage to care with HIVST. This trial focuses on implementing a&#xD;
      cluster randomized trial with displaced/refugee AYP aged 16-24 living in informal settlements&#xD;
      in Kampala (Arm1: HIVST; Arm 2: HIVST + m-health; Arm 3: standard of care). The study will&#xD;
      assess changes in HIV testing practices, HIV status knowledge, and linkage to HIV prevention&#xD;
      and care between the 3 arms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will take place in Kampala, Uganda, hosting over 80,000 refugees. This&#xD;
      research will be conducted in 5 informal settlements ('slums') grouped into 3 clusters based&#xD;
      on proximity (1: Kabalanga and Kasanga, 2: Katwe and Nsambya, 3: Rubaga) where most&#xD;
      displaced/refugee persons in Kampala live.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention involves a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectivness of HIVST delivery approaches on HIV testing uptake among refugee youth aged&#xD;
      16-24 in Kampala. Clusters include 3 sites, slums of: Kabalanga/kasanga, Katwe/Nsambya and&#xD;
      Rubaga. Sites will be randomized in a 1:1:1 method to one of 3 study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arms 1 &amp; 2: HIVST Interventions: At the first visit study participants are provided with a&#xD;
      HIVST kit (Oraquick: approved and used in Uganda by the Ministry of Health) that is an oral&#xD;
      swab test stick and tube solutions, and a written detailed step by step description of how to&#xD;
      correctly use the HIVST kits, pictorial and written guide for HIVST kits, condoms and&#xD;
      lubricant, information booklets on HIV and testing, referral cards with addresses and phone&#xD;
      numbers to MARPI clinics for confirmatory testing. The cards will also have a peer navigator&#xD;
      (PN)'s phone numbers for participants to text message (SMS) if they need additional&#xD;
      information on how to use the kits, or support to go to confirmatory tests at the MARPI&#xD;
      clinics. Instructions for the kits are in French, Swahili, Luganda and English and reflect&#xD;
      the context of the urban displaced adolescent and young people. There is a 24-hour contact&#xD;
      number for participants to text if/when they have questions. These texts will be managed&#xD;
      through WelTel system that will flag these messages in real-time. The Research Coordinator&#xD;
      and PN team will rotate being on-call to respond to these issues by text and will offer to&#xD;
      phone, text, or WhatsApp support the participant and offer to make an appointment to see them&#xD;
      and/or support them to attend MARPI or collaborating agency for further support. At follow-up&#xD;
      visits PN will check in with participants about the HIVST kits, distribute another HIVST kit&#xD;
      and condoms/lubricant, and screen for adverse events (e.g. negative HIVST related&#xD;
      experiences).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: HIVST + m-Health: Participants will receive weekly text messages via WelTel that check&#xD;
      in with their wellbeing. Arm 2 PNs will discuss the weekly two-ways messages with&#xD;
      participants, and request participants to respond to the message (detailed above) within 2&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3: Standard of Care: PNs will provide information about HIV testing, care and support&#xD;
      services at MARPI clinics and provide a pamphlet of information about HIV &amp; HIV prevention&#xD;
      strategies (written in French, English, Luganda and Swahili).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant retention: Community collaborators will facilitate recruitment and retention; PNs&#xD;
      will use multiple study reminder strategies (e.g. social media, texts) to maintain&#xD;
      engagement, and we will utilize existing outreach and services by MARPI, YARID, Interaid&#xD;
      Uganda, Tomorrow Vijana and community partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Team Training: This research involves collaborations with the Ministry of Health's&#xD;
      Most At Risk Population Initiative (MARPI) clinics, YARID's women empowerment centre,&#xD;
      Tomorrow Vijana's and Interaid Uganda's urban outreach programs in Kampala. MARPI clinic&#xD;
      staff will provide technical assistance for HIVST and train PN and the research team in: a)&#xD;
      using HIV rapid test kits (Alere Determine HIV-1/2); b) using OraQuick, a rapid oral HIVST&#xD;
      used in Uganda; c) pre/post HIV test counseling; and d) linkages to confirmatory testing and&#xD;
      HIV care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      m-Health training: This research involves a collaboration with WelTel's non-profit agency for&#xD;
      the supportive SMS intervention (Arm 2). WelTel staff will conduct SMS training with:&#xD;
      Research Coordinator, Logie, Okumu, and the research team, including the PN. The WelTel&#xD;
      system will manage the SMS intervention on their structured mobile-phone platform (all SMS&#xD;
      interactions are logged). Weekly 2-way supportive messages (how are you? In Swahili: Habari&#xD;
      Yako?) will automatically be sent on the same weekday with WelTel software to Arm 2&#xD;
      participants. PN ask Arm 2 participants to respond within 48 hours if they are well (Mzuri&#xD;
      sana) or have a problem (Nina shida), and will follow-up with non-responders. The Arm 2 PN&#xD;
      and Research Coordinator will access the server every 24-48 hours to triage and respond to&#xD;
      participants who express a problem or need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linkage to testing and care: Participants across all study arms will meet with PN at 3 time&#xD;
      points (t0: baseline, t1: 8 months, t2: 12 months) to complete surveys. Each participant will&#xD;
      have a study identification (ID) number printed on 'movie coupons'; they can bring these&#xD;
      coupons to MARPI for HIV testing, confirmatory testing, linkage to HIV care, SRH services.&#xD;
      The survey ID will be linked to resources accessed. Persons who test positive will be linked&#xD;
      with the collaborator Uganda Network of Young People Living with HIV &amp; AIDS (UNYPA)'s support&#xD;
      groups and services.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) will evaluate the effectivness of HIVST delivery approaches on HIV testing uptake among refugee youth in Kampala. Clusters include 3 sites, informal settlements. Sites will be randomized in a 1:1:1 method to one of 3 study arms: Arm 1-HIVST, Arm 2- HIVST+ m-health, and Arm 3-standard of care (control). We propose a cRCT design of randomizing by slums to reduce the possibility of experimental contamination due to the shared social and physical environment in slums. Data collectors will administer tablet-based surveys (baseline, t1: 8 months, t2: 12 months). Arms 1 &amp; 2 will receive HIVST kits at each time-point.</intervention_model_description>
