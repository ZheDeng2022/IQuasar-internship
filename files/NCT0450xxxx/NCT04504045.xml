  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a major public health concern. It is widely established that type 2&#xD;
      diabetes in linked to activated innate immunity and increased levels of C-reactive protein&#xD;
      and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in plasma. Studies in humans and in liver cells has shown that IL-6&#xD;
      downregulates important drug metabolizing enzymes in the liver (cytochrome P450 (CYP)&#xD;
      enzymes). More than half of the most prescribed drugs are eliminated by biotransformation of&#xD;
      these enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously shown that initiating glucose-lowering treatment (e.g.&#xD;
      metformin, sulphonylureas and insulin) leads to decreased therapeutic efficacy of the&#xD;
      blood-thinning vitamin-K antagonist warfarin. Due to the non-specific effect of glucose&#xD;
      lowering drugs, the investigators hypothesize that this is caused by the glucose-lowering&#xD;
      effect rather than drug-drug interactions caused by the individual drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the proposal that reversal of increased plasma glucose affects drug metabolism, the&#xD;
      investigators will perform a clinical pharmacokinetic trial. The purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      elucidate whether initiation of glucose-lowering treatment causes altered drug metabolism&#xD;
      among patients with type 2 diabetes. The study will include newly diagnosed and untreated&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes patients who will ingest a 6-drug cocktail consisting of probes for specific&#xD;
      CYP enzymes. Plasma and urine will be drawn over 6 hours to determine concentrations of the&#xD;
      drugs and their metabolites. Patients will then initiate metformin treatment and to assess&#xD;
      both short- and long-term impact of glucose-lowering, the same 6-drug cocktail will be&#xD;
      ingested, and concentrations measured, after three weeks and three months. To help understand&#xD;
      the mechanism and the putative involvement of inflammation, markers of inflammation such as&#xD;
      cytokines, transcription factors, etc. will also be assesses.&#xD;
