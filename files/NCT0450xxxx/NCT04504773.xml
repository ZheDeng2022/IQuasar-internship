  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is a common and impairing problem for children. The principle treatment for pediatric&#xD;
      anxiety involves facing a child's fears in a stepwise approach through a therapeutic exercise&#xD;
      called exposures. While exposures are effective, some feared situations cannot be confronted&#xD;
      in a clinician's office (e.g., heights, public speaking, storms). This poses a logistical&#xD;
      challenge in treatment that: (1) takes time away from patient care, (2) leads clinicians to&#xD;
      rely on imagined exposures, and/or (3) requires families to complete exposures outside of the&#xD;
      therapy visits. This creates a burden for clinicians and families, and impedes treatment&#xD;
      success. Immersive virtual reality (VR) presents an innovative solution that allows children&#xD;
      to face fears without leaving the clinician's office. While VR has been used to distract&#xD;
      children during painful medical procedures, it has not been well examined as a primary&#xD;
      treatment for pediatric anxiety. This study proposes to examine the effectiveness and&#xD;
      acceptability of using immersive VR exposures to treat children and adolescents with specific&#xD;
      phobias.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical Severity Rating (CSR) of Targeted Specific Phobia on Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for Children and Parents (ADIS-C/P)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after virtual reality exposure therapy session</time_frame>
    <description>The ADIS-C/P CSR for the Specific Phobia is a single item rating that is made by a clinician. Scores are made on a 9-point scale that ranges from 0 (Not at all) to 8 (Very, very much). A score of 4 or greater considered to be indicative of a psychiatric disorder.</description>

The total score ranges from 0 to 82, with a total score of 25 or greater may indicate the presence of an anxiety disorder.</description>
