  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether the combination of moxibustion and characteristic&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention of TCM can alleviate the clinical symptoms and improve quality of life&#xD;
      and mental health in patients with abdominal obesity. The results are expected to provide&#xD;
      clinical evidence for the application of the combination of moxibustion and characteristic&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention of TCM in patients with abdominal obesity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial conducted from January, 2020 to January,&#xD;
      2022 that includes 150 participants who have abdominal obesity and meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. The participants will be randomly divided into 3 groups in a 2:2:1 allocation&#xD;
      ratio.The intervention group will receive moxibustion combined with characteristic lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention of TCM;the other group will receive moxibustion combined with lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention;the control group will receive lifestyle intervention only.Each treatment will&#xD;
      last 12 weeks including 8 weeks of intervention period and 4 weeks of follow-up period. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is the waist circumference(WC),the secondary outcomes include obesity-related&#xD;
      indicators,serum biochemical indexs,blood pressure, conversion score of constitution&#xD;
      characteristics, and measurement of the scale.Adverse events will be recorded during the&#xD;
      intervention and follow-up period.&#xD;

    <description>The scale classification of the patient's constitution according to Traditional Chinese Medicine theory into nine constitutions. The Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (CCMQ) consists of 60 items to classify a person into one or more of nine body constitution types: balanced (8 Items), Qi-deficiency (8 Items), Yang-deficiency (7 Items), Yin-deficiency (8 Items), phlegm-wetness (8 Items), wetness-heat (6 Items), blood-stasis (7 Items), Qi-depression (7 Items), and special diathesis (7 Items). A higher score in the CCMQ scale indicates a higher likelihood of the specific body constitution. The original score is sum up each item's score. The conversion score of constitution characteristics is [(original scores- items)/(items*40]*100. The balanced constitution is the converted score &gt;60 and the rest constitutions' converted scores all &lt; 30. The unbalanced constitution is the converted score ≥40.</description>
