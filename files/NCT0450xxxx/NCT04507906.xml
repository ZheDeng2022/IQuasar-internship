  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib/IIa, open-label, single center study, aiming to investigate safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of nivolumab (administered intravenously) in combination with anlotinib&#xD;
      (administered orally) in immunotherapy-treated advanced NSCLC. The study has been designed to&#xD;
      allow an investigation of the optimal combination dose and schedule while ensuring the safety&#xD;
      of patients with intensive safety monitoring. There are two main parts to this study; Part A,&#xD;
      combination dose finding and Parts B, dose expansion. Part B will either be initiated if RP2D&#xD;
      reached in Part A, or not initiated if RP2D was not reached in Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A has been designed to identify the recommended dose of combination of nivolumab plus&#xD;
      anlotinib for further clinical evaluation based upon assessment of the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability data collected during the first 21 days (cycle 1, 21 days per cycle). The 21-day&#xD;
      assessment period was selected as the major toxicities leading to cessation of dose&#xD;
      de-escalation in such Phase I oncology studies (haematological, gastrointestinal, liver&#xD;
      enzymes) are anticipated to present within this duration. &quot;3+3&quot;design was used in the dose&#xD;
      finding cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If RP2D was reached in Part A, eligible patients would be enrolled and receive nivolumab&#xD;
      (360mg q3w, intravenously) plus anlotinib (RP2D, QD from day 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle) till&#xD;
      disease progression (PD) withdraw of consent, or unacceptable toxicity to further evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability and efficacy in terms of ORR , DCR, DOR, PFS and OS. The tumor&#xD;
      response will be evaluated according to RECIST Version 1.1 every 6 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>In combination dose finding phase, Phase 1b will begin with Dose Level 1; anlotinib 12 mg/day orally (from days 1 to 14 in a 21-day cycle) and nivolumab (360mg q3w, intravenously) will be administered to eligible subjects on a 21-day treatment cycle. Two dose de-escalation steps are included: Dose Level 2 (anlotinib 10 mg/day orally, from days 1 to 14 in a 21-day cycle) and nivolumab 360mg q3w, intravenously) and Dose Level 3 (anlotinib 8 mg/day orally, from days 1 to 14 in a 21-day cycle) and nivolumab 360mg q3w, intravenously).If RP2D was reached in Part A, eligible patients would be enrolled and receive nivolumab (360mg q3w, intravenously) plus anlotinib (RP2D, QD from day 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle) .</description>
