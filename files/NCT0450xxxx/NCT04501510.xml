  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bone fracture is usually diagnosed using an X-ray examination (the method of choice).&#xD;
      However, in the case of the youngest patients (children and adolescents), it carries a&#xD;
      potential risk of X-ray radiation exposure. What is important, an X-ray examination often&#xD;
      fails to detect occult fractures or the early stages of a fracture with or without bone&#xD;
      fusion. The literature emphasizes that from 2 to 36% of fractures may be unnoticed on X-ray&#xD;
      images (false negative results). Therefore, additional possibilities are sought to improve&#xD;
      the initial diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was shown that ultrasound could be used instead of the conventional imaging. The most&#xD;
      important advantages of the usg are the absence of radiation exposure and greater&#xD;
      availability. Moreover, the evaluator is able to show neovascularization during usg&#xD;
      examination, which is important in bone healing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is (1) to validate the ultrasound imaging method for the fracture&#xD;
      management; (2) to use an ultrasound imaging to assess the bone fracture and healing process&#xD;
      during 8 weeks post injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of 50 patients aged 10-18 years old. The forearm fracture will be&#xD;
      diagnosed using an X-ray imaging as well as an ultrasound imaging in the first 3 days post&#xD;
      injury (initial study). It is planned to assess the healing process after 2, 4, 6 and/or 8&#xD;
      weeks post injury (comparative study).&#xD;

      The physiological fracture healing is based on the proper facilitation of regeneration and&#xD;
      proliferation process. The bone fracture is usually diagnosed using an X-ray examination.&#xD;
      However, an ultrasound imaging could be used instead of the conventional imaging. It is&#xD;
      important in the case of the youngest patients. In these cases, the Hubner protocol/algorithm&#xD;
      is often used. The patients with suspected fracture are advised to perform an ultrasound&#xD;
      examination. Only after the confirmation of a suspected fracture, an X-ray examination should&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone structure show typical characteristics, which make an ultrasonography an attractive&#xD;
      medical diagnostic tool. Highly dense tissues such as bone reflect echoes and, therefore,&#xD;
      appear bright white on an ultrasound (reflection from the cortical surface of the bone). This&#xD;
      allows bone to be clearly distinguished from the surrounding soft tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was shown that ultrasound is a good diagnostic tool to assess the fracture healing&#xD;
      process. The advantage of usg is that it is non-invasive, does not use ionizing radiation and&#xD;
      is performed in a real-time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first study about the ultrasound in the diagnosis of fracture was carried out in 1988 in&#xD;
      a group of 41 newborns with suspected clavicle fractures after complicated delivery. In all&#xD;
      cases, the collarbone fracture was easily identifiable by an ultrasound in the first few days&#xD;
      after the injury. Moreover, these data correlated with the conventional X-ray imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was also shown that the ultrasound method in pediatric patients can be used to visualize&#xD;
      fractures, e.g. of the ribs or the sternum. In the acute phase, disturbances in the cortical&#xD;
      layer of the bone as well as recent hematoma are easily observed. In the later phase, the&#xD;
      formation of a callus (callus hypertrophy) could be diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is (1) to validate the ultrasound imaging method using variables such&#xD;
      as repeatability, interclass correlation coefficient (Qw), relative standard deviation (rSD)&#xD;
      etc.; (2) to use an ultrasound imaging to assess the bone fracture and healing process during&#xD;
      8 weeks post injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of 50 patients aged 10-18 years old. The forearm fracture will be&#xD;
      diagnosed using an X-ray imaging as well as an ultrasound imaging in the first 3 days post&#xD;
      injury (initial study). It is planned to assess the proper healing process after 2, 4, 6&#xD;
      and/or 8 weeks post injury (comparative study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the measurement of the humerus in two different projections (a-p and lateral). The&#xD;
           distance from the acromion localized on the shoulder blade will be measured in order to&#xD;
           repeat the examination in the same area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  radial bone examination in two different projections (a-p and lateral). The distance&#xD;
           from the radiocarpal joint space will be measured in order to repeat the examination in&#xD;
           the same area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  additionally, POWER Doppler assessment of callus neovascularization will be performed&#xD;
           (each recording of the Doppler frame parameters for a given patient in order to repeat&#xD;
           the examination at subsequent controls)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fracture diagnosis is planned to be performed on the day of the injury, or at an interval&#xD;
      of no more than 2-3 days post the injury as an initial examination and approx. during 8 weeks&#xD;
      after the injury as a comparative examination (during the first control in an orthopedic&#xD;
      clinic after 14 days, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and/or 8 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the procedures performed in this study involving human participants will conform to the&#xD;
      ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki (and its later amendments or&#xD;
      comparable ethical standards, revised in 2013) and follow the Adapted Physical Activity (APA)&#xD;
      Ethics Standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Stanislaw Popowski Regional Specialized&#xD;
      Children's Hospital in Olsztyn, Poland (number of approval: 6 ZE//2020/WSSD; date of&#xD;
      approval: 22 May 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment will be conducted with the understanding of each subject. All subjects as well&#xD;
      as their parents will give written informed consent before children's participation in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
