      The present project aims at identifying robust candidates for drug resistance in BC patients&#xD;
      eligible for NAC. Its originality lies upon the combination of three different and&#xD;
      complementary prospective approaches: from the molecular analyses of biopsies sampled before&#xD;
      and after NAC, from in vitro BC Patient-Derived Organoids (PDO) mimicking patient's response&#xD;
      to NAC, and from Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) isolated before/during/after NAC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) is a major public health problem in France, with an increasing incidence,&#xD;
      estimated at ~60,000 new cases in 2017 and 12,000 deaths. Despite survival improvement in the&#xD;
      recent years, resistance to chemotherapy (CT) remains a paramount challenge in BC: the&#xD;
      molecular mechanisms remain poorly known and the current interventions are inadequate to&#xD;
      target chemoresistance. Neo-adjuvant chimiotherapy (NAC) is now used increasingly in women&#xD;
      with operable but aggressive BC such as triple-negative (TN) or HER2+ tumor (Pusztai et al,&#xD;
      Lancet Oncol 2019). It provides at least three advantages: i) tumor debulking authorizing&#xD;
      conservative surgery, ii) tailoring of adjuvant systemic therapy according to the&#xD;
      pathological response, with delivery of capecitabine in TN patients (Masuda N. et al, N Engl&#xD;
      J Med. 2017) and T-DM1 in HER2+ patients (von Minckwitz G et al., N Engl J Med. 2019) in the&#xD;
      absence of pathological complete response (pCR), and iii) providing resources for&#xD;
      investigating the molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance. The current standard NAC regimen&#xD;
      is based on a sequential association of anthracycline and taxane (and trastuzumab if HER2+)&#xD;
      (Huober &amp; von Minckwitz, Breast Care 2011), and the achievement of pCR, defined as the&#xD;
      absence of residual invasive cancer on pathological evaluation of the operative specimen&#xD;
      (resected breast specimen and sampled ipsilateral lymph nodes (i.e., ypT0/Tis ypN0 in the&#xD;
      AJCC staging system), is a good-prognosis feature; the patients without pCR being at high&#xD;
      relapse risk (â‰ˆ50% of the TN and HER2+ subtypes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major bottleneck in improving treatment efficiency for these patients is the&#xD;
      identification of candidates effectively involved in the resistance to NAC, their validation&#xD;
      in relevant and predictive models, and their detection from surrogate markers. Of course, the&#xD;
      search for molecular alterations differentially represented in the pre-NAC samples between&#xD;
      the resistant (no pCR) versus sensitive (pCR) patients, or between the paired post- versus&#xD;
      pre-NAC samples may reveal candidates involved in resistance (&quot;innate&quot; and &quot;acquired stable&quot;&#xD;
      respectively), but ignores the alterations that occur during the NAC that may be reversible&#xD;
      (&quot;acquired reversible&quot;) and not identified in the resected specimen (Echeverria GV, Sci&#xD;
      Transl Med 2019), but only identifiable by analysis of serial samples during NAC regimen,&#xD;
      difficult and traumatic in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project aims at identifying robust candidates for drug resistance in BC patients&#xD;
      eligible for NAC. Its originality lies upon the combination of three different and&#xD;
      complementary prospective approaches: from the molecular analyses of biopsies sampled before&#xD;
      and after NAC, from in vitro BC Patient-Derived Organoids (PDO) mimicking patient's response&#xD;
      to NAC, and from Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) isolated before/during/after NAC. This&#xD;
      project will combine the most advanced technologies (RNA and DNA-sequencing from small amount&#xD;
      of biologic material, rare subsets/single-cell isolation, and multi-omics analyses) with&#xD;
      innovative models (drug testing on breast PDO, identification of reversible drug-induced&#xD;
      changes) and clever combination of robust markers involved in drug resistance that have all&#xD;
      been established and are running in the laboratory (cf Part B). The last two points have only&#xD;
      recently become feasible thanks to two recent technological advances: breast cancer PDO&#xD;
      cultures (Sachs N, et al. Cell. 2018) and CTCs isolation and characterization (Gkountela S,&#xD;
      et al. Cell. 2019). Briefly, the investigators will use serial tumor biopsies and blood&#xD;
      samples from a cohort of BC patients treated with NAC (Figure 1). Tumor biopsies will be&#xD;
      collected before and after NAC. They will be analyzed by RNA-seq and targeted-NGS (exome)&#xD;
      approaches to capture the differences resulting from NAC in patients with different&#xD;
      pathological response. They will also be used to generate BC PDO models. The PDO models&#xD;
      predictive for NAC response will be exploited as relevant models to investigate NAC&#xD;
      resistance. Specifically, investigators will use these models to look at in vitro &quot;acquired&#xD;
      reversible&quot; drug-induced resistance mechanisms (i.e only detectable during the drug&#xD;
      exposure). Blood samples will be collected before, during, and after NAC to analyze CTCs, and&#xD;
      aim at identifying &quot;acquired reversible&quot; drug-induced resistance mechanisms ex vivo, which&#xD;
      the investigators might fail to detect with the before/after NAC samples only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, this is the first time that these three innovative approaches will be used&#xD;
      together to investigate in depth the topic of &quot;resistance&quot; in patients receiving NAC. The&#xD;
      strength of this combination is to anticipate different - not mutually exclusive - situations&#xD;
      that might occur (&quot;innate&quot;, &quot;acquired stable&quot; and/or &quot;reversible&quot; drug-induced resistance).&#xD;
      Each approach will provide original, precise and specific information that will contribute to&#xD;
      build a more complete answer to this question than the scattered and incomplete data&#xD;
      currently available in the literature.&#xD;
