  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate if intravenous steroid supplementation can provide&#xD;
      advantages over routine analgesia protocols in terms of post-operative symptoms (pain and&#xD;
      nausea), length of hospital stay, shoulder range of motion, function and patient satisfaction&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to detect the efficacy of intravenous perioperative steroid&#xD;
      supplementation for total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) surgeries in terms of short-term and&#xD;
      long-term clinical outcomes and to demonstrate its advantages over the routine anaesthesia&#xD;
      protocol. The comparison will be evaluated in terms of post- operative pain and function,&#xD;
      opioids and analgesic drugs consumption, patient satisfaction, patient reported outcome&#xD;
      measures (validated clinical scores), clinician-assessed clinical scores, systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response, length of hospital stay and long-term outcomes. Moreover, to confirm&#xD;
      the safety of steroid supplementation all treatment related adverse events- and reactions are&#xD;
      going to be recorded and reported, as well as post-operative glycaemia will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to show the efficacy on post-operative pain of&#xD;
      intravenous perioperative dexamethasone supplementation for TSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to show superiority by comparison of the&#xD;
      intravenous peri- operative dexamethasone supplementation group to the routine analgesia&#xD;
      protocol (no steroid supplementation group), in terms of post-operative pain and function,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, shoulder active- and passive range of motion, quantification with&#xD;
      validated clinician- and patient reported outcome measures as the Constant, ASES and SSV&#xD;
      Scores for function and EQ-5D-3L Score for health-related quality of life, opioids and&#xD;
      analgesic drugs consumption, systemic inflammatory response, time until first mobilization&#xD;
      and until the patient first slept through at night, the length of hospital stay and presence&#xD;
      or absence of a frozen shoulder at the postoperative follow-up, as well as adverse events and&#xD;
      reactions, in order to document the advantage over the absence of steroid supplementation in&#xD;
      the short-, mid- term- and long-term follow up.&#xD;

An intermediate score (≥13, ≤18) indicates a possible neuropathic component.</description>
