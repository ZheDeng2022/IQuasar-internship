  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Music-Supported Therapy (MST) is a rehabilitation technique to improve the upper extremity&#xD;
      motor function of stroke patients through playing musical instruments. A modified version of&#xD;
      the MST protocol has been created (hereafter, referred as enriched MST, eMST) to include (i)&#xD;
      a home-based self-training program using an app for electronic tablets and (ii) weekly group&#xD;
      sessions of musical playing strengthening the motivational and emotional components of music&#xD;
      playing. A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to test the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      enriched MST (eMST) protocol in improving motor functions, cognition, emotional well-being&#xD;
      and quality of life when compared to a program of home-based exercises utilizing the Graded&#xD;
      Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program (GRASP). Sixty stroke patients will be recruited and&#xD;
      randomly allocated to an eMST group (n=30) or a control GRASP intervention group (n=30).&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated before and after a 10-week intervention, as well as at 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up. The primary outcome of the study is the functionality of the paretic upper limb&#xD;
      measured with the Action Research Arm Test. Secondary outcomes include other motor and&#xD;
      cognitive functions, emotional well-being and quality of life measures as well as&#xD;
      self-regulation and self-efficacy outcomes. We hypothesize that patients treated with eMST&#xD;
      will show larger improvements in their motor and cognitive functions, emotional well-being&#xD;
      and quality of life than patients treated with a home-based GRASP intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Action Research Arm Test</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Upper extremity function measure. The measure is a 19-item test divided into four subtests (grasp, grip, pinch and gross movement). For each item, the patient is asked to perform a simple task that involves a functional movement of the affected upper limb. Each task is rated using a 4-point ordinal scale. The maximum possible score is 57 and the minimal clinically important difference is 5.7 points.</description>

    <description>Motor impairment measure. It comprises 33 items that evaluate motor impairment in the affected upper limb. The test is divided into 4 sections (shoulder, forearm and elbow, wrist, hand and coordination) assessing reflexes, flexor and extensor synergies, range of motion, and overall coordination and speed of the upper extremity. Each item is graded using an ordinal scale from 0 to 2. The maximum possible score is 66 and the minimal clinically important difference for chronic stroke patients is 5.2 points.</description>
