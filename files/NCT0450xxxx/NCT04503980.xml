    <description>The safety and efficacy of αPD1-MSLN-CAR T cells will be assessed in a standard 3+3 dose escalation approach. Four doses of CAR T cells will be evaluated in this study: 1×10^5 CAR+ T cells/kg, 3×10^5 CAR+ T cells/kg, 1×10^6 CAR+ T cells/kg, and 3×10^6 CAR+ T cells/kg.</description>

    <description>Subjects will undergo leukapheresis to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for the production of αPD1-MSLN-CAR T cells. During αPD1-MSLN-CAR T cells production, subjects will receive cyclophosphamide for the purpose of lymphocytes depletion. After lymphodepletion, subjects will receive one dose treatment with αPD1-MSLN-CAR T cells by intravenous (IV) injection. The initial dose of 1×10^5 CAR+ T cells/kg will be infused on day 0.</description>
