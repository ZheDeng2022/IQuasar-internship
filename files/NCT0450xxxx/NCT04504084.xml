  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ureteral stone is a common disease with high prevalence and recurrence rate in Taiwan. Taiwan&#xD;
      is located in subtropical zone, where urolithiasis is commonly seen. A national survey in&#xD;
      Taiwan determined that 9.6% of the population suffered stones throughout their lifetime.&#xD;
      Symptoms of ureteral stone include renal colic, hematuria, and urinary tract infection.&#xD;
      Without proper treatment, ureteral stone could lead to renal function impairment such as&#xD;
      acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). There are several treatment&#xD;
      options for ureteral stone, such as ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URSL), flexible urteroscopic&#xD;
      lithotripsy (F-URSL), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), extracorporeal shock wave&#xD;
      lithotripsy (ESWL), and Medical expulsive therapy (MET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are only few minutes from diagnosis of ureteral stone to possible treatment&#xD;
      options explanation. It's difficult for patients to well understand all the details of&#xD;
      possible treatments under such circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we design a patient decision aid (PDA) for unilateral ureteral stone to help&#xD;
      patients understand all the treatment options. The PDA is standardized, written in plain&#xD;
      language and patient-centered, with pictures attached.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shared decision making (SDM) has been defined as: 'an approach where clinicians and patients&#xD;
      share the best available evidence when faced with the task of making decisions, and where&#xD;
      patients are supported to consider options, to achieve informed preferences&quot;. To conduct SDM,&#xD;
      a PDA was developed to be administered for patients with ureteral stone to choose treatment&#xD;
      options. We expect the PDA would benefit the intervention group in the aspects of knowledge&#xD;
      and communication in choosing treatment.The aim of this study is to conduct a single center&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT ) to evaluate the benefit of PDAs on decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision aids are interventions designed to help patients with ureteral stone to choose their&#xD;
      treatment options for unilateral ureteral stone and any potential outcome relevant to&#xD;
      treatment options. Patients with unilateral ureteral stone are randomly assigned to receive a&#xD;
      PDA (PDA group) or the standard oral information (control group) during consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In control group, patients will receive standard oral information. In PDA group group, PDA&#xD;
      will be used as a tool to explain the benefits and harms between ureteroscopic lithotripsy&#xD;
      (URSL), flexible urteroscopic lithotripsy (F-URSL), extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy&#xD;
      (ESWL). And by following SDM principles, the patients are guided to consider their individual&#xD;
      values and preferences and helped to make a choice that best meet their needs. This study&#xD;
      will be conducted in a single center (Shuang Ho Hospital). The outcomes are decision&#xD;
      conflicts and decision-making and SURE test before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that the PDA would promote communications between doctors and patients, to further&#xD;
      help the patient to make a proper decision for his/her own.&#xD;
