  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, led by the American Samoa Community Cancer Coalition's INdigenous Samoan&#xD;
      Partnership to Initiate Research Excellence (INSPIRE) and the UH Cancer Center's project team&#xD;
      including Dr. Cassel, will utilize a community-based and culturally relevant process to&#xD;
      assess the uptake of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) using tailored colorectal cancer&#xD;
      patient education materials for those with inadequate health literacy. Our primary outcomes&#xD;
      include: 1) process to develop &quot;suitable&quot; and &quot;comprehensible&quot; health promotion materials for&#xD;
      populations in English and Samoan with various health literacy levels, 2) commitment to use&#xD;
      the FOBT Colocare home kit, and 3) use of a FOBT Colocare home kit.&#xD;

      Utilizing the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use as a conceptual framework and the&#xD;
      evidence-based program &quot;Against Colorectal Cancer in Our Neighborhoods&quot; (ACCION) for the&#xD;
      Latino population in Texas as a guide, the proposed study will conduct a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of Indigenous Samoan participants (N=312), age≥ 50 recruited using&#xD;
      Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS). This design will compare use of non-tailored instruction&#xD;
      for completing ColoCare FOBT home-kits (N=156) versus the experimental condition, using a&#xD;
      ColoCare FOBT home-kit with instructions tailored to low health literacy and to enhance&#xD;
      CRC-Knowledge Attitudes and Behavior (KAB) - (N=156). Our goal is to test the influence of&#xD;
      tailored materials on timely completion of CRC screening using the ColoCARE FOBT.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The health belief model and social cognitive theory were used as foundational principles to develop an intervention that builds awareness to initiate a CRC screening behavior modification.&#xD;
This research project will be the first to test the efficacy of the ColoCare FOBT home kit as a CRC screening intervention using a classical experimental (randomized clinical trial) in American Samoa. Second, the ColoCare kits can be identified as a cost-effective and culturally appropriate alternative to traditional FOBT home test kits. Lastly, results will be used to develop recommendations in healthcare delivery systems to improve information, communication, informed decision-making, and access to care in American Samoa.</intervention_model_description>
