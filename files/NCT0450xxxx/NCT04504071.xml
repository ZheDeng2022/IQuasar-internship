  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center and exploratory study, aiming to analyze the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      dacomitinib-a pan-HER and irreversible TKI in subjects with diagnosed stage IIIB/IV or&#xD;
      recurrent NSCLC. All subjects will have tumors that test positive for at least one uncommon&#xD;
      EGFR activating mutation (do not have drug-resistant pattern, e.g. 20 insertion or 20T790M).&#xD;
      All patients will be of histo- and/or cytopathology confirmed. Determination of the EGFR&#xD;
      mutation type will be performed in the pathological department of Shanghai Chest Hospital.&#xD;
      Both ARMS method or targeted sequencing are acceptable. It is not acceptable for subjects&#xD;
      with the presence of the exon 20T790M mutation or insertion together with either EGFR&#xD;
      activating mutations (exon 19 deletion or the L858R mutation in exon 21) or uncommon EGFR&#xD;
      mutations. 10ml peripheral blood must be available for concomitant study. All eligible&#xD;
      subjects must have adequate renal, hepatic, and hematologic function, as defined in&#xD;
      &quot;inclusion criteria&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive continuous oral therapy with the study drugs (dacomitinib 45 mg) until&#xD;
      progressive disease as defined by RECIST version 1.1 or judged by investigator that the&#xD;
      patient no longer derives clinical benefit from study treatment. At the time of progression&#xD;
      and removal from study treatment, the subject may receive any regulatory approved therapy at&#xD;
      the judgment of the investigator. Timely and complete disease assessments in this study are&#xD;
      important. Every effort should be made to ensure disease assessments performed as scheduled&#xD;
      to prevent the introduction of bias into the assessment of efficacy. Failure to perform any&#xD;
      of the required disease assessments will result in the inability to determine disease status&#xD;
      for that time point. Frequent off schedule or incomplete disease assessments have the&#xD;
      potential to weaken the study conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have progressive disease per RECIST version 1.1 confirmed by the investigator&#xD;
      believes it is in their best interest to continue on their study therapy, will be allowed to&#xD;
      continue on their therapy with or without local therapy (e.g. surgical removal and/or&#xD;
      radiation of a single lesion), at the discretion of the investigator until any alternate or&#xD;
      additional systemic anti-cancer therapy regimen is implemented. The subsequent new cancer&#xD;
      therapy (including, for systemic therapy, drugs administered, date of initiation and&#xD;
      discontinuation of each drug) and OS will be recorded. Each subject will be followed for&#xD;
      survival status and subsequent cancer therapies up to 48 months from the date of first&#xD;
      dosing. This data may be collected from subjects by telephone, and if collected should be&#xD;
      entered into the CRF.&#xD;
