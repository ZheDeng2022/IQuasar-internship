  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Managed Access Program (MAP) Cohort Treatment Plan is to provide guidance&#xD;
      to the Physician for the treatment and monitoring of eligible patients diagnosed with BRAF&#xD;
      V600E/K activating mutation-positive advanced NSCLC using trametinib/dabrafenib in the Cohort&#xD;
      MAP CTMT212X2002I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Physician should follow the suggested treatment guidelines. Furthermore, the Physician&#xD;
      must comply with the MAP Agreement Letter and applicable local laws and regulations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to inclusion of a patient in the Cohort, the requesting Physician must submit a request&#xD;
      for access to the product in GEMS (Grants, External Requests and Managed Access System)&#xD;
      accessible through&#xD;
      https://www.novartis.com/our-focus/healthcare-professionals/managedaccess-programs providing&#xD;
      the rationale for the request and relevant medical history of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The request is then assessed against the MAP and Cohort inclusion/exclusion criteria by the&#xD;
      medical team experienced with the product and indication. Upon the required approvals, the&#xD;
      patient is included in the Cohort.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Is receiving care at a clinical site with a Treating Physician who has experience with&#xD;
             administering investigational agents for the end-stage NSCLC population, or the&#xD;
             patient is willing and/or able to travel to a site and receive treatment under the&#xD;
             guidance of physician with this experience. NOTE: The latter option would require the&#xD;
             patient being evaluated in advance by the Treating Physician at the experienced site&#xD;
             and his/her agreement to assume responsibility for the care of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is able to retain oral medication and swallow tablets/capsules (appropriate exceptions&#xD;
             allowed for patients who are unable to swallow tablets/capsules - this is subject to&#xD;
             availability of alternative (liquid) oral formulations).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Does not require treatment with any (other) anti-cancer medication (exceptions might&#xD;
             be allowed and are subject to individual evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;

             ineligible for immediate local treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Is not eligible for participation in any ongoing clinical trials with dabrafenib&#xD;
             and/or trametinib or has recently completed a clinical trial that has been terminated&#xD;
             and, after considering other options (e.g., trial extensions, amendments, etc.), the&#xD;
             clinical team has determined that treatment is necessary and there are no other&#xD;
             feasible alternatives for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 3 (or equivalent)&#xD;
             and is in stable clinical condition. NOTE: patient in rapidly deteriorating clinical&#xD;
             condition prior to start of therapy should not be considered for this program.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Does not require treatment with prohibited concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Women of childbearing potential must have a serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             (HCG) pregnancy test performed within 14 days prior to starting dabrafenib and&#xD;
             trametinib treatment. Patients with a positive pregnancy test result are not eligible&#xD;
             for the program. Patients with a negative pregnancy test result must agree to use an&#xD;
             effective contraception method as described below throughout the treatment period and&#xD;
             for a total of 16 weeks following the last dose of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Contraceptive Methods for Females of Childbearing Potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, must use highly effective methods of contraception during dosing&#xD;
             and for 16 weeks after stopping treatment with trametinib (for trametinib monotherapy&#xD;
             trials); 2 weeks after stopping treatment with dabrafenib (for dabrafenib monotherapy&#xD;
             trials); 16 weeks after stopping treatment with trametinib or 2 weeks after stopping&#xD;
             treatment with dabrafenib whichever is longer (for trials of dabrafenib in combination&#xD;
             with trametinib).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Highly effective contraception methods include: (for dabrafenib monotherapy or&#xD;
             combination therapy with trametinib) Total abstinence (when this is in line with the&#xD;
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,&#xD;
             ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
             methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening) for male partners. The&#xD;
                  vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Placement of a hormonal or non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine&#xD;
                  system (IUS) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Notes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Double-barrier contraception: condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault&#xD;
             caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent (foam/gel/cream/suppository) are not considered&#xD;
             highly effective methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Hormonal-based methods (e.g. oral contraceptives) are not considered as highly&#xD;
             effective methods of contraception due to potential drug-drug interactions with&#xD;
             dabrafenib Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if&#xD;
             they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
             clinical profile (i.e. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had&#xD;
             surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or&#xD;
             tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when&#xD;
             the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level&#xD;
             assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If a patient becomes pregnant during the treatment period of the program, the&#xD;
             treatments should be stopped immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Written patient informed consent must be obtained by the Treating Physician prior to&#xD;
             start of treatment in accordance with the applicable local regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
