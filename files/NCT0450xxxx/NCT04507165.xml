  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comparison of incidences of postoperative opioid-related adverse effects and recovery&#xD;
      parameters in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lung resection&#xD;
      receiving opioid or opioid-free general anesthesia (OFA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lung resection is traditionally performed under&#xD;
      general anesthesia with opioid-based analgesia. It is associated with higher incidences of&#xD;
      respiratory depression, hypotension, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), dizziness,&#xD;
      constipation and urinary retention, and more severe acute postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our study is to compare the opioid-free general anesthesia with the&#xD;
      opioid-based general anesthesia with respect to the primary outcome measures of the total&#xD;
      incidence of opioid-related adverse effects (including respiratory depression, hypotension,&#xD;
      PONV and dizziness) and secondary outcome measures of incidence of intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative cardiovascular complications, pain relief, analgesic requirement , and other&#xD;
      postoperative recovery parameters [e.g. duration of tracheal extubation, departing from&#xD;
      post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU), exhaust, defecation, and stay in hospital&#xD;
      postoperatively].&#xD;

Aldrete score is the standard for departing from PACU which includes five contents to evaluate: activity, breath, blood pressure, state of consciousness and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2). 2 point in total for each content. 2 point refers to the best state, whereas 0 point refers to the worst state. When a patient's total score greater than 9 who will be transferred out of PACU.</description>

    <description>Anesthesia induction: Dexmedetomidine 1µg/kg (intravenous infusion within 10min), propofol 1.5-2mg/kg (intravenous bolus), lidocaine 1.5-2mg/kg (intravenous bolus), cisatracurium besylate 0.15-0.3mg/kg (intravenous bolus before tracheal intubation), methylprednisolone 40mg (intravenous bolus), esmolol 1mg/kg (intravenous bolus), and 0.5% tetracaine 5ml for surface anesthesia of the throat.&#xD;
Maintenance of anesthesia: Continuous infusion of propofol and dexmedetomidine [0.4μg/(kg.h)]. The infusion rate of propofol was adjusted according to bispectral index value. Cisatracurium besylate was given as needed. Flurbiprofen 50mg was given intravenously before the skin incision and suture respectively.&#xD;
Remedy: If blood pressure rises (more than 30% of the mean arterial pressure after induction), and heart rate increases (more than 30% of heart rate after induction) during skin incision, lidocaine 1.5mg/kg will be given intravenously and then be continuously infused at a rate of 1.5mg/(kg.h).</description>

Maintenance of anesthesia: Continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil. The infusion rate of propofol was adjusted according to BIS value. The infusion rate of remifentanil was 0.1-0.5µg/(kg.min) and adjusted according to the change of heart rate and blood pressure. Cisatracurium besylate was given as needed. Sufentanil 0.1μg/kg and flurbiprofen 50mg were given intravenously before the skin incision and suture respectively.</description>
