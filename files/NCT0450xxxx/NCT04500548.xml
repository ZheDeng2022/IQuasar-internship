  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial investigates the side effects of the combination of nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab, and to see how well they work in treating patients with cancers that have come&#xD;
      back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory) and have an increased number of&#xD;
      genetic changes. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab,&#xD;
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is the total amount of genetic&#xD;
      changes or &quot;mutations&quot; found in tumor cells. Some studies in adults with cancer have shown&#xD;
      that patients with a higher TMB (an increased number of genetic changes) are more likely to&#xD;
      respond to immunotherapy drugs. There is also evidence that nivolumab and ipilimumab can&#xD;
      shrink or stabilize cancer in adult patients with cancer. This study is being done to help&#xD;
      doctors learn if the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab can help children, adolescents,&#xD;
      and young adults patients live longer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To confirm the safety and tolerability of nivolumab-based combination therapy in children,&#xD;
      adolescent and young adult (CAYA) patients with relapsed/refractory hypermutant cancers&#xD;
      (including solid tumors, central nervous system [CNS] tumors, neuroblastoma, and lymphoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. To determine the tolerability, define and describe the toxicities, and determine the&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy in CAYA&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/refractory hypermutant cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess objective overall response rate (ORR) to the nivolumab-based combination therapy&#xD;
      in CAYA patients with relapsed/refractory hypermutant cancers within the confines of a Phase&#xD;
      1b study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess clinical benefit rate (CBR) (objective response and stable disease for at least&#xD;
      two [2] protocol reassessments), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      following nivolumab-based combination therapy in CAYA patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      hypermutant cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore correlations between tumor genotype (including tumor mutation burden [TMB],&#xD;
      specific gene mutations, etc.) and response to nivolumab-based combination therapy in CAYA&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/refractory hypermutant cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To discover biomarkers predicting response of hypermutant CAYA cancers undergoing PD-1&#xD;
      blockade including tumor neoantigen formation, specific T-cell receptor rearrangements (TCRR)&#xD;
      of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and detailed characterization and activation of the&#xD;
      immune infiltrations including the TILs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the use of minimally invasive methods to monitor and predict response to&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibition in hypermutant cancers including assessment of circulating tumor&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and circulating T-cells immunophenotypic profiling&#xD;
      (differentiation markers, cytokines, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART I: Patients undergo collection of tissue samples for TMB level. Patients with elevated&#xD;
      TMB may be eligible for Part II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART II: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE LEVEL 1: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes and ipilimumab&#xD;
      IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 30-90&#xD;
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 23 cycles in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE LEVEL -1: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 26 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks for 1 year.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  PART 2: Patients with treated CNS metastasis are eligible if there is no evidence of&#xD;
             progression for at least 4 weeks after CNS-directed treatment as ascertained by&#xD;
             clinical examination and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed&#xD;
             tomography [CT] scan) during screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with new or progressive CNS metastasis (active metastasis) or&#xD;
                  leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that&#xD;
                  immediate CNS-directed treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required&#xD;
                  for at least 6 weeks after treatment initiation, and a risk-benefit analysis&#xD;
                  (discussion) by the patient and investigator favors participation in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PART 2: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): Infected patients on effective&#xD;
             anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months prior to&#xD;
             treatment initiation are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Routine screening for HIV status prior to enrollment is not required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PART 2: Hepatitis B virus (HBV): Patients with evidence of chronic infection with&#xD;
             undetectable viral load are eligible. Suppressive therapy, if indicated, is allowed&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  PART 2: Hepatitis C virus (HCV): Infected patients currently on treatment with&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Note: Routine screening for HCV status prior to enrollment is not required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PART 2: Patients must provide a pre-treatment tumor tissue specimen (baseline sample)&#xD;
             for correlative exploratory biology studies. The specimen may be archival or&#xD;
             prospective, from a medically necessary surgery, biopsy, or excision. Tissue will not&#xD;
             be obtained solely for this trial. A specimen from the time of most recent&#xD;
             relapse/progression is preferred, but not mandatory. Submission of a representative&#xD;
             sample from all available lesions (archival and prospective) is strongly encouraged.&#xD;
             If available, residual tissue from Part 1 may be used to fulfill the baseline tissue&#xD;
             sample requirement; however additional tissue may be required if residual tissue is&#xD;
             insufficient&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to&#xD;

                  immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Due to the unknown but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants&#xD;
                  secondary to treatment of the mother with the study agents, breastfeeding must be&#xD;
                  discontinued if the mother is treated on study&#xD;
