      Mindfulness training, relaxation training, and cerebellar electrical stimulation were used to&#xD;
      intervene in the cognitive function of healthy individuals and individuals with first episode&#xD;
      depression&#xD;

      In this proposed study,the investigators will evaluate the effects of different&#xD;
      non-pharmacological interventions (physical/psychological) on emotion-related cognitive&#xD;
      function.This project will use a variety of intervention methods to conduct research in&#xD;
      healthy individuals and patients with mood disorders. The main intervention methods include:&#xD;
      (1) mindfulness training;(2) relaxation training;(3) cerebellar electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit 80 healthy subjects and 40 first-episode depression patients. The&#xD;
      study consisted of three steps: First, subjects filled in personal data and completed the&#xD;
      first screening, randomly assigned groups, and filled in the pre-intervention&#xD;
      questionnaire;Second, give a one-time non-drug intervention (mindfulness training, relaxation&#xD;
      training or cerebellar electrical stimulation);Step 3: After the intervention, the subjects&#xD;
      filled in the post-intervention questionnaire and completed the cognitive task test.Clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and safety assessment will be done at first time. The specific aims are to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of non-drug therapy on cognitive function in healthy individuals and patients with&#xD;
      first episode depression. and the behavior was evaluated by cognitive function task.&#xD;
