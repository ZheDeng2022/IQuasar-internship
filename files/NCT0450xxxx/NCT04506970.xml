  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is caused when the placenta cannot provide enough&#xD;
      nutrients to allow normal growth of the fetus during pregnancy. It is unclear why IUGR&#xD;
      happens, but an increase in inflammatory T cells in the placenta known as villitis of unknown&#xD;
      etiology (VUE) is observed in many IUGR infants. The investigators aim to develop ultrasound&#xD;
      methods for diagnosing VUE to understand it's role in IUGR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) occurs in 3-10% of all pregnancies and is associated&#xD;
      with significant morbidity and mortality during pregnancy, after birth and throughout the&#xD;
      child's lifespan. IUGR is caused by the inability of the placental vasculature to provide&#xD;
      enough oxygen and nutrients to support the fetus; yet, the mechanisms leading to disruption&#xD;
      of placental vasculature are unknown. The placenta of ~50% of IUGR fetuses are infiltrated&#xD;
      with inflammatory cells, specifically maternal T cells, which destroy placental blood vessels&#xD;
      that support the fetus. This infiltration of T cells is known as villitis of unknown etiology&#xD;
      (VUE). The diagnosis of VUE is problematic because it occurs without clinical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of maternal (or fetal) distress and puts the fetus at significant risk of demise.&#xD;
      Additionally, VUE commonly recurs in subsequent pregnancies putting future offspring at risk.&#xD;
      Yet, the exact prevalence of VUE and its significance in IUGR pathogenesis and outcomes are&#xD;
      poorly understood as VUE is only diagnosed after the infant is outside the womb. Therefore,&#xD;
      the study aims to recognize risk factors and cellular mechanisms associated with VUE and&#xD;
      develop methods for diagnosing and treating VUE in utero, in order to improve infant health.&#xD;

        Participants will be recruited from women obtaining prenatal care in the obstetrics clinic&#xD;
        at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. This study will consist of two cohorts: 1) women&#xD;
        diagnosed with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and 2) women having uncomplicated&#xD;
        pregnancies. Forty women will be enrolled after being diagnosed with IUGR. Based on prior&#xD;
        clinical data it is expected that 50% will have a VUE diagnosis. Another cohort of 20 women&#xD;
        having uncomplicated pregnancies will also be enrolled, matched for fetal sex and&#xD;
        gestational age at ultrasound.&#xD;
