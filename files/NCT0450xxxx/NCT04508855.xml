  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm prospective observational study aiming to explore the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of switching from direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) to low molecular weight heparin&#xD;
      (LMWH) in cancer patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) during antineoplastic therapy or for&#xD;
      a maximum time period of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia; it affects 1.5% to 2% of the general population,&#xD;
      and this prevalence increases to 10% at 80 years of age and to 18% at 85 years of age. Given&#xD;
      the increasing occurrence of malignancies in the elderly and the coexistence of other&#xD;
      conditions predisposing to AF in cancer patients, an association between those 2 conditions&#xD;
      would be expected. A study including 24,125 patients estimated a prevalence of AF of 2.4% at&#xD;
      the time of cancer diagnosis. A recent prospective study of 34,691 middle-aged women without&#xD;
      AF or cancer at baseline showed that new-onset AF was a risk marker of subsequent diagnosis&#xD;
      of cancer (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.75; p &lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, patients with cancer are at significantly higher risk of developing venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism (VTE) which sometimes may precede the diagnosis of the malignancy. The risk&#xD;
      is even higher when the patient is poorly mobilized or hospitalized. On the other hand, some&#xD;
      anticancer therapies and especially the novel angiogenesis inhibitors are associated with&#xD;
      increased thrombogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to current Guidelines, DOACs are preferred over vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy&#xD;
      and LMWH in both AF and VTE in the general population. However, in the presence of active&#xD;
      cancer the administration of LMWH is advised for patients who are hospitalized for any reason&#xD;
      and/or receiving chemotherapy, unless there is a high bleeding risk. LMWH has more favorable&#xD;
      outcomes in cancer patients than VKAs, both in the setting of primary or secondary&#xD;
      thromboembolic prophylaxis while extended anticoagulation (beyond the first 6 months) may be&#xD;
      considered for an indefinite period or until the cancer is cured. This is possibly related&#xD;
      with the fact that LMWH present antitumour and antimetastatic effects and confer an increased&#xD;
      survival benefit. It should be noted that currently there is no conclusive evidence regarding&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of DOACs in cancer patients and the first results seem contradictory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of recent studies with the use of DOACs in cancer-associated venous thromboembolism&#xD;
      have demonstrated that these drugs are effective with similar rates of recurrent VTE but&#xD;
      higher rates of major bleeding compared to LMWH. However, there are particular disadvantages,&#xD;
      especially during the period of chemotherapy, such as interactions between these agents and&#xD;
      anticancer therapies (eg, potential interactions between DOACs and azole-antimycotic agents),&#xD;
      as well as unknown pharmacokinetics from chemotherapy-related vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Putting things together, many patients who are under a DOAC due to AF or previous&#xD;
      VTE/pulmonary embolism (PE) may be diagnosed with cancer. Moreover, the risk of VTE is 6-fold&#xD;
      higher on intravenous chemotherapy. For this reason, current clinical practice suggests that&#xD;
      LMWH is continued during treatment with intravenous chemotherapy. However, data on the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of this common approach is lacking. This is important, especially in the&#xD;
      setting of gastrointestinal tumors (especially gastric and pancreatic disease) which pose a&#xD;
      high bleeding risk and especially during the chemotherapy active period.&#xD;
