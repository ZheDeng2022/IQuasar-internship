      The purpose of the initial (phase I) portion of this study is to find a dose level and&#xD;
      administration schedule of the study drug, 225Ac-J591 that can be given without severe side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

      This clinical trial is for men with progressive metastatic castration resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer. The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose level of the study drug,&#xD;
      225Ac-J591 that can be given without severe side effects. The research study is being done&#xD;
      because the standard treatments for prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland&#xD;
      are intended to minimize the adverse effects of the disease. These treatments, however, are&#xD;
      not curative. Patients who choose to participate in this study will have a screening visit to&#xD;
      determine whether or not they are eligible to participate in the study. The treatment phase&#xD;
      is comprised of 8 weeks for the fractionated dose cohort and 8 weeks past last dose of&#xD;
      225Ac-J591 for the multiple dose regimen (for subjects receiving 4 cycles, 26 weeks is&#xD;
      expected). Following treatment, short-term follow up is planned until radiographic&#xD;
      progression, expected to be 6 months.The study medication is called 225Ac-J591, and will be&#xD;
      administered as a single fractionated cycle day 1 and day 15 in the fractionated dose regimen&#xD;
      and as a single dose per cycle repeated every 6 weeks in the multiple dose regimen. Upon&#xD;
      completion of investigational treatment with 225Ac-J591, subjects will undergo&#xD;
      68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC injection and same day PET/CT/ at the end of study visit to document&#xD;
      treatment response. 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC is comprised of gallium-68, which is a PET emitting&#xD;
      radionuclide linked to PSMA-HBED-CC (aka PSMA11), which is a small molecule targeting PSMA.&#xD;
      68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC will be administered intravenously prior to PET/CT at screening and at&#xD;
      follow up imaging x2. Subsequently survival data and additional treatment(s) information will&#xD;
      be captured from their routine Standard of care (SOC) visits.During the other study visits,&#xD;
      participants will undergo routine tests and procedures, such as physical examinations, and&#xD;
      routine blood tests. Some blood tests will be done for research purposes only. After&#xD;
      completion of therapy, participants may be contacted on a periodic basis to see how they are&#xD;
      doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open to men age 18 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of progressive metastatic prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have been previously treated for their disease with particular types of therapy&#xD;
