  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a tumor entity featured by frequent involvement of&#xD;
      peritoneum, also called peritoneal carcinomatosis. It is a type of metastasis accompanied by&#xD;
      significant cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) accumulation. Fibroblast activation protein&#xD;
      (FAP) is a protein that is overexpressed on CAFs and can be non-invasively monitored by a&#xD;
      novel radiotracer called 68Ga-FAPI-04 positron emission tomography/computed tomography&#xD;
      (PET/CT). In this study, we will explore the value of 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT in patients with&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancer who are scheduled for surgical intervention. The findings of&#xD;
      68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT will also be compared with that of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose&#xD;
      fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT, which is one of the most commonly used modalities in&#xD;
      evaluating EOC, and histological findings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with epithelial ovarian cancer who are scheduled for surgical intervention will be&#xD;
      recruited in this study. They will undergo a comparative 68Ga-FAPI-04 and 18F-FDG PET/CT&#xD;
      study before the surgery. No tumor-specific treatment is allowed between the scan and&#xD;
      surgery, e.g. adjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and intraperitoneal&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Three types of lesions will be marked based on 68Ga-FAPI-04 and 18F-FDG PET/CT&#xD;
      findings, which is FAPI+/FDG-, FAPI-/FAPI+, and FAPI+/FDG+ lesions. The marked lesions will&#xD;
      be explored by the surgeon, resected if possible, and compared with histological results. A&#xD;
      fourth type of lesion will be added into the analysis if that lesion is both FAPI and FAP&#xD;
      negative but is a histological-confirmed positive lesion.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent signed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EOC patients who are scheduled for surgery. The diagnosis of EOC should be based on&#xD;
             the previous histological results or cytological evaluation combined with a serum&#xD;
             CA-125 to carcinoembryonic antigen ratio&gt;25 to confirm the primary diagnosis and&#xD;
             exclude a nongynecologic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI-04.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor-specific treatment is necessary between the scans and surgery, e.g. adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and intraperitoneal chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any mental condition rendering the patient unable to understand the nature, scope, and&#xD;
             possible consequences of the study, and/or evidence of an uncooperative attitude.&#xD;
