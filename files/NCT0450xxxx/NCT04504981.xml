  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African Americans represent only 14% of the population, but account for 44% of all new HIV&#xD;
      infections reported yearly. The situation is particularly grave for Black/African American&#xD;
      young men who have sex with men (AAYMSM), with seroprevalence rates of 19% for ages 15-22 and&#xD;
      26% for ages 23-29 among AAYMSM. These health outcomes are influenced by important social and&#xD;
      structural factors, including violence and victimization, homophobia, discrimination,&#xD;
      institutional racism, and economic and social marginalization. These experiences are&#xD;
      significantly associated with illicit drug use, alcohol misuse, transactional sex work, and&#xD;
      HIV risk behaviors. In response to this crisis, the investigators are proposing to create a&#xD;
      new theoretically driven, youth-centered intervention designed to build the capacity of&#xD;
      AAYMSM to overcome these barriers to health. With this revised R34 application, the team&#xD;
      proposes to further refine and pilot test an intervention, called Young Men's Adult Identity&#xD;
      Mentoring (YM-AIM). Adapted from an existing CDC Diffusing Effective Behavioral Intervention,&#xD;
      YM-AIM is a theory-driven, group-level intervention designed to help AAYMSM develop a healthy&#xD;
      vision for their future (or &quot;possible future self&quot;) by defining a set of short- and long-term&#xD;
      goals in the areas of education, health, family and intimate relationships. We propose to&#xD;
      further strengthen and refine YM-AIM by adding a youth mentoring/support component, called&#xD;
      Youth Initiated Mentoring (YIM). YIM uses a positive youth development framework to: a) build&#xD;
      social capital to achieve immediate and long-term goals, b) build social support, c) identify&#xD;
      and engage natural mentors in one's networks to address structural barriers, and d) develop&#xD;
      relationships with supportive adults. The investigators will integrate these two models into&#xD;
      a single intervention called Y2Prevent. The investigators will then work to further adapt,&#xD;
      tailor, and evaluate Y2Prevent as an intervention to reduce illicit drug use and HIV/STI risk&#xD;
      among AAYMSM. This intervention will emphasize: a) biomedical HIV prevention strategies for&#xD;
      primary prevention, b) HIV/STI testing and treatment referral, c) drug screening and&#xD;
      treatment referral, and d) positive youth development and future planning. The investigators&#xD;
      will conduct formative research to inform the adaptation/tailoring followed by a piloting of&#xD;
      the new intervention to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and the preliminary efficacy.&#xD;
      Our proposed positive youth development and resilience theory provide a strong, innovative&#xD;
      framework for examining how AAYMSM with significant exposure to syndemic health and social&#xD;
      disparities respond to engagement with prevention and treatment resources. The proposed&#xD;
      intervention is intended to promote resilience, build social skills and assets among AAYMSM&#xD;
      to help them recognize and overcome individual, social and structural barriers leading to&#xD;
      risk, and adopt and maintain protective behaviors, such as safer sex, PrEP/PEP use, HIV/STI&#xD;
      testing and healthcare utilization. The findings will inform the development of an R01&#xD;
      application that will propose a larger-scale, multi-city efficacy trail in a subsequent R01&#xD;
      application.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim is to develop a culturally tailored and developmentally appropriate HIV&#xD;
      prevention intervention for African American young men who have sex with men (AAYMSM), ages&#xD;
      18 to 24 years. No group is at greater risk for acquiring HIV than YMSM, especially those&#xD;
      living in inner cities, with AAYMSM now accounting for the largest number of new HIV&#xD;
      infections detected in cities each year. If these trends continue, it is estimated that as&#xD;
      many as 1 in 2 AAYMSM will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to further refine and pilot test an intervention, called Young&#xD;
      Men's Adult Identity Mentoring (YM-AIM). Adapted from an existing CDC Diffusing Effective&#xD;
      Behavioral Intervention (DEBI), YM-AIM is a theory-driven, group-level intervention designed&#xD;
      to help AAYMSM develop a healthy vision for their future (or &quot;possible future self&quot;) by&#xD;
      defining a set of short- and long-term goals in the areas of education, health, family and&#xD;
      intimate relationships. Through the facilitated activities, participants consider how their&#xD;
      involvement in risky behaviors (e.g., illicit drug use, condomless sex, multiple sex&#xD;
      partners) would interfere with achieving those goals. With funding from NIDA (R21 DA024588),&#xD;
      the investigators developed YM-AIM in response to findings from our own research, as well as&#xD;
      those reported in the literature, which demonstrate that experiences of minority stress&#xD;
      (e.g., racism, homophobia) and exposure to violence and victimization (family, intimate&#xD;
      partner, community) put AAYMSM at significantly greater risk for illicit drug use, HIV/STI&#xD;
      sexual risk (condomless anal sex), and mental health problems (e.g., depression) as compared&#xD;
      to Caucasian and Hispanic/Latino YMSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During our initial pilot, participants (n=36) were enormously enthusiastic about their&#xD;
      participation in YM-AIM (all participants attended all six weekly sessions), they provided&#xD;
      positive feedback about the various components, activities, and exercises, and they reported&#xD;
      that YM-AIM should continue to be delivered using a group-based intervention because they&#xD;
      enjoyed the support provided by other group members. Participants also reported they wanted&#xD;
      (and needed) ongoing social support after completing the intervention, to help them achieve&#xD;
      their short- and long-term goals and maintain positive changes in sexual risk behaviors. This&#xD;
      feedback is consistent with the literature that suggests mentors are immensely beneficial,&#xD;
      particularly for youth and young adults, because they can share their worldviews,&#xD;
      experiences, knowledge, support and advice, as well as provide a positive influence. By&#xD;
      introducing youth to new experiences and sharing positive values, mentors can help young&#xD;
      people avoid negative behaviors and achieve success. Having a mentor has also been found to&#xD;
      reduce youths' risk for delinquency, aggression and drug use and lead to increased academic&#xD;
      satisfaction and performance. Based on this, the investigators propose to further strengthen&#xD;
      and refine YM-AIM by adding a youth mentoring/support component, called Youth Initiated&#xD;
      Mentoring (YIM). YIM uses a positive youth development framework to help young, low-income&#xD;
      ethnic/racial minorities: a) build social capital to achieve immediate and long-term life&#xD;
      goals, b) build social support networks, c) identify and engage natural mentors in their&#xD;
      networks to address structural barriers encountered in their lives, and d) develop&#xD;
      relationships with supportive adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      YM-AIM was developed in 2011, before widespread availability of PrEP/PEP. The investigators&#xD;
      are therefore also proposing to add three new components: 1) biomedical HIV prevention&#xD;
      strategies (PrEP, PEP), 2) HIV/STI testing and treatment referral, and 3) drug screening and&#xD;
      treatment referral. This new intervention, which is called Y2Prevent, will then be evaluated&#xD;
      for its feasibility and acceptability. Intervention outcomes include drug use in past 30 days&#xD;
      and 3 months, alcohol use, condomless sex, number of partners, condom use intention, condom&#xD;
      use self-efficacy, HIV testing recency/frequency, and linkage to care. The specific aims are&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 1: Conduct formative research to develop Y2Prevent and refine our assessment&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 2: Finalize Y2Prevent study protocols and consents and develop a manual of&#xD;
      operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 3: Pilot and evaluate Y2Prevent to determine intervention feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability, and collect prelimiary efficacy data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e propose to integrate YM-AIM and YIM into a single new intervention, called Y2Prevent. This&#xD;
      intervention will then be implemented and evaluated for feasibility and acceptability, and&#xD;
      manualized. Three phases of research are proposed. In Phase 1, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      formative research to integrate YM-AIM and YIM and refine our assessment battery (Aim 1). In&#xD;
      Phase 2, the investigators will finalize the study protocols and consents and develop a&#xD;
      manual of operations (Aim 2). In Phase 3, investigators will pilot test Y2Prevent with 30&#xD;
      participants. Assessment measures will also be pilot tested during three assessment sessions,&#xD;
      at baseline (first study visit) and 3- and 6-month follow-up (after post-intervention test).&#xD;
      Intervention outcomes include drug use in past 30 days and 3 months, alcohol use, condomless&#xD;
      sex, number of partners, condom use intention, condom use self-efficacy, HIV testing&#xD;
      recency/frequency, and linkage to care. Findings from this pilot research will inform&#xD;
      selection of measures and outcomes for a future randomized clinical trial (RCT) and provide&#xD;
      estimates of possible intervention effect sizes (group means, SDs) for trial planning.&#xD;
      Process measures include data on sources of recruitment and recruitment rates, trial&#xD;
      retention rates, and identification of barriers and facilitators to recruitment and&#xD;
      retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WORKING GROUPS - PHASE 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase 1, the investigators will convene two working groups of AAYMS to engage in a&#xD;
      process of integrating the Young Men's Adult Identity Mentoring (YM-AIM) and Youth Initiated&#xD;
      Mentoring (YIM). Each work group will include 8-10 young men. These men will be recruited&#xD;
      from our existing HYM cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior experience has taught us that creating groups with shared key characteristics (e.g.&#xD;
      risk profile, sexual identity or age) is the most effective means of facilitating more&#xD;
      in-depth discussions. Each group, consisting of 6-8 members, will be convened on a weekly&#xD;
      basis and each meeting will focus on one specific topic (i.e.,common challenges that AAYMSM&#xD;
      experience with HIV prevention; what AAYMSM want from a mentor) - there will be around 7&#xD;
      weekly lessons that participants will attend. During these meetings, participants will review&#xD;
      each unit of the original YM-AIM and YIM curricula and discuss what components would be most&#xD;
      relevant. Groups will be facilitated by the research assistant, and each week a volunteer&#xD;
      from each group will be asked to serve as a co-facilitator in an effort to increase ownership&#xD;
      for intervention adaptation and to assist in maintaining order within the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guided discussions will focus on different aspects of the curricula such as: 1) common&#xD;
      challenges that AAYMSM experience with HIV prevention; 2) what AAYMSM want from a mentor; 3)&#xD;
      managing positive and negative influences in their lives; 4) challenges in accessing care;&#xD;
      and 5) the role that intimate partners play in their lives. The investigators will brainstorm&#xD;
      potential activities that can be integrated into our newly adapted Y2Prevent curriculum that&#xD;
      focus on these areas (e.g., PrEP Myth or Truth game).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PILOT TEST - PHASE 3: In Phase 3, the investigators will pilot test Y2Prevent with three&#xD;
      working groups of African American young men who have sex with men (AAYMSM) in Los Angeles.&#xD;
      Each group will have up to 10 members (n=30). The intervention will be delivered to the three&#xD;
      groups in a sequential order so that the experiences from the first group can be used to&#xD;
      adapt and/or further refine the intervention before it is pilot tested with the second group.&#xD;
      Feedback from the first group will be used to further adapt and refine the intervention. It&#xD;
      will be pilot tested again with a second group of 10 participants. Y2Prevent will be further&#xD;
      refined as needed, and it will then be pilot tested with a third and final group of up to ten&#xD;
      participants. The investigators will continue to gather information, solicit input, and&#xD;
      refine Y2Prevent until the investigators are satisfied that the intervention is truly&#xD;
      relevant, acceptable, and appropriate for the target population. These group discussions will&#xD;
      be audio-recorded and professionally transcribed for analysis. The focus groups are expected&#xD;
      to last 1.5 - 2 hours each.&#xD;
