  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase II interventional study in order to assess efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of single agent ublituximab as initial therapy for FL (Follicular lymphoma) and MZL (Marginal&#xD;
      zone lymphoma ) with response driven addition of umbralisib for suboptimal response.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on overall reporting in low tumor burden FL and MZL, CR rate of at least 30% was&#xD;
      achieved when single agent rituximab was used in these subsets. The investigators assume that&#xD;
      by administering ublituximab (both as a single agent and in combination with umbralisib for&#xD;
      individuals who fail to achieve a CR [Complete response] with the single agent), the CR rate&#xD;
      will increase to 50%. Efficacy will be assessed using the proportion of patients treated with&#xD;
      ublituximab alone or with ublituximab administered in combination who have a complete&#xD;
      response. Thus, the investigators will test the efficacy of ublituximab using a difference in&#xD;
      proportions design by comparing an expected study population control rate of 50% to the&#xD;
      comparison proportion being determined by the historical control CR rate of 30%. In other&#xD;
      words, the null hypothesis is that the true response rate is 30%, and it will be formally&#xD;
      tested against a one-sided alternative that the response rate is 50%.&#xD;
