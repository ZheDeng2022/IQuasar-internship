  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is the 2nd most disabling neurological disease. It affects 14.7% of the population&#xD;
      (children and adults) of whom 80% are female. In the European Union, the total annual cost of&#xD;
      migraine is of 111 billion euros. If not adequately treated, migraine can evolve into the&#xD;
      more severe chronic form (CM), defined by &gt;15 headache days/month, where burden and costs&#xD;
      increase exponentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until very recently, available preventive treatments for migraine were non-specific, of&#xD;
      limited efficacy and scarce tolerability. In 2018, monoclonal antibodies (mABs) against&#xD;
      calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor have been approved. Since CGRP is one of the&#xD;
      main modulators of the trigeminal system, mABs against CGRP are the first specific preventive&#xD;
      treatment for migraine ever developed. They are highly effective in a subgroup of patients,&#xD;
      well tolerated, but costly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this frame, the main objective of BIOMIGA project is to identify predictive biomarkers of&#xD;
      response to CGRP-mABs in patients with severe forms of migraine. To this end, the&#xD;
      investigators will use an integrated hypothesis-based and data-driven, multidisciplinary&#xD;
      approach that combines' omic testing in a deep-phenotyped migraine population and parallel&#xD;
      fundamental research in a validated animal model of migraine. Three partners, Headache&#xD;
      Science Centre, IRCCS C. Mondino Foundation, University of Pavia, Italy, Headache Research&#xD;
      Group Vall d'Hebron Institute of Research, Barcelona, Spain and Institut für Systemische&#xD;
      Neurowissenschaften, Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany with an&#xD;
      established long-standing and complementary expertise in neuroimaging, biochemical profiling&#xD;
      and epigenetics in humans and in animal modeling of migraine will collaborate to achieve the&#xD;
      Project's objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect important spin-offs to the improved management of migraine, both in&#xD;
      terms of increased efficacy and cost saving, but also to understand CGRP-based mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying migraine pathophysiology and to set the basis for a pathophysiologically driven&#xD;
      classification. Healthcare providers and the pharmaceutical industry will be engaged once the&#xD;
      biomarker(s) have been identified to optimize access to care and the use of resource, as well&#xD;
      as to reduce disability and socio-economic impact of migraine.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almost 15% of European citizens suffer from migraine and its comorbidities. Migraine is the&#xD;
      second most disabling chronic neurological disease, with devastating repercussions on the&#xD;
      life of those who are affected, their relatives and society. Migraine manifests in recurring&#xD;
      attacks lasting 4-72 hours characterized by severe head pain, often throbbing, associated&#xD;
      with nausea, photo and phonophobia, vomiting, cognitive deficits, severe emotional distress&#xD;
      and complete disability. If not diagnosed and appropriately treated, migraine can transform&#xD;
      into a chronic form (15 or more days of headache/ month) often associated with acute&#xD;
      medication overuse and severe comorbidities such as depression, anxiety and panic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disability associated to migraine is closely related to the frequency of the attacks.&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies show that in Europe 34$ of migraineurs suffer from more than 5&#xD;
      headache days per month and 1-3% of the general population has migraine on more than 15&#xD;
      days/month, thus qualifying for the diagnosis of Chronic Migraine (CM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migraine is a genetically-driven, chronic &quot;neurosensorial&quot; disorder, where the unpredictable&#xD;
      recurrence of the attacks is modulated by the variable efficiency of the fine-tuned interplay&#xD;
      of the brain with dynamic sensory stimuli originating from the internal or external&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migraine can be viewed as a cycling functional disorder that affects several areas of the&#xD;
      brain, involving multiple pathways ultimately leading to the excessive activation of&#xD;
      trigeminovascular afferents in the meninges with the local release of vasoactive substances&#xD;
      (calcitonin gene-related peptide - CGRP ) and the activation of the neuroinflammatory&#xD;
      cascade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike several other chronic neurological diseases, migraine can be successfully treated and&#xD;
      prevented. Unfortunately, this is true only for subgroups of patients and for a limited&#xD;
      period, due to the nonspecific therapeutic armamentarium available: calcium antagonists,&#xD;
      beta-blockers, antidepressants, antiepileptics and, only for chronic migraine,&#xD;
      onabotulinumtoxin-A. This is the direct consequence of the complex pathophysiology of the&#xD;
      disease, but mostly and, more importantly, by the total absence of biomarkers of disease and&#xD;
      of responsiveness to available drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last years, enormous efforts have indeed been undertaken to identify biomarker of&#xD;
      migraine, especially for the chronic form. Functional imaging has provided important clues on&#xD;
      the machinery underlying attack generation and imaging biomarkers for chronic migraine,&#xD;
      whereas it has become evident that epigenetic processes - DNA methylation in particular - may&#xD;
      play an important role in the phenotypical expression of migraine. Attack recurrence and the&#xD;
      associated changes in neuronal activity may indeed cause epigenetic changes that alter&#xD;
      synaptic plasticity, thus leading to more frequent migraine attacks and ultimately promotes&#xD;
      stable epigenetic changes in a feed-forward loop. Circulating levels of CGRP have also been&#xD;
      evaluated as a possible peripheral biomarker of migraine in consideration of the seminal&#xD;
      observations that CGRP levels increase in the external jugular vein during a migraine attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second half of 2018 marked a revolution in the treatment of migraine: the advent of the&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies (mABs) directed against CGRP or its receptor. They proved safe and&#xD;
      effective in reducing migraine frequency and represent the first class of preventive drugs&#xD;
      targeting a specific step in the cascade of events leading to the migraine attack. Results&#xD;
      from clinical trials have shown that approximately 1/3 of patients are excellent responders&#xD;
      (&gt;75% reduction in headache days) whilst 1/3 patients are non- or poor responders (&lt;25%&#xD;
      reduction in headache days) to CGRP-targeted mABs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGRP-targeted mABs do not interfere with other systems or medications. Consequently, the fact&#xD;
      that patients can be stratified as responders and non-responders creates a unique opportunity&#xD;
      to better understand the difference of response in patients clinically alike and, through&#xD;
      this, provide unprecedented insights into the pathophysiology of migraine allowing the&#xD;
      migraine field to move towards a pathophysiological driven classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For decades the migraine scientific community has been searching for biomarkers associated&#xD;
      with the disease or with its response to treatment. Unfortunately, to date none has been&#xD;
      validated. This failure is likely related to multiple reasons: the complex and dynamic nature&#xD;
      of migraine-associated biological processes (attack vs. pre-post interictal phase), the&#xD;
      multiplicity of neurotransmitters (serotonin dopamine, neuropeptides, etc.), the&#xD;
      neuroanatomical structures (peripheral, central) and the interindividual variability of&#xD;
      disease expression. Moreover, the reasons for the failure of previous studies are also&#xD;
      associated with the variability between studies, in terms of methodology, population and&#xD;
      endpoints, which has led to inconsistent findings and low estimate precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now, a selective class of preventive drugs that specifically target a biological step in&#xD;
      migraine disease has become available, prompting the possibility to precisely stratify&#xD;
      migraine subjects on the basis of their pharmacological response. The availability of&#xD;
      high-throughput technologies is providing unprecedented opportunities to identify molecular&#xD;
      markers of complex disease by extracting meaningful signatures from complex and heterogeneous&#xD;
      sets of data. Molecular biomarkers of thoroughly stratified populations can be combined with&#xD;
      deep clinical phenotyping and also with epigenetic, pharmacogenetic and neuroimaging&#xD;
      variables, that are relevant for migraine. The availability of migraine-specific animal&#xD;
      models also contributes to identifying and firmly placing important pieces to the migraine&#xD;
      puzzle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Against this background, a hybrid data-driven and knowledge-based approach building on&#xD;
      clinical and preclinical inputs and including phenotype, genetic, neuroimaging and animal&#xD;
      data will provide a large informative dataset that can be effectively analyzed with machine&#xD;
      and deep learning algorithms for feature selection, modeling and for subsequent&#xD;
      cross-validation to ultimately yield a precise, robust and reproducible model for predicting&#xD;
      the response of migraine to a specifically targeted preventive treatment. This will be a&#xD;
      crucial step in the therapeutic decision process, especially in the most severe and disabling&#xD;
      form of migraine, chronic migraine. It will also provide additional positive implications in&#xD;
      the field, such as prompting the ground for a pathophysiology-driven diagnosis and, equally&#xD;
      important, robust scientific evidence to European decision makers and health-care providers&#xD;
      for optimizing the distribution of resources and rationalizing the access to care of migraine&#xD;
      sufferers. Engagement of patients is envisaged both in the planning and conducting of the&#xD;
      study to ensure that project methodology and results are in line with their needs and&#xD;
      expectations, thus favoring the translation into clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP (CGRP-mABs) have been shown to be effective in the&#xD;
      preventive treatment of migraine. They are large molecules that do not cross the blood brain&#xD;
      barrier, have a long half-life (20-45 days) and do not interact pharmacologically. They are&#xD;
      administered parenterally, which warrants less intra-individual variations and a better&#xD;
      adherence to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGRP-mABs have proven safe and effective in multiple phase II and III randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trials and were approved by FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) as a preventive&#xD;
      treatment for migraine. Four CGRP-mABs have been studied and 3 of them have been approved by&#xD;
      EMA in late 2018 and 2019: erenumab, galcanezumab and fremanezumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A strong body of evidence suggests that CGRP-mABs induce a 50% response (50% reduction in&#xD;
      monthly headache days) in about 50% of subjects, with a 75% response in 30-40% of patients.&#xD;
      The latter group, from now on defined as 'excellent responders', represents an interesting&#xD;
      subgroup of migraine subjects whose disease is likely particularly dependent on CGRP-related&#xD;
      pathways. Hence, the availability of mABs targeting CGRP together with the demonstration of&#xD;
      their efficacy in relevant subgroups of subjects prompt a formidable tool to tackle precisely&#xD;
      a subset of mechanisms and pathways underlying the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGRP-targeted mABs do not interfere with other systems or medications. Consequently, the fact&#xD;
      that patients can be precisely stratified as excellent responders and non-responders creates&#xD;
      a unique novel opportunity to unravel hitherto concealed differences between patients with&#xD;
      the same diagnosis and, through this, provides unprecedented insights into the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of migraine. Ultimately, this will allow the migraine field to move towards a&#xD;
      neurobiological definition of responders and a pathophysiological driven classification.&#xD;
      Defining predictors to this response will in turn allow obtaining a more cost-effective&#xD;
      approach to migraine healthcare. Engagement of patients is envisaged both in the planning and&#xD;
      conducting of the study based on the long-standing collaboration with the European Migraine&#xD;
      and Headache Alliance (EMHA), which has been aligned and involved in the preparation of the&#xD;
      present proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetics is acquiring an increasing importance in the panorama of biological events that&#xD;
      leads to the transformation of episodic migraine (EM) into chronic migraine (CM). Frequent&#xD;
      recurrence of migraine attacks may indeed promote stable epigenetic changes in a feed-forward&#xD;
      loop thus altering synaptic plasticity. So far, the most significant associated CpG sites&#xD;
      related to migraine chronification are SH2D5, NPTX2 and RAMP1, three brain-expressed genes&#xD;
      involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and CGRP modulation. However, it is still&#xD;
      not known whether a specific profile of DNA methylation, which is a stable epigenetic&#xD;
      chemical marker crucial for many cellular activities, can predict the clinical response to&#xD;
      preventive therapy in migraine patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroimaging Functional imaging studies have revolutionized this area and provided unique&#xD;
      neuroanatomical and functional insights into migraine machinery. Functional imaging has&#xD;
      revealed that the pathophysiology of migraine crucially involves&#xD;
      hypothalamo-thalamo-brainstem networks. Pharmacological imaging has begun to shed light on&#xD;
      how medications may enfold their effect in migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of structural and functional imaging parameters with and without external&#xD;
      input will give us the unique opportunity to characterize patients who respond to&#xD;
      CGRP_targeting antibodies against those who do not. These data will then be an additional&#xD;
      powerful source for informing animal projects and also machine learning algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching and main objective of this proposal is the identification of predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers of response to treatment with CGRP-targeted mAbs in chronic migraine, the most&#xD;
      severe and disabling form of migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening will be performed at visit 1 (month 0). Patients will sign the informed consent and&#xD;
      will be instructed to fill in a headache diary and will return after 1 month (+2 days) for&#xD;
      visit 2 (V2). At V2, after verification of inclusion/exclusion criteria, enrolled subjects&#xD;
      will fill in the protocol scales (Assessment of disability - monthly MIDAS, Headache Impact&#xD;
      Test 6 (HIT-6) -, depression - Beck Depression Inventory, BDI-II -, anxiety - Beck Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) -, quality of life - MSQ- , subjective cognitive&#xD;
      impairment scale for migraine attacks - Mig-SCog -, comorbidities, acute medications intake,&#xD;
      anxiety and depression - Beck scales - and Emergency Room Use), they will undergo blood&#xD;
      sampling, neuroimaging and they will receive the first treatment administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls will be screened at V1 and, following the verification of the satisfaction&#xD;
      of inclusion/exclusion criteria and the signature of the informed consent, will fill in the&#xD;
      protocol scale, they will undergo blood sampling and neuroimaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose (defined according to the indication approved by the Local Health Authorities)&#xD;
      of the CGRP-targeting monoclonal antibody will be administered during the hospital visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive 2 additional doses of the drug and a training on the modality of&#xD;
      self-injection and specific indication of the day they will perform the self-injection. They&#xD;
      will also receive the headache diary and associated instructions for filling it in regularly&#xD;
      during the following 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No drug treatment is foreseen for healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No concomitant migraine preventive treatment will be allowed during the screening, baseline&#xD;
      and the 3-month treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abortive medications will be allowed, but the type and formulation should be kept stable&#xD;
      during the study. Data about their doses and frequencies will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A remote visit will be scheduled 30 (week 4) and 60 (week 8) days after day 1 to monitor&#xD;
      patient's health status, remind the treatment schedule and collect the data from the headache&#xD;
      diaries (visit 3 and 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 5 (week 12), all migraine subjects will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of disability (MIDAS, HIT-6), work impairment (WPAI scale), evaluation of&#xD;
           acute medications intake, anxiety and depression, quality of life (MSQ), Emergency Room&#xD;
           Use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of treatment efficacy through the headache diaries (migraine days/month)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of treatment satisfaction with validated patient reported outcomes (PROs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excellent responders and non-responders will also undergo neuroimaging evaluation: 3Tesla&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) involving Structural (sMRI) resting state MRI (rsMRI),&#xD;
      Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI).&#xD;
