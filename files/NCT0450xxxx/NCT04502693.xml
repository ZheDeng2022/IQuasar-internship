      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 doses or 3 doses of GSK's&#xD;
      licenced meningococcal group B Bexsero (rMenB+OMV NZ) vaccine and of 2 doses of GSK's&#xD;
      investigational combined meningococcal (MenABCWY) vaccine (GSK3536819A) in healthy&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults. The immunogenicity and safety will also be evaluated in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      As per the feedback from Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) the scope of&#xD;
      this post-marketing commitment study has been extended to demonstrate the effectiveness,&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety of GSK's investigational combined meningococcal ABCWY vaccine along&#xD;
      with the rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine. Note that the rMenB+OMV and MenACWY vaccines provided to&#xD;
      MenB_0_2_6, MenB_0_6 group and MenACWY group respectively at day 211 are only as part of&#xD;
      standard care of treatment and to maintain blinding. These vaccination schedules are not&#xD;
      considered for any endpoint evaluations.&#xD;
