      This project was aimed to test the effects of a six-month VA program on the activities of&#xD;
      daily living (ADL) and functional fitness of institutional older adults with sarcopenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted to test the effects of a six-month VA&#xD;
      program on ADL and functional fitness (lung capacity, body flexibility, range of the joint's&#xD;
      motion, and muscle endurance) of institutional older adults with sarcopenia. Using&#xD;
      convenience sampling, 12 long-term care facilities with 114 older adults were recruited, and&#xD;
      then cluster-randomized by the facility to a VA experimental or a control group. The&#xD;
      experimental group received the VA program led by certified instructors 3 times per week and&#xD;
      40 minutes per session for six months; the control group continued with their regular daily&#xD;
      activities. One pre-test and two post-tests, three months apart, were conducted.&#xD;

    <description>The VA program took 40 minutes to complete and included three phases: 1) activating qi and blood (5 movements, 10 minutes): warm-up exercises that allowed the body to accumulate heat and promote flexibility of the joints to loosen up the body, 2) punching meridians (14 movements, 20 minutes): both hands were used to exert a vibrating effect according to the rhythms that stimulate the 14 meridians in the entire body to improve aerobic endurance, and 3) relaxing body and mind (5 movements, 10 minutes): muscle relaxing exercises to rest the body and cease the qi. Participants in the experimental group received the VA program led by the instructors, who were trained and certified by the PI, 3 times per week and 40 minutes per session for 6 months.</description>
