  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to determine whether a high-dose form of non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation is a promising and safe treatment for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an FDA approved treatment for depression. In&#xD;
      studies of TMS for depression and other disorders, individuals have experienced improved&#xD;
      cognitive function. Thus, the current study is testing whether TMS is safe, feasible and&#xD;
      effective in improving cognition in individuals with MCI.&#xD;

    <description>A MagVenture MagPro Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) System will be utilized. All participants will receive open-label treatment for approximately eight, 3-minute sessions of intermittent theta burst rTMS on each of three days within an eight-day span. A single session = 600 pulses at 120% rMT, intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) triplets at 50 Hz for 2 seconds and repeated every 10 seconds for a total of 190 s to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Total pulses = 14,400. To enable adherence and retention, the days do not need to be contiguous. Same day sessions will be separated by 10-15 minutes, but more accounting for participant comfort.</description>

             disorder, or other neurologic disease (e.g. severe brain injury, seizures).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MRI and TMS contraindications (e.g., implants, claustrophobia, conditions/treatments&#xD;
