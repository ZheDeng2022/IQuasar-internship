  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair are at risk of suffering&#xD;
      devastating spinal cord injury (SCI), rendering them with a permanent neurologic deficit,&#xD;
      paraplegia, or paraparesis. Despite huge success over the last several decades with the&#xD;
      introduction of innovative protective maneuvers, such as the use of cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      drains (CSFDs), the rate of these complications remains around 5%. Spinal cord perfusion can&#xD;
      be compromised during aortic surgery and the intrathecal decompression achieved by CSFDs&#xD;
      functions to increase the pressure gradient of blood flow, thereby optimizing spinal cord&#xD;
      perfusion during aortic surgery. There are two methods commonly used to place cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid drains: blind placement and with fluoroscopic guidance. Prior to 2016, CSFDs at UNC&#xD;
      hospital were primarily placed without image guidance. However, hospital policy then&#xD;
      transitioned to having all CSFDs placed using fluoroscopic guidance. To the investigators'&#xD;
      knowledge, there are no reported studies directly comparing clinical outcomes of CSFDs placed&#xD;
      by these methods. Given the increased cost and radiation exposure associated with the use of&#xD;
      fluoroscopy, a better understanding of comparative outcomes has great potential clinical&#xD;
      value. Therefore, the investigators propose to compare the rate and severity of complications&#xD;
      associated with CSFD placement either with or without fluoroscopic guidance.&#xD;
