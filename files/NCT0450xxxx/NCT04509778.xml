  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will use the collected clinical and biological information of high-risk groups,&#xD;
      use embedded computer chips, and use big data background analysis system to comprehensively&#xD;
      evaluate the risk of high-risk groups, and build a mental illness risk estimator completely&#xD;
      relying on the sample data of Chinese population and with independent intellectual property&#xD;
      rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculator function and the risk calculation standard verified by the model can obtain&#xD;
      the risk degree of each patient's progress to psychosis in the next two years. This&#xD;
      calculator will play an important role in the prevention and treatment of psychosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe mental disorders, mainly schizophrenia (SZ), affect 16 million Chinese population. At&#xD;
      present, due to the lack of effective techniques and standards for early risk identification,&#xD;
      the intervention opportunity for prevention and optimal efficacy is often missed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous cohort studies , it has been found that this clinical high-risk(CHR) population&#xD;
      can be effectively identified before its onset. Since 2011, the project team has been relying&#xD;
      on the ShangHai At Risk for Psychosis Program, 300 CHRs were enrolled in the clinic through&#xD;
      screening and diagnostic interview. The baseline clinical and event-related EEG indicators of&#xD;
      this cohort were collected. The cohort was followed up for 2 years, with a follow-up&#xD;
      completion rate of nearly 90%, it was found that the clinical outcome of high-risk groups was&#xD;
      nearly one third, and the proportion of patients would be converted to schizophrenia within 2&#xD;
      years. This conversion rate is very consistent with the results of cohort studies of other&#xD;
      large high-risk groups in the world. In view of this conversion ratio, many countries, such&#xD;
      as the United States, have begun to use the baseline information to build prediction models,&#xD;
      so as to form a psychiatric prediction tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 5 years of accumulation, the project team has sufficient data to build a psychosis risk&#xD;
      prediction model suitable for Chinese people, truly realize the goal of early diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment, and further support with the integration of key identification technologies and&#xD;
      big data calculation.&#xD;

    <description>It will be determined using the criteria for the Presence of Psychotic Symptoms from SIPS. Specifically, the conversion will be defined by the presence of level 6 positive symptoms (the rating &quot;6&quot; refers to severe and psychotic symptoms) identified as either dangerous, disorganised, or occurring at least one hour a day on average, over four days a week for at least 16 hours.</description>

    <description>It will be determined by GAF score. Specifically, poor function outcome is defined as the GAF score of less than 60 at the follow-up point.</description>
