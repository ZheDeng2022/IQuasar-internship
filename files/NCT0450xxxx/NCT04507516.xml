  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to investigate the effect of water-only fasting and refeeding on&#xD;
      the homeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), a measure of insulin resistance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and a major public health burden. Data suggests&#xD;
      that insulin resistance is a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, and that dietary and lifestyle intervention can reduce insulin resistance as&#xD;
      well as these disease risks. Nonetheless, current intervention strategies have done little to&#xD;
      reduce overall stroke incidence. Therefore, an intervention, such as prolonged medically&#xD;
      supervised water-only fasting, might be an effective strategy to both reduce insulin&#xD;
      resistance and encourage dietary and lifestyle changes that reduce incidence of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is designed to investigate the effect of water-only fasting and refeeding on&#xD;
      the homeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), a measure of insulin resistance.&#xD;
      Additionally, the study will assess if markers of cardiovascular health and inflammation&#xD;
      change before and after water-only fasting. Water-only fasting participants will be recruited&#xD;
      from patients who voluntarily elect to water-only fast for 10 or more consecutive days.&#xD;
      Clinical variables and blood will be collected at baseline, every 7th day during fasting and&#xD;
      refeeding, and the final day of fasting and refeeding.&#xD;
