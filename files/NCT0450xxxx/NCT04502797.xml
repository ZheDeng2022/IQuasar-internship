  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, non-blinded, phase 0/I study will assess the feasibility of conducting a&#xD;
      large randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the ePVA to improve pain&#xD;
      management and HRQoL in HNC. Thirty participants undergoing radiation therapy (RT) (with or&#xD;
      without chemotherapy) will be randomized to: 1) ePVA intervention or 2) usual care. The&#xD;
      intervention consists of participants completing the ePVA every other week during radiation&#xD;
      therapy (RT), then weeks 4, 12, and 24 after end of RT. Automated reports of ePVA data,&#xD;
      including pain reports and patient-reports of pain medications, will be sent to providers to&#xD;
      inform their clinical decisions.&#xD;

    <description>The ePVA is an mHealth clinical support tool. The ePVA consists of a patient-reported measure that focuses on symptoms common to HNC (i.e. pain, eye, ear, nasal, mouth, voice, fibrosis, edema, skin, gastrointestinal, fatigue, limitation in movement, sleep, breathing, difficulty eating or drinking, swallowing, communication, social activities, anxiety, depression, and daily activities). PROMISÂ® questionnaires (pain intensity 3a, fatigue 6a, sleep disturbance 6a, anxiety 6a, depression 6a) are embedded within the ePVA.</description>
