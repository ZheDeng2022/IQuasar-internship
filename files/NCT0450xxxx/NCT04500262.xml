  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare performance and safety of a newly developed 14-gauge&#xD;
      open-tip pulsed biopsy needle with a conventional 14-gauge core biopsy needle for sampling of&#xD;
      radiologically indeterminate or suspicious axillary lymph nodes in women with radiologically&#xD;
      suspected breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Sponsor-initiated multicentre randomised trial. At the time of radiological breast&#xD;
      cancer diagnosis women with ultrasonically abnormal lymph nodes undergo axillary sampling&#xD;
      using the NeoNavia biopsy system or a common CNB device. This is in accordance with clinical&#xD;
      routine and current clinical guidelines. The NeoNavia biopsy system is approved for use in&#xD;
      the axillary lymph nodes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is the standard of care in the United Kingdom for women with suspected or confirmed breast&#xD;
      cancer to undergo ultrasound of the ipsilateral axilla prior to surgery in order to detect&#xD;
      nodal metastatic disease. Women with invasive breast cancer and normal axillary ultrasound&#xD;
      will then undergo operative sentinel lymph node biopsy. This is usually at the same time as&#xD;
      the surgical removal of the breast cancer by wide local excision or mastectomy but may be&#xD;
      done as a separate procedure before (e.g. where neoadjuvant chemotherapy is planned) or after&#xD;
      (e.g. if a non-operative diagnosis of invasive breast cancer was not made prior to surgery).&#xD;
      Women who are found to have a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (i.e. have axillary&#xD;
      metastatic disease) normally undergo axillary node clearance (ANC) at a subsequent operation.&#xD;
      This policy may change in the future, as evidence from the American Z0011 study suggests that&#xD;
      women with low volume axillary metastatic disease do as well with no further axillary surgery&#xD;
      plus standard adjuvant treatment as those that undergo ANC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who have abnormal lymph nodes on axillary ultrasound undergo tissue sampling with core&#xD;
      needle biopsy (CNB), usually 14 Gauge (14G) under local anaesthetic or with fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration cytology (FNAC). Women with proven axillary nodal metastases will then usually&#xD;
      undergo axillary node clearance at the same operation as surgical removal of the primary&#xD;
      tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of women who need to undergo more than one operation can therefore be minimised by&#xD;
      maximising the number of women with axillary metastatic disease in whom this diagnosis is&#xD;
      made preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meta-analyses of published studies and more recent studies suggest that ultrasound has a&#xD;
      sensitivity of ~60% and specificity of ~80% for the detection of metastatic lymph nodes.&#xD;
      Although no randomised comparisons of 14G core needle biopsy (CNB) and FNAC have been&#xD;
      performed, several studies have suggested that CNB is more accurate. Ultrasound-guided biopsy&#xD;
      of nodes subsequently proven at surgery to contain metastases has a sensitivity of ~80% and a&#xD;
      specificity of 100% and is more likely to be positive in those women with a higher nodal&#xD;
      burden. Numerous studies suggest that increasing the volume of tissue removed may increase&#xD;
      the diagnostic yield.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently a new biopsy device indicated for the use in breast and axillary lymph nodes&#xD;
      (NeoNavia biopsy system, NeoDynamics, Sweden) has become available. It incorporates a&#xD;
      pneumatic needle insertion mechanism that is intended to provide better control of needle&#xD;
      progression and enable stepwise insertion without noticeable deformation or displacement of&#xD;
      surrounding tissue as visualized under ultrasound. Furthermore a new method of tissue&#xD;
      acquisition is employed that has pre-clinically shown a significantly higher sampling yield&#xD;
      compared to CNB. These characteristics indicate that the device could be well suited for&#xD;
      axillary lymph node biopsies. Initial clinical results indicate that in axillary lesions&#xD;
      deemed &quot;technically difficult&quot;, i.e. where prior US-guided biopsies with CNB or FNA had&#xD;
      yielded non-diagnostic histology results, the NeoNavia device performed successfully, thereby&#xD;
      significantly altering clinical management.&#xD;
