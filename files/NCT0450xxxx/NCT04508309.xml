  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This planned randomized controlled trial will evaluate a bivalent HPV vaccine, Cecolin®, in&#xD;
      alternate 2-dose regimens, compared to an established HPV vaccine. Gardasil® used as the&#xD;
      comparator vaccine, as this vaccine is most widely used in low- and low-middle income&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, active-comparator controlled, open-label study will enroll total of&#xD;
      approximately 1025 girls aged 9 to 14 years, in one country in Africa (Ghana) and one country&#xD;
      in South/Southeast Asia (Bangladesh). Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive&#xD;
      Cecolin® at 0 and 6 months, 0 and 12 months, or 0 and 24 months, Gardasil® at 0 and 6 months,&#xD;
      or Gardasil® at 0 months and Cecolin® at 24 months. For each arm, blood will be collected for&#xD;
      immunologic testing at baseline and one month following second dose. Additional blood&#xD;
      collections will occur immediately prior to the administration of the second dose, as well as&#xD;
      at additional later time points, for immunobridging to other published and ongoing trials.&#xD;
      The study also aims to evaluate the performance of a mixed arm (group 5) of Gardasil®&#xD;
      followed by Cecolin® and collect data on effects of interchangeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Girls of target age will be identified, and their parents contacted to attend an&#xD;
      informational session for individual discussion, informed consent, assent and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted by the research groups in icddr,b in Bangladesh and Malaria&#xD;
      Research Center (MRC) in Ghana.&#xD;
