      This project will compare the effectiveness of an HIV-specific comprehensive wellness&#xD;
      intervention designed to have broad appeal to smokers living with HIV to the effectiveness of&#xD;
      standard care services that include referral to the National VA Quitline and SmokefreeVET&#xD;
      texting program. Participants in both arms will have access to pharmacotherapy available&#xD;
      through their Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare providers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death and illness in our society, and&#xD;
      smoking rates are disproportionately high among people living with HIV. NCI, nicotine&#xD;
      dependence researchers, and HIV clinicians have all called for research to evaluate targeted&#xD;
      and tailored smoking cessation programs for smokers living with HIV (SLWH). Research suggests&#xD;
      SLWH are largely unaware of the HIV-specific deleterious effects of smoking and often lack&#xD;
      motivation and confidence in their ability to quit. For these reasons, we developed the&#xD;
      Wellness Intervention for Smokers with HIV (WISH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to standard care cessation services available to Veterans, WISH is delivered remotely&#xD;
      by mobile phone (voice and text message). The program is designed for all SLWH, regardless of&#xD;
      their initial motivation to quit. WISH follows evidence-based, best practice guidelines for&#xD;
      nicotine dependence treatment, but is innovative in its use of a more comprehensive wellness&#xD;
      approach. That is, the intervention addresses both smoking and a number of other personally&#xD;
      relevant health behaviors (such as treatment engagement, medication adherence, stress and&#xD;
      mood management, social support, alcohol use, etc.), making it relevant and engaging to all&#xD;
      SLWH, not just those ready to stop smoking. For those not yet ready to quit, WISH is designed&#xD;
      to build and strengthen motivation and self-confidence for quitting, while smokers also work&#xD;
      on other personal health goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once ready to quit smoking, participants receive evidence-based cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      counseling and encouragement to access nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or other&#xD;
      appropriate pharmacotherapy through usual care VA procedures. Medications will not be&#xD;
      prescribed or dispensed by the study, allowing use of these standard services to be compared&#xD;
      across study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this two-group randomized trial, we will compare the effectiveness of WISH to standard&#xD;
      care services offered through the National VA Quitline and the SmokefreeVET texting program&#xD;
      (tobacco cessation services available to all Veterans). Participants in both study groups can&#xD;
      receive phone/ text counseling and have access to pharmacotherapy through VA. Cessation&#xD;
      services in both study groups will be provided and overseen by the non-VA sites that&#xD;
      developed each program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking-related outcomes will include 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence and presence&#xD;
      of any 24-hour intentional quit attempts, prolonged abstinence, and change in cigarettes per&#xD;
      day. We will measure change in smoking-related knowledge, motivation and behavioral skills,&#xD;
      as well as intervention reach and implementation. We will also describe comorbidities and&#xD;
      explore intervention impact on markers of immune status and mortality risk using clinical&#xD;
      data resources available through the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If effective, WISH could meaningfully increase the reach of cessation services and reduce&#xD;
      smoking among HIV+ Veterans nationwide. To support this goal, dissemination efforts are&#xD;
      planned in Year 5 to share the WISH program with the National VA Quitline. Because VA is the&#xD;
      largest U.S. provider of HIV care, this research has the potential for significant public&#xD;
      health impact.&#xD;
