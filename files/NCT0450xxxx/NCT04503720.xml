    <textblock>
      Major abdominal surgery is associated with significant complications which may lead to&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Pain experienced after surgery affects the recovery from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to evaluate the current gold standard of PCA morphine infusion against a&#xD;
      continuous wound infusion (CLoWI). The use of CLoWI negates the side-effects of opioids, and&#xD;
      will be the first randomised controlled trial to compare PCA (Morphine) with CLoWI-LA&#xD;
      (Ropivacaine).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Major intra-abdominal surgery represents one of the commonest groups of surgical procedures&#xD;
      performed both worldwide and within Singapore. Common general surgical conditions requiring&#xD;
      major intra-abdominal surgery include intestinal pathologies such as cancer, ischaemia,&#xD;
      infection, haemorrhage and perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major surgery within the abdominal cavity is associated with significant complications which&#xD;
      may be life threatening with an associated hospital mortality rate of as high as 20% for&#xD;
      emergency surgery. Importantly, the recovery from this type of major surgery often entails&#xD;
      significant pain and discomfort for the patient during healing of the abdominal wound and&#xD;
      internal organs from tissue trauma associated with these surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent developments in major intra-abdominal surgery have demonstrated the importance of the&#xD;
      early surgical recovery period where common postoperative complications including pain, chest&#xD;
      infection, intestinal ileus and delerium are not only associated with prolonged hospital stay&#xD;
      but are harbingers of poor long term surgical outcomes. Current recommendations for&#xD;
      perioperative management of patients undergoing major intra-abdominal surgery stress the&#xD;
      importance of high quality perioperative care to minimise these sequelae. Key features of&#xD;
      these recommendations are to provide a pain free postoperative surgical recovery with minimal&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting to facilitate early mobilisation and functional recovery from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with opioids is the first line analgesia therapy currently&#xD;
      used in the immediate post-operative period following major abdominal surgery. PCA with&#xD;
      opioids has some inherent disadvantages that include side-effects of opioids such as nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, prolonged ileus, dizziness, hallucination and respiratory depression with the need&#xD;
      for supplementary oxygen. This is most pertinent in elderly patients who are more prone to&#xD;
      these side-effects in addition to being more likely to have difficulties in understanding how&#xD;
      to use the PCA and so are more vulnerable to inadequate pain control. Consequently, there may&#xD;
      be a delay in resuming mobility and discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous local wound infusion (CLoWI) with Ropivacaine that is delivered into the&#xD;
      extraperitoneal plane via an ON-Q® (Halyard) infusion pump has been shown to be an effective&#xD;
      analgesia post-operatively. The use of CLoWI negates the side-effects of opioids and&#xD;
      furthermore, the small portable pump allows early ambulation with no requirement for&#xD;
      supplementary oxygen. Previous published research has demonstrated the benefits of continuous&#xD;
      local wound infusion with local anaesthesia in terms of postoperative analgesia and surgical&#xD;
      recovery However, there are no randomized controlled trials comparing PCA versus continuous&#xD;
      local wound infusion alone; this study will be the first randomised controlled trial to&#xD;
      compare PCA (Morphine) with CLoWI-LA (Ropivacaine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local anaesthetic drug to be used for the wound infiltration system is Ropivacaine. Its&#xD;
      mechanism of action involves inhibiting sodium influx through sodium-specific ion channels in&#xD;
      the peripheral nerve axonal cell membrane, in particular, the voltage gated sodium channels.&#xD;
      When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and the conduction&#xD;
      of a pain signal is inhibited. The local anaesthetic will be administered via 2 catheters&#xD;
      that will be placed under direct vision by the surgeon at the time of wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ropivacaine 0.5% will be infused at a rate of 4mls/hour (2mls/hour in each catheter) for a&#xD;
      total of 4 days. It is currently in clinical use within our hospital as a routine method of&#xD;
      providing postoperative analgesia following major abdominal surgery.&#xD;
