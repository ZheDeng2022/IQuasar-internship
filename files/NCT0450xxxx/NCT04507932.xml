  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      68Ga-FAPI has been developed as a tumor-targeting agent as fibroblast activation protein is&#xD;
      overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts and some inflammation,such as inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease. And it might be more sensitive than FDG in detecting a certain type of&#xD;
      inflammations according to our preliminary research. Thus this prospective study is going to&#xD;
      investigate whether 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT may be superior for diagnosis, therapy response&#xD;
      assessment and follow-up of inflammatory bowel disease than 18F-FDG PET/CT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is comprised of two major disorders: ulcerative colitis (UC)&#xD;
      and Crohn's disease(CD).CD is an autoimmune condition resulting in chronic gut inflammation&#xD;
      that can be complicated by intestinal fibrosis and stricture formation. Ulcerative colitis is&#xD;
      characterized by recurring episodes of inflammation limited to the mucosal layer of the&#xD;
      colon. It commonly involves the rectum and may extend in a proximal and continuous fashion to&#xD;
      involve other parts of the colon. Studies identified FAP to be overexpressed in uninflamed&#xD;
      strictures compared with nonstrictured colonic regions in biopsies taken from Crohn's disease&#xD;
      patients. But preliminary studies showed FAP was not overexpressed in colonic biopsies taken&#xD;
      from healthy individuals or individuals with ulcerative colitis.68Ga-FAPI has been developed&#xD;
      as a tumor-targeting agent as fibroblast activation protein is overexpressed in&#xD;
      cancer-associated fibroblasts and inflammation. Recently we have published an article of the&#xD;
      application of 68Ga-FAPI in IgG4-related disease which showed it was more sensitive than FDG&#xD;
      in detecting a certain type of inflammations. Thus this prospective study is going to&#xD;
      investigate whether 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT may be superior for diagnosis, therapy response&#xD;
      assessment and follow-up of IBD than 18F-FDG PET/CT.&#xD;
