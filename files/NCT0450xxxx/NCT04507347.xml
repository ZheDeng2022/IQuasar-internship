    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a randomized, multi-centre, double-blind, parallel-group,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study in patients receiving SoC therapy. Eligible participants will be&#xD;
      randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either test product, TRC041266 1500 mg or matching&#xD;
      placebo twice daily for 48 weeks&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HFpEF is associated with high morbidity and mortality and the prevalence is on the rise&#xD;
      globally. Diabetics are at increased risk of developing HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no evidence based therapy to improve the disease condition and its associated&#xD;
      functional incapacity. Some of the recently concluded trials, PARAGON-HF, EMPERIAL-PRESERVED,&#xD;
      failed to demonstrate benefit and it is regarded as an area with high unmet need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 results have demonstrated that in diabetic patients with heart failure having LVEF&#xD;
      &gt;30% and receiving guideline-indicated therapy with RAS inhibitors and β-blockers, TRC4186&#xD;
      has the potential to improve worsening of heart failure, functional status, cardiac diastolic&#xD;
      function and has no adverse effect on cardiac mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, TRC041266, the decanoic acid co-crystal of TRC4186 is an innovative product for&#xD;
      the management of heart failure with LVEF≥40% in diabetic patients which is expected to&#xD;
      modify the underlying disease at multiple levels and confer benefit as add-on to standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current phase 3 study has been planned based on the results of the phase 2 trial which&#xD;
      demonstrated that the TRC4186 2000 mg/day (in two divided doses; BD) administered orally for&#xD;
      48 weeks resulted in significant improvement in QoL measured by PD-MLHFQ, diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction measured by E/e' and reduction in HF hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose level to be used in the present study is based on the assessment of safety, efficacy&#xD;
      and PK data obtained from phase 1 and 2 studies. In the phase 2 study, a dose response was&#xD;
      observed with a trend towards improvement at 500 mg/day dose of TRC4186, and clinically and&#xD;
      statistically significant improvement was seen at 2000 mg/day (1000 mg BD). There was&#xD;
      plateauing of the response beyond the dose of 2000 mg/day. Hence, the choice of optimal dose&#xD;
      of TRC4186 being considered is lower than 2000 mg/day and in between 500 and 2000 mg/day,&#xD;
      i.e., 1500 mg/day (750 mg BD). The total daily dose of TRC041266 which would be equivalent to&#xD;
      1500 mg/day of TRC4186, is TRC041266 3000 mg/day, to be administered in two divided&#xD;
      doses,i.e., 1500 mg BD.&#xD;
