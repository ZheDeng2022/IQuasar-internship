  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates under controlled conditions the variation of poorly ventilated lung&#xD;
      units (silent spaces) in children between 1 and 6 years of age measured by electrical&#xD;
      impedance tomography during intravenous anaesthesia in a day-hospital setting and before&#xD;
      discharge to help further raise safety standards in paediatric anaesthesia&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible, children, with parental written informed consent, scheduled for a cerebral magnetic&#xD;
      resonance image (MRI) will receive an intravenous anaesthesia using a Propofol infusion of 10&#xD;
      mg/kg/h. At the Bern Children's Hospital all children will be premedicated with Midazolam&#xD;
      rectal/oral 0.5 mg/kg or Dexmedetomidine nasal 2 mcg/kg 20 minutes before the beginning of&#xD;
      the procedure Eligible children will be prepared for procedure according to the local SOPs of&#xD;
      the paediatric anaesthesia departments. Mandatory monitoring will consist of: SpO2, HR, NIBP.&#xD;
      An iv-line for drugs injection will be placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction of anaesthesia: after iv-line placement a bolus of Propofol of 2 mg/kg followed by&#xD;
      a continuous infusion of 10 mg/kg/h will be applied. Administration of low-flow oxygen for&#xD;
      all children (0.3 l/kg/min) via Microstream® Smart CapnoLine® paediatric cannula (Philips&#xD;
      Healthcare, Amsterdam, Netherlands). This cannula allows to measure the etCO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of extremely agitated child an inhalative induction may be performed. This technique&#xD;
      represent the actual standard of care and is not associated with increased risks because of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before induction of the anaesthesia, before the radiological procedure when the induction is&#xD;
      terminated, after the termination of the radiological procedure, before transport to the Post&#xD;
      anaesthesia Care Unite (PACU), and before the discharge from the PACU after 2 hours of&#xD;
      monitoring ventilation distribution changes by thoracic electrical impedance tomography are&#xD;
      measured (each measurement will last 1 min).&#xD;

    <description>Before induction of the anaesthesia, before the radiological procedure when the induction is terminated, after the termination of the radiological procedure, before transport to the Post anaesthesia Care Unite (PACU), and before the discharge from the PACU after 2 hours of monitoring ventilation distribution changes by thoracic electrical impedance tomography are measured (each measurement will last 1 min). For this, resulting potential differences are measured, and impedance distribution sampled at 30 Hz will be calculated by an automated linearized Newton-Raphson reconstruction algorithm (9). Relative change in poorly ventilated lung regions (silent spaces) and end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI) and measures of ventilation inhomogeneity such as the global inhomogeneity index will be calculated as described previously, using customised software (Matlab R2013a, The MathWorks, Nattick, Massachusetts, USA)(10-12).</description>
