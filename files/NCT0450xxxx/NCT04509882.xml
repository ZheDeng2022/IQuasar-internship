    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study&#xD;
      of bear bile pill, as add-on therapy in MDD patients conducted in Shang Hai Mental Health&#xD;
      Center. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of bear bile pill&#xD;
      in reducing symptoms of depression in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)patients with inadequate&#xD;
