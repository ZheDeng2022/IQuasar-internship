The KSPD is a validated neurodevelopmental outcome assessment that is standardized for Japanese children and has been evaluated in comparison to BSID in the assessment of developmental characteristics of very low birth weight Japanese infants. The KSPD is designed to measure a young child's skills in three domains of development: Cognitive-Adaptive (non-verbal reasoning or visuospatial perception), Language-Social (interpersonal relationships, socialization, verbal abilities), and Postural-Motor (fine and gross motor functions). The scale consists of 328 items covering a Cognitive-Adaptive area, Language-Social area, and Postural-Motor area. For each of the three areas, a sum score is converted to a Developmental Quotient (dividing the developmental age by the chronological age and then multiplying the quotient by 100). A positive value indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Gross Motor Function Assessed by Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 24 and 60 months CA</time_frame>
    <description>The GMFM-88 item scores is used to calculate a domain-specific percent score for each of the 5 GMFM-88 dimensions, which are the following: Lying and rolling; Sitting; Crawling and kneeling; Standing; Walking, running, and jumping. Each of the 88 items is rated on a 4-point scale: 0=does not initiate; 1=initiates; 2=partially completes; and 3=completes. The GMFM-88 total scores range from 0% (no mobility) to a score of 100%. The test is considered to be appropriate for children whose motor skills are at or below those of a 5-year-old child without any motor disability. The GMFM-88 will be administered at 24 months CA. GMFM-88 Sections D (Standing) and E (Walking, Running and Jumping) only will be administered at 5 years CA.</description>

Each item is scored from a range of 0 (reflecting no symptoms) to 3 (reflecting severe symptoms) with total scores ranging from 0-54. The 18 items are grouped into 2 subscales: hyperactivity-impulsivity (even numbered items 2-18) and inattention (&quot;inattentiveness&quot;) (odd numbered items 1-17).</description>

The HUI 2/3 system contains a number of attributes/domains to classify the level of health status. Each attribute or domain (eg, mobility, cognition, emotion or pain) is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale to indicate the severity level, ranging from 1-5 (higher numbers indicating a more severe level).</description>
