  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, PK,&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity, and pharmacodynamic effects of SL-172154 administered by intratumoral&#xD;
      injection in subjects with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) or squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity and pharmacodynamic effects of SL-172154 when administered as an intratumoral&#xD;
      injection (ITI) and identify the dose and schedule i.e., recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for&#xD;
      future development. Eligible subjects must have unresectable or recurrent, locally advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or head and neck, that is not amenable to&#xD;
      curative surgery or radiotherapy. The study design consists of four sequential&#xD;
      dose-escalation cohorts and an optional pharmacodynamic cohort to obtain additional&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic data at one or more dose levels that have completed evaluation for safety&#xD;
      without exceeding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
