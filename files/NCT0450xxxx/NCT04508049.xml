  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether or not an MRI technique (quantitative&#xD;
      magnetization transfer or qMT) in narrowing human kidneys is feasible, reproducible, and&#xD;
      predicts recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal fibrosis is a final pathway and important biomarker of injury common to most forms of&#xD;
      kidney disease. For example, in renal vascular disease (RVD) progressive renal fibrosis may&#xD;
      induce kidney injury and hypertension. Early identification of fibrosis and adequate&#xD;
      intervention may slow down renal disease progression, but adequate noninvasive strategies to&#xD;
      detect and quantify renal fibrosis are yet to be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a novel noninvasive&#xD;
      method to evaluate the tissue macromolecular composition. The investigators have demonstrated&#xD;
      that MTI can assess stenotic kidney fibrosis in murine and swine models of unilateral RVD.&#xD;
      However, the clinical utility of MT-MRI to assess renal fibrosis is currently limited,&#xD;
      because it is inherently semi-quantitative. In contrast, quantitative MT (qMT), based on&#xD;
      biophysical compartment models, provides more objective measurement of tissue MT properties.&#xD;
      A model fitting of MR signal acquired with various MT pulse amplitudes and offset&#xD;
      frequencies, combined with scan-specific B0/B1/T1 maps, give rise to a more complete&#xD;
      definition of tissue parameters, including a &quot;bound pool fraction&quot;, a direct measure of the&#xD;
      macromolecular content in tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis underlying this proposal is that qMT would reliably detect development of&#xD;
      renal fibrosis at both 1.5 T and 3.0 T in subjects with RVD. To test this hypothesis, which&#xD;
      is supported by strong preliminary data, the investigators will initially develop, optimize,&#xD;
      and validate qMT for evaluation of fibrosis in the post-stenotic swine kidney. The&#xD;
      investigators will correlate qMT-derived renal fibrosis with reference standards, as well as&#xD;
      with single-kidney hemodynamics, function, and oxygenation, quantified using cutting-edge&#xD;
      multi-detector CT (MDCT) and MRI techniques. The investigators will then determine the&#xD;
      ability of qMT to predict renal recovery in pigs with RVD undergoing revascularization.&#xD;
      Further, they will perform a pilot study to test the ability of qMT to quantify fibrosis in&#xD;
      the post-stenotic human kidney, in comparison to innovative biomarkers of renal dysfunction&#xD;
      and tissue damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three specific aims will test the hypotheses: Specific Aim 1: qMT in stenotic swine kidneys&#xD;
      is feasible, reliable, and reproducible at 1.5 and 3.0 T. Specific Aim 2: qMT predicts renal&#xD;
      recovery potential in response to percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA).&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: qMT in stenotic human kidneys is feasible, reproducible, and predicts&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed studies may therefore establish a reliable, noninvasive, and clinically feasible&#xD;
      strategy to quantify kidney fibrosis, a key biomarker for renal outcomes and therapeutic&#xD;
      success.&#xD;
