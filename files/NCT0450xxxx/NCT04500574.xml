      In this research study, we will assess the safety, tolerability, comfort, and feasibility of&#xD;
      lowering intraocular pressure using a novel Contact Lens Drug Delivery System with&#xD;
      latanoprost. Latanoprost is a well-studied medication and has been used to treat glaucoma for&#xD;
      decades. Currently, latanoprost is FDA-approved to be administered to patients as eye drops,&#xD;
      but using eye drops has challenges (having to remember to take the drop, getting the drop in&#xD;
      the eye). This clinical trial is being done to determine the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      effectiveness of using latanoprost to deliver latanoprost in a new way (through a&#xD;
      drug-eluting contact lens).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes two phases. Phase A is intended to assess safety and tolerability and&#xD;
      Phase B to assess safety and effectiveness.&#xD;

      In Phase A of this study, five subjects will wear the latanoprost-eluting contact lens (L-CL)&#xD;
      for one week. Phase A is designed to assess for safety and tolerability. In Phase B of this&#xD;
      research study, we will compare the L-CL to placebo. Patients will be randomized to one of 2&#xD;
      groups. Subjects in Group 1 will receive the contact lens with latanoprost in it (latanoprost&#xD;
      contact lens, or &quot;L-CL&quot;) and placebo eye drops. Subjects in Group 2 will receive a standard,&#xD;
      commercial contact lens (or &quot;C-CL) that contains no latanoprost but will be given latanoprost&#xD;
      eye drops. The placebo contact lens (C-CL) is highly similar to the latanoprost-eluting&#xD;
      contact lens but contains no latanoprost. The placebo eye drops look just like latanoprost&#xD;
      eye drops but contain no latanoprost.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single-center study to assess the safety and feasibility of delivering latanoprost using the latanoprost contact lens (L-CL) delivery system as a treatment for glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The study has two phases. Phase A is an open-label study with 5 participants; these individuals will wear the L-CL in one eye for one week during which time they will be closely followed with examinations for evaluation of safety. If the L-CL is found to be safe after review of the clinical data by a data and safety monitoring board, phase B will be initiated to assess the safety and effectiveness of delivering latanoprost through the L-CL. This is a double-masked double-dummy study. The L-CL arm will have the drug-eluting latanoprost contact lens (L-CL) and a sham drop, and the latanoprost arm will have a C-CL (no drug) with a nightly 0.005% latanoprost drop.</intervention_model_description>
