  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, involves the implementation and evaluation of a Monday-focused, individually&#xD;
      tailored mobile health application to assist overweight or obese adults who would like to&#xD;
      achieve a healthful weight. The goal was to evaluate the application of a Monday-focused&#xD;
      delivery system for the M-TRIMM2 intervention on participants who worked or lived in areas in&#xD;
      or adjacent to Johns Hopkins East Baltimore medical campus.Targeting mobile messaging&#xD;
      occurred at strategic intervals throughout each week, with the intent of prompting&#xD;
      participants to renew their health resolutions each Monday combined with lifestyle behavioral&#xD;
      education.&#xD;

      The specific aims of this research project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop a targeted delivery system for mobile health messages which focused on improving&#xD;
           physical activity and diet, and setting healthy resolutions each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Deliver the M-TRIMM intervention, which encourages healthy behavior and the weekly&#xD;
           renewal of health resolutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on individuals' weight loss,&#xD;
           self-efficacy, and motivation to sustain changes in lifestyle behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the benefit of receiving the message content only (in a paper document), versus a&#xD;
           scheduled weekly delivery via mobile messaging.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants were randomized after they completed the study's baseline assessment. The randomization sequence was designed to balance treatment groups by gender of the participants. Allocation was concealed from the data collectors, and was determined using a randomization module in REDCap, a survey website. The data collectors were not blinded to the randomization results after the completion of the baseline survey.</masking_description>

    <measure>Comparison of satisfaction with the program and suggestions for improvement between intervention and control groups</measure>
    <time_frame>~16 weeks, and ~42 weeks post-randomization compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed a questionnaire that included quantitative and qualitative questions.&#xD;
Most of the qualitative questions sought to assess what parts of the program worked well and what could have been done better. For instance, participants were asked for their suggestions about what could be done to improve the M-TRIMM2 program, what messages they liked and did not like, and why they would or would not recommend the program to their friends.&#xD;
The quantitative questions covered a variety of topics, including participants engagement with the program (i.e. whether the participants read the messages they received), how useful messages were in helping participants reach the eight study goals (i.e. eating only when hungry, and exercising more), how helpful the goals were helping participants to achieve weight loss, and whether the program helped participants commit to new goals each Monday during the intervention.</description>

    <description>The 16-weeks text-messaging intervention centered around 8 goal topics: eating only when hungry, increasing PA, eating a lower fat diet, eating less sugar and reducing calories from beverages, exercising more, eating a balance diet, portion control, and making healthier food choices in social situations.&#xD;
Messaging&#xD;
Sun evening: asked to pick 1 of 3 goal topics&#xD;
Mon morning: received a goal to focus on for the week&#xD;
Mon evening: asked whether plans were made to reach the goal&#xD;
Wed morning: received a tip to help reach goal&#xD;
Wed evening: reminded that if having cravings, text &quot;tip&quot; to automatically receive a tip&#xD;
Fri morning: received end of the week congratulations, encouragement to keep goals in mind over the weekend&#xD;
Fri evening: asked for weight, congratulated if lost weight, or encouraged if no weight lost</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group, received a printed copy of the same messages that the intervention group received. However, the first eight-weeks' worth of messages and craving tips were given after the baseline assessment, and the rest were given after the first follow-up assessment (~ 8 weeks post randomization).&#xD;
The messages for each week were clearly laid out and labeled. Participants were given spaces to record their answers (i.e. to which goal they were selecting for each week). The study staff reviewed the first week's messages together with the study participants to get the participants comfortable with the format that the printed messages were presented in.</description>
