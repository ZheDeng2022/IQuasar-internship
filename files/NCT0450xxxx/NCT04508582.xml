  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a multi-system vascular disease which affects 2-5% of pregnancies. It is also&#xD;
      a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease later in life and a number of&#xD;
      functional and structural cardiac changes have been found in this population of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In mouse models disruption of a group of immune cells, neutrophils, has led to alteration of&#xD;
      the placenta and offspring consistent with those seen in preeclampsia. These mice also have&#xD;
      an abnormal cardiac function and structure (Nadkarni et al 2016). The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesis that this may also occur in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to intimately link the maternal immunological and vascular components of&#xD;
      cardiac dysfunction in women preeclampsia. The investigators hypothesise that in preeclampsia&#xD;
      activated neutrophils may affect maternal immune system thus leading to myocardial injury and&#xD;
      altered cardiac function. The study intends to identify the mechanisms by which the maternal&#xD;
      immune system (focusing on neutrophil and T-cell subsets) affects cardiac function in women&#xD;
      with preeclampsia. Specific aims to be addressed are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To correlate specific neutrophil phenotype(s) and function to cardiac function in&#xD;
      women with preeclampsia during pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To test whether specific activated neutrophil phenotype persists postpartum and&#xD;
      whether this neutrophil phenotype correlates with cardiac function in women with preeclampsia&#xD;
      postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will comprise of 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Normotensive pregnant (~33 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH; New-onset hypertension after 20 weeks without&#xD;
           proteinuria; ~33 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Preeclampsia (~34 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac function will be evaluated using cardiovascular magnetic resonance, echocardiography&#xD;
      and cardiac markers in the blood. The participants immune system will be assessed from blood&#xD;
      samples looking at the immune cells, hormone levels and inflammatory and non-inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary research objective is to investigate whether changes in the immune system and&#xD;
      cardiac function in participants is persistent after delivery. Therefore participants will&#xD;
      have scans and blood tests both antenatally and at 3 months postnatally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By identifying key changes in immune cell type and function with cardiac abnormalities in&#xD;
      women with preeclampsia, data obtained from this study could provide novel insight into how&#xD;
      the maternal immune system influences cardiac changes in normal and preeclamptic pregnancies.&#xD;
      Identifying such links could pave the way for future therapeutic targets.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the clinical observational study is to determine whether the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory immune cell phenotype observed in women with preeclampsia (PE) can be&#xD;
      correlated to cardiac function during and after pregnancy and in the postpartum period .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will comprise of Dr Alice Christensen (PhD candidate), who will consent&#xD;
      patients within the study group and carry out the clinical and laboratory aspects of the&#xD;
      study; Dr Suchita Nadkarni (primary supervisor) who will oversee and train Dr Christensen on&#xD;
      all basic science aspects of the study; Prof Steve Thornton and Dr Elena Greco (clinical&#xD;
      supervisors) who will be the obstetric leads on the study; Consultant cardiologists will&#xD;
      include Dr Neha Sekhri who will be primary contact for any cardiac issues, Dr Anna Herrey ,&#xD;
      who will oversee the analyses of imaging aspect of the study and Dr Kate Von Klemperer who&#xD;
      will liaise with and advise Dr Christensen at both The Royal London and Barts Hospitals&#xD;
      regarding echocardiography (echo). To this end, ~100 pregnant women will be recruited from&#xD;
      The Royal London Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will comprise of 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preeclamptic patients (34 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH; 33 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Healthy pregnant women (33)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normotensive and PIH patients will be matched for gestational age with PE patients.&#xD;
      Echocardiography and non-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) studies will be&#xD;
      carried out in all patients in the study upon enrolment and 3-months post partum, on the&#xD;
      assumption that any physiological cardiovascular changes related to pregnancy will have&#xD;
      resolved by then. Dr Anna Herrey - a leading expert in CMR in pregnant women will over-see&#xD;
      the image analyses in the study. Dr Herrey has recently published a paper outlining the&#xD;
      safety of carrying out CMR in pregnant women and the comparative resolution without the use&#xD;
      of gadolinium contrast (Herrey et al 2019). Cardiac function will be assessed by&#xD;
      echocardiography examination measuring ejection fraction, strain and diastolic function (as&#xD;
      well as pulse wave velocity). Myocardial tissue characteristics will be assessed with&#xD;
      non-contrast CMR (T1 and T2 mapping and full volumetric assessment, the gold standard for LV&#xD;
      function analysis(Bellenger et al 2000 and Grothues et al 2002)). Any patient within the&#xD;
      study group who demonstrates abnormal cardiac changes at 3-months post partum will be&#xD;
      referred to Dr Sekhri for a 6-months follow-up (under NHS care at this time point). All&#xD;
      cardiac scans will be carried out as an outpatient at Barts Hospital except for women with&#xD;
      severe PE where the echocardiography will be carried out at bedside, upon admission to the&#xD;
      ward. Thus, these women will not have CMR studies at enrolment but will be invited to attend&#xD;
      the follow-up at 3 months for CMR and echocardiography studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time- matched blood samples will be taken from patients to assess immune cell phenotypes.&#xD;
      Plasma samples will be collected for the analyses of cardiac specific factors (BNP, troponin)&#xD;
      as well as measurement of steroid hormones (progesterone and oestradiol), and soluble&#xD;
      inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. In order to limit bias within the study, all&#xD;
      CMR image analyses (done by Dr Herrey) will be blinded. Dr Sekhri will be available for&#xD;
      second reporting to assess interobserver variability of the CMR studies. Should any&#xD;
      difference become apparent between early- and late-onset PE (PE which develops before and&#xD;
      after 34 weeks gestation, respectively), sub-groups will be analysed within the PE group.&#xD;
      This initial pilot study will inform power calculations for further studies in early and late&#xD;
      onset disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients recruited to the study, except those with severe PE, will be followed up as&#xD;
      outpatients at The Royal London and will be asked to attend a hospital visit at Barts&#xD;
      Hospital for CMR studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have the option to submit a written request to be withdrawn from the trial&#xD;
      at any stage. Participants will also have the option to withdraw consent from further&#xD;
      participation in which circumstance no further data will be collected for inclusion. In the&#xD;
      unfortunate event that a participant loses capacity, information gathered will continue to be&#xD;
      used but no further data will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also ask participants if they can retain their contact information so&#xD;
      that the investigators may contact them to take part in future research related to to current&#xD;
      study. This request will be asked on the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Definition&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the study will be defined by achieving the proposed patient numbers per patient&#xD;
      group (outlined above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this will be a pilot study the investigators cannot perform power calculations on the&#xD;
      number of patients needed. the numbers for each patient group have been chosen based on the&#xD;
      realistic numbers of patients that they believe can be recruited over the initial 1 year&#xD;
      period and subsequent follow-up studies on these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the support of our local NIHR bioinformatics and bio-repository facility&#xD;
      (http://www.whri.qmul.ac.uk/core-facilities/nihr-bioinformatics-and-bio-repository), multiple&#xD;
      parameters will be analysed using multiple group comparisons (ANOVAs) to increase power. In&#xD;
      order to limit bias within the study, all CMR image analyses (done by Dr Herrey and Dr&#xD;
      Sekhri) will be blinded, and interobserver variability will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use flow cytometry to analyse immune cell phenotype. This is a&#xD;
      well-established method. Dr Nadkarni's laboratory has access to a flow cytometry core&#xD;
      facility, which has machines that can identify up 12 phenotypic markers on any given cell.&#xD;
      Moreover, Dr Nadkarni, the Chief Investigator, and her group, have extensive experience in&#xD;
      immune cell phenotyping using this method. The key advantages are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It is the gold-standard for immune cell phenotyping&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A minimal amount of blood are needed (max 200μls)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Antibodies are commercially available and have been extensively validated by ourselves&#xD;
           and others&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dr Nadkarni has developed a high throughput method to analyse many samples at once,&#xD;
           thereby minimising handling error&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples will be processed an analysed within 1 hour of sample collection to minimise&#xD;
      degradation of proteins on the surface of the immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also propose to look at circulating factors in the plasma and this will be&#xD;
      carried out using commercially available ELISA kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be to determine whether there is a correlation between aberrant&#xD;
      immune cell phenotypes and abnormal cardiac function within our preeclampsia patient cohort,&#xD;
      compared to normal healthy and PIH groups. Furthermore, analyses will be carried out to find&#xD;
      statistically significant cardiac functional and phenotypic differences between our&#xD;
      preeclamptic and PIH patient cohorts, which will improve our understanding of cardiac&#xD;
      function between the patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application for the current study is pending following submission. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained and recorded as described as above. Allowances for special groups are detailed&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidental Findings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should any incidental findings of clinical significance arise during the course of the study,&#xD;
      the participants GP and clinical care team will be informed. Consent to contact the GP will&#xD;
      be sought during the enrolment process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual Safety Reporting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CI will send an Annual Progress Report to the REC and the sponsor using the HRA template&#xD;
      on the anniversary of the REC &quot;favourable opinion&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data generated will be stored within an Excel spreadsheet combining clinical and lab&#xD;
      data. The spreadsheet will be password protected stored with a secure hard drive on a&#xD;
      protected computer. Access to the password and data will be on a strict need-to-know basis. A&#xD;
      full audit trail will be in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data for this study will comprise of initial diagnoses of preeclampsia or pregnancy&#xD;
      induced hypertension, which will be obtained from the obstetric care team, lead by Dr Elena&#xD;
      Greco at the Royal London. These will be in the form of blood test results and/or scan images&#xD;
      of the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent source data will be CMR images taken at the initial time point (diagnoses of&#xD;
      preeclampsia and gestational age-matched controls) and follow-up CMR image data at the 2nd&#xD;
      time point of the study (3 months post-partum). In addition to CMR images, source data will&#xD;
      also be obtained from the laboratory phenotyping of blood samples taken from patients at the&#xD;
      time points mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators who are directly involved with the study will have access to the source data.&#xD;
      In some cases, where it is deemed best for the patient and their ongoing care, clinicians may&#xD;
      seek advice from other experts, which may require their access to the source data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will undertake pseudorandomisation, whereby the patient is only be&#xD;
      identifiable by their hospital number. As this will be a follow-up study, the investigators&#xD;
      will need to link the patient and so this study will not be completely anonymised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record retention and archiving&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study data and documentation will be archived in accordance with the relevant regulatory&#xD;
      requirements and site SOPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A unique alphanumeric patient identifier will be allocated to each participant at the start&#xD;
      of the study. Data will be stored using the unique participant identifiers on a secure&#xD;
      database. Data will not be stored on personal computers. Confidential documents will be&#xD;
      stored in a locked cupboard located in a secure room. Clinical notes will be handled&#xD;
      according to trust protocol. The Data Protection Act and the NHS confidentiality code of&#xD;
      practice will be adhered to throughout this study. Data may be shared with members of the&#xD;
      clinical team to allow ongoing clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCP guidelines require that the investigator or the institution maintains all Case Report&#xD;
      Forms and all source documents that support the data collected from each participant plus all&#xD;
      trial documentation. Measures will be taken to prevent accidental or premature destruction of&#xD;
      these documents. Essential documents must be retained for at least 20 years. It is the&#xD;
      responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need&#xD;
      to be retained. If the responsible investigator retires or leaves the institution&#xD;
      responsibility for the documentation must be transferred to a person who will accept their&#xD;
      custody&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample preparation and collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples to assess immune cell phenotypes will be collected from patients who have read&#xD;
      the information sheet and signed the consent form. on the day of the cardiac MRI. A maximum&#xD;
      volume of 15mls will be taken from the patient at any one time and collected into sodium&#xD;
      citrate tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of the blood samples will undergo phenotypic analyses using the flow cytometry&#xD;
      method. Briefly, 50 microlitres of blood will be labelled with commercially-available&#xD;
      antibodies that are conjugated to flurochromes that can be detected by lasers on the flow&#xD;
      cytometer. Specialised software will enable the analyses of the assessment of phenotypic&#xD;
      markers that are expressed on immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples will also be isolated for specific immune cell including neutrophils and T-cells,&#xD;
      which will be stored in a secure -80oC freezer and may be subsequently used for genetic&#xD;
      testing, including next generation and whole genome sequencing. Such deep sequencing will&#xD;
      allow us to assess genetic changes that may occur alongside the phenotypic changes in the&#xD;
      immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma will also be collected from these samples to assess circulating factors, to be&#xD;
      assessed by commercially-available kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample storage and transfer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken by the Research Fellow, Dr Alice Christensen, at Barts Heart&#xD;
      Centre, where the Cardiac MRIs are to be carried out. Samples will be stored in an NHS fridge&#xD;
      until transfer to laboratory. Barts Heart Centre is a maximum ten-minute walk to the William&#xD;
      Harvey Research Institute where the laboratory is based. Samples will be transferred by Dr&#xD;
      Christensen to the laboratory using secure sample transfer boxes to be brought to the&#xD;
      laboratory. All blood samples will be processed within one hour of collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety reporting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the observational nature and design of this study, safety reporting of adverse events&#xD;
      will not occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and auditing&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor or delegate retains the right to audit any study, study site or central facility.&#xD;
      In addition, any part of the study may be audited by the funders where applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On-site monitoring will be performed as per the study monitoring plan. Monitoring will&#xD;
      include source data verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of the centre may be undertaken by a trained study monitor or monitors, to verify&#xD;
      the study documentation.&#xD;
