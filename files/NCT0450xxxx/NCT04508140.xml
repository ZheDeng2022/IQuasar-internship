  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, single arm, multicenter phase 2 trial in which BO-112 will be administered&#xD;
      intratumorally in combination with intravenous pembrolizumab in patients with liver&#xD;
      metastasis from colorectal, gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancers. The objective is to&#xD;
      reverse the primary resistance that a subgroup of patients from these tumors having&#xD;
      microsatellite stability present to the PD-1 inhibitors. Treatment will be administered every&#xD;
      3 weeks, with the exception of the first cycle, in which BO-112 will be also administered on&#xD;
      D8, for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is overall response rate based on RECIST 1.1 and safety, specifically&#xD;
      referred to treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with severity â‰¥ Grade 3 related to the&#xD;
      study treatment (NCI-CTCAE v 5.0). The secondary endpoints include other efficacy endpoints&#xD;
      (duration of response, disease control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival at 6&#xD;
      months, all based on RECIST 1.1, and overall response rate based on a specific tumor&#xD;
      assessment criteria to evaluate the response to immunotherapies, IRECIST) and safety, in this&#xD;
      case considering the number and proportion of subjects with treatment TEAEs (any grade) . In&#xD;
      addition, the changes in the tumor microenvironment induced by the injection of BO-112 will&#xD;
      be also evaluated as exploratory endpoints.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase II study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, antitumoural&#xD;
      activity and systemic exposure of repeated IT administrations of BO-112 percutaneously&#xD;
      injected into a hepatic metastatic lesion in combination with pembrolizumab administered&#xD;
      intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, non-comparative, 2-cohort study with a Simon's 2-stage design which&#xD;
      will include up to 69 evaluable adult subjects with un resectable liver metastasis suitable&#xD;
      for IT injection from CRC or GC/GEJ who are naive to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A will consist of up to 26 subjects with metastatic CRC who have received at least 2&#xD;
      prior standard of care systemic anticancer therapies for advanced/metastatic disease.&#xD;
      Bevacizumab may have been previously administrated. Prior Anti-EGFR drugs are mandatory if&#xD;
      applicable depending on the RAS status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B will consist of up to 43 subjects with gastric or GC/GEJ who have received at least&#xD;
      1 prior standard of care systemic anticancer therapy for advanced/metastatic disease. Prior&#xD;
      Her2 blockade will be mandatory in those patients with Her2 positive tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to reverse the primary resistance that the subgroup of patients from&#xD;
      these 2 cohorts who present microsatellite stability (MSS), in which data from previous&#xD;
      clinical trials have demonstrate that the inhibition of PD-1 has no proven efficacy. For that&#xD;
      purpose, the MSI status will be determined in the pre-treatment biopsy, done on C1D1, before&#xD;
      the first BO-112 administration. Those patients with a MSI status will continue under study&#xD;
      treatment but will be replaced and will not be considered for the efficacy assessment, only&#xD;
      for the safety assessment. Those patients having a MSS status will be considered bot both&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended dose for further clinical development of BO-112 is 1 mg administered in 1.7&#xD;
      mL volume, based on the data from the 112/2016-IT study, the fist-in-human trial with BO-112.&#xD;
      The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg. Study treatment will consist of&#xD;
      BO-112 IT injections in combination with IV pembrolizumab infusions and will be administered&#xD;
      in 3-week cycles. For each cycle, BO-112 IT injections will be administered after the&#xD;
      pembrolizumab infusion, either the same day or within a period of up to 36 hours after the&#xD;
      pembrolizumab infusion (for organisational feasibility at the site). On the first cycle,&#xD;
      BO-112 will be administered on D1 and D8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BO-112 IT injections will be administered by an interventional radiologist under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance, or occasional CT scan guidance, at the discretion of the interventional&#xD;
      radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment should continue as long as there is clinical benefit and it is tolerated, up&#xD;
      to a maximum of approx. 2 years (corresponding to 35 treatment cycles).&#xD;
