      The intervention will be a physical exercise program for colorectal cancer patients during&#xD;
      the adjuvant chemotherapy. The exercise program aims on reducing the side effects of the&#xD;
      treatment and improving patients' quality of life. In addition, the investigators try to&#xD;
      improve endurance and resistance training level, in order to achieve greater physical&#xD;
      functionality, survival and general well-being. For this, the investigators will carry out an&#xD;
      exercise program based mainly on muscular strength and cardiorespiratory condition. It will&#xD;
      last 6 months, with a frequency of 3 days per week, including sessions of 60 minutes.&#xD;
      Sessions will consist of three parts: warm-up, main part (endurance and resistance training),&#xD;
      and cool down. An individualized and supervised progression of training will take place. The&#xD;
      intensity levels will always be adjusted to the initial levels of the participants, always&#xD;
      considering their preferences and comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' preferences and exercise history will be considered through an initial&#xD;
      interview. Motivational strategies based on self-determination theory will be applied, since&#xD;
      it is one of the most used theories in the field of physical exercise. This theory proposes&#xD;
      that all people need to feel competent, autonomous and socially related. If these three needs&#xD;
      are satisfied, participants will develop more positive (autonomous) forms of motivation,&#xD;
      which are related to better consequences such as vitality, enjoyment, quality of life and&#xD;
      adherence to physical activity. In addition, motivational strategies will be applied for&#xD;
      families and healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the program and at the end of it, each eligible patient will be evaluated&#xD;
      through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity: strength test of lower and upper limbs, agility test, stress test for&#xD;
           cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity levels, physical condition and body&#xD;
           composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological factors: autonomy support, basic psychological need satisfaction,&#xD;
           motivation, quality of life, perceived barriers, depression, anxiety, hope, quality of&#xD;
           life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical parameters: survival rate, side effects, biological factors, treatment delays&#xD;
           and planned treatment completion.&#xD;

      Objectives and justification of the project In Spain, cancer is the second cause of death&#xD;
      after cardiovascular diseases. However, if it is divided by sex, cancer is the leading cause&#xD;
      of death for men and the second cause for women. In recent years there has been an increase&#xD;
      in new cases of cancer due to population growth and aging, since 2/3 of cancer patients are&#xD;
      older than 65 years. In addition to the impact of this disease on people's quality of life, a&#xD;
      high economic cost has been estimated for the health system. For example, the total cost of&#xD;
      cancer in 2015 in Spain was 7,168 million euros. This situation represents an important&#xD;
      public health problem and therefore implies that research on the factors that can prevent or&#xD;
      alleviate this disease should be considered as a priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, there is increasing scientific evidence of the physical and psychosocial&#xD;
      benefits of exercise both during and after the treatment of this disease. Nevertheless, only&#xD;
      30-40% of cancer survivors perform the necessary physical activity (PA) recommended by the&#xD;
      main medical institutions. In fact, a significant number of patients are obese (33%) and have&#xD;
      a low cardiorespiratory condition (45%). Despite this, PA continues to decrease after&#xD;
      diagnosis and only 5-10% of patients are physically active during treatment and 20-30% after&#xD;
      treatment. Therefore, the development of intervention programs aimed at promoting PA should&#xD;
      be a fundamental objective in the fight against cancer and its physical and psychosocial&#xD;
      consequences. In this line, our general objective will be to develop a motivation PA program&#xD;
      for colorectal cancer patients. Specifically, and considering the gaps existing in the&#xD;
      current literature, our general objective is subdivided into the following specific&#xD;
      objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the physical, psychosocial and behavioural effects, in the short and medium&#xD;
           term, of a physical exercise program in which motivational strategies based on&#xD;
           self-determination theory are applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore qualitatively the benefits of the physical exercise program, as well as the&#xD;
           troubles encountered in its implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop an educational guide and an intervention protocol to encourage motivation and&#xD;
           adherence to PA of colorectal cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology This study will require a sample size of 34 patients. This calculation was made&#xD;
      through the G*power software, by means of an analysis of variance (ANOVA), adjusting the&#xD;
      values to p &lt;.05, with a statistical power of 80% and an effect size of 0.5. The patients&#xD;
      will be recently diagnosed with colorectal cancer in phases II-III by the oncology service of&#xD;
      the Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro de Majadahonda. Inclusion criteria include to be&#xD;
      between 18 and 75 years old, to be undergoing chemotherapy treatment, and to not have any&#xD;
      type of associated pathology that prevents them from performing PA. A intervention with an&#xD;
      experimental group and a control group will be conducted, where 17 patients will be assigned&#xD;
      to a control group, and 17 patients will perform a supervised motivational exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures Cardiorespiratory fitness. Stress tests adapted to the characteristics of the&#xD;
      patients will be performed, both in the type of ergometer and in the protocol. We will use&#xD;
      electrocardiographic recording and gas exchange analysis. Aerobic and anaerobic exercise&#xD;
      thresholds will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life. The validated Spanish version of the EORTC-QLQ-CR30 will be used for&#xD;
      patients with colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition. Anthropometries will be carried out to estimate body composition&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological parameters. The usual analytics carried out in the hospital during the treatment&#xD;
      will be used to check the patient's health status and the side effects of the chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety. The validated version in Spanish of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression. The Spanish version of the Hamilton Depression Scale will be used. Autonomy&#xD;
      support. The Spanish version of the Perceived Autonomy Support for Exercise Settings will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived barriers to do PA. This scale will be translated and validated to the Spanish&#xD;
      context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic psychological needs in exercise. We will use the Basic Psychological Needs in Exercise&#xD;
      Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic psychological needs in life. The Spanish version of the Basic Psychological Need&#xD;
      Satisfaction and Frustration Scale will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types of motivation. To measure motivation towards PA, the Behavioural Regulation in Exercise&#xD;
      Questionnaire will be for PA levels. The Spanish version of the IPAQ questionnaire will be&#xD;
      used. On the other hand, PA will be measured in a direct and objective way through portable&#xD;
      GT3X accelerometers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, procedure and data analysis The intervention program will be carried out at the&#xD;
      Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro of Majadahonda. The program will last 6 months, with&#xD;
      three weekly one-hour sessions, and will comply with the recommendations established by the&#xD;
      American Cancer Society and the American College of Sports Medicine. The safety precautions&#xD;
      and contraindications identified by these institutions for colorectal cancer patients will be&#xD;
      especially considered. The program will include aerobic sessions at moderate and vigorous&#xD;
      intensities, as well as strength work. Patients will be monitored to model exercise loads&#xD;
      individually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements will be made just before starting the PA program (T1) in the case of the&#xD;
      experimental group, at an initial time of the equivalent treatment in the case of the control&#xD;
      group. The same measures will be carried out 6 months later (T2). For PA levels, instead of&#xD;
      measuring them just after the end of the program, we will wait another month so that patients&#xD;
      have been able to recover their usual PA levels after the shock that can mean for them to&#xD;
      face the end of our program. In the control group, PA levels will also be evaluated one month&#xD;
      after T2. To test the effects of the program, all measurements will be performed 6 months&#xD;
      after T2 in both groups (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, qualitative methodology will be used, so that the 17 patients of the&#xD;
      experimental group will be interviewed to know the factors related to their adherence to the&#xD;
      PA program and the benefits perceived by them with their participation. Qualitative data&#xD;
      collection will be reinforced with field notes compiled in research diaries by observers who&#xD;
      will be present during the development of the program. Relatives and health professionals&#xD;
      will also be interviewed to learn their perspective regarding the benefits of the program and&#xD;
      adherence to it in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to promote adherence to the program and to educate in autonomous PA habits when it&#xD;
      ends, motivational strategies based on the self-determination theory will be used. Specific&#xD;
      strategies will be developed for this group, based on previous works and educational guides&#xD;
      for colorectal cancer patients. The instructor in charge of directing the program will be&#xD;
      trained in several sessions to use motivational strategies based on this theory. Once the&#xD;
      program is finished, an educational guide of motivational strategies for the promotion of PA&#xD;
      in patients with colorectal cancer will be developed and published from the perspective of&#xD;
      self-determination theory.&#xD;
