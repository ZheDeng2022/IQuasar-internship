      Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and the mortality benefit it provides in the heart&#xD;
      failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) population are well-established by multiple&#xD;
      professional society guidelines. GDMT refers to initial medical therapy with&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB),&#xD;
      beta-blockers (BB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) titrating to maximally&#xD;
      tolerated doses for patients with HFrEF. Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) such&#xD;
      as the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy&#xD;
      (CRT) have also become a mainstay in the management of HFrEF after implementation of GDMT.&#xD;
      ICD therapy is an effective and established treatment for HFrEF patients for both primary and&#xD;
      secondary prevention of SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the use, adherence and results of GDMT after ICD/CRT implantation, there is very&#xD;
      limited data available in the literature. There are a few retrospective trials that show&#xD;
      this, however very limited randomized controlled data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study would randomize patients with primary prevention ICDs and CRT into a&#xD;
      specialized clinic with a heart failure nurse practitioner vs usual clinical care, with the&#xD;
      goal of determining outcomes such as change in LVEFs, heart failure hospitalizations, and&#xD;
      visits to the ER for heart failure. Consequently, this would determine whether targeted&#xD;
      clinics are needed for ICD/CRT patients with HFrEF to optimize GDMT, improve patient outcomes&#xD;
      and thus implement new guidelines/recommendations for this specific patient population.&#xD;

      Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and the mortality benefit it provides in the heart&#xD;
      failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) population are well-established by multiple&#xD;
      professional society guidelines. GDMT refers to initial medical therapy with&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB),&#xD;
      beta-blockers (BB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) titrating to maximally&#xD;
      tolerated doses for patients with HFrEF. Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) such&#xD;
      as the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy&#xD;
      (CRT) have also become a mainstay in the management of HFrEF after implementation of GDMT.&#xD;
      ICD therapy is an effective and established treatment for HFrEF patients for both primary and&#xD;
      secondary prevention of SCD. Canadian guidelines recommend ICD implantation for patients with&#xD;
      ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) and persistent ejection fraction ≤ 30%, when&#xD;
      persistent refers to at least 3 months of optimal medical therapy (OMT) in all patients and,&#xD;
      in patients with ischemic heart disease, at least 3 months after revascularization and at&#xD;
      least 40 days after a myocardial infarction (MI). These guidelines also suggest that ICDs be&#xD;
      considered for the same population with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 31-35%&#xD;
      as well. CRT device therapy is indicated for use in patients in sinus rhythm with New York&#xD;
      Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III, or ambulatory NYHA class IV heart failure symptoms, a&#xD;
      LVEF ≤ 35%, and QRS duration &gt; 130 ms because of left bundle branch block (LBBB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use and adherence to GDMT before and after ICD implantation is of critical importance.&#xD;
      Adherence to GDMT before implantation has the potential to improve survival and may even&#xD;
      improve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) enough so that an ICD may no longer be&#xD;
      indicated. However, adherence to GDMT is notoriously difficult to assess in conventional&#xD;
      clinical practice due a multitude of factors. These include information about outpatient&#xD;
      prescription use, prescription filling pattern/barriers, reported patient adherence to GDMT,&#xD;
      and various electronic health records/documentation linked to pharmacies to name a few. In&#xD;
      one retrospective study, it was demonstrated that just over half (61.1%) of patients filled&#xD;
      any GDMT prescription before ICD implantation. Futhermore, patients receiving GDMT versus&#xD;
      those who did not receive GMT had a lower 1 year mortality rate after ICD implantation (11.1%&#xD;
      vs 16.2%) after adjustments for comorbidities, LVEF, and NYHA class heart failure. In a&#xD;
      similar study assessing prescriptions claim data to assess beta-blocker use prior to ICD&#xD;
      implantation, the median number of days covered by a beta-blocker in the 90 days prior to ICD&#xD;
      implantation was 46 days. From the results of these studies, it is clear that there is room&#xD;
      for improvement for implementation of GDMT prior to ICD implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the use, adherence and results of GDMT after ICD/CRT implantation, there is very&#xD;
      limited data available in the literature. One of the first studies to exhibit the effect of&#xD;
      medical therapy in HFrEF patients after ICD/CRT implantation was a retrospective cohort study&#xD;
      that stratified ICD/CRT patients according to combination treatment with HFrEF medical&#xD;
      therapy; patients on none or one HFrEF medications were in group 0/1, patients on two HFrEF&#xD;
      medications (ex: ACEi + BB) were in group 2, and patients on all three HFrEF medications&#xD;
      (ACEi/ARB + BB + MRA) were in group 3. Results showed a higher hospitalization rate per&#xD;
      patient/year in the undertreated population (group 0 and 1) (28% vs 12%, p = 0.001). Also, in&#xD;
      multivariate analysis, patients treated with better medical therapy (groups 2 and 3) had less&#xD;
      hospitalizations for heart failure and better survival (p &lt; 0.001). In addition to benefits&#xD;
      with hospitalizations and better survival, adjunctive optimization of GDMT can result in&#xD;
      quantitative benefits as well. One study compared usual post-implant care was compared to&#xD;
      protocol-driven clinical care with a dedicated nurse and cardiologist. Protocol-driven care&#xD;
      was associated with significant improvements in LVEF, LV internal diastolic diameter, and&#xD;
      improvements in maximum exercise capacity. Interestingly, these improvements appeared to be&#xD;
      driven not only by device-related management, but also by concomitant optimization of GDMT&#xD;
      and heart failure education. As evidenced by these promising results, it is of utmost&#xD;
      importance to assess and optimize the use of GDMT in patients with CIEDs and HFrEF, as there&#xD;
      can be potential improvements in LVEF, exercise capacity and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study would randomize patients with primary prevention ICDs and CRT into a&#xD;
      specialized clinic with a heart failure nurse practitioner vs usual clinical care, with the&#xD;
      goal of determining outcomes such as change in LVEFs, heart failure hospitalizations, and&#xD;
      visits to the ER for heart failure. Consequently, this would determine whether targeted&#xD;
      clinics are needed for ICD/CRT patients with HFrEF to optimize GDMT, improve patient outcomes&#xD;
      and thus implement new guidelines/recommendations for this specific patient population.&#xD;
