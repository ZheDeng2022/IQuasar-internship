  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of CGF and Ozone in the treatment of&#xD;
      alveolitis and to develop a new treatment protocol that can enable a quick and effective&#xD;
      solution of this clinical problem, which significantly affects patients' comfort of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, 60 healthy patients &gt; 18 years old and have alveolitis, will included.&#xD;
      60 patient will divided randomly into three groups as Control, Ozone and Ozone+CGF. After&#xD;
      irrigation of the sockets alvogyl, ozone and ozone+CGF will applied to the sockets&#xD;
      respectively. Post operative pain, will measured at 1st to 7th days. Post operative&#xD;
      infection, and granulation tissue will measured at 1st, 3rd and 7th days. Oral hygiene will&#xD;
      evaluated at first visit. Quality of life will evaluated at 7th day.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in post-operative pain assessed: visual analog (VAS) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6th and 24th hour, 2nd day, 3rd day, 4th day, 5th day, 6th day and 7th day</time_frame>
    <description>For the evaluation of the pain, the visual analog scale (VAS) will be used to express the absence of pain in the initial part on a straight line (0) and the end part to express the unbearable pain (10).&#xD;
0 (no pain)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------10 (unbearable pain) Higher values of the scale represent worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Granulation tissue health</measure>
    <time_frame>postoperative 1st, 3rd, 7th days</time_frame>
    <description>Granulation tissue formation in the area after treatment will be evaluated clinically. Granulation tissue will be scored as healthy (pink color and no bleeding on probing) and unhealthy granulation tissue (dark red in color and usually bleeding on probing).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oral hygiene degree</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation of the oral hygiene before operation</time_frame>
    <description>Oral hygiene of the patient will be evaluated in 3 groups as poor, moderate and good.&#xD;
Good&#xD;
Patients with a low incidence of active caries,&#xD;
Patients with no bleeding and non-inflamed gums, as well as no plaque, calculus, and gingival pocket formation.&#xD;
Bad&#xD;
Patients with periodontitis, inflamed gums, bleeding on probing, pocket formation,calculus&#xD;
Patients with active caries.&#xD;
Moderate&#xD;
Patients other than these two groups will be evaluated as moderate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflamation severity</measure>
    <time_frame>postoperative 1st, 3rd, 7th days</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of inflammation will be assessed using the gingival index; From values 0 to 3; 0.Normal gingiva&#xD;
Slight inflammation-slight discoloration, mild edema. no probing on bleeding,&#xD;
Moderate inflammation - redness, edema. bleeding on probing,&#xD;
Severe inflammation-marked redness and edema, ulceration and tendency to spontaneous bleeding</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the quality of postoperative life after the procedures performed</measure>
    <time_frame>postoperative 7th day</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of the change in postoperative quality of life will be done with a scale of post-operative symptom severity (PoSSe) consisting of 15-item questionnaire in which the effect of operation on eating, speech, sensation, appearance, pain, disease and daily activities is evaluated. This questionnaire was divided into subscales corresponding to seven main adverse effects, and for each possible answer there was a score ranging from 0 to a variable number. For total possible answer there was a score ranging from 0 to a 97.9. Higher values of the scale represent worse outcome.</description>
