  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is among the most widespread in the male population and represents 19%&#xD;
      of all cancers diagnosed from the age of fifty, in Italy. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)&#xD;
      and Radiotherapy (RT) are used for increase survival. However, both therapies are associated&#xD;
      with significant side effects, such as fatigue, loss of muscle mass and strength, cognitive&#xD;
      decline that together lead to an increase risk of accidental falls and fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines for cancer survivors recommend Physical Exercise (PE) as a strategy to reduce&#xD;
      several side effects of therapies. However, most people living with cancer do not meet&#xD;
      current exercise recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, an effective PE program requires the application of long-term, moderate to high&#xD;
      intensity activity. Thus it may be difficult to implement this type of recommendation in&#xD;
      patient with PCa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to develop an experimental PE intervention testing their&#xD;
      feasibility and safety and the patients' satisfaction, aimed at improving the health&#xD;
      conditions of the patients with PCa receiving ADT and RT. Furthermore, long-term falls and&#xD;
      fracture events will be monitored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The non-randomized feasibility and pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      a structured, multicomponent, supervised and unsupervised exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome will be evaluate the change in the health condition, in particular muscle&#xD;
      strength, cognitive function, fatigue, balance, anxiety and depression level, and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PE program will be conducted at the &quot;Virgilio Camparada&quot; Municipal Athletic Track in the&#xD;
      city of Reggio Emilia (IT). Patients will be participate in a supervised exercise program&#xD;
      with three sessions per week, for eight weeks. Subsequently, the intervention will continue&#xD;
      further for four weeks maintaining one supervised session and two unsupervised sessions a&#xD;
      week. Finally, sessions will be performed without supervision for further eight weeks. The&#xD;
      overall duration of the intervention will be twenty weeks. In addition, an evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed at one year from baseline to monitor long-term fall and fracture events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline will be the following assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - clinical and anthropometric data and the Six Minute Walking Test (6MWT) to determine the&#xD;
      intensity of aerobic exercise.&#xD;
