  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck tumors include well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma,&#xD;
      adenoid cystic carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, sarcoma, olfactory blastoma, and&#xD;
      mucoepidermoid carcinoma, which are highly invasive and have a high rate of recurrence and&#xD;
      metastasis. For tumors that cannot be radically removed at the local advanced stage, even&#xD;
      after traditional comprehensive treatment, survival is still very low. Therefore, we need to&#xD;
      explore new treatment methods to achieve tumor degeneration and increase the surgical&#xD;
      resection rate or control local lesions to improve the survival rate of tumors. According to&#xD;
      previous research reports and clinical exploration, anlotinib has evidence support for the&#xD;
      treatment of locally advanced head and neck tumors. With a considerable effect in the early&#xD;
      stage, we tried to initially observe the clinical treatment efficiency, toxic and side&#xD;
      effects, progression-free survival time, overall survival time and quality of life of&#xD;
      anlotinib in the treatment of patients with refractory head and neck carcinoma. Provide&#xD;
      patients with a more optimal treatment plan and improve survival.&#xD;

      We will prospectively collect 30 patients who receive anlotinib combined with&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy. Data will be stored in a private database. The process of data collection&#xD;
      will be supervised and regular data examination will be performed.&#xD;

Efficiency and side effects will be evaluated within 3 months after therapy. Finally, the survival is in follow-up.</description>
