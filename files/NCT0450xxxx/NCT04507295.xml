      the aim of this study is to compare the effect of different modes of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      by using volume-controlled ventilation and pressure-controlled ventilation on cerebral blood&#xD;
      flow monitored by cerebral oximetry during thoracoscopic surgeries in neonates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The brain uses aerobic metabolism exclusively for energy production, so the brain is&#xD;
      critically dependent on the nearly continuous delivery of oxygen to maintain cellular energy&#xD;
      production. Normal cerebral blood flow is approximately 50 ml/100 gram of brain tissue/min.&#xD;
      The brain represents 2% of the total body weight but it receives about 15% of the cardiac&#xD;
      output. The brain is supplied by the circle of Willis which is formed of anastomosis between&#xD;
      the internal carotid artery and the vertebro-basillar system. Monitoring of the CBF depends&#xD;
      on either assessing the blood flow itself (e.g, radioactive substance and transcranial&#xD;
      duplex) or assessing the oxygen delivery to the brain (e.g, cerebral oximetry and jugular&#xD;
      bulb venous O2 saturation). CBF monitoring is an important parameter in both Intensive care&#xD;
      unit and operation room in several aspects e.g, traumatic brain injury (TBI), acute stroke,&#xD;
      carotid artery surgeries and cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral oximetry is a continuous noninvasive technique that monitors the cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      with several advantages over other CBF monitors including the ease of use and interpretation.&#xD;
      It is painless and does not utilize ionizing radiation. The recordings provide real time&#xD;
      information rather than single static measurements. Using the cerebral oximetry has few&#xD;
      limitations including representing local rather than global CBF and absence of normal and&#xD;
      cutoff values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracoscopic surgery was first introduced in 1910 and allowed a major advance in the field&#xD;
      of thoracic surgery. Then with the improvement of the Instrumentation, thoracoscopic surgery&#xD;
      started in the pediatric field in 1976 for simple procedures and now it is used predominantly&#xD;
      in the pediatric thoracic surgery. The use of thoracoscope has many advantages over the open&#xD;
      approach including using a smaller incision and reducing blood loss, postoperative pain,&#xD;
      hospital stay and musculoskeletal deformities. Thoracoscope utilizes either one lung&#xD;
      ventilation (OLV) or CO2 insufflation technique. In neonates the OLV technique is not&#xD;
      suitable, so CO2 insufflation ( capnothorax ) is usually used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies were done and revealed the effect of thoracoscopy in neonate on CBF due to&#xD;
      the effect of capnothorax which increases the intrathoracic pressure leading to decreased&#xD;
      venous return and cardiac output, subsequently the CBF decreases, and with the increase of&#xD;
      the insufflation pressure the decease in the CBF becomes more significant. Also the&#xD;
      capnothorax may lead to hypercapnia which leads to changes in the CBF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of newborn with congenital anomalies that require surgical procedure during the&#xD;
      neonatal period is not low. With the increase of the survival rate, several studies proved&#xD;
      that exposure of the neonates to surgery and anesthesia is associated with a higher risk of&#xD;
      neuro-developmental delay in different aspects (sensory, motor, language, behavioral,&#xD;
      cognitive, etc.) and thoracoscopic surgery is associated with higher risk due to the nature&#xD;
      of the disease and the surgery. Using cerebral oximetry in addition to other routine monitors&#xD;
      is of added value to maintain CBF within normal range to decrease the incidence of&#xD;
      neurological injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few studies showing that using different modes of mechanical ventilation affects&#xD;
      CBF in neonates due to difference in several factors including effect on hemodynamics and&#xD;
      airway pressure but there is no study comparing between volume controlled ventilation and&#xD;
      pressure controlled ventilation. This research gap encourages us to do this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative assessment will be conducted on the patients the day before surgery including&#xD;
      history taking from parents, full examination, routine laboratory investigations; in the form&#xD;
      of CBC, coagulation profile, creatinine, urea, ALT, AST and radiological investigations; in&#xD;
      the form of chest X-ray and echocardiography. the parents (guardians) will be consented to be&#xD;
      included in the study &amp; informed about the required fasting hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients enrolled in the study will be monitored all through the surgical procedure using&#xD;
      pulse oximeter, non-invasive blood pressure and invasive blood pressure monitor (also for&#xD;
      repeated arterial blood gases sampling), ECG, capnogram in addition to the cerebral oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two infant probes of the cerebral oximetry will be applied to the patient on the both sides&#xD;
      of the forehead and the monitor will display the cerebral oxygen saturation from the right&#xD;
      and the left side of the brain digitally and in form of graph then the baseline reading of&#xD;
      the cerebral oxygen saturation will be recorded before induction of anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction of general anaesthesia will be performed using a regimen of 1-2 µg/Kg fentanyl IV&#xD;
      and 2-3mg/kg propofol IV then tracheal intubation is facilitated using atracurium 0.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      IV. Ventilation will be mechanically controlled using the routine pressure-controlled mode,&#xD;
      to maintain end tidal CO2 (ETCO2) between 30-35 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia will be maintained using 1.6 % isoflurane that will be adjusted according to&#xD;
      hemodynamics changes with top up doses of atracurium as required. After starting of gas&#xD;
      insufflation using pressure of 4-6 mmHg and flow at 0.5 to 1.0 Liter/Minute, ventilation of&#xD;
      patients will be modified according to the protocol of each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recorded data will be analyzed using the statistical package for social sciences, version&#xD;
      20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Quantitative data will be expressed as mean±&#xD;
      standard deviation (SD). Qualitative data will be expressed as frequency and percentage. The&#xD;
      following tests will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Independent-samples t-test of significance will be used when comparing between two&#xD;
           means.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mann Whitney U test: for two-group comparisons in non-parametric data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chi-square (x2) test of significance will be used to compare proportions between&#xD;
           qualitative parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The confidence interval is set to 95% and the margin of error accepted is set to 5%. So,&#xD;
           the p-value is considered significant as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probability (P-value) :- P-value &lt;0.05 is considered significant. P-value &lt;0.001 is&#xD;
           considered as highly significant. P-value &gt;0.05 is considered insignificant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated using G-power software. The cerebral oxygen saturation in neonates&#xD;
      undergoing thoracoscopic surgery was derived from a previous study and was 73%±7 %.we assumed&#xD;
      that different ventilation mode caused a difference of 10% in cerebral oxygen saturation&#xD;
      .considering a study power of 80% and a p-value of 0.05 to be significant, the sample size&#xD;
      was calculated to be 30 patients (15 in each group)&#xD;
