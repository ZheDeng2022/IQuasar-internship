        Inclusion Criteria: Phase 1 of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each patient enrolled in the trial must have CLDN6-positive tumor regardless of tumor&#xD;
             histology defined as ≥ 50% of tumors expressing ≥ 2+ CLDN6 protein using a&#xD;
             semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay in a central laboratory for&#xD;
             specific detection of CLDN6 protein expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded&#xD;
             (FFPE) neoplastic tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of a FFPE tumor tissue sample. FFPE can be from an archival tumor tissue&#xD;
             sample, and it should be from the most recent tumor tissue obtained. If this is not&#xD;
             available, patient must be biopsied for CLDN6 staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have histological documentation of the original primary tumor via a pathology&#xD;
             report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 (except for Germ Cell Tumors, where&#xD;
             patients can be evaluated according to Cancer-Antigen (CA)-125, Alpha-fetoprotein&#xD;
             (AFP) or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) [as applicable] if they have a&#xD;
             pre-treatment sample that is at least twice the upper limit of normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a histologically confirmed solid tumor that is metastatic or unresectable&#xD;

             agree to use highly effective birth control method(s), such as barrier method of birth&#xD;
             control, e.g., either condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository for men;&#xD;
             and/or for females occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal&#xD;
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository; an intrauterine device; and/or hormone-based&#xD;
             contraception, with established use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods&#xD;
