  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is becoming increasingly apparent that there is an urgent need to systematically&#xD;
      investigate the rising cesarean section (CS) rates in Greece and develop interventions to&#xD;
      substantially reduce these rates. In this trial, to be conducted in Greece, the obstetricians&#xD;
      will be exposed to educational, behavioral and/or organizational interventions while managing&#xD;
      labor. The trial is expected to yield new information about effective interventions to reduce&#xD;
      unnecessary cesarean sections in Greece, hopefully leading the way to their reduction&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study explains the planned implementation of a stepped-wedge trial in Greek&#xD;
      maternity units. Twenty-two maternity units in Greece will participate in the trial involving&#xD;
      20,000 to 25,000 births, with two of the units entering the intervention period each month&#xD;
      (stepped randomization). The maternity units will apply the interventions for a period of&#xD;
      6-16 months, depending on the time they enter the intervention stage of the trial. There will&#xD;
      also be an initial baseline phase of the trial, lasting from 3 to 13 months; this phase will&#xD;
      include observation and data collection of routine obstetric practices. The interventions are&#xD;
      based on educational, behavioral and organizational modifications and will include the&#xD;
      implementation of the Hellenic Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (HSOG) guidelines on&#xD;
      labor management and targeted training in cardiotocography (CTG), obstetric emergencies, and&#xD;
      the classification of cesarean section through Robson criteria. During the trial period, the&#xD;
      rates and indications for cesarean sections will be available to participating units on a&#xD;
      live platform, using an anonymous reporting system. Participating obstetricians will be able&#xD;
      to see their own and other units' performance and also get feedback on their rates. Î¤he final&#xD;
      three-month phase of the trial will be devoted to completion of questionnaires by the&#xD;
      participating obstetricians. The total estimated duration of the trial will be 22 months. The&#xD;
      primary outcome assessed will be the change in cesarean section rate and the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will be maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The intervention and control&#xD;
      periods will be compared using mixed effects logistic regression with adjustment for any&#xD;
      underlying secular trends.&#xD;

    <description>In their practice, as regards the mode of delivery, obstetricians are encouraged to conform to the three guidelines and two consent forms published by the Hellenic Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (HSOG). The members of the appointed Steering Committee and/or local opinion leaders will discuss and disseminate these guidelines among the professional staff in the respective maternity units, providing them with the opportunity to identify specific barriers, overcome them, and develop an implementation timetable.</description>

    <description>The workshops and courses will give instruction in indications for cesarean section and clinical scenarios, physiology-based cardiotocography (CTG) interpretation, obstetric emergencies (with topics including breech delivery, trial of labor after cesarean, delivery of twins, induction and augmentation of labor), organization of the labor ward, as well as launching of regular cesarean section and CTG meetings with review of the patient notes. The workshops will last four days and will be conducted by experienced trainers. The expectation is that the obstetricians will gain very considerable knowledge and skills, which will enable them to subsequently follow these practices safely and competently.</description>

    <description>Live real-time statistics provided by an online platform, on a regular basis, is expected to improve adherence, through regular feedback. Each unit will see other units' statistics by means of an anonymous reporting system. This repetition will create silent signals that will remind the participating obstetricians to remain on task.</description>

    <description>Local cesarean section meetings will be held weekly, in each unit. The members of the steering committee or local opinion leaders may actively participate in these meetings. Local obstetricians learn to judiciously adapt standard medical practices, thereby avoiding unnecessary medical interventions. This is a way to further enhance compliance, as during the discussions the behavior expected of the obstetricians is clearly stated by the participating opinion leaders.</description>

    <description>Local CTG interpretation meetings will be held weekly, in each unit, during which all &quot;abnormal&quot; CTG cases that led to cesarean section will be reviewed and discussed. Members of the Steering Committee or local opinion leaders may actively participate in these meetings.

    <description>Effective and reliable reminders concerning optimal obstetric practice will be placed in labor wards, staff rooms, patient notes, vaginal birth packages and above theater hand washers. There will be short messages with positive phrasing regarding the benefits of vaginal birth, thus reminding birth attendants to reduce unnecessary cesarean sections. Relevant SMS (short message service) will be sent to the participating obstetricians' mobiles on a regular basis, so as to motivate them via non-verbal signals.</description>

    <description>There will be application in daily practice of three guidelines and two consent forms pertaining to the mode of delivery published by HSOG. Obstetricians are informed on evidence-based medicine in obstetrics and provided with a structured and safe approach to labor management. The members of the appointed Steering Committee and/or local opinion leaders discuss and disseminate the guidelines among the professional staff at the respective maternity units, answer questions, and make available their knowledge and experience. Adoption of guidelines by the participating unit helps to establish clear, consistent rules that are direct and simple, and obstetricians are asked to embrace fully justified medical practice.</description>

This type of formal training provides problem-solving strategies, using mnemonics, that are critical in emergencies and that also aid in learning and retaining the skills being taught. Functional and social skills that directly affect decision-making and effectiveness are addressed. Thus, units adopt a continuous educational procedure for their staff, enhancing their confidence when dealing with labor emergencies and redesigning labor management plans, so as to ensure high-level obstetric services.</description>

The unit's staff can hear about both justified and unnecessary surgical procedures and draw informed conclusions as to the optimal procedure in similar cases. They will also have the opportunity to actively participate in an elaborative problem-solving discussion. These meetings when routinely conducted, provide feedback and audit resources to help improve performance and further enhance compliance.</description>
