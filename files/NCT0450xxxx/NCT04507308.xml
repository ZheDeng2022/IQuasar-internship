  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental illness that often first emerges in&#xD;
      adolescence. Effective treatments are typically expensive, lengthy, and intense (e.g.,&#xD;
      Dialectical Behavior Therapy). Thus, setting individuals up for treatment success is&#xD;
      extremely important. Disrupted sleep is closely linked to many BPD symptoms (e.g., moodiness,&#xD;
      impulsivity, interpersonal problems), and people with BPD have a range of sleep-related&#xD;
      problems. Importantly, sleep problems may make BPD symptoms worse, longer lasting, and also&#xD;
      interfere with learning new skills in treatment. Understanding sleep problems in BPD may help&#xD;
      create better interventions, as most therapies for BPD do not currently address sleep&#xD;
      difficulties. Although approaches like Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and&#xD;
      the Youth version of the Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Intervention (TranS-C-Youth)&#xD;
      work well with many populations, scientists don't yet know if youth with BPD features can&#xD;
      tolerate a sleep-focused intervention. The investigators will recruit youth between ages 13&#xD;
      and 18 who have 3 or more clinically impairing BPD symptoms from the London community and via&#xD;
      clinician referrals. They will also recruit a parent to report on their child's sleep&#xD;
      patterns, mental health symptoms, and accompany youth to an intervention session.&#xD;
      Participants will complete diagnostic interviews and a range of surveys to assess their&#xD;
      current functioning (e.g., sleep, mental health, BPD symptoms). Investigators will also ask&#xD;
      youth to report on their BPD symptoms multiple times per day in real time and track their&#xD;
      sleep at night for a 10-day period. Participants will also wear a headband to track their&#xD;
      brain waves while they sleep. After an initial 10-day monitoring period, youth participants&#xD;
      will receive a brief, single-session sleep intervention with their parent using materials&#xD;
      from the TranS-C-Youth protocol. Adolescents will be asked to follow a sleep plan created&#xD;
      during their visit for three weeks before completing another 10 days of assessment.&#xD;
      Participants will complete a follow-up survey battery upon completion of the second real-time&#xD;
      survey protocol, and also be invited to complete surveys one-month post intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that day-to-day variability in sleep will influence BPD symptom&#xD;
      presentation, and vice versa. They also hypothesize that our intervention will improve sleep&#xD;
      quantity/quality among an at-risk sample, and may be associated with decreased BPD symptoms&#xD;
      relative to baseline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a persistent and profoundly impairing mental&#xD;
      disorder characterized by interpersonal turmoil, severe emotion dysregulation, and&#xD;
      impulsivity(1). BPD often first manifests in adolescence(2) and even subthreshold levels of&#xD;
      symptoms are associated with significant psychosocial morbidity(3). Approximately 69% to 80%&#xD;
      of persons with this condition engage in self-injurious behavior, and as many as 9% die by&#xD;
      suicide(4-5). Although efficacious treatment approaches have been developed (e.g.,&#xD;
      Dialectical Behavior Therapy [DBT];6), they are typically expensive, lengthy, and intensive.&#xD;
      Identifying methods for optimizing BPD treatment and prevention is an urgent public health&#xD;
      priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disrupted sleep is closely linked to defining characteristics of BPD such as higher&#xD;
      sensitivity and reactivity to stress, behavioral impulsivity, interpersonal dysfunction, and&#xD;
      poor emotion regulation(7). Studies have documented a range of sleep disturbances among BPD&#xD;
      samples, and demonstrated that sleep problems are not better accounted for by concomitant&#xD;
      depression or other psychiatric disorders(7-9). Importantly, sleep problems may worsen BPD&#xD;
      symptom course and chronicity(10-11), heighten risk of suicide(12-13) and self-harm(14), and&#xD;
      interfere with cognitive processes that are vital to behavioral intervention (e.g., memory&#xD;
      consolidation, and attentional processes; 15). A greater understanding of sleep disturbance&#xD;
      in BPD may help enrich treatment protocols, which currently place limited emphasis on sleep&#xD;
      difficulties(11). Although approaches like Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)&#xD;
      and the Youth version of the Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Intervention (TranS-C-Youth)&#xD;
      are effective with many populations(16), it is currently unknown whether sleep-focused&#xD;
      interventions can be tolerated or followed adherently by youth with BPD features (who are&#xD;
      often extremely dysregulated across affective, interpersonal, and behavioral domains).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: 1) To assess transactional relations of sleep, interpersonal stressors, affect,&#xD;
      impulsive behaviors, and self-harm among youth with BPD features (N = 50); 2) To assess the&#xD;
      effects of a brief sleep intervention on subsequent sleep quality (primary outcome) and BPD&#xD;
      symptoms (secondary outcome). This pilot study will establish recruitment feasibility,&#xD;
      determine the acceptability and efficacy of a sleep-focused intervention among adolescents&#xD;
      with BPD features, and provide crucial preliminary data to support future grants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology. The investigators will use a pre-post intervention design with 2 assessments.&#xD;
      Changes in BPD symptoms, self-reported sleep quality, and ambulatory monitoring of&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) during sleep, will be assessed approximately 30 days&#xD;
      post-treatment. Two 10-day EMA protocols (one prospective and one post-intervention) will&#xD;
      provide data for transactional analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Adolescents ages 13-18 (N=50) will participate with a parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be conducted through physician and therapist referrals and ethics-approved&#xD;
      media advertisements and fliers posted in waiting rooms where youth with BPD are likely to be&#xD;
      treated (e.g., children's hospital), and common community venues (coffee shops, libraries,&#xD;
      community centers). Interested participants (and a parent) will complete a brief telephone&#xD;
      screen to determine initial eligibility and schedule two virtual visits.&#xD;

        5. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and EEG Protocol 1 (10 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  EMA assessments will be collected 5 times per day. Upon waking, participants will&#xD;
                report bed time and wake time for calibration with sleep EEG data&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each daily survey will assess current mood, sleep, and BPD symptoms since the last&#xD;
                prompt (e.g., perceived emotional control/dyscontrol, emotional lability,&#xD;
                interpersonal conflict, impulsive behavior, dissociation, self-harm&#xD;
                urges/behaviors; see attached EMA protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Research staff will monitor EMA responses each morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  When responses during the EMA protocol indicate imminent risk of suicide or&#xD;
                     self-injury (see EMA protocol for specific rules), the CMHA Ontario's suicide&#xD;
                     crisis number will automatically display on participants' smart phone, and&#xD;
                     research staff will immediately receive an automated e-mail. Research staff&#xD;
                     are able to log into the secure database to view participants' responses, and&#xD;
                     Dr. Kaufman may contact the participant by telephone for risk assessment and&#xD;
                     safety planning. Appropriate intervention or follow-up care will be arranged.&#xD;
                     In cases of immediate safety risk, the research team will define a feasible&#xD;
                     safety plan with the participant (this may include other members in the&#xD;
                     participants' network and/or crisis intervention services and emergency care).&#xD;
                     If child abuse or neglect is disclosed, the alleged abuse will be reported to&#xD;
                     local child welfare services and provincial/territorial social service&#xD;
                     ministries. During the consent process, all participants will be informed of&#xD;
                     limits to confidentiality and our legal obligations to report dangerous&#xD;
                     situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           EMA protocols of similar duration and assessment frequency have been successfully&#xD;
           conducted with individuals at risk for self-harm with excellent participant compliance&#xD;
           rates (21-23).&#xD;

&#xD;
           - EMA assessments will proceed as they did for protocol 1 (i.e., 5 times per day), with&#xD;
           additional prompts to assess sleep plan/skill usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Research staff will monitor EMA responses by examining data each morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  When responses during the EMA protocol indicate imminent risk of suicide or&#xD;
                self-injury, the CMHA Ontario's suicide crisis number will automatically display on&#xD;
                participants' smart phone, and research staff will immediately receive an automated&#xD;
                e-mail. Research staff are able to log into the secure database to view&#xD;
                participants' responses, and Dr. Kaufman may contact the participant by telephone&#xD;
                for risk assessment and safety planning. Appropriate intervention or follow-up care&#xD;
                will be arranged. In cases of immediate safety risk, the research team will define&#xD;
                a feasible safety plan that includes other members in the participants' network&#xD;
                and/or crisis intervention services and emergency care. If child abuse or neglect&#xD;
                is disclosed, the alleged abuse will be reported to local child welfare services&#xD;
                and provincial/territorial social service ministries. During the consent process,&#xD;
                all participants will be informed of limits to confidentiality and our legal&#xD;
                obligations to report dangerous situations.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>De-identified data may be shared with scientific collaborators in the future. Given the sensitive nature of study data, and that our sample includes vulnerable youth recruited from the London area, we will not provide unrestricted access to all study variables. A subset of de-identified questionnaire, interview, and psychophysiological data may be made available by request. Researchers interested in more sensitive data (e.g., demographic variables that, in combination, could increase the odds of participant identification [age, sex, race, ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation]) can request variables of interest from the principle investigator, and will be asked to complete a plan for data security.</ipd_description>
