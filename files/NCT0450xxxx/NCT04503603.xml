    <description>An Adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant who has signed informed consent to participate in a study; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. TEAEs is defined as AEs with onset at the time of or following the start of treatment with study medication, or medical conditions present prior to the start of treatment but increasing in severity or relationship at the time of or following the start of treatment.</description>
