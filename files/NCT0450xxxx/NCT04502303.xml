  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intestinal stricture is a complication of Crohn's disease (CD), which is thought to be the&#xD;
      result of chronic transmural inflammation combined with a dysregulated wound-healing process.&#xD;
      While inflammatory strictures may respond to anti-inflammatory treatment, fibrotic strictures&#xD;
      are usually anti-inflammation resistant, requiring further endoscopic balloon dilation or&#xD;
      surgical intervention. Therefore, to determinate the inflammatory or fibrotic nature of&#xD;
      intestinal stricture is a key step in the treatment of CD. 18F-FDG is a radiotracer&#xD;
      reflecting the glucose metabolism of disease and is usually accumulated in inflammatory&#xD;
      disease. 68Ga-FAPI is a novel radiotracer that specifically targets fibroblast activation&#xD;
      protein (FAP). FAP is a membrane glycoprotein expressed on activated fibroblasts, which are&#xD;
      key cells in the process of fibrotic intestinal stricture of CD. In this study, we hypothesis&#xD;
      that the inflammatory or fibrotic nature of intestinal stricture can be non-invasively&#xD;
      evaluated by 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT in patients with CD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with intestinal stricture will undergo 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT on two&#xD;
      consectutive days. The accumulation of 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI at the site of stricture will be&#xD;
      determined by standard uptake value (SUV), molecular volume (MV), and total molecular index&#xD;
      (TMI). In patients with a planned surgical resection of one or more stricture (s), the image&#xD;
      results will be compared with histological findings.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will undergo 18F-FDG (0.12-0.15mCi/kg) and 68Ga-FAPI (3-6mCi) PET/CT on two consecutive days. At least 6 hours of fast is required for 18F-FDG PET scan, while no dietary control is necessary for 68Ga-FAPI PET scan. If the patients are on metformin, discontinuation of 48 hours is required before 18F-FDG injection to minimize the bowel uptake. If the patient is planned for surgical resection of one or more stricture (s), the scans have to be completed within a maximum period of 30 days before the surgery.</description>
