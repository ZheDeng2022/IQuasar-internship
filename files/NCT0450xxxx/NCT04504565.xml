  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has high prevalence and mortality in China,&#xD;
      which become a severe challenge for public health. The molecular imaging technology has been&#xD;
      developed for visualization and precise diagnosis of the tumors. Integrin αvβ3 is a specific&#xD;
      marker for tumor. Noninvasive visualization and quantitative analysis of integrin αvβ3&#xD;
      expression provide new opportunities for tumor diagnosis, identification and efficacy&#xD;
      monitoring. The peptide containing Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) can specifically bind to integrin αvβ3&#xD;
      receptor with high selectivity and affinity to achieve the detecting tumor .The SPECT/CT with&#xD;
      99mTc-3PRGD2 has a high specificity in the diagnosis of mediastinal lymphnode metastasis and&#xD;
      a greater value in the decision-making of lymphnode dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-center self-controlled study, It is planned to enroll 30 patients with&#xD;
      esophageal cancer , preliminarily confirmed by endoscopic biopsy, . After intravenous&#xD;
      injection of 0.3 mCi/kg of 99mTC-3PRGD2, patients underwent single-photon emission computed&#xD;
      tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) examination.Subsequently, the patients received&#xD;
      chest/abdomen enhanced CT and 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission computed&#xD;
      tomography /CT (PET/CT) for diagnosis. According to the determination of the researcher,&#xD;
      patients who were suitable for surgery received surgery to obtain surgical pathology; For&#xD;
      patients who were not suitable for surgery, ultrasound-guided lyphnode biop was performed .In&#xD;
      this study, pathological specimens were obtained from gastroscopy, surgical pathology, or&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided lymph node biopsy. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity , specificity and&#xD;
      safety of SPECT/CT with 99mTc-3PRGD2 were evaluated and compared with PET-CT and enhanced CT.&#xD;

      Screening period All patients will be during the screening screening assessment, specific&#xD;
      include: the signing of the ICF, demographic data, drug allergy history and history, height,&#xD;
      weight, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) examination, laboratory&#xD;
      examination, blood pregnancy test records (if applicable), endoscopic biopsy, AE and drug&#xD;
      combination, check into/standard. Qualified patients will enter the administration period&#xD;
      after screening and confirmation. Administration period (from Administration to safety&#xD;
      follow-up) day of administration (study day 1): before administration of the experimental&#xD;
      drug, 12-lead ECG, laboratory test (fasting) and vital signs were measured. Subsequently, the&#xD;
      experimental drug was injected intravenously at 0.3 ± 20% mCi/kg, and subjects underwent&#xD;
      urination and SPECT/CT examination 40 min after administration. AE and combined medication&#xD;
      were recorded. The next day after administration (day 2 of the study): 12-lead ECG,&#xD;
      laboratory examination (fasting), vital signs were measured, AE and combined medication were&#xD;
      recorded. Between the administration of 99mTc-3PRGD2 and the safety follow-up, the&#xD;
      investigator determined that chest/abdomen enhanced CT and PET/CT were performed at an&#xD;
      optional date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety follow-up (day 14±2 of the study or before the next clinical intervention, whichever&#xD;
      is shorter) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 lead ECG, laboratory test (fasting), measurement of vital signs, blood pregnancy (women of&#xD;
      childbearing age only), AE and combined medication were recorded.Lymph node histopathology&#xD;
      was obtained by surgery in patients suitable for surgery, and by ultrasound-guided lymph node&#xD;
      biopsy in patients unsuitable for surgery.&#xD;
