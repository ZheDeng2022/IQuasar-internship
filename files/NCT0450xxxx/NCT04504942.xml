  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II study with 30 patients of leronlimab (PRO 140) in patients with&#xD;
      CCR5+ locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leronlimab (PRO 140) will be administered subcutaneously as weekly dose of 525 mg until&#xD;
      disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Subjects participating in this study will be&#xD;
      allowed to receive/continue standard-of-care chemotherapy or radotherapy as per the dosing&#xD;
      schedule included on the package insert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients will be evaluated for tumor response approximately every 3 months or&#xD;
      according to institution's standard practice by CT, PET/CT or MRI with contrast (per treating&#xD;
      investigator's discretion) using the same method as at baseline.&#xD;
