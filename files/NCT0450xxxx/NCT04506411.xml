    <description>Evaluation of Quality of life through SF-36 (RAND version), which is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability and the higher the score the less disability.</description>
