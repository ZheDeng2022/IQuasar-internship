      improving the doctor-patient relationship and optimizing the treatment cost, FIBSER, STAR-P&#xD;
      and HEA Health Economics Follow-up Evaluation Scale are selected as simple and quick&#xD;
      evaluation scales to evaluate the influence, doctor-patient relationship and social and&#xD;
      economic benefits after drug treatment in clinical treatment. At present, the reliability and&#xD;
      validity of FIBSER, STAR-P and HEA scales will be verified the reliability and validity of&#xD;
      the above three scales in depressive disorder, aiming at enriching the treatment of&#xD;
      depressive patients based on assessment, thus improving the compliance of medication for&#xD;

      In this study, the reliability and validity of FIBSER Scale, Doctor-patient Relationship&#xD;
      Scale-Patient Edition (STAR-P) and HEA in Chinese population will be verified to increase the&#xD;
      diversity and selectivity of domestic assessment tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes two steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. baseline: demographic data, HAM-D, HAM-A, YMRS, drug side effects scale：FIBSER, TESS；&#xD;
           doctor-patient relationship scale ：STAR-P, PDRQ-15；Health economics follow-up evaluation&#xD;
           scale ：SDS and HEA were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. follow-up (4 weeks): HAM-D, HAM-A, YMRS, FIBSER, STAR-P and HEA scale in order to verify&#xD;
           the reliability of retest.&#xD;
