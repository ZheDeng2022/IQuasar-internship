      This study is an opportunity to provide continued reasonable assurance of the safety and&#xD;
      probable benefit of The Tether HUD. The study will collect long term safety and efficacy&#xD;
      information from patients who have had their idiopathic scoliosis treated via anterior&#xD;
      vertebral body tethering (AVBT) with The Tether.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While spinal fusion remains the standard surgical treatment for progressive idiopathic&#xD;
      scoliosis, concerns about the long-term effects of spinal fusion have led to the&#xD;
      investigation of growth-modulation techniques. Anterior Vertebral Body Tethering (AVBT) is&#xD;
      one such technique that utilizes growth modulation to remodel the shape of the vertebra and&#xD;
      straighten scoliotic curves in skeletally immature individuals. In this technique, screws are&#xD;
      inserted at each vertebral level for the length of the convex side of the curve. A strong&#xD;
      cord is connected through the screw tulip heads and used to initially straighten the curve as&#xD;
      each level is fixed with a set screw. Following surgery and during the growth period the&#xD;
      spine begins to remodel according to the Hueter-Volkmann Law, bone growth is relatively&#xD;
      inhibited in areas of increased pressure (convex or tethered side) and relatively stimulated&#xD;
      in areas of decreased pressure or tension (concave side). Following this principle, AVBT has&#xD;
      been shown to alter spinal growth with the potential to correct scoliosis while maintaining&#xD;
      spine flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to assess the ongoing safety and probable benefit of The Tether&#xD;
      HUD which was approved by the FDA under an HDE. Subject enrollment and data collection will&#xD;
      be managed by the Harms Study Group (HSG) and Setting Scoliosis Straight Foundation (SSSF)&#xD;
      Registry. Institutions that are HSG members or affiliates, with Investigators/surgeons that&#xD;
      are trained and approved to perform surgeries with The Tether, will participate in the&#xD;
      registry. Ten sites from this group will be identified as study sites specific to this Tether&#xD;
      post-approval study (PAS). Consecutive subjects from these sites, that meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria of this study, will be flagged in the registry as the PAS cohort and the study&#xD;
      endpoints will be assessed across this population.&#xD;
