    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled, single-center, exploratory clinical research method was used. In&#xD;
      the treatment plan, the experimental group used basic treatment + Huperzine A, and the&#xD;
      control group only used basic treatment, with a total of 20 cases. To evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of Huperzine A injection in the treatment of brain injury in&#xD;
      patients with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage.&#xD;
