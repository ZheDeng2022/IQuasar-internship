  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recovery after surgery depends on psychological factors such as preoperative information,&#xD;
      expectations and surgery-associated anxiety. Prior studies have shown that even short&#xD;
      preoperative psychological interventions can improve postoperative outcomes in heart surgery&#xD;
      patients. However, what content works best for which patient group and how long an&#xD;
      intervention has to be is still largely unknown. The aims of this study are thus to examine&#xD;
      if the developed preoperative psychological intervention (i) reduces preoperative anxiety,&#xD;
      (ii) increases positive expectations, and (iii) improves the long-term outcome postoperative&#xD;
      recovery. Therefore, a brief intervention has been developed. Heart valve patients who&#xD;
      undergo a heart surgery will be randomized into two groups (Control vs. intervention group)&#xD;
      after baseline assessment. Following this the intervention group will participate in the&#xD;
      psychological intervention (30-40 minutes). To increase patients' positive expectations the&#xD;
      intervention will focus on treatment outcome expectations and personal control expectations.&#xD;
      Furthermore, patients in the intervention group will have two booster-telephone calls (four&#xD;
      and eight weeks after the surgery) to check if their developed plans work out. The control&#xD;
      group will receive the standard medical procedure. Both groups will fill out questionnaires&#xD;
      again at the evening before the surgery, around one week after the surgery and three months&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;

    <description>The psychological, preoperative intervention follows a treatment manual. Patients get a personal intervention one day before surgery (30-40 minutes). It includes the development of an individual, subjectively perceived disease model, the treatment outcome expectations and the personalized outcome expectancy. Additionally they get two booster telephone calls 4 and 8 weeks after the surgery to recall the discussed topics and to talk about their recovery process (10-15 minutes).</description>
