  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients requiring endotracheal intubation for elective surgery with an expected difficult&#xD;
      airway are randomized to be intubated either by a) videolaryngoscopy or b) an endotracheal&#xD;
      tube-mounted camera.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation is required for different surgical procedures for mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and to prevent aspiration of secretions. Endotracheal intubation is usually&#xD;
      performed by direct laryngoscopy (DL), but this technique may fail in patients with a&#xD;
      difficult airway, i.e. during otorhinolaryngologic or oral and maxillofacial surgery. Besides&#xD;
      fiberoptic intubation that is regarded as gold standard, videolaryngoscopy (VL) has evolved&#xD;
      as a valuable alternative technique in patients with a difficult airway. However, VL has its&#xD;
      limitations and may also fail due to insufficient visualization of the larynx. An&#xD;
      endotracheal tube with an integrated camera (VST, VivaSight-SL, Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark)&#xD;
      may allow for direct guidance of the tube and may aid in endotracheal intubation in difficult&#xD;
      airway patients. This tube has been evaluated in intensive care patients and in patients with&#xD;
      morbid adiposity compared to DL, but there is a paucity of data in difficult airway patients,&#xD;
      so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we aim to test the VST in difficult airway patients compared to VL in a&#xD;
      prospective randomized non-inferiority trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed for eligibility in the Anesthesiology Pre-assessment Clinic of the&#xD;
      University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf prior to elective surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive a structured preoperative airway assessment in accordance with standard&#xD;
      operating procedure of the Department of Anesthesiology, University Medical Center&#xD;
      Hamburg-Eppendorf using the implemented in-house algorithm for the prediction of difficult&#xD;
      airway management and the Simplified Airway Risk Index (SARI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the intervention group will be intubated with a VST. Depending on&#xD;
      gender and patient's size, tubes with inner diameters of 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0 are available. The&#xD;
      tubes camera is connected to an Ambu aView monitor (Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark). Patients&#xD;
      randomized to the control group are intubated with a C-MAC videolaryngoscope (Karl Storz SE &amp;&#xD;
      Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) with a Macintosh type blade size 3 or 4 blade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia management, the choice of the blade and tube size, as well as the use of adjuncts&#xD;
      like stylets, introducers or forceps or airway optimization maneuvers (e.g. backward upward&#xD;
      rightward pressure [BURP] and optimum external laryngeal manipulation [OELM]) will be left to&#xD;
      the discretion of the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All intubations are recorded through the monitors for later review (e.g. Cormack-Lehane and&#xD;
      POGO-score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on an expected endtidal fraction of oxygen after intubation of 80% with a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 8%, and a noninferiority margin of 10%, 2x 24 patients are required with errors&#xD;
      of α=0.025 and β=0.2 (PASS version 08.0.6, NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, UT, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participating physicians are anesthesiology residents or fellows. To avoid a bias that&#xD;
      may occur due to different skills for VL compared to the VST, physicians participating in&#xD;
      this study take part in a structured manikin airway training. The age and months of work&#xD;
      experience of the participating anesthetists will be assessed within a questionnaire. It has&#xD;
      been shown that novice physicians are able to reliably intubate a manikin with the VST after&#xD;
      a 30 min training session of DL and VST. For VL, it has been shown that novice physicians may&#xD;
      intubate manikins set up to a difficult airway scenario after a brief introduction and five&#xD;
      intubations with the VL and that anesthesiology residents may quickly adopt the use of the&#xD;
      C-MAC VL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, participating physicians are trained for 30 min under the supervision of an&#xD;
      independent anesthetist before participating in this study.&#xD;
