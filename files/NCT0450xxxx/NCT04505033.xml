  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      placebo by subcutaneous (SC) administration. Forty subjects (10 subjects per cohort for SC&#xD;
      administration) will be randomized and assigned to up to 4 sequential doses cohorts of HB0017&#xD;
      (50 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and 450 mg) or matching placebo. Each cohort of ten volunteers will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of HB0017 or matching placebo at a ratio of&#xD;
      4:1. Starting with the lowest dose, each of the subsequent doses will be administered only if&#xD;
      the preceding dose was determined to be safe and well tolerated. The decision to escalate the&#xD;
      next dose will be made jointly by the sponsor s medical expert and the investigator based&#xD;
      upon review of 15-day blinded safety data prior to dosing each cohort.&#xD;
