  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of fosaprepitant plus ondansetron&#xD;
      with dexamethasone or placebo plus ondansetron with dexamethasone in preventing&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) with MEC/HE multi-day chemotherapy in&#xD;
      children with solid tumors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will randomly assigned 1:1 to receive double-blind study drug ( fosaprepitant&#xD;
      plus ondansetron with dexamethasone OR placebo to fosaprepitant plus ondansetron with&#xD;
      dexamethasone). Fosaprepitant or placebo to fosaprepitant were supplied and administered in a&#xD;
      blinded manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants received a single dose of fosaprepitant (age-based adjustment) administered&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) on Day 1 prior to chemotherapy plus ondansetron (weight based) IV with&#xD;
      dexamethasone (weight based) iv/po prior to chemotherapy and up to 72 hours after&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo Comparator:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants received a single dose of matched placebo for fosaprepitant administered&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) on Day 1 prior to chemotherapy plus ondansetron (weight based) IV with&#xD;
      dexamethasone (weight based) iv/po prior to chemotherapy and up to 72 hours after&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
