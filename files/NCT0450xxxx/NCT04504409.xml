      The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of KT and DN combined with&#xD;
      exercise on pain, range of motion (ROM), and upper extremity function in patients with common&#xD;
      shoulder disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal problem seen in working population. The main&#xD;
      contributor to nontraumatic upper-limb pain, in which chronicity and recurrence of symptoms&#xD;
      are common. A common cause of muscle pain is myofascial pain caused by myofascial trigger&#xD;
      points (MTrPs). Travel and Simons have described trigger points as 'a tender point on&#xD;
      palpation characterized by referring pain, motor dysfunction and autonomic symptoms and&#xD;
      usually located in the taut band or the fascia of the muscle. MTrPs in the shoulder muscles&#xD;
      produce symptoms similar to those of other shoulder pain syndromes, including pain at rest&#xD;
      and with movement, sleep disturbances and pain provocation during impingement tests. MTrPs&#xD;
      are classified into active and latent trigger points. An active MTrP causes a clinical pain&#xD;
      complaint. It is always tender, prevents full lengthening of the muscle, weakens the muscle,&#xD;
      refers a patient-recognized pain on compression, mediates a local twitch response of muscle&#xD;
      fibers when adequately stimulated and, when compressed within the patient's pain tolerance,&#xD;
      produces referred motor phenomena and often autonomic phenomena, generally in its pain&#xD;
      reference zone, and causes tenderness in the pain reference zone. A latent MTrP is clinically&#xD;
      quiescent with respect to spontaneous pain; it is painful only when palpated. A latent MTrP&#xD;
      may have all the other clinical characteristics of an active MTrP and always has a taut band&#xD;
      that increases muscle tension and restricts range of motion. An alternative approach to the&#xD;
      management of persons with shoulder problems consists of a treatment aimed at inactivating&#xD;
      MTrPs and eliminating factors that perpetuate them. Manual techniques (such as compression on&#xD;
      the trigger point or other massage techniques), cooling the skin with ethyl chloride spray&#xD;
      and stretch and trigger point needling can inactivate MTrPs. MTrP inactivation may be&#xD;
      combined with active exercises, postural correction, extracorporeal shock wave therapy,&#xD;
      kinesio taping and relaxation if and when appropriate. Kinesio taping (KT) and dry needling&#xD;
      (DN) are two common applications being used in treatment of acute and chronic musculoskeletal&#xD;
      problems in recent years. Several therapies have been proposed for MTrPs, including KT, a&#xD;
      relatively new method that has become widely used as a therapeutic tool in a variety of&#xD;
      prevention and rehabilitation protocols. KT is an elastic cotton adhesive tape which is&#xD;
      latex-free and can be used on any joint or muscle. Te exact mechanism by which KT functions&#xD;
      remain unknown, though it is thought that its effectiveness may be mediated by cutaneous&#xD;
      mechanoreceptors which would provide sensorimotor and proprioceptive feedback, and/or by&#xD;
      mechanical restraint and inhibitory and excitatory nociceptive stimuli [16]. Various groups&#xD;
      have shown that the use of KT can be beneficial, for example, by decreasing pain or by&#xD;
      increasing range of motion (ROM) in shoulder pathologies. Among the non-pharmacological&#xD;
      options, DN, despite the controversy, is currently considered one of the most effective&#xD;
      interventions for the direct inactivation of MTrPs and is gaining attention for the treatment&#xD;
      of MTrPs in musculoskeletal pain by targeting trigger points and non- trigger point&#xD;
      structures. It is a skilled intervention that uses a thin filiform needle to penetrate the&#xD;
      skin and stimulate underlying trigger points, muscular and connective tissues without the use&#xD;
      of injectate. A systematic review with meta-analysis reported that DN, compared with&#xD;
      sham/placebo, can decrease pain immediately after treatment and in four weeks among patients&#xD;
      with upper quarter myofascial pain syndrome. Another systematic review with metaanalysis&#xD;
      reported that DN can be recommended to relieve MTrP pain of neck and shoulders in short and&#xD;
      medium terms, but wet needling is more effective than DN in reducing MTrP pain in neck and&#xD;
      shoulders in medium term.&#xD;

    <description>Limited and painful ROM is often observed in patients with shoulder disorders. Shoulder active ROM was measured in a supine position using a universal goniometer. The goniometer is a reliable instrument for measuring shoulder ROM . All measurements will be taken with patients standing. In this study, three repetitions were performed in each direction, and the average of three trials will determine the mean ROM values for each condition.</description>

    <description>The exercise program consisted of; Codman , wand, stretching and strengthening exercises [25] applied twice a day, 5 times a week and duration of 3 weeks in all groups. All exercises were performed for 10 repetitions and 3 sets. Patients performed exercises with under supervision of physiotherapist in the clinic settings. In ExG, patients received only this exercise protocol for 3-weeks.</description>

    <description>Before KT application, their skin was shaved, cleaned with alcohol, and dried. Prior to application, the patient was seated and asked to flex their neck laterally to the contralateral side and to rotate their head to the same side. KTs (Ares®) tape was used. The first strip was a Y-strip representative of the supraspinatus, which was applied from its insertion to origin with paper off tension. A Y-strip refers to a section of tape that has a portion cut down the middle to produce 2 tails. In KTG, patients wore the KT for a 3-week duration (renewed twice a week periodically in this time).</description>

    <description>The MTrP dry needling procedure employed was similar to the MTrP injection described by Hong. The MTrP was located by palpating the taut band and identifying the point of maximal tenderness. This was then firmly compressed by the index finger or middle finger of the nondominant hand to direct the placement of the needle tip while inserting the needle. The needle was inserted into the skin at a point above the taut band, approximately 1 cm from the MTrP region. After penetration of the needle into the subcutaneous layer, it was kept there and obliquely (about 45 degrees) directed to the MTrP region under the fingertip of the non-dominant hand. Then, the needle was inserted rapidly into the MTrP region and withdrawn rapidly. In DNG, patients received DN for a 3-week duration (twice a week periodically in this time).</description>
