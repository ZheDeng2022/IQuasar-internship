  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is one of the pathological processes with the greatest impact on the demand of&#xD;
      health services. The cost of this process in Spain according to the results is 2.5% of Gross&#xD;
      Domestic Product (Breivik, Collett, Ventafridda et al. 2006).Mainly affects women and in it&#xD;
      psychological, behavioral and psychological factors converge (Cöster, Kendall, Gerdle et al.&#xD;
      2008). The role of gender as a social determinant of health is known (Stansfeld, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multidisciplinary and not only pharmacological intervention stands as a desirable paradigm&#xD;
      for addressing this type of health problem, and it is considered necessary to standardize&#xD;
      treatment in this regard. Thus, psychological constructs such as the concept of&#xD;
      &quot;catastrophization&quot; have demonstrated the relationship between suffering and the displacing&#xD;
      experience (Wade, Riddle, Price, Dumenci, 2011) and the psychological framework of Acceptance&#xD;
      and Commitment Therapy has also revealed its positive effect. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rise of new technologies makes it necessary to give added value to the use of digital&#xD;
      mobile devices for its potential contribution to the health care of the population, given its&#xD;
      immediacy, widespread use, possibility of interaction and increase of the margin of&#xD;
      accessibility to health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project aims to demonstrate that multidisciplinary and combined intervention of&#xD;
      pharmacological therapies with specific psychological therapies along with the use of mobile&#xD;
      digital devices can improve the management and evolution of chronic pain.&#xD;

      Patients received a written invitation from their primary care physician or nurse to a group&#xD;
      informational meeting where the principal investigator introduced the program. The study has&#xD;
      been completed in a span of three years. People participating in the study were asked to give&#xD;
      their informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To carry out this study, the basic ethical aspects have been guaranteed, approved by the&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee of Córdoba which belongs to the Andalusian Public Health System.&#xD;
      The Informed consent was guaranteed by the Research Ethics Committee of Córdoba which belongs&#xD;
      to the Andalusian Public Health System In the group meeting, the people who agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study will be informed via email, they will be given instructions on how&#xD;
      to download the mobile application if they are selected in the intervention group, the&#xD;
      treatment will last 6 weeks maximum 8 weeks The three questionnaires will be completed by all&#xD;
      study subjects in a maximum time of 10 minutes. Immediately after receiving the two&#xD;
      face-to-face sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then ,the questionnaire will be filled in again by participants at week number (8 weeks&#xD;
      maximum after treatment) and three months just after having received the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain management application includes automatic monitoring, skills training, social&#xD;
      support, education, goal setting and achievement of 4 components: exercises, psychological&#xD;
      well-being, pharmacological and health assets interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week participants have a look at digital presentations about every component, doing&#xD;
      then 3 activities related to each.This program will be.&#xD;

    <masking_description>In this study, a distribution by blocks of size four was used, in which the only criterion for stratification was the reference Health Center of the patient in question. Therefore, in order to randomize a patient, the existing button on the recruitment form for this study, hosted on the REDCap platform of the Maimonides Institute for Biomedical Research in Córdoba, was clicked. (IMIBIC). The data was transferred to the electronic notebook: the Data Entry Manager. The statistician, principal investigator, and study collaborators who evaluated the respondents were not involved in patient recruitment and were blinded to group allocation. Recruiters were not blinded to be available throughout the study to ask and answer participants' treatment questions.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Pain Catastrophization Scale (PCS) (Sullivan, Bishop and Pivik, 1995), Spanish adaptation of (J. García Campayo et al., 2008),</measure>
    <time_frame>6 MONTH</time_frame>
    <description>it was used to measure the main outcome variable of the study: catastrophization in pain, which is considered an important prognostic factor in chronic pain in general. The PCS is a 13-item self-administered scale on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (always). It comprises 3 dimensions: a) rumination; b) magnification, and c) hopelessness. Higher scores indicate higher levels of catastrophism. The Spanish version of the PCS has been shown to have adequate internal consistency, convergent validity, and classificatory value (Cronbach's α = 0.79), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.84), and sensitivity to size change (effect size). &gt; 2), which makes it a good measure, similar to the original scale, so its use is aimed at clinical practice and clinical research (García-Campayo et al., 2008).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ) (McCracken, Vowles, &amp; Eccleston, 2004). Spanish adaptation by (Balluerka, Gorostiaga, Alonso-Arbiol, &amp; Haranburu, 2007)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 MONTH</time_frame>
    <description>It was used to measure participation in activities of daily living despite pain and the willingness to experience pain without trying to control, alter or avoid it. It is a 20-item questionnaire that evaluates the acceptance of pain in a 6-point Likert-type format that goes from or (never true) to 6 (always true). The total CPAQ score is the sum of the two subscales. According to (GEISER, 1992), the initial studies carried out in relation to acceptance and adaptation to the CPAQ questionnaire, show adequate internal consistency and expected correlations with measures of physical functioning and psychological distress. After subsequent studies in which its content and dimensionality were evaluated (McCracken et al., 2004), two factors were established, the involvement in activities (Cronbach's α of 0.82) and the openness to pain (Cronbach's α of 0.78). .</description>

    <measure>Scale of the European Questionnaire on Quality of Life of 5 dimensions. EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) (Badia, Roset, Montserrat, Herdman, &amp; Segura, 1999)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 MONTH</time_frame>
    <description>it was used to measure health-related quality of life (HRQL) that can be used both in relatively healthy individuals (general population) and in groups of patients with different pathologies. The individual himself evaluates his state of health, first in severity levels by dimensions (descriptive system) and then on a more general visual analogue scale (VAS) of evaluation. A third element of the EQ-5D is the index of social values obtained for each state of health generated by the instrument. For each dimension of the EQ-5D, severity levels are coded 1 if the answer choice is &quot;no (I have) problems&quot;; with a 2 if the answer option is &quot;some or moderate problems&quot;; and with a 3 if the answer option is &quot;many problems&quot;. &quot;The EQ-5D is a simple, valid, and practical measure for use as an outcome variable in both clinical research and health care resource allocation.&quot;</description>
