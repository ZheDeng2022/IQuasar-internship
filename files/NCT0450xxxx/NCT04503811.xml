  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to explore the lived experience of control and wellbeing of older&#xD;
      people diagnosed with frailty within the care service provision in southern England.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, the researcher will talk with older people diagnosed with frailty and the&#xD;
      professionals that provide care to them. The researcher is interested in understanding&#xD;
      participants' experiences of a sense of control and how health and social care services&#xD;
      affect this experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although research has shown that rehabilitation can be effective in maintaining physical&#xD;
      activity often frail older people do not wish to take up the rehabilitation services&#xD;
      provided. Research in this area has been dominated by health care professionals' views about&#xD;
      frailty and how services should be provided. Services could be improved by learning from the&#xD;
      first-hand experiences of older people living with frailty and what they feel increases their&#xD;
      level of control and wellbeing within their service use. The factors which increase their&#xD;
      sense of control and wellbeing can then be built into future service development, inform care&#xD;
      policies, and provide new understanding for future research to develop services which are&#xD;
      more attractive and relevant for older frail people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All persons aged 65 years and over, with a diagnosis of frailty will be eligible to take part&#xD;
      in one to one interviews with the researcher. From the interviews principles underpinning&#xD;
      good practice which enhances the sense of control and wellbeing in older people's lives and&#xD;
      within the services received will be identified. These will be shared with professional care&#xD;
      providers including nurses, doctors, and physiotherapists who routinely work with frail older&#xD;
      people to gain insights into how these principles can be integrated into practice and&#xD;
      developed in policy and future service development. The findings will, therefore, help to&#xD;
      develop services which ensure that they are supportive and increase a sense of control in&#xD;
      life rather than getting in the way of this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to last 12 months and up to 30 participants (20 older people and 10&#xD;
      Hospital staff) will be recruited to take part in the study.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The researcher will ensure that the Data is made open and accessible to other researchers in line with the provisions of the InnovateDignity Project Data Management Plan and the Bournemouth University Research Data Policy.&#xD;
Once the study has ended, anonymised data from the project will be deposited in the 'UK Data Archive' in Qualibank for example and QuDEX as a way of ensuring that the data are easily accessible to other researchers in the specific field of study and/or social scientists in related fields such as health care and policy research. However, there will be an embargo of up to 3 years on publications, after which data will be made available and accessible via the UK Data Archive.&#xD;
The data will be secured in line with the UK Data Archive policies and at the end of the project and the three-year embargo, researchers seeking access to the data will have to go through the UK Data Service access processes.</ipd_description>
