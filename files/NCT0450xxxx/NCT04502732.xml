  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare a less invasive breath test against the current&#xD;
      standard for assessing gastric (stomach) emptying. The current standard of care is a&#xD;
      procedure called Nuclear Scintigraphy of a Solid Meal (NSSM). This study will compare this&#xD;
      method to a Gastric Emptying Breath Test (GEBT).&#xD;

    <description>The aim of this study is to compare baseline, early post-procedural (2 month), and delayed post-procedural (6 month) T1/2, as assessed by both GEBT and NSSM, in seven adult subjects with obesity who have underwent an EGRWL procedure.</description>

    <description>The time to half gastric emptying (T1/2) will be assessed via Gastric Emptying Breath Tests (GEBT) and Nuclear Scintigraphy of a Solid Meal (NSSM) at baseline, 2 months, and 6 months. This data will be collected from seven adult subjects, with obesity, who have recently received Endoscopic Bariatric and Metabolic Therapy.</description>
