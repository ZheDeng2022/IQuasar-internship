      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of dynamic tape in prevent shoulder&#xD;
      muscle fatigue.&#xD;

      After being informed about the study and the potential of risk, all participants will undergo&#xD;
      a screening to determine eligibility for study entry and giving written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will include 20 participants who have pitch 100 times with dynamic taping or shame taping&#xD;
      in randomized sequence. There must be more than 2 weeks resting between 2 test. We will test&#xD;
      maximal force in shoulder flexion, extension, abduction and adduction before and after test.&#xD;
      We also record spins and speed of baseball for performance outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our hypothesis, we suggest dynamic taping could decrease the arm fatigue after long-term&#xD;
      pitching.&#xD;
