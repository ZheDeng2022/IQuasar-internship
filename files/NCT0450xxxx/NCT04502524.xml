  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well a new electronic (e)-health smoking cessation program&#xD;
      (called Vet Flexiquit) works in promoting smoking cessation in low-income veterans who may or&#xD;
      may not be ready to quit smoking. The study will compare the new website smoking cessation&#xD;
      program to the current standard care website smoking cessation program offered by the&#xD;
      Veterans Administration (VA). Both website interventions will be accompanied by a text&#xD;
      messaging program that includes: (1) motivational messages, and (2) reminders to use the&#xD;
      assigned program. Both of the website interventions can help smokers quit or cut back on how&#xD;
      much they smoke, thus dramatically reducing their chances of developing tobacco-related&#xD;
      health conditions.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Participants use the new website smoking cessation program, which provides values&#xD;
      driven, mindfulness based coping skills and utilizes non-judgmental acceptance of&#xD;
      uncomfortable internal states like cravings. Participants also receive text messages&#xD;
      consisting of motivational messages and reminders to use the program. At the end of the&#xD;
      program, participants receive an email with handouts and available resources provided by the&#xD;
      VA for continued support for smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Participants use the VA standard of care website, which provides educational&#xD;
      materials about cessation treatments, tools to cope with urges and relapse, how to stay&#xD;
      motivated, and brief tips on coping with physical and mental health problems. Participants&#xD;
      also receive text messages consisting of motivational messages and reminders to use the&#xD;
      program. At the end of the program, participants receive an email with a handout of available&#xD;
      resources provided by the VA for continued support for smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study randomization, participants are followed up at 1 and 3 months.&#xD;

    <description>Satisfaction ratings regarding the usefulness of specific components of the website program, user comments and suggestions for improvement, presented descriptively. Treatment satisfaction items are reported on a Likert-type scale, with response choices ranging from &quot;not at all satisfied&quot; to &quot;very satisfied&quot;. Will dichotomize values at a threshold of &quot;somewhat satisfied&quot; or higher. Will test for differences between arms using a logistic regression model with adjustment for the stratification variable, baseline readiness to quit (high versus low), as well as adjustment for any baseline variables that differ between study arms and are associated with the outcome (i.e., potential confounders).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in readiness to quit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by the Contemplation Ladder on a scale from 0 (no thought about quitting) to 10 (taking action to quit). Will calculate change score as follow-up minus baseline score and use a linear regression model with adjustment for the baseline value of the measure of interest and for the stratification variable, baseline readiness to quit (high versus low), as well as adjustment for any baseline variables that differ between study arms and are associated with the outcome (i.e., potential confounders) to compare between study arms.</description>
