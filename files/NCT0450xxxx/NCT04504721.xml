  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition with an unclear etiology. The syndrome includes symptoms&#xD;
      such as chronic musculoskeletal pain, cognitive dysfunctions, fatigue, sleep disorders, and&#xD;
      circadian rhythm disturbances. Fibromyalgia-related pain is associated with a substantial&#xD;
      socioeconomic burden including greater health care costs and productivity loss from work.&#xD;
      Light therapy can improve sleep quality and sleep architecture, advance sleep phases and&#xD;
      reduce pain sensitivity and that the effect of light therapy on mood and cognitive function&#xD;
      have been widely supported.This randomized controlled study aims to examine the effects of&#xD;
      light therapy on sleep quality, depressive symptoms, psychomotor vigilance performance, and&#xD;
      overall symptom severity in patients with fibromyalgia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a central sensitivity syndrome characterized by chronic widespread pain,&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunctions, fatigue, sleep disorders, and circadian dysregulation. Light therapy&#xD;
      can improve sleep quality and sleep architecture, advance sleep phases and reduce pain&#xD;
      sensitivity and that the effect of light therapy on mood and cognitive function have been&#xD;
      widely supported, research into the effect of light therapy for patients with fibromyalgia&#xD;
      who often suffer from sleep and mood disturbance, pain, and cognitive impairments is of both&#xD;
      research interest and therapeutic implications. This study will use a randomized, parallel&#xD;
      group, assessor-blind, waiting-list controlled trial design. The primary outcome is symptom&#xD;
      severity. The secondary outcomes include: sleep quality; depressive symptoms; psychomotor&#xD;
      vigilance and attention; and sleep phase changes. The intervention will take 8 weeks with 30&#xD;
      minutes exposure at awakening to blue-enriched white light. A total of 80 participants, aged&#xD;
      20 to 64, with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia will be enrolled and randomly assigned into one of&#xD;
      the two parallel groups: an intervention and a waiting list group. For the intervention&#xD;
      group, outcomes will be assessed at baseline, immediately after, and 2 months after the&#xD;
      8-week intervention period. For the waiting list group, outcomes will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, immediately after the 8-week waiting period, and 2 months after the intervention&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-administered questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. The seven components include subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, total sleep time, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disorders, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction. All questions are scored on a 0-3 interval scale. The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where higher scores denote a poorer sleep quality.</description>

    <description>The Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) is used to estimate phase preferences in circadian rhythms based on participants' self-descriptions. timing.

MEQ scores can range from 16 to 86, with lower scores indicating eveningness or later circadian timing, and higher scores indicating morningness or earlier circadian timing.</description>
