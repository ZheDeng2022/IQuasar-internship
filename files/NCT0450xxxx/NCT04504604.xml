      This open label, non-randomized, multi-center, pragmatic study aims to establish whether&#xD;
      patients with rare tumors can benefit from matched molecular therapy as dictated by their&#xD;
      next-generation sequencing (NGS) results. The study leverages a remote consent and&#xD;
      participation approach to open enrollment to all patients with rare tumors within the United&#xD;
      States. Traditional, site-based patient consenting and participation is also available for&#xD;
      enrollment to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will undergo comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) by Foundation Medicine&#xD;
      Inc. (FMI) of their tumor as well as plasma circulating cell-free DNA. Plasma circulating&#xD;
      cell-free DNA may be additionally collected for repeat CGP at various timepoints during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CGP findings will be provided by FMI directly to the treating physician and study sponsor&#xD;
      TargetCancer Foundation (TCF), with TCF presenting cases with genomic findings to the Virtual&#xD;
      Molecular Tumor Board (VMTB). The VMTB will analyze the findings and provide a written report&#xD;
      to the treating physician on recommended treatments and/or relevant clinical trials; the&#xD;
      treating physician makes all treatment decisions. The resultant treatments and treatment&#xD;
      responses will be tracked longitudinally during the term of this study, thus linking&#xD;
      molecularly informed treatments to specific patient outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>The primary feasibility endpoint is the percent of participants who receive a molecularly targeted matched treatment after recommendation from the VMTB.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS) among participants who received the molecularly targeted matched treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the progression-free survival (PFS) among participants who received the molecularly targeted matched treatment. Kaplan-Meier estimates will be constructed for time-to-event endpoints, including progression-free survival (PFS). Cox regression analysis will be applied to model PFS by putative covariates such as performance status, type of tumor, prior lines of treatment, and whether matched treatments are received.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of Tumor Biomarker Profiling to Treatment Outcome.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor molecular profiles will be correlated to treatment outcome, assessed by measures including the response rate, the rate of stable disease (SD)&gt;6 months/partial response (PR)/complete response (CR), progression-free survival (PFS), PFS ratio (comparison of the PFS used after molecular profiling to PFS on prior treatment), time to treatment failure, and overall survival. Kaplan-Meier estimates will be constructed for time-to-event endpoints, including overall survival (OS).</description>
