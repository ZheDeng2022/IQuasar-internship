  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease has innumerous motor symptoms that impacting on the functional level of&#xD;
      the patient, such as impairment in functional mobility and balance . Previous studies have&#xD;
      already aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of whole body vibration, but without&#xD;
      methodological criteria. The use of whole body vibration may be an alternative for the&#xD;
      treatment of Parkinson's disease. Therefore, the objective of the study is to verify which&#xD;
      frequency of vibration is able to improve the balance and mobility of patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

      After confirming the eligibility criteria, patients will be asked to sign the informed&#xD;
      consent form. Subsequently, they will be randomly allocated to three groups: (i) group 6 Hz:&#xD;
      full body vibration (frequency 6 Hz, amplitude 4 mm, five cycles lasting 1 minutes and&#xD;
      interval between cycles of 1 minute) , (ii) 25 Hz group: full body vibration (25 Hz&#xD;
      frequency, 4 mm amplitude, five cycles lasting 1 minute and interval between 1 minute cycles)&#xD;
      and (iii) sham group: The sham vibration will be performed with the platform disconnected.&#xD;
      Additionally, a sound device will be connected producing a noise similar to that of the&#xD;
      connected platform for a time equivalent to that of the treatment protocol. The patient will&#xD;
      be instructed to position himself standing on the platform, with a semi knee flexion in order&#xD;
      that the vibration wave does not propagate to the head. The allocation will be made randomly&#xD;
      among individuals, using a random sequence table generated by the website&#xD;
      www.randomization.com. There will be a washout time of at least one week between one&#xD;
      intervention and another. All evaluations took place inside the laboratory, which has all the&#xD;
      equipment for the evaluation. The evaluations will take place immediately before the&#xD;
      intervention and immediately after.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Static and dynamic balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Before (T0) and immediate after vibration (T1)</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of static and dynamic balance using the Biodex Balance System (BBS) tool, capable of evaluating the displacement of the center of mass in the anteroposterior and laterolateral axes on a circular platform that can oscillate up to 20 ° in all directions in the horizontal plane. Static balance was performed using the Postural Stability Test, while dynamic balance was assessed using the Limits of Stability Test. The MiniBest test was performed to assess dynamic balance. The test consists of the application of 14 tasks that measure the patient's dynamic balance in different positions, through 14 items, with scores ranging from zero to two</description>

    <description>The indirect center of pressure (COP) was acquired by the baropodometric static platform (Sensor Medica). The patient was instructed to position himself on the platform with his arms relaxed along his body, in the usual posture and looking towards the horizon, with a postural adaptation time of 30 seconds. The collection started without being informed to the patient. The averages of the three acquisitions of the following measures were analyzed of center of pressure</description>
