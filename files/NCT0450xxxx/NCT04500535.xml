    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to describe the following, for each cohort, in real world&#xD;
      conditions in France:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The characteristics and treatment sequence of patients treated with nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effectiveness of nivolumab treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The safety profile of nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment patterns (e.g. duration of treatment, subsequent treatments) of nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in patients treated with nivolumab, at baseline and&#xD;
           during follow up using the EuroQoL-5D-3L&#xD;

        The target population will be constituted using multistage sampling, in which physicians&#xD;
        (pulmonologists and/or oncologists) from eligible hospitals are to identify and recruit the&#xD;
        participants. Eligible hospitals will be selected among PMSI sites (national hospital&#xD;
        discharge database) and only hospitals with a minimum of 40 patients treated for lung&#xD;
        cancer and with chemotherapy in 2018 will be considered to ensure sufficient enrollment.&#xD;
