    <textblock>
      To study the efficacy of adding Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) to&#xD;
      selected physical therapy exercise program on pain in patients with pudendal neuralgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty-two male participants with chronic pudendal neuralgia (30-50 years) shared in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: patients were assigned randomly into two groups equal in number; study and control&#xD;
      groups with 26 patients in each. All patients were receiving the same physical therapy&#xD;
      exercise program, in addition to the same prescribed analgesic medication. Patients in the&#xD;
      study group received additional TENS therapy and those in the control group received sham&#xD;
      TENS. Treatment was provided three sessions per week for twelve successive weeks. The&#xD;
      participants underwent baseline and post treatment assessment for pain level as measured by&#xD;
      three methods; Serum Cortisol Level (SCL), Daily Etodolac intake dose (DEID), and Numerical&#xD;
      Pain Rating Scale (NPRS).&#xD;

    <description>All patients were receiving the same physical therapy exercise program, 3 times per week for 12 weeks in the form of pelvic floor relaxation exercises, diastasis correction exercises , myofascial trigger points release, connective tissue manipulation and progressive abdominal strengthening exercises. Pelvic floor relaxation exercises included pelvic floor release stretches, Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation technique, and pelvic floor drop exercises in addition to TENS therapy The standard protocol for TENS therapy in this group was 20 minutes of 100 Hz frequency, pulse duration of 200 Âµsec, three times a week for successive 12 weeks</description>
