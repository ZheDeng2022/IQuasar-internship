  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation&#xD;
      study to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of GMA301 Injection in healthy subjects. Two&#xD;
      sequential dosing cohorts (at ascending dose fashion), each with 6 subjects receiving GMA301&#xD;
      Injection and 2 subjects receiving placebo (total of 16 subjects), will be given single&#xD;
      doses. The doses to be administered in the two cohorts will be 1500 mg and 2000 mg&#xD;
      respectively, or matching placebo&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study is an extension of the previous study #1010218 (ACTRN12618000121268) to&#xD;
      further explore the safety and PK profile of GMA301 injection at higher dosage. The SRC&#xD;
      (Safety Review Committee) will be responsible for the assessment of safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      PK data for each dose level and to make decisions with regards to study progression. A&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written after finalizing the protocol and prior to&#xD;
      database lock. The SAP will detail the implementation of all the planned statistical analyses&#xD;
      in accordance with the principal features stated in the protocol. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).&#xD;
