      The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness and safety of camrelizumab combined&#xD;
      with apatinib mesylate in the treatment of relapsed platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian&#xD;
      cancer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anti-PD-1 drug camrelizumab combined with apatinib mesylate was used to treat relapsed&#xD;
      platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer, and the effectiveness and safety of the&#xD;
      treatment plan was evaluated by objective remission rate, progression-free survival, and&#xD;
      major safety indicators , so as to provide patients a more beneficial treatment plan.&#xD;
