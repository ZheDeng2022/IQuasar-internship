  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If surgical treatment is not possible in patients with malignant obstruction in the common&#xD;
      bile duct, placing metal stents using endoscopy is a standardized treatment to resolve&#xD;
      biliary obstruction. The metal stent is located in the bile duct to cover the stenotic&#xD;
      portion by malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lower end of the metal stent can be located inside the common bile duct above the major&#xD;
      ampulla or in the duodenum through the major ampulla. These two procedures with supra- or&#xD;
      trans-papillary stents are currently being performed in general clinical practices, depending&#xD;
      on the preference of the endoscopists. Until now, the comparison of the clinical results of&#xD;
      the two procedures has been scarcely studied, and there is no prospective study yet.&#xD;
      Therefore, researchers aim to compare the clinical results of two stent procedures through&#xD;
      prospective randomized controlled studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If surgical treatment is not possible in patients with malignant obstruction in the common&#xD;
      bile duct, endoscopic metal stent placement to resolve biliary obstruction is a standard&#xD;
      treatment that is commonly performed. The metal stents relieve the bile duct stenosis by&#xD;
      malignant tumors, helping to drain the bile and improving jaundice. There is no doubt that&#xD;
      the center of the metal stent is located in the central part of the biliary stricture, but&#xD;
      the location of the lower end of the metal stent is not fixed. The lower end of the metal&#xD;
      stent can be located in two main locations, either in the common bile duct above the major&#xD;
      ampulla or in the duodenum through the major ampulla. These procedures with supra- or&#xD;
      trans-papillary stents are performed in common and are determined by the operator's&#xD;
      preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to several retrospective studies so far, trans-papillary metal stents were&#xD;
      effective in improving the initial biliary obstruction, but there was no difference in their&#xD;
      long-term effects. Mao et al. showed that trans-papillary metal stents increase jaundice-free&#xD;
      survival, and Shin et al. revealed the advantages of trans-papillary metal stents because&#xD;
      they had a high success rate of secondary endoscopic procedures. On the contrary, Okamoto et&#xD;
      al. showed that acute cholangitis more developed after trans-papillary metal stents&#xD;
      placement, while Joe et al. revealed the advantages of supra-papillary metal stents because&#xD;
      they reduce acute pancreatitis after the procedures. It has not yet been determined which&#xD;
      method is effective. So far studies are all retrospective, and some of them placed the metal&#xD;
      stents in a percutaneous way rather than endoscopy without sphincterotomy. Besides, some&#xD;
      studies included intra-hepatic or hilar bile duct strictures, making it difficult to&#xD;
      interpret the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, through a prospective randomized controlled study, the researchers want to compare&#xD;
      the clinical results of supra- and trans-papillary metal stents placed by endoscopes in&#xD;
      malignant common bile duct obstruction.&#xD;
