  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is autosomal recessive, genetic disorder cause of cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      transmembrane regulatory (CFTR) gene mutation. CF often is observed in caucasian population.&#xD;
      CFTR protein in cell apical membrane is canal responsible of transport sodium and clorid&#xD;
      ions. Impaired sodium ion transport causes production viscous mucus. Disease include problems&#xD;
      such as mucus, breathlessness and coughing. Blood glucose levels fluctuation are observed.&#xD;
      This study aims comparison between lung function, functional capacity, muscle strength,&#xD;
      physical activity, physical fitness and activities of daily living activities in cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis with and without abnormal glucose tolerance&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Distance of 6 minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>28 week</time_frame>
    <description>Distance of 6 minute walk test assesing functional capacity made on flat corridor with speed is determined from participant. She/he walks during 6 minute on this corridor as quickly as possible.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lung function</measure>
    <time_frame>28 week</time_frame>
    <description>Lung function will be assesed for standardization procedure in Cystic fibrosis. Acceptible outcome will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>28 week</time_frame>
    <description>Both inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength wil be evaluated at least three times in Cystic fibrosis. Mouth pressure device will be used for evaluate. The highest value for MIP and MEP will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quadriceps muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>28 week</time_frame>
    <description>Quadriceps muscle strength will be assessed least three times in children with cystic fibrosis. hand held dynamometer will be used for assessing quadriceps muscle strength. The highest value for each side will be recorded and used for analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Handgrip</measure>
    <time_frame>28 week</time_frame>
    <description>Handgrip will be assessed in Cystic fibrosis using hand dynamometer (Jamar hand dynamometer). Assessing will be repeated three times end mean of three measurement will be calculated and used for analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity levels</measure>
    <time_frame>28 week</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be evaluated with Bouchard physical activity record. This activity recorder is evaluated every 15 min in a day. Two weekday and one weekend day are recorded with made activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>28 week</time_frame>
    <description>Physical fitness is measured with Munich physical fitness test battery. This battery vertial jump, bouncing ball, flexibilty, climbing, throwing bag, step up test are included in battery. the battery evaluates such as strength, endurance, speed, flexibilty, coordination, power.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Distance of shuttle walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>28 week</time_frame>
    <description>Distance of shuttle walk test will be walked by children with cystic fibrosis. Shuttle walk test is made on floor with ten meters distance. Speed is determined according to signals from CD player.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time of activities of daily living test</measure>
    <time_frame>28 week</time_frame>
    <description>Activities of daily living will be tested with the Glittre ADL test. This test includes five repeated cycles that includes sitting, walk, step up and changing place of object on bookshelf in test procedure. The total completion time of five cycles will be recorded and used for analysis</description>
