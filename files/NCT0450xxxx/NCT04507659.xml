    <measure>Assessment of Spondylo Arthritis International Society 20%（ASAS20）</measure>
    <time_frame>week 16</time_frame>
    <description>ASAS 20 response is a validated composite assessment, reflecting the proportion of treated patients who achieve within a defined time frame at least 20% improvement in score in at least 3 of a conventional set of 4 clinical domains relevant to AS and no worsening in the fourth domain.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 2,4,8,12,16,20,24,32</time_frame>
    <description>It assess the disease activity. It was evaluated with a 6-question questionnaire. After taking the answer of each question out of 10, the total of the points was calculated by dividing the number of questions.The score range was 0-10, the low score meant that the spinal movement was better.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index (BASFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 2,4,8,12,16,20,24,32</time_frame>
    <description>It assess functional status. It was evaluated with a 10-question questionnaire.The score range was 0-10, the low score meant that the spinal movement was better. After taking the answer of each question out of 10, the total of the points was calculated by dividing the number of questions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline in Bath ankylosing spondylitis metrology index (BASMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 2,4,8,12,16,20,24,32</time_frame>
    <description>It characterises the spinal mobility of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Cervical rotation, tragus-wall distance, lateral lumbar flexion, anterior lumbar flexion (modified schober), intermalleolar distance were measured. The score range was 0-10, the low score meant that the spinal movement was better.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline in Ankylosing spondylitis quality of life（ASQoL）</measure>
    <time_frame>week 2,4,8,12,16,20,24,32</time_frame>
    <description>It evaluates quality of life. Each statement on the ASQoL (18-item) is given a score of &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot;. A score of &quot;1&quot; is given where the item is affirmed, indicating adverse QoL. All item scores are summed to give a total score or index. Scores can range from 0 (good QoL) to 18 (poor QoL).</description>
