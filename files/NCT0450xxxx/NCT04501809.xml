      it is a randomized controlled trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Vaginal Misoprostol&#xD;
      versus combined Intracervical Foley's Catheter and Oxytocin Infusion for Second Trimester&#xD;
      Pregnancy Termination. the patients will be sorted into 2 groups, Group I (Misoprostol&#xD;
      group): seventy-nine patients and Group II (Combined group): seventy- nine patients. safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of the procedure will be followed up and documented.&#xD;

      Design: prospective randomized controlled trial Sitting: department of Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynecology Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt Sample size calculation:&#xD;
      thoroughly reviewing the use of vaginal misoprostol and intracervical Foleys catheter alone&#xD;
      or in combination for mid trimester pregnancy termination, Rezk et al 2014 showed that the&#xD;
      percentage of complications &quot;fever and diarrhea&quot; in the first group (misoprostol) was 30 %&#xD;
      versus complications in the second group (intra cervical Foleys group)&quot; cervical laceration&#xD;
      &quot;was 13.3 %. Therefore, at confidence level 95% and power 80%, using Epi info 7 the Sample&#xD;
      size will be one hundred fifty-eight (158) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants: the study will include women indicated for termination of pregnancy&#xD;
      between 14weeks-23 weeks and 6 days of gestation. The investigators will involve patients&#xD;
      with a singleton pregnancy with one or multiple cesarean delivery. The investigators will&#xD;
      exclude all patients with critical co-morbidities: bleeding disorders, chorioamnionitis,&#xD;
      low-lying placenta, rupture uterus, myomectomy and contraindication to misoprostol or latex&#xD;
      allergy. All women will undergo history taking, general examination, and local assessment for&#xD;
      the cervix. Departmental US to confirm the diagnosis and indication for termination and&#xD;
      position of the placenta. Blood tests will be done including blood group, full blood count&#xD;
      matching, Antibodies screening and viral markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: After meeting eligibility criteria all participants will be counseled to the&#xD;
      clinical trial. A signed documented consent form will be attached to their medical records.&#xD;
      The patients will be sorted into two groups using a computerized random number generator in a&#xD;
      sequence of sealed, numbered opaque envelopes, with a 1:1randomization ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I (Misoprostol group): seventy-nine patients will receive a loading dose of moistened&#xD;
      misoprostol tablets (cytotec pfizer 400 mg) inserted vaginally and it will be followed by&#xD;
      maintenance dose (200 mg) after six hours and repeated every 4 hours till the start of&#xD;
      effective uterine contraction with maximum five doses in 24 hours duration .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II (Combined group): seventy- nine patients will get intracervical Foleys Catheter&#xD;
      insertion .Exposure of the cervix by means of a sterile speculum, a 16F Foley catheter will&#xD;
      be introduced into the cervical canal to induce cervical ripping. The catheter will be fixed&#xD;
      through inflation of the balloon with 30 milliliters of sterile solution when the catheter&#xD;
      will be beyond the internal cervical os. Slight traction of the catheter will be exerted&#xD;
      through tapping it to the inner thigh. After six hours of Foleys catheter fixation, The&#xD;
      investigators will start infusion of 10 IU of oxytocin on 500 ml ringer lactate by rate 125&#xD;
      ml\hr followed by one hour rest to allow diuresis. Increased gradually of oxytocin dose by&#xD;
      5IU each time until achieving regular uterine contraction, maximum five doses in twenty -four&#xD;
      hours duration. Therefore the maximum dose of oxytocin 100 IU over 24 hrs duration to avoid&#xD;
      water intoxication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failed induction of abortion is considered if no fetal expulsion occurred within twenty for&#xD;
      hours from the use of primary method of termination. The Demographic data and serial clinical&#xD;
      monitoring will be recorded by the assigned on duty registrar.&#xD;
