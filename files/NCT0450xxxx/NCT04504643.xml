  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Understanding how to delay age-related physical and mental declines is an issue for aging&#xD;
      research. It has been shown that isolated aerobic, coordination and cognitive training&#xD;
      improve brain functions and cognitive performances. Moreover, the combination of them leads&#xD;
      to greater effects. Different combination modalities are possible: training programs&#xD;
      demanding cognitive resources within the activity performed in a natural environment like&#xD;
      Nordic Walking (or Tai chi, Dance...); or as in a conceptually-grounded circuit training&#xD;
      where training components are systematically combined and their intensity controlled. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to compare three training programs: a Nordic walking one (NW), and two&#xD;
      conceptual grounded, circuits training (CT-c; CT-fit). CT-c implemented by dual-task (DT)&#xD;
      exercises, while CT-fit characterized by cognitive charge embodied in the movements through&#xD;
      the use of technology. An improvement in physical, motor, and cognitive functions is expected&#xD;
      by all three groups. However, our primary hypothesis is that the CT-fit will impact executive&#xD;
      functions more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      45 healthy independent living community dwellers participants aged 65 to 80 will be&#xD;
      recruited. Participants will be included after a general medical examination (geriatric&#xD;
      screening and cycle-ergometer maximal effort test). The main exclusion criteria are signs of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, (MMSE &lt;26/30), and physical impairments. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      divided into the 3 groups (NW, CT-c, CT-fit): The training program will last 8 weeks, 1 hour&#xD;
      3 times a week. Pre and post-tests will include cognitive assessment (MoCA; TMT; Stroop task,&#xD;
      Happy Neuron™ working memory test, Rey Complex Figure copy task and dual-task capacities&#xD;
      through the DT-OTMT); motor fitness assessment (Bipedal upright standing, Unipedal balance&#xD;
      test, walking speed and size of the base of support, Timed Up &amp; Go, Chair sit and reach test&#xD;
      and Four square stepping test) and physical assessment (10 m incremental shuttle walking&#xD;
      test, maximal handgrip force, 30s chair rise stand).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving cognitive functions by adding new technology embodied in a systematically combined&#xD;
      training (exergame), would result to be the best solution to optimize training for aging&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
