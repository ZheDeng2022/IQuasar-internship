  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is aimed in this study to examine the changes in brain blood supply and oxygenation in&#xD;
      neonatal premature babies who have anemia and who underwent erythrocyte suspension&#xD;
      transfusion in the light of original guidelines by means of obtaining measurements with the&#xD;
      help of cranial doppler ultrasonography and near-infrared spectroscopy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anemia in newborn babies is defined as the mean of hemoglobin values according to postnatal&#xD;
      age is below 2 standard deviations. Disruption in tissue perfusion and oxygenation,&#xD;
      hyperdynamic cardiac failure, increase in need of oxygen, increase in respiratory effort,&#xD;
      inability to be separated from mechanical ventilation, failure to thrive, paleness, increase&#xD;
      in frequency of morbidities of prematurity (necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of&#xD;
      prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, etc.) may be seen as a result of progressive&#xD;
      anemia. When critical hemoglobin values are reached in premature newborn babies with&#xD;
      concomitant disruption of tissue oxygenation, transfusion is performed with erythrocyte&#xD;
      suspensions. The main goal here is to correct impaired tissue oxygenation, provide perfusion&#xD;
      in sufficient quantity, and prevent anemia-related morbidities. Although frequently applied,&#xD;
      there is no consensus in our country and in the world regarding threshold hemoglobin values&#xD;
      and supporting parameters for transfusions. As a result, there are no guidelines prepared for&#xD;
      newborns based on evidence with clearly defined borders and accepted by everyone. Many&#xD;
      countries and centers implement different transfusion protocols based on their experience.&#xD;
      Given the risk of oxygen radical damage and associated diseases as a result of erythrocyte&#xD;
      transfusions (infections, bone marrow suppression, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of&#xD;
      prematurity, etc.), there is a need to develop new methods for taking and supporting&#xD;
      transfusion decision, and to prepare more objective and more accepted guidelines. The origin&#xD;
      of our study is the subsequent protective compensation mechanisms after deterioration in&#xD;
      brain oxygenation due to symptomatic anemia in premature newborn babies. For these reasons,&#xD;
      it is aimed to examine the changes in brain blood supply and oxygenation in neonatal&#xD;
      premature babies who have anemia and who underwent erythrocyte suspension transfusion in the&#xD;
      light of original guidelines by means of obtaining measurements with the help of cranial&#xD;
      doppler ultrasonography and near-infrared spectroscopy.&#xD;

    <measure>Gradual improvement in middle cerebral artery flow patterns obtained by cranial doppler ultrasound imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>Cranial doppler ultrasonography measurements will be obtained immediately before and 4 hours after the trasfusions.</time_frame>
    <description>After a critical point, the cerebral oxygenation will be compromised due to anemia in spite of normal compensation mechanisms of cerebral vasculature. Erythrocyte suspension transfusion will help to normalize altered cerebral blood flow. It is hypothesized that these changes can be detected by cranial doppler ultrasonography as follows: Middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity and flow volume will be increased before transfusion, possibly indicating the need of intervention. Four hours after transfusion, middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity and flow volume will gradually fall and reach eventually a steady normal state. This in turn may also serve to better understand the effectiveness of the transfusion.</description>

    <description>After a critical point, the cerebral oxygenation will be compromised due to anemia in spite of normal compensation mechanisms of cerebral vasculature. Erythrocyte suspension transfusion will help to normalize altered cerebral blood flow. It is hypothesized that these changes can be measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as follows: Regional cerebral oxygen saturations (cSO2) will be low before transfusion, possibly indicating the need of intervention. During transfusion time of 2 hours, cSO2 will rise gradually and reach eventually a steady normal state in 4 hours after transfusion. This in turn may also serve to better understand the effectiveness of the transfusion.</description>
