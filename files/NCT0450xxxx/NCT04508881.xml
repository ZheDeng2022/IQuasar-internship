      Objectives: To compare the intraluminal stenting and external ligation of Ahmed Glaucoma&#xD;
      Valve (AGV) regarding refractory glaucoma management and postoperative hypotony prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: This randomized clinical trial included 30 eyes of 25 patients (age&#xD;
      range: 44-56 y) with refractory glaucoma. This study was conducted during the period from&#xD;
      September 2018 to January 2020. The study included two groups, AGV with intraluminal stenting&#xD;
      group (n=15) and AGV with external ligation group (n=15). Follow up continued to a year post&#xD;
      operation. The primary outcome was Intraocular pressure (IOP) and its association with the&#xD;
      number of postoperative glaucoma medications. IOP ≤ 21 mmHg without medications announced&#xD;
      complete success while IOP ≤ 21 mmHg with medications indicated qualified success. IOP of &lt;6&#xD;
      mmHg defined hypotony.&#xD;

      Introduction: Refractory glaucoma is a complicated type of glaucoma difficult to be treated.&#xD;
      This type is characterized by high IOP with a high resistance to be reduced by traditional&#xD;
      medical or surgical therapy. Shunt surgery improve trabeculectomy poor long term outcomes in&#xD;
      refractory glaucoma.1 AGV, a shunt device, is used either from the start or after&#xD;
      conventional procedures failure in refractory glaucoma. It helps the aqueous humour flow&#xD;
      direct in the silicone tube.2 AGV is effective in reducing the postoperative hypotony&#xD;
      commonly seen in non valved implants however the presence of persistent hypotony is still a&#xD;
      problem after AGV.3 Persistent hypotony after AGV is caused by over-priming the tube and&#xD;
      excessive manipulation of the valve housing that may damage the valve mechanism, the outflow&#xD;
      of aqueous humour around the silicone tube immediately post-operatorive after the utilization&#xD;
      of a 22 or 23G needle in creation of the sclerostomy and ciliary body function failure&#xD;
      post-surgery in complicated eyes in which AGV is used. 4-5 closure of the tube by ligation or&#xD;
      stenting may be needed when postoperative ocular hypotony occurs. 6 Enough and expected&#xD;
      outflow control may not be induced by ligation of the tube at a focal area. 7 postoperative&#xD;
      ocular hypotony could be managed effectively by Ab interno tube stenting. 8-10 Patients and&#xD;
      Methods: Thirty eyes with refractory glaucoma were included in randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. Patients aged from 44 to 56 years old. Despite of tolerated medication after previous&#xD;
      trabeculectomy surgery, those patients had high intraocular pressure (IOP). Approval of&#xD;
      institutional research board committee was taken. Two groups were studied; AGV with&#xD;
      intraluminal stenting group (n=15 eyes) and AGV with external ligation group (n=15 eyes).&#xD;
      Follow- up to one year after the surgery was done. The primary outcome was Intraocular&#xD;
      pressure (IOP) and its association with the number of postoperative glaucoma medications. IOP&#xD;
      ≤ 21 mmHg without medications announced complete success while IOP ≤ 21 mmHg with medications&#xD;
      indicated qualified success. IOP of &lt;6 mmHg defined hypotony. All patients preoperatively&#xD;
      were subjected to IOP measurement using Goldman applanation tonometer, visual acuity&#xD;
      assessment (VA) using Snellen E chart, visual field analysis (VF) by Humphrey visual field&#xD;
      analyzer, Angle examination by goniolens, optic disc examination by Volk+90 lens, sit lamp&#xD;
      examination for assessment of corneal clarity and any corneal touch with the tube and&#xD;
      anterior chamber depth. All patients had peribulbar anaesthesia. Operative technique: in&#xD;
      group I, incision of superior-temporal conjunctiva was carried out, appropriate cauterization&#xD;
      and approximately at 10 mm posterior to the corneal limbus, the valve body plate was placed.&#xD;
      Forceps was used to insert A 7-0 prolene thread into the tube lumen; the prolene 7-0 thread&#xD;
      was cut with scissors making it along the tube length to remove it when needed. (Figure 2) In&#xD;
      group II, the same as in group I but 8-0 vicryl was used to ligate the tube with the&#xD;
      underlying sclera in addition to usage of two interrupted prolene 7-0 sutures applied 2mm&#xD;
      apart over the tube itself to make partial occlusion and then entered into the anterior&#xD;
      chamber. (Figure 3) Postoperative treatment with combined antibiotic and steroid eye drops&#xD;
      every four hours in the first week followed by 2 weeks gradual tapering. IOP, VA, VF, optic&#xD;
      disc examination by Volk+90 lens, slit lamp examination were the follow-up parameters.&#xD;
      Failure was considered if the patient needed to implant removal, added glaucoma surgery, or&#xD;
      developed phthisis bulbi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Data were statistically analyzed by SPSS version 22(SPSS Inc., Chicago,&#xD;
      IL, USA). Non-paired t test and Mann-Whitney were applied to quantitative variables. Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test was applied to qualitative variables. Correlation was used to assess strength and&#xD;
      direction of association. Less than 0.05 P value was set to be significant.&#xD;
