  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase II -Proof of Concept study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of poractant alfa (Curosurf®), administered by endotracheal (ET) instillation in adult&#xD;
      hospitalized patients with SARS-COV-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, open-label, randomized phase II proof of concept study. The efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of poractant alfa will be evaluated in terms of ventilatory free days during the&#xD;
      21 days after randomization, in adult patients with ARDS due to SARS-COV-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient randomized to the study treatment will receive three administrations of Curosurf&#xD;
      ® with a 24 hours dosing interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment collection will last until day 28 when the evaluation will occur at the ICU,&#xD;
      or by phone call if the patient has been discharged before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy patients will be randomized in the study with a ratio 3:2 (i.e. 42 patients in the&#xD;
      poractant alfa arm and 28 in the control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control arm population is treated as per Standard of Care (SoC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in UK, US and Italy.&#xD;
