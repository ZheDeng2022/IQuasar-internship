    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the stability and efficacy after administration of&#xD;
      [177Lu]Ludotadipep in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC),&#xD;
      with dose-escalation applied to determine the appropriate dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      [18F]PSMA PET/CT is conducted at the 2nd screening and only PSMA PET/CT positive patients can&#xD;
      be enrolled (PSMA RADS 4 or more).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose is administered by differentiated into 5 groups (6 subjects each) and sequentially&#xD;
      elevated starting from a low dose to a high dose (50±5 mCi, 75±8 mCi, 100±10 mCi, 125±13 mCi,&#xD;
