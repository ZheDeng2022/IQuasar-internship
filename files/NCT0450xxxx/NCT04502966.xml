  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether the combination of grass allergen&#xD;
      sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) and dupilumab for 2 years is more effective than double&#xD;
      placebo in suppressing the nasal allergen challenge (NAC) response to grass pollen at 1 year&#xD;
      after completion of study medication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (masked) placebo-controlled trial in adults (N=108 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled) with moderate to severe seasonal allergic rhinitis and allergic sensitization to&#xD;
      grass pollen. Eligible participants who demonstrate a positive response defined by a Total&#xD;
      Nasal Symptom Score [TNSS] ≥ 5 (Scale 0-12 in response to a Nasal Allergen Challenge [NAC]&#xD;
      with grass pollen extract), will be randomized to one of the following 3 groups in a 1:1:1&#xD;
      ratio:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grass allergen sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) + dupilumab (n=36)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grass allergen SLIT +dupilumab placebo (n=36)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grass allergen SLIT placebo + dupilumab placebo (n=36)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grazax® is a sublingual grass allergen immunotherapy product approved for clinical use in the&#xD;
      United Kingdom and will be used as SLIT in this study. Grazax (and its matching placebo) will&#xD;
      be self-administered daily by participants for a duration of two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dupixent®is the brand name for dupilumab and is a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin&#xD;
      4 (IL-4) receptor. Dupilumab (and its matching placebo) will be administered every two weeks&#xD;
      by subcutaneous injection through for a duration of two years, administered by study&#xD;
      personnel. The treatment phase of two years will be followed by an observation phase of 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;

The Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) is a participant-reported composite symptom assessment of 4 symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching and sneezing), each scored on a scale from 0 to 3 where 0 = none, 3 = severe. TNSS total score is calculated as the sum of the response for all 4 individual nasal symptom scores and can range from a minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 12: a higher score indicates more severe symptoms.</description>

Grazax® is formulated as a freeze-dried oral lyophilisate/orally disintegrating tablet for oromucosal use. The active pharmaceutical ingredient is a standardized allergen extract derived from extraction and purification of grass pollen from timothy grass (Phleum pratense). The biological activity of the allergen is expressed in Standardized Quality Tablet units (SQ-T) units. The Grazax® dosage is one oral lyophilisate (75,000 Standardized Quality Tablet units (SQ-T) or approximately 2800 Bioequivalent allergy units (BAU), a measure of Phleum pratense SQ total biological potency defined by the FDA.</description>
