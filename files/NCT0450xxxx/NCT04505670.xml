  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test effectiveness of donepezil to improve wound healing in&#xD;
      patients with diabetic wounds that have not healed with standard treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized double blind study whereby patients with refractory diabetic&#xD;
      wound healing over 3-6 months will be randomized to ascertain the effect of donepezil&#xD;
      (administration of 5 mg to 10 mg of donepezil daily, orally, over 6 week period) on clinical&#xD;
      wound healing reflecting correction of diabetic microvascular disease of non-healing wounds.&#xD;
      The subjects will be recruited from the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at&#xD;
      Easton's emergency room and inpatients. Subjects will also be recruited from University of&#xD;
      Maryland Shore Medical Group Wound Care and University of Maryland Baltimore Washington&#xD;
      Medical Center's Vascular Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Adult Onset Diabetes Mellitus) and non-healing&#xD;
      ulcers/ wounds refractory to management with topical preparation and local debridement over a&#xD;
      3 to 6 month period prior will randomized to treatment or control group. The study group will&#xD;
      be treated with oral donepezil (5 to 10 mg ). After 3 days of treatment, the dose of&#xD;
      donepezil or placebo will be increased to 10 if no improvements are noted in skin integrity&#xD;
      in the feet or lower extremity. Improvements in capillary refill and vascular edema will&#xD;
      determine increase of donepezil from 5 to 10 mg. All patients will receive topical zinc oxide&#xD;
      20% topically three times a day, an effective topical management of diabetic wounds.&#xD;
      Measurement of wound size and depth will be made prior to treatment. Additionally a color&#xD;
      photograph will be obtained to compare with wound appearance in 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As many patients as required to meet the enrollment numbers shall be screened. Patients will&#xD;
      be monitored daily for blood pressure, glucose levels and heart rate, during the period of&#xD;
      hospitalization. Adjustments in insulin or oral hypoglycemic, blood pressure and heart rate&#xD;
      control medications will occur during this time. Follow up visits will be made as required&#xD;
      and at the end of week 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donepezil shall be orally administered to the study group. Control group will get an orally&#xD;
      administered placebo which is an inert compound, lactulose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wk0 will be the randomization visit. The patients will take the drug for 6 weeks and the last&#xD;
      follow up visit will be the last day of week 6. Follow up at 6 weeks will occur at Shore&#xD;
      Rehab at Easton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any anticholinergic drugs will be eliminated from the patients' medical regimen with the&#xD;
      exception for inhaled anticholinergic. There is no known major contraindication of&#xD;
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (like for eg: galantamine, rivastigmine and donepezil)&#xD;
      Patients shall be monitored closely for vagotonic effect. Acetylcholine is known to have a&#xD;
      vagotonic effect lowering heart rate and blood pressure. Therefore, during the course of&#xD;
      administration of the drug close attention to heart rate and blood pressure will be a&#xD;
      significant part off the clinical management of patients. If the patients are on beta&#xD;
      blockers, their beta blocker dose will be closely monitored and adjusted as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2 antagonist will be used to guard against any possible GI bleed, Pepcid 20mg a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be observed for seizures. The patients will be examined for pulmonary&#xD;
      exacerbation during treatment in the hospital. If the pulmonary status deteriorates they will&#xD;
      be eliminated from the study. The medication administration will not start sooner than 24 hrs&#xD;
      after surgery. Patients shall be observed for exaggerated response from anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photographs of the diabetic wound/ ulcer and HgbA1C will be obtained on introduction to study&#xD;
      and obtained at completion at 6 weeks.&#xD;
