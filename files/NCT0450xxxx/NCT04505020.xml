  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the introduction of a 3D printed&#xD;
      model into the pre and intra-operative planning for arthroscopic femoroacetabular impingement&#xD;
      (FAI) surgery. The RCT will look to place patients into one of two treatment groups: 1)&#xD;
      conventional preoperative imaging (X-ray, CT, and MRI) only and 2) those that have had a 3D&#xD;
      printed model created in addition to the conventional imaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we investigate the use of 3D models during pre and intra-operative planning&#xD;
      could improve the success of hip arthroscopy and reduce the incidence of revision cases. By&#xD;
      adding an adjunct to the common suite of pre-operative imaging modalities (X-ray, MRI and&#xD;
      CT), we can change the surgeon's understanding of each patient's individual morphology with a&#xD;
      tactile physical model. This study will compare the success of hip arthroscopy in patients&#xD;
      with or without 3D printed models (in addition to traditional pre-operative imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-center, blinded observer, randomized controlled trial of 80 patients&#xD;
      performed at the Halifax Infirmary, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Center in Halifax,&#xD;
      Nova Scotia. Patients with cam-type FAI involved in the study will be approached by the&#xD;
      surgeon, Dr. Ivan Wong, or a delegate regarding the study during a pre-operative visit.&#xD;
      Following a detailed discussion of the risks/benefits/alternatives of this study, the patient&#xD;
      will be provided with a copy of the informed consent to review, if they demonstrate an&#xD;
      interest in the study. If the patient wishes to be enrolled in the study, the research team&#xD;
      will obtain patient consent for the study according to the Division of Orthopaedic Surgery&#xD;
      and Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) institutional protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pre-operative period, there will be no additional time requirements for the&#xD;
      participant, except for the informed consent process for the study. Routine X-ray&#xD;
      radiographs, as well as a pre-operative MRI and CT scan, will be obtained for all subjects&#xD;
      undergoing FAI surgery. The participants will not be exposed to any additional radiation.&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a structured clinical examination conducted by a sports medicine&#xD;
      fellowship-trained orthopaedic consultant. The patient will also complete pre-operative&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that have consented to the study will be randomized into two groups with a 50%&#xD;
      chance of being in either group. Randomization will be done with a computer random number&#xD;
      generator. Both groups will undergo routine pre-operative imaging but one group will also&#xD;
      have a 3D print made from the 3D CT reconstruction. All patient groups will undergo hip&#xD;
      arthroscopy for the treatment of their FAI.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients that have consented to the study will be randomized into four groups with a 50% chance of being in either group. The two treatment groups are 1) conventional preoperative imaging (X-ray, CT, and MRI) only 2) those that have had a 3D printed model created in addition to conventional imaging. There will be 40 patients in each group. Randomization will be done with a computer random number generator. Both groups will undergo routine pre-operative imaging but one group will also have a 3D print made from the 3D CT reconstruction. Both patient groups will undergo hip arthroscopy for treatment of their FAI.</intervention_model_description>
