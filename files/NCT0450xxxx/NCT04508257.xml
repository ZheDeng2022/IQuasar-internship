  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel-designed,&#xD;
      prospective trial and is intended to evaluate the nutritive effects of two staged study&#xD;
      formulas on growth and cognitive outcomes. Approximately 450 participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      with the expectation of having 105 participants per group (315 for three groups: control&#xD;
      group, investigational group, and breastfeeding reference group ) complete Study Visit 6 at&#xD;
      365 days of age ± 7 days (allowing for a 30% drop-out rate). Participants will receive stage&#xD;
      1 formulas up to 180 days of age and then switch to stage 2 formulas though 365 days of age.&#xD;
      The study period will include feeding up to 365 days of age and cognitive testing up to 365&#xD;
      days of age. Stool samples will be collected from a subset of participants at enrollment and&#xD;
      at 120 days of age for fecal microbiome analysis.&#xD;
