  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether certain criteria for returning to the field&#xD;
      can be predictive of a return of the athlete to a level of performance similar to that of&#xD;
      before his shoulder injury. In this context, these different criteria will be tested at 6&#xD;
      months in post-surgery while performance monitoring will be carried out at 12, 18 and 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Strength test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months from the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The strength will be assess with a isokinetic device. It will allow to calculate the maximum force of the subject at the level of the rotators of the shoulder. This is a dorsal decubitus test. The subject's arm will be positioned in 90° of abduction of shoulder abduction.&#xD;
In this position, the subject will perform tests at different speeds (60°/s concentric, 240°/s concentric and 60°/s eccentric). This will calculate the maximum force.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months from the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This test will consist of a measurement of the active and passive joint amplitudes of the athlete.&#xD;
Different movements will be tested:&#xD;
flexion, extension, abduction, external rotation elbow to body, hand-back, internal/external rotations at 90° arm abduction in frontal plane.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months from the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Two functional tests will be proposed, one closed chain and the other open chain. Athletes will realize the one that comes closest to their daily practice.&#xD;
The Upper Quarter Y-Balance test will be performed by athletes in closed-chain sports.&#xD;
The second proposed test will be the medicine ball throw.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaire DASH</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months from the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire that athletes will complete will be the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Scale) questionnaire.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Follow-up questionnaire at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 months from the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Athletes will be asked to answer different questions about their performance level since their sports restart at 12, 18 and 24 months post-operation.&#xD;
We will also look into a possible recurrence of injury to their shoulder.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Follow-up questionnaire at 18 months</measure>
    <time_frame>At 18 months from the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Athletes will be asked to answer different questions about their performance level since their sports restart at 12, 18 and 24 months post-operation.&#xD;
We will also look into a possible recurrence of injury to their shoulder.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Follow-up questionnaire at 24 months</measure>
    <time_frame>At 24 months from the surgery</time_frame>

    <description>Patients undergoing instability surgery will perform amplitude, strength, functional tests and a questionnaire at 6 months of the operation. Then they will be contacted at 12, 18 and 24 months to find out if they have regained their performance level or if they have injured their shoulder again.</description>
