  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine if parenterally administered ascorbic acid (Vitamin C)&#xD;
      given at the time of lung transplant is safe. Vitamin C may be an effective intervention&#xD;
      towards primary graft dysfunction (PGD). The study will enroll 69 participants who consent to&#xD;
      the intervention. Participants who do not consent to the intervention will be treated&#xD;
      according to standard-of-care, but may choose to be consented to have their data&#xD;
      retrospectively reviewed. Based on our consent rate, this group may include 40-70&#xD;
      participants. Participants will be on study for up to 12 months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PGD is a frequent and severe outcome that impacts both short- and long-term outcomes after&#xD;
      lung transplantation. Major pathophysiologic contributors include ischemia and reperfusion&#xD;
      injury, mitochondrial dysfunction and endothelial failure. No directed therapy exists.&#xD;
      Vitamin C is a first-line antioxidant that also acts at the endothelium and mitochondria to&#xD;
      decrease permeability and leak, inhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and improve ischemia and&#xD;
      reperfusion. When combined with steroids, part of standard care for lung transplant&#xD;
      recipients, these effects may be enhanced and synergistically inhibit instigators of patient&#xD;
      injury. A pilot trial will ensure safety of this potential intervention and guide future&#xD;
      research into this important outcome measure. It will be readily received in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the present study, vitamin C will be administered parenterally at a dose of 1,500 mg&#xD;
      every 6 hours, a dose that is widely accepted and used in other clinical contexts where the&#xD;
      drug is studied, such as sepsis. This will predictably reconstitute levels and achieve&#xD;
      supratherapeutic benefit towards oxidant scavenging, while avoiding the potential pro-oxidant&#xD;
      effects seen at exceedingly high doses. To this end, the investigators will exclude patients&#xD;
      where the standard dosing of vitamin C will exceed 100 mg/kg/day (excluding patients &lt;60 kg).&#xD;
      Dosing will continue through post-operative day (POD) 3 to effectively assess for the impact&#xD;
      of vitamin C on PGD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether parenterally administered ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is safe in the&#xD;
           lung transplant population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate adherence to ascorbic acid administration protocol in this study population&#xD;
           and to identify obstacles to feasibility of future trials using this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether parenterally administered ascorbic acid (vitamin C) may decrease the&#xD;
           rate and severity of PGD after lung transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the incidence of vitamin C and vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiencies in the&#xD;
           lung transplant population, and the responsiveness of vitamin C levels to our selected&#xD;
           parenteral therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify interventions that will optimize the post-operative wellbeing of patients&#xD;
           receiving lung transplants by decreasing primary graft dysfunction (short and&#xD;
           intermediate-to-long term&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stop Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anuria x 3-hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate, Grade 2 AKI (doubling of baseline creatinine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An acute, unexplained hemoglobin drop of &gt;2 mg/dL&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a pilot single-arm unblinded trial to assess whether parenterally administered ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is safe in the lung transplant population.The investigators will not randomize or control; a retrospective cohort of participants not treated with vitamin C will be reviewed from 2015-2020. Those participants who decline the intervention will have the choice to consent to having their data be considered as part of the (non-retrospective) controls and be considered in our statistical analysis for outcomes, including analysis between this group and the historical controls. All participants who consent will be administered the therapy and participants will be evaluated via an intention-to-treat analysis.</intervention_model_description>
