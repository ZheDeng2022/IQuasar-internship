  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic hepatitis B should maximize the inhibition of HBV replication, which&#xD;
      could reduce the incidence of liver cancer and liver disease-related complications. However,&#xD;
      after 96 weeks of treatment with the first-line drugs, entecavir or tenofovir disoproxil&#xD;
      fumarate, a certain proportion of patients still had low levels of HBV replication. Tenofovir&#xD;
      alafenamide fumarate is a newly marketed anti-hepatitis B drug that is currently considered&#xD;
      to be non-inferior to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and safer bone and renal effects.&#xD;
      Therefore, this research was put forward to investigate whether tenofovir alafenamide&#xD;
      fumarate replacement for hepatitis B had a higher virological response rate and safety in&#xD;
      patients with low levels of virus after 48 weeks of treatment with entecavir and tenofovir&#xD;
      disoproxil fumarate.&#xD;

      Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the research.&#xD;
      The participants will voluntarily choose to enter the experimental group or the control group&#xD;
      with full informed consent. The control group will continue with the original regimen, while&#xD;
      the study group will switch to tenofovir alafenamide fumarate antiviral therapy. Each group&#xD;
      will enroll 100 participants.&#xD;
