  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study builds on earlier work assessing the impact of kindness media on viewers'&#xD;
      emotional responses. Using images of kindness and connection, as well as other content, we&#xD;
      will test its impact on emotions and behavior in the field. The setting is in healthcare,&#xD;
      specifically a pediatric dental clinic. Using simple scales, participants anonymously rate&#xD;
      themselves on a variety of emotions, watch a television for 8 minutes, and then complete the&#xD;
      self-assessment. An honorarium is provided for participation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study builds on the earlier work with a focused application of inspiring content&#xD;
      in health care settings. It is well described that health care providers, including doctors,&#xD;
      nurses, and other staff members) have high rates of burnout, depression, and&#xD;
      suicide-approximately twice that of the general population. In addition to the lower quality&#xD;
      of life for the individual health care provider, this burnout problem has consequences for&#xD;
      the patient, including heightened number of medical errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, of course, also have significant stressors in their lives. Perhaps, those center on&#xD;
      health-related issues, or are more general in nature. In the general population, it is known&#xD;
      that anxiety, perceived stress, opiate abuse, and suicide are all rising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the patients' perspective, it is important to encourage them to adapt behaviors and&#xD;
      attitudes that will benefit themselves as well as others. It has been shown that being kind&#xD;
      and compassionate can yield positive impacts on health: people who volunteer regularly, for&#xD;
      example, have death rates 20-40% lower than those who do not. Another facet of inducing&#xD;
      kindness and compassion is kindness towards oneself. In health care settings, behavioral&#xD;
      modification is very challenging. One way to rethink that approach is teaching and&#xD;
      illustrating to patients how kindness to oneself is a necessity. Kindness to oneself&#xD;
      encompasses following physician instructions as well as general health practice. By providing&#xD;
      inspiring visual content to both patients and providers, it is believed that at least&#xD;
      additive if not synergistic interaction will occur with simultaneous promotion of kindness,&#xD;
      compassion, joy and love for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, multiple publications have pointed to the observation that various types of media&#xD;
      can inspire viewers such that they are &quot;moved&quot; or &quot;touched&quot; or &quot;elevated.&quot; Most of these&#xD;
      studies have focused on the use of single films from several minutes long to full length&#xD;
      feature films.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the above cited research has been done in a laboratory or structured research&#xD;
      setting. While very valuable, this research plan focuses on a &quot;real world&quot; setting, i.e.,&#xD;
      with patients and practitioners at the source in their work environments. The first step is&#xD;
      to measure responses from both providers and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantify the response to videos depicting kindness, compassion, connection, joy, and&#xD;
           love for both patients (or caregivers) and for health care staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare these responses to the standard content that the site uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the impact of these videos on a measure of generosity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Obtain qualitative feedback on the content in the effort to improve the content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Kindness media both moves and provides a significant lift in emotional state for both&#xD;
           sets of viewers (providers and patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compared to what is usually shown, kindness media has significant impact on emotional&#xD;
           state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Viewers will prefer to see more kindness media upon future visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open, randomized, comparator-controlled study of kindness media versus commercial media on&#xD;
      emotions and behavior. Parents and staff of the clinic are recruited as participants. Surveys&#xD;
      with self-ratings are completed before and then after watching either kindness media or&#xD;
      commercial (standard) children's media for 8 minutes.&#xD;
