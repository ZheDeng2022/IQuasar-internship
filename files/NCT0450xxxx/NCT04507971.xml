      Obesity is a condition characterized by an excess amount of body fat, and is defined as a&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m² or greater. The rising prevalence of obesity in all parts&#xD;
      of the world is of great public health concern due to the fact that obesity is associated&#xD;
      with many causes of morbidity and mortality. Excess body fat accumulates when energy intake&#xD;
      is greater than energy expenditure and recently, the role of the colonic microbiome has been&#xD;
      highlighted as a potential contributor to energy balance. The obese microbiome is suggested&#xD;
      to promote obesity due to an excess production of short-chain fatty acids, and, thus,&#xD;
      increased colonic energy availability.&#xD;

    <description>MET-3 is composed of twenty-two strains of bacteria and was designed to treat metabolic syndrome. The strains that were selected are based on strains that are known butyrate producers, associated with healthy subjects and improved gut barrier function. MET-3 is provided in capsule form and 5 capsules will be swallowed by each subject once daily for 4 weeks.</description>

    <description>MET-5 is a new product composed of twenty-six strains of bacteria isolated from the stool of a different healthy donor than MET-3. Although it is expected to work in a similar fashion to MET-3, it contains some strains that are unique in comparison to the original MET-3 formulation and have been associated with leanness in the scientific literature. MET-5 is provided in capsule form and 5 capsules will be swallowed by each subject once daily for 4 weeks.</description>
