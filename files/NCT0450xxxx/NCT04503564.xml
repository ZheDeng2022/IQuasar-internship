  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 1 million patients globally currently manage their Type 1 Diabetes mellitus using&#xD;
      continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with an infusion set that needs to be changed every&#xD;
      3 days. This study will assess the feasibility and device performance of the study device,&#xD;
      the Achilles infusion set over three periods during routine insulin infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 20 participants and has 3 periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 1 (up to 7 days): Trial run with study device with saline infusion. Period 2 (up to 7&#xD;
      days): participants will manage their blood glucose solely with their insulin pump and the&#xD;
      Achilles infusion set. Blood glucose will be closely monitored with a continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring (CGM) device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 3 (up to 7 days): Participants will return to study centre to receive a fresh Achilles&#xD;
      infusion set and continue blood glucose management at home until infusion set failure or 7&#xD;
      days.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, non-randomized, home-use feasibility study of device performance,&#xD;
      usability, tolerability, and safety of the Capillary Biomedical, Inc. (CapBio) Achilles&#xD;
      infusion set for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII or insulin pump therapy) in&#xD;
      up to 20 participants diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CapBio Achilles infusion set is a sterile single use device designed to be used with&#xD;
      commercially available infusion pumps (e.g., Medtronic MiniMed). The investigational Achilles&#xD;
      infusion set contains a coil reinforced soft polymer indwelling cannula with one distal and&#xD;
      three proximal holes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine feasibility and device performance of the&#xD;
      CapBio Achilles infusion set over 2 extended home use wear periods of up to 7 days each&#xD;
      during routine therapeutic insulin infusion. Feasibility is evidenced by the absence of&#xD;
      uncontrolled hyperglycemia and/or suspected infusion set cannula occlusion.&#xD;

    <description>The composite primary objective of this study is to evaluate feasibility and device performance of the Achilles infusion set over three extended home use wear periods of up to 7 days each during routine therapeutic insulin infusion.&#xD;
The composite primary objective of this study will be assessed through Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) readings in coordination with pump data. CGM readings will indicate how well the device performs in terms of insulin absorption, indicated by pump boluses. Therefore, a comparison of time of pump bolus and the CGM readings over the course of two to three hours will be made to asses if the device was successful in delivering insulin to the body to absorb</description>
