  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and feasibility of combined inhalational and intravenous amphotericin B&#xD;
      therapy for the treatment of pulmonary mucormycosis. And compare the efficacy of combined&#xD;
      therapy with that of intravenous amphotericin B alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary mucormycosis is a relatively a rare disease with a high mortality. The&#xD;
      angioinvasion associated with mucormycosis prevents efficient drug delivery at the diseased&#xD;
      site. Inhaled amphotericin B achieves drug levels in lung tissue and has been shown to be&#xD;
      useful in several diseases including chronic pulmonary and allergic bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      aspergillosis. Further inhaled forms of amphotericin B are associated with less&#xD;
      nephrotoxicity and other systemic adverse effects. The role of inhaled amphotericin B in&#xD;
      pulmonary mucormycosis has been previously demonstrated in murine models and anecdotal&#xD;
      reports. The study hypothesis is that combined therapy with inhalational and intravenous&#xD;
      amphotericin B is likely to result in better outcomes as compared with intravenous&#xD;
      amphotericin B alone for treatment of pulmonary mucormycosis&#xD;

    <description>Intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (beginning with 3mg/kg) along with inhaled amphotericin as below: Amp-B deoxycholate 50 mg (Amphotretâ„¢ Bharat serums and vaccines limited), will be dissolved in 10 mL distilled water. 2 mL of the reconstituted amphotericin B solution will be transferred into the drug chamber of a breath actuated nebulizer (Lupineb Ultra kit breath actuated nebulize which contains aeroclipse XL Reusable Breath Actuated Nebulizer and DeVilbiss 3655 compressor). 3 mL of distilled water is added to 2 mL of the reconstituted amphotericin B. The nebulization is continued till the chamber is emptied of the drug or the patient does not tolerate the therapy.&#xD;
The first three doses of amphotericin B nebulization will be under the direct supervision of a physician. If tolerated, nebulization will be continued twice a day till tolerated or till response.The patient will complete a VAS score for cough after nebulization.</description>
