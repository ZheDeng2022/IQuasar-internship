  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microvascular angina (MVA) is caused by abnormalities of the small blood vessels in the&#xD;
      heart. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a chemical messenger that circulates and accumulates in the&#xD;
      blood vessel walls, causing them to narrow or go into spasm and thicken over a long period,&#xD;
      especially as levels of ET-1 increase. As a result, patients experience pain, psychological&#xD;
      distress and limitation of their daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cambridge is a participating recruitment site for a large randomised, double blinded, placebo&#xD;
      controlled crossover trial (the PRIZE study: NCT04097314) investigating Zibotentan as a new&#xD;
      drug treatment for patients with MVA using a 'precision medicine' approach. Zibotentan is a&#xD;
      drug originally developed by Astra Zeneca for prostate cancer but prior research has shown&#xD;
      that it acts to relax the small blood vessels of patients with MVA, highlighting its&#xD;
      potential as a novel therapy for this patient group. The PRIZE study population will be&#xD;
      enriched for 'responders' to the drug by screening patients with MVA for a gene mutation&#xD;
      known to increase levels of circulating endothelin. The trial aims to initially invite&#xD;
      approximately 356 participants for genetic testing but only 100 participants will go forward&#xD;
      into the main study, with approximately 2/3rd being screen failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our sub-study, we will invite patients with MVA who are screen failures at our site for&#xD;
      further blood tests looking for other genetic variants in the ET-1 signalling pathway and&#xD;
      examine how this correlates with the severity of microvascular angina quantified by cardiac&#xD;
      MRI and clinical assessments. Data from this sub-study would provide a bio-resource for&#xD;
      further analysis of the main PRIZE trial to identify other patients that would benefit from&#xD;
      Zibotentan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with microvascular angina (MVA) are under-diagnosed and have limited therapeutic&#xD;
      options available to them. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor implicated in the&#xD;
      small vessel obstruction that causes MVA. The PRIZE trial will apply a precision medicine&#xD;
      approach to assess the therapeutic effect of Zibotentan, an ET-1 antagonist (ETA) selective&#xD;
      for the ETA receptor in patients who are high ET-1 expressors (possessing the PHACTR1 minor&#xD;
      GG allele single nucleotide polymorphism - SNP). Unfortunately, the incidence of this SNP&#xD;
      occurs in only a third of the population, resulting in a high screen-failure rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed sub-study, we aim to recruit patients with MVA but without the minor GG&#xD;
      allele SNP to potentially identify other potential 'responders' to Zibotentan. In an&#xD;
      observational mechanistic study, we will perform baseline genotyping for other genetic&#xD;
      variants in the ET-1 pathway as well as phenotyping patients by quantification of&#xD;
      microvascular disease from retrospective analysis of cardiac MRI data. Patients will also&#xD;
      complete angina and quality of life questionnaires and perform an exercise stress test to&#xD;
      determine maximal exercise distance. Information from this sub-study will provide a genotype&#xD;
      bio-resource that could identify novel SNPs for the pathogenesis of MVA that could be&#xD;
      validated in the UK biobank. This may indicate other ETA receptor antagonist&#xD;
      super-responders, justifying treatment with Zibotentan and enabling more patients with MVA to&#xD;
      potentially benefit from this promising drug.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients who after screening blood tests and clinical assessment are ineligible for the&#xD;
        main PRIZE trial will qualify for this study. Patients will be screened for the PRIZE trial&#xD;
        according to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age &gt;18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Microvascular angina as defined by probable or definitive COVADIS criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able to comply with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Non-cardiovascular exercise-limiting problem e.g. morbid (or severe) obesity (BMI&#xD;
             ≥40.0 kg/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Genotype not available&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding or of child-bearing potential (WoCBP) without a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test and who are unwilling or unable to use highly effective&#xD;
             contraception for the duration of the study treatment and 30 days after the last dose&#xD;
             of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Men who are sexually active with a WoCBP who are unwilling to use condoms or other&#xD;
             highly effective methods of contraception for the duration of study treatment and for&#xD;
             14 weeks after last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Where applicable, patients will be provided with advice on contraception and our&#xD;
             definition of highly effective contraception is taken from previously published&#xD;
             guidance from the MHRA and Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH):&#xD;
             advised contraception methods include the copper intrauterine device, the&#xD;
             levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system and the progestogen implant (as long as&#xD;
             the woman is not taking a medication that may reduce the effectiveness of the&#xD;
             implant). If a combined hormonal method, progestogen only pill or injection is chosen,&#xD;
             then, due to the typical failure rates of these methods, the additional use of a&#xD;
             barrier method such as the male condom will be advised.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Heart failure (New York Heart Association Grade ≥II i.e. mild symptoms and slight&#xD;
             limitation during ordinary activity)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Recent (&lt;3 months) myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A history of epilepsy, other CNS adverse events, neurological symptoms or signs&#xD;
             consistent with spinal cord compression or CNS metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Moderate or more severe renal impairment (GFR &lt; 45 mL/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Liver disease with a Child-Pugh score of A (5-6 points) or higher&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participation in another intervention study involving a drug within the past 90 days&#xD;
             or 5 half-lives whichever is longer (co-enrolment in observational studies is&#xD;
             permitted).&#xD;
