  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological condition, which affects the brain. PD gets worse&#xD;
      over time, but how quickly it progresses varies a lot from person to person. Some symptoms of&#xD;
      PD are tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement. The purpose of this study is to see how&#xD;
      feasible and how satisfied participants/caregivers/investigators are with video-assisted&#xD;
      telenursing use in nurse support programs with LCIG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LCIG is an approved drug to treat PD. Approximately 50 adult participants with advanced PD&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study at approximately 10 sites across the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 2 groups. In one group, around 25 participants will receive nurse support using&#xD;
      video devices. In the second group, around 25 participants will receive nurse support without&#xD;
      using video devices. All participants will attend a baseline visit and follow up visits at&#xD;
      Week 4 and Week 12. The planned observation period will be 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are prescribed LCIG by their physicians will have three study related&#xD;
      visits. Participants, caregivers, and investigators will be asked to complete questionnaires&#xD;
      for the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Participant Acceptance of the AbbVie Duodopa Specialist (ADS) Nurse Support and Communication Access</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participant acceptance is measured by the participant satisfaction with the AbbVie Duodopa Specialist (ADS) nurse support and communication access (Visual Analog Sore from 1 to 10).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Satisfaction With ADS Nurse Support and Communication Access</measure>
    <time_frame>Through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participant Satisfaction is defined as participant satisfaction with the ADS nurse support and communication access at Week 4 (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] scoring from 1 to 10) and at Week 12 (VAS scoring from 8 to 10).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Satisfaction with the ADS Nurse Support and Communication Access</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participant satisfaction with the ADS nurse support and communication access is based on scoring 8 to 10 on a VAS (Binary: Yes/No).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Satisfaction With ADS Nurse Support and Communication Access</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver satisfaction is measured as the satisfaction of caregiver with the ADS nurse support and communication access at weeks 4 and 12 (VAS from 1 to 10).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Acceptance of ADS Nurse Support and Communication Access</measure>
    <time_frame>Through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver acceptance is measured as the acceptance of caregiver with the ADS nurse support and communication access at weeks 4 and 12 (VAS from 1 to 10).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator Satisfaction With Nurse Support</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator satisfaction is measured as the satisfaction of investigator with the nurse support (VAS from 1 to 10).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Satisfaction With Video Functionality of the Device</measure>
    <time_frame>Through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participant satisfaction is defined as the measure of satisfaction of participant with the video functionality of the device specifically at weeks 4 and 12 (VAS from 1 to 10).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Caregiver Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change of caregiver burden will be measured by the Modified Caregiver Strain Index (MCSI). MCSI is a questionnaire comprising of 13 questions around major domains, to be filled by caregivers. The higher the score, the higher the level of caregiver strain. Scoring ranges from 0 to 26, with 0 indicating no strain and 26 indicating extreme strain.</description>
