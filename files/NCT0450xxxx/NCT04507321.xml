  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, single group, non-randomized, two-period, single&#xD;
      sequence, mass balance study which will enroll 6 healthy male participants. This study will&#xD;
      assess the pharmacokinetics, balance/excretion, and metabolism of GSK3640254 in humans using&#xD;
      [14C]-radiolabeled drug substance administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion and via the&#xD;
      oral route. The study will also provide an assessment of GSK3640254 absorption, metabolism&#xD;
      and excretion following administration of a [14C]-radiolabeled oral suspension. Each&#xD;
      participant will be involved in the study for up to 10 weeks which will include a screening&#xD;
      period, two treatment periods (treatment Periods 1 and 2) separated by a washout of at least&#xD;
      13 days between oral doses, and a follow-up visit 7-14 days after the last assessment in&#xD;
      treatment Period 2.&#xD;
