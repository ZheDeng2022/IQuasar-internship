  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research, the investigators are looking at the effects of a drug called metformin may&#xD;
      have on the growth of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)s. AAA is an abnormal enlargement of the&#xD;
      aorta, which is the large artery in the abdomen (stomach area). The enlargement of the aorta&#xD;
      carries a risk that it will rupture and cause life-threatening bleeding in the abdomen&#xD;
      (belly). In this study the investigators hope to learn how metformin is associated with the&#xD;
      enlargement or change in size of the AAA in study participants. Smaller studies have&#xD;
      suggested that metformin may reduce the rate at which aortic aneurysms enlarge. This study&#xD;
      will test this question: does metformin prevent AAAs from growing larger?&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome measure will be the change in maximal orthogonal diameter of the infrarenal aorta, as measured by computed tomographic (CT) aortography, in centimeters.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The change in maximal orthogonal diameter of the infrarenal aorta, as measured by computed tomographic (CT) aortography, over the course of the study in participants taking metformin XR (extended release) vs. placebo. It is calculated as the difference in CTA-determined diameter (in mm) from baseline to the follow-up CT study at the end of study participation, divided by time elapsed between two measurements (e.g., annual rate of change in CT-diameter). The justification for this endpoint is that maximal orthogonal transverse diameter by CTA is the primary standard to measure AAA disease progression, determine need for surgical intervention, and correlate with clinical outcomes.</description>
