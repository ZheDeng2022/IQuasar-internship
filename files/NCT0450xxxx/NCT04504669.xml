      This is a Phase I, First in Human, multicentre, open-label, multiple arm study with dose&#xD;
      escalations and expansions at selected doses. Dose-escalation will occur with AZD8701 in&#xD;
      monotherapy (Part 1) and in combination with durvalumab (Part 3) in selected participants&#xD;
      with HNSCC, TNBC, NSCLC, ccRCC, gastroesophageal cancer, melanoma, cervical cancer,&#xD;
      small-cell lung cancer and/or participants with solid tumours who have demonstrated a&#xD;
      response to prior PD-(L)1 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease specific expansions will occur with a selected dose AZD8701 in participants with&#xD;
      NSCLC (Part 2) and with a selected dose of AZD8701 and durvalumab in participants with TNBC&#xD;
      and clear cell RCC (Part 4).&#xD;
