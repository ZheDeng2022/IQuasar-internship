  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections is known to be a high-risk factor to induce cervical&#xD;
      cancers. To date, EBV-related nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is still a major concern in east&#xD;
      Asia, especially in China. Concurrent therapies for NPC have limited response rate and high&#xD;
      chance of relapse. However, EBV-induced cancers provided an ideal target for T cell-based&#xD;
      immunotherapy due to the non-self origins. Engineered T cells bearing a TCR (TCR-T) that can&#xD;
      specifically recognize the presented LMP2-epitope become a viable approach to treat this type&#xD;
      of cancer. Though engineered T therapies have been well-recognized in hematological cancers,&#xD;
      solid cancer treatment has been a major hurdle due to the immune-suppressive tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment. Interleukin 12 (IL-12) seemed to represent the ideal candidate for tumor&#xD;
      immunotherapy, due to its ability to activate both innate (NK cells) and adaptive (cytotoxic&#xD;
      T lymphocytes) immunities. several clinical studies have been initiated in which IL-12 is&#xD;
      applied as an adjuvant in cancer vaccines, in gene therapy including locoregional injections&#xD;
      of IL-12 plasmid and in the form of tumor-targeting immunocytokines (IL-12 fused to&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies). Therefore, TCR-T cells armed with a IL12-secretion element could&#xD;
      further enhance the efficacy of TCR-T in solid cancers.&#xD;

    <description>Verify the MTD of TCR-T cells for LMP2 antigen for treatment. The first nine patients enrolled in this project will be infused in a dose-climbing approach, with every three patients as a group. The first group of patients returned to 5e+6/kg TCR-T cells, the second group returned to 1e+7/kg TCR-T cells, and the third group returned to 5e+7/kg TCR-T cells. The remaining 11 patients will infused with TCR-Ts in the maximum tolerated dose</description>
