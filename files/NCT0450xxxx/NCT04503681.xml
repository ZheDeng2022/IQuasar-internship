    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with cancer commonly have a high degree of anxiety during an initial&#xD;
      oncology consultation, which may interfere with a patient's ability to retain information&#xD;
      required to make informed treatment decisions. A previous study randomized breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors (volunteers) to view either (a) a brief video depicting a standard initial&#xD;
      consultation from an oncologist or (b) an identical consultation with the addition of&#xD;
      compassionate statements from the oncologist, and found the compassionate statements reduced&#xD;
      anxiety among the volunteers. However, it is currently unknown if watching a video containing&#xD;
      compassionate statements from an oncologist prior to an actual initial oncology consultation&#xD;
      will reduce anxiety among patients referred to a cancer center. The aim of this randomized&#xD;
      control trial is to test if watching a brief video containing compassionate statements from&#xD;
      an oncologist, compared to watching a standard introduction video, prior to an initial&#xD;
      oncology consultation will reduce the degree of anxiety among patients referred to a cancer&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial at an academic cancer center. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll adult patients scheduled for an initial oncology consultation.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a &quot;standard introduction video&quot; or &quot;enhanced&#xD;
      compassion video&quot; for viewing prior to the initial oncology consultation. On arrival to the&#xD;
      cancer center anxiety severity will be measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression&#xD;
      scale (HADS). The HADS has two 7-item subscales (HADS Anxiety and HADS Depression) and is&#xD;
      well-validated among oncology patients. Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used to test for a&#xD;
      difference in the HADS subscales between the two video groups.&#xD;

      Study design This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical&#xD;
      trial at a single university-based cancer center (MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper, Cooper&#xD;
      University Health Care, Camden, New Jersey, USA). Potential subjects will be enrolled at the&#xD;
      time of scheduling an initial cancer consultation. The Cooper University Hospital&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board allowed alteration of the requirements of obtaining informed&#xD;
      consent under 45 CFR 46.116(d) given the intervention was deemed no greater than minimal&#xD;
      risk. All new adult patients scheduled for an initial cancer consultation at MD Anderson&#xD;
      Cancer Center at Cooper will be randomized to receive an email containing a link for either&#xD;
      the &quot;standard introduction video&quot; or the &quot;enhanced compassion video.&quot; Emails will be sent to&#xD;
      patients prior to obtaining informed consent to allow for viewing of the video prior to the&#xD;
      initial oncology consultation and to keep the patients masked to the study hypotheses prior&#xD;
      to the consultation. When the patients arrive to the MD Anderson Cancer Center waiting room&#xD;
      for his/her initial cancer consultation they will be approached by research staff to obtain&#xD;
      written informed consent to complete the research questionnaire and for use of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and masking Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, &quot;standard&#xD;
      introduction video&quot; or &quot;enhanced compassion video.&quot; An independent statistician will generate&#xD;
      the group assignment sequence using a parallel design, 1:1 randomization schedule. Standard&#xD;
      measures will be used to ensure appropriate concealment of group assignment. The&#xD;
      randomization assignments will be kept in a sequential list and maintained in the scheduling&#xD;
      operator office. At the time of scheduling an initial consultation, appointment operators&#xD;
      will identify the next assignment in the series, which will be labeled either &quot;Video A&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;Video B.&quot; The operators will then send the appropriate email containing a link to a website&#xD;
      for the matching video. The independent statistician will maintain the code link for the&#xD;
      videos. Thus, the operators, investigators, and research statistician will be blinded to&#xD;
      video allocation until after all study analyses have been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions As part of a currently ongoing clinical quality initiative at the study&#xD;
      institution, when a new patient schedules an appointment for an initial cancer consultation&#xD;
      the scheduling operator sends an email to the patient containing a link for a standard&#xD;
      introduction video. For the purposes of this study a second &quot;enhanced compassion video&quot; was&#xD;
      developed, which added five additional sentences to the standard introduction video. Those&#xD;
      five sentences were compassion-focused statements. Both videos feature the same oncologist&#xD;
      (i.e. Medical Director of MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper) and are identical aside from&#xD;
      the additional compassionate statements. The compassionate statements added to the &quot;enhanced&#xD;
      compassion video&quot; were based on the results of a recent systematic review of clinician&#xD;
      compassionate behaviors, which found incorporating statements of support, acknowledgement,&#xD;
      patient's perspective, emotion naming, and validation increased patient perception of&#xD;
      compassion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and Data Collection After obtaining written informed consent a research&#xD;
      questionnaire will be administered to patients at the cancer center prior to the initial&#xD;
      cancer consultation. The questionnaire will assess the patients' perception of the video&#xD;
      oncologist's compassion using the 5-item compassion measure, a previously validated&#xD;
      patient-assessed measure of perceived compassion during patient care. Subject demographics,&#xD;
      as well as clinical information pertaining to cancer diagnosis will be abstracted from the&#xD;
      medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures The primary outcome measure will be anxiety severity on arrival to the&#xD;
      cancer center for the initial consultation. As part of the research questionnaire subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). The HADS is a&#xD;
      14-item self-reported instrument that assesses anxiety and depressive symptoms in populations&#xD;
      with medical conditions (both in- and out-patients). It has two 7-item subscales: HADS&#xD;
      Anxiety and HADS Depression. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0=not at all to 3=nearly&#xD;
      all the time); thus, each sub-scale can range from 0-21. The HADS has been extensively&#xD;
      validated in oncology populations, and is a commonly used measure of anxiety and depression&#xD;
      in oncology studies. The HADS Depression score will be analyzed as a secondary outcome. An&#xD;
      additional secondary outcome measure will be the no-show rate for the initial consultation&#xD;
      among each group. All data will be entered into Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a&#xD;
      secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies, and&#xD;
      export the data into Stata/SE 16.0 for Mac, StataCorp LP (College Station, TX, USA) for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis For descriptive statistics categorical data will be reported as&#xD;
      proportions with 95% confidence intervals and continuous data as means with standard&#xD;
      deviations or medians with interquartile ranges as appropriate. As part of the CONSORT&#xD;
      diagram the proportion of patients who do not attend their initial cancer consultation, as&#xD;
      well as the proportion of patients who attend their initial consultation, but decline to&#xD;
      participate in the study, will be recored and stratified by video group. The investigators&#xD;
      will test if the &quot;enhanced compassion video&quot; reduced the no-show rate to the initial&#xD;
      consultation, as well as increased participation in research using the Fisher exact test.&#xD;
      Cronbach's alpha will be used to separately test the internal reliability of the HADS anxiety&#xD;
      scale, HADS depression scale, and the 5-item compassion measure among our cohort. The&#xD;
      investigators will test if the &quot;enhanced compassion video&quot; group perceived the video&#xD;
      oncologist as more (or less) compassionate, as measured by the 5-item compassion measure,&#xD;
      than the &quot;standard introduction video&quot; group using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary outcome, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used to test for a difference in&#xD;
      the HADS anxiety scale between the two video groups. Sensitivity analysis dichotomizing the&#xD;
      HADS anxiety scale into low (&lt; 8) and moderate/high (≥ 8) will be performed. A cut point of 8&#xD;
      on the HADS subscales has been defined as the optimal cut point for diagnosis screening and&#xD;
      is commonly used to define clinically significant symptoms in research studies. The Fisher&#xD;
      exact test will be used to test if the proportion of subjects with clinically significant&#xD;
      symptoms differed between the two video groups. For the secondary outcome measure the&#xD;
      investigators will repeat the same analyses described above using the HADS depression scale&#xD;
      in place of the HADS anxiety scale. The investigators will perform the above analyses using&#xD;
      intention to treat methodology. The analyses will be repeated in a per protocol fashion&#xD;
      excluding patients who state they did not watch the video prior to presentation to the cancer&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if the relationship between video group and anxiety severity differs among&#xD;
      pre-specified subgroups the investigators will perform separate multivariable linear&#xD;
      regression models with the HADS anxiety scale as the dependent variable, and entering the&#xD;
      following patient characteristic along with an interaction term between video group and the&#xD;
      characteristic as independent variables: (1) age (decile), (2) sex (male vs. female), (3)&#xD;
      race (white vs. non-white), (4) ethnicity (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic), (5) suspected primary&#xD;
      cancer (breast vs. gastrointestinal vs. pulmonary vs. skin vs. central nervous system vs.&#xD;
      gynecologic vs. other).&#xD;
