  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It's a randomized control trial to compare early drain removal versus standard drain removal&#xD;
      after donor hepatectomy in terms of donor outcomes. We will analyse the data and elucidate&#xD;
      the safety of early drain removal using 3x3 rule with routine drain removal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      -  Prophylactic abdominal drainage after donor right hepatectomy for LDLT has been a common&#xD;
           or even mandatory practice in most transplant centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This serves to monitor the occurrence of postoperative intraabdominal bleeding and is&#xD;
           used for the detection and drainage of any bile leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Below table mentions both advantages and disadvantages of prophylactic drain placement&#xD;
           after hepatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advantages&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Early detection of haemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Early detection of bile leak&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Early reintervention Disadvantages&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Increased rates of intraabdominal and wound infection, 2. Increased abdominal pain, 3.&#xD;
      Decreased pulmonary function, 4. Prolonged hospital stay, 5. Bowel injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our study in ILBS for ALF donors, the overall complication rate was 20% as per&#xD;
           Clavien-Dindo classification, of which a majority (15.9%) had grade 1 or 2&#xD;
           complications. Major complications (3b and above) were seen in 4 (1.0%) patients.&#xD;
           Biliary complications were noted in 1.7% only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a study by Japanese group concluded that 3 × 3 rule is clinically feasible and allows&#xD;
           for the early removal of the drain tube with minimum infection risk after liver&#xD;
           resection. The ''3 x 3 rule'': the drain will be removed when the drain fluid bilirubin&#xD;
           concentration is &lt;3 mg/dl on day 3 after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In our institute we remove drain routinely, when output is less than 100ml and serous.&#xD;
           That is usually on postoperative day 5-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no randomized control trail done in donor hepatectomy comparing early versus&#xD;
           standard drain removal.&#xD;
