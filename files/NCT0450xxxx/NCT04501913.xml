    <textblock>
      This study examines at-home monitoring of patient-generated phsyiologic health data and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes. Patient-generated health data using at-home monitoring devices and&#xD;
      smart device applications are used more and more to measure value and quality in cancer care.&#xD;
      This trial may show whether at-home monitoring programs can improve the care of patients&#xD;
      after hospital discharge from surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of remote perioperative monitoring in solid&#xD;
      tumor cancer patients scheduled for gastrointestinal (GI), genitourinary (GU), gynecological&#xD;
      (GYN) cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore patterns, trajectory, and changes in physiologic health parameter outcomes&#xD;
      (weight, temperature, oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure, daily steps) and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (symptoms, quality of life [QOL]) from pre-surgery to the&#xD;
      post-discharge period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the relationship between changes in physiologic health parameter&#xD;
      outcomes/PROs and surgical outcomes (postoperative complications, readmissions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore changes in physiologic health parameters and PROs by open surgery versus&#xD;
      minimally invasive (laparoscopic or robotic) surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo remote perioperative telemonitoring with home monitoring devices activity&#xD;
      monitor beginning 7 days before surgery and up to 30 days after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 2 months.&#xD;
