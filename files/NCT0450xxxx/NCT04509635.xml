  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with unresectable colorectal cancer liver metastases, preclinical studies have&#xD;
      shown that after the resistance of cetuximab, the treatment sensitivity can be restored by&#xD;
      stopping cetuximab for a period of time. This is called the cetuximab re-challenge. And the&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) test is reported a biomarker for the efficacy of cetuximab&#xD;
      rechallenge. However, there is still no randomized controlled trial for verification. This&#xD;
      study aims at patients after the first-line treatment of cetuximab has progressed. After the&#xD;
      second-line non-cetuximab treatment has progressed, the effects of re-application of combined&#xD;
      with cetuximab and chemotherapy alone are compared to verify the re-challenge effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases were RAS wild type, received first-line&#xD;
      cetuximab plus chemotherapy. After first-line progression, second-line non-cetuximab&#xD;
      treatment were used. After second-line progression, ctDNA is test, and patients with RAS&#xD;
      wild-type are enrolled in the study to compare cetuximab plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy&#xD;
      alone as third-line treatment. Treatment will continue until disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxic effects. The primary endpoint is the disease control rate，which will be&#xD;
      assessed by local multidisciplinary team with the use of contrast-enhanced CT or MRI after 4&#xD;
      cycles and then every other 4 cycles up to 12 cycles.&#xD;
