  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vocational instability in Veterans with serious mental illness (SMI) is pervasive, costly,&#xD;
      and harmful. Over 75% of Veterans with SMI are unemployed, resulting in economic difficulties&#xD;
      and trouble meeting basic needs. Overall, among adults with depression, work dysfunction&#xD;
      results in a 36 to 51 billion dollar loss annually. Unemployed Veterans with SMI also suffer&#xD;
      major health consequences, including a more severe course of illness and poor recovery over&#xD;
      time, leading to increased inpatient and emergency service use. The WORKWELL study will&#xD;
      synergistically address these deficits in health, recovery, and work functioning by testing&#xD;
      the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Work Success (CBTw) intervention. Using a pragmatic&#xD;
      design, this project will address work as a major social determinant of health and close the&#xD;
      health disparity gap among people with SMI. Further, through promotion of work and healthy&#xD;
      thinking, CBTw holds promise to reduce risk of suicide among vulnerable veterans with SMI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Project background: Work is a major social determinant of health. In people with serious&#xD;
      mental illness (SMI), work is associated with better wellbeing, physical and mental health,&#xD;
      quality of life, and may prevent the onset of disability. Among Veterans with SMI, work is a&#xD;
      protective factor against suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most veterans with SMI are unemployed and suffer substantially worse health and recovery&#xD;
      across key domains. Despite quality VHA vocational services, such as supported employment&#xD;
      (SE), two-thirds or more of Veterans who receive these services experience work dysfunction.&#xD;
      A probable explanation lies in unsolved cognitive and behavioral barriers, such as low&#xD;
      work-related self-efficacy, ineffective coping skills, little hope that work is attainable,&#xD;
      poor work motivation and sense of self.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Work Success (CBTw) intervention was designed to target&#xD;
      these problems and augment VHA SE services to synergistically improve work, as well as health&#xD;
      and recovery, in Veterans with SMI. In an open trial pilot, CBTw was associated with&#xD;
      significant increases in hours worked and wages earned and the majority of CBTw participants&#xD;
      became steady workers. Veterans also experienced improvements in symptoms, recovery, and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project goals: Using Hybrid 1 RCT design, this project will test the effects of CBTw on&#xD;
      competitive work and health and recovery outcomes over a 9-month study period at 3 VA SE&#xD;
      programs. Informed by the RE-AIM framework, an implementation evaluation will examine the&#xD;
      success of using SE staff to deliver CBTw, barriers and facilitators to implementation, and&#xD;
      strategies utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance to priorities: This project has high implementation potential and is responsive to&#xD;
      the VHA priority regarding Health Equity, as it will address work functioning, an under&#xD;
      studied social determinant of health. WORKWELL also holds promise to improve health and&#xD;
      recovery outcomes among Veterans with SMI, another HSR&amp;D area of emphasis. Lastly, this study&#xD;
      is consistent with the goal of finding novel strategies toward suicide prevention among&#xD;
      vulnerable Veteran groups, including those with SMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Aim 1: Test the effects of CBTw + SE compared to a control of psychoeducation +&#xD;
      SE on work. Hypotheses: Participants in the CBTw+ SE arm will work significantly more total&#xD;
      weeks in competitive jobs (primary study outcome) and will be more likely to become steady&#xD;
      workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Test the effects of CBTw + SE on health and recovery. Hypotheses: Participants in the&#xD;
      CBTw + SE arm will have greater improvements on subjective recovery and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, and decreases in symptoms, suicidal ideation, and inpatient service&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Guided by the RE-AIM implementation science framework, conduct an evaluation of the&#xD;
      implementation of CBTw, including examination of the feasibility of using SE staff to deliver&#xD;
      CBTw, and related barriers and facilitators. The objective is to spur future wide scale CBTw&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Methods: WORKWELL is a pragmatic, Hybrid 1 design RCT. CBTw will be tested at 3 SE&#xD;
      sites-Roudebush VA Medical Center, the Edward J. Hines VA Medical Center, and the VA St.&#xD;
      Louis Health Care System. 276 unemployed Veterans with SMI will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive CBTw plus SE or a control of psychoeducation plus SE. Outcomes including total weeks&#xD;
      worked in competitive jobs (primary), achievement of steady work, symptoms, recovery, health&#xD;
      related quality of life, suicidal ideation, and service utilization will be assessed at&#xD;
      posttreatment (12 weeks), 6 months (primary endpoint), and 9 months (to examine sustained&#xD;
      effects). CBTw implementation planning, training, and consultation will be provided. CBTw&#xD;
      implementation (fidelity), barriers and facilitators to implementation, and other RE-AIM&#xD;
      elements will be examined using mixed methods.&#xD;
