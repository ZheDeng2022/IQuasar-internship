  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia (GA) is a medically induced state of unresponsiveness and unconsciousness,&#xD;
      which millions of people experience every year. Despite its ubiquity, a clear and consistent&#xD;
      picture of the brain circuits mediating consciousness and responsiveness has not emerged.&#xD;
      Studies to date are limited by lack of direct recordings in human brain during medically&#xD;
      induced anesthesia. Our overall hypothesis is that the current model of consciousness,&#xD;
      originally proposed to model disorders and recovery of consciousness after brain injury, can&#xD;
      be generalized to understand mechanisms of consciousness more broadly. This will be studied&#xD;
      through three specific aims. The first is to evaluate the difference in anesthesia&#xD;
      sensitivity in patients with and without underlying basal ganglia pathology. Second is to&#xD;
      correlate changes in brain circuitry with induction and emergence from anesthesia. The third&#xD;
      aim is to evaluate the effects of targeted deep brain stimulation on anesthesia induced loss&#xD;
      and recovery of consciousness. This study focuses on experimentally studying these related&#xD;
      brain circuits by taking advantage of pathological differences in movement disorder patient&#xD;
      populations undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. DBS is a neurosurgical procedure&#xD;
      that is used as treatment for movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and essential&#xD;
      tremor, and provides a mechanism to acquire brain activity recordings in subcortical&#xD;
      structures. This study will provide important insight by using human data to shed light on&#xD;
      the generalizability of the current model of consciousness. The subject's surgery for DBS&#xD;
      will be prolonged by up to 40 minutes in order to record the participant's brain activity and&#xD;
      their responses to verbal and auditory stimuli.&#xD;

    <description>This cohort will serve as as the observed group, displaying basal ganglia pathology.&#xD;
A syringe pump controlled by STANPUMP implementing the Eleveld Pharmocokinetics-Pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) model for propofol will be used as a targeted controlled infusion (TCI) system to achieve plasma target propofol concentrations. Target effect-site concentration of propofol will be started at 1.4 μg/mL and will be increased by 0.3 μg/mL with reassessment until endpoints are achieved.&#xD;
Experiments will be completed with DBS off.</description>
