  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DZD1516 is an oral, blood brain barrier penetrable, selective HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor.&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DZD1516 in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have progressed following prior therapy. This is&#xD;
      the first time this drug has ever been tested in patients, and so it will help to understand&#xD;
      what type of side effects may occur with the drug treatment. It will also measure the levels&#xD;
      of drug in the body and assess its anti-cancer activity as monotherapy and in combination&#xD;
      with trastuzumab and/or capecitabine, or in combination with T-DM1&#xD;
