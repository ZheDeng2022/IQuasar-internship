  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the neurophysiological mechanisms of peripheral&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (PES) in modulating supraspinal tremorogenic input to motoneurons. For&#xD;
      this purpose, the investigators will use transcutaneous PES, high-density electromyography&#xD;
      (HD-EMG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI), and neuromusculoskeletal modelling. This study will be carried out&#xD;
      in both healthy participants and patients with essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      In Experiment A, the investigators will recruit healthy participants without motor disorders&#xD;
      and medications influencing brain function (n = 25). The investigators will characterize&#xD;
      inhibition of wrist flexors/wrist extensors with PES, and also use TMS to stimulate the&#xD;
      corresponding areas in the brain and see if the movement can be reduced through PES. HD-EMG&#xD;
      will be used to collect data and identify associated motor unit spike trains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Experiment B, the investigators will recruit patients with essential tremor (ET) and/or&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 25 for each pathology). The investigators will repeat the same&#xD;
      characterization of inhibition of wrist flexors/ wrist extensors with PES and also use TMS to&#xD;
      stimulate corresponding areas in the brain. Additionally, the investigators will test PES&#xD;
      conditions as a tremor reduction strategy at the wrist level. The investigators will also&#xD;
      test PES conditions at the elbow and shoulder joints as a tremor reduction strategy. Finally,&#xD;
      the investigators will observe and characterize the long-term effects (lasting 24h, 48h, and&#xD;
      7 days post stimulation) of PES via coherence between HD-EMG and EEG at the tremor frequency.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The purpose of this study is to understand how motor activation can be reduced. For this purpose, it will be examined how some muscles of the arm respond to electric and magnetic stimulation. The effects of the electric and/or magnetic stimulation will be recorded non-invasively with HD-EMG.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Changes in Amount of Motor Inhibition</measure>
    <time_frame>Experiment A: Short-term: before vs. during and at 1 minute after PES. Experiment B: Short-term: before vs. during and at 1 minute after PES. Long-term: persistence of changes at post 24 hours, post 48 hours, and post 1 week after PES.</time_frame>
    <description>HD-EMG will be recorded with a 64-channel device (EMG-Quattrocento; 400-channel EMG amplifier, OT Bioelettronica, Italy). The HD-EMG data will be recorded at the wrist level before, during and after muscle contractions. All data will be analyzed offline. Changes in the amount of inhibition will be assessed. The amount of inhibition is calculated as the mean discharge rate across trials and normalized as a percentage of the baseline (100%). To assess the short-term effects, HD-EMG data will be collected before (baseline), during and 1 minute (Post) after PES. Changes in amount of motor inhibition will be measured by comparing the amount of inhibition before (baseline), during and 1 minute after PES (Post). To assess long-term effects, HD-EMG data will be collected at post 24h, post 48h, and post 1 week after PES. The amount of inhibition at 24h, 48h, and 1 week after PES will be compared with the baseline amount of inhibition (before PES).</description>

    <measure>Changes in motor evoked potentials (MEPs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Experiment A: Short-term: before vs. during and at 5 minutes after PES. Experiment B: Short-term: before vs. during and at 5 minutes after PES. Long-term: persistence of changes at post 24 hours, post 48 hours, and post 1 week after PES.</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the effects of electrical stimulation in motor inhibition, single-pulse TMS will be administered to the contralateral area of the brain while MEPs are recorded from the contralateral site (EMG-Quattrocento; 400-channel EMG amplifier, OT Bioelettronica, Italy). The mean peak-to peak MEP amplitude will be calculated to assess changes in inhibition. To assess the short-term effects, MEP data will be collected before (baseline), during and 5 minutes (Post) after PES. Changes in MEPs will be measured by comparing the MEPs before (baseline), during and 1 minute after PES (Post). To assess long-term effects, MEP data will be collected at post 24h, post 48h, and post 1 week after PES. The MEPs at 24h, 48h, and 1 week after PES will be compared with the baseline MEPs (before PES).</description>

    <measure>Changes in cortico-muscular coherence in ET and/or PD participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Experiment A: N/A. Experiment B: Short-term effects, within sessions (before vs. 1 minute after PES. Long-term effects, across sessions (persistence of changes at post 24 hours, post 48 hours, and post 1 week after PES).</time_frame>
    <description>EEG will be recorded with a 64-channel whole-head device (NeurOne, Bittium, Kuopio, Finland) and HD-EMG with a 64-channels system (EMG-Quattrocento; 400-channel EMG amplifier, OT Bioelettronica, Italy). The coherence between EEG and HD-EMG signals will be computed to assess supraspinal and spinal inhibition. To assess the short- term effects, EEG and HD-EMG data will be collected before (Pre) and 1 minute (Post) after PES. Changes in cortico-muscular coherence will be measured by comparing the cortico-muscular coherence before (baseline) and 1 minute after PES (Post). To assess long-term effects, EEG and HD-EMG data will be collected at post 24h, post 48h, and post 1 week after PES. The cortico-muscular coherence at 24h, 48h, and 1 week after PES will be compared with the baseline cortico-muscular coherence (before PES).</description>

    <measure>Changes in kinematics</measure>
    <time_frame>Experiment A: N/A. Experiment B: Short-term effects, within sessions (before vs. 1 minute after PES). Long-term effects, across sessions (persistence of changes at post 24 hours, post 48 hours, and post 1 week after PES).</time_frame>
    <description>Tremor amplitude will be measured with inertial measurement units that quantify variations in wrist angles during tremor. Specifically, the tremor amplitude will be calculated as the mean peak-to-peak amplitude between maximal wrist flexion and wrist extension angles. To assess the short-term effects, tremor amplitude will be collected before (Pre) and 1 minute (Post) after PES. Changes in tremor amplitude will be measured by comparing the tremor amplitude before (baseline) and 1 minute after PES (Post). To assess long-term effects, tremor amplitude will be recorded at post 24h, post 48h, and post 1 week after PES. The tremor amplitude at 24h, 48h, and 1 week after PES will be compared with the baseline tremor amplitude (before PES).</description>

    <measure>Clinical motor score change</measure>
    <time_frame>For Experiment A: N/A. For Experiment B: Short-term effects, within sessions (before and after PES). Long-term effects, across sessions (persistence of changes at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 1-week after PES).</time_frame>
    <description>The MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and the Fahn Tolosa Marin (FTM) rating scale are functional scales used by clinicians to assess the functional impairments caused by Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, respectively. The MDS-UPDRS and the FTM scales will be used to assess clinical motor changes induced by the PES. To assess the short-term effects, The MDS-UPDRS or the FTM will be administered before and after PES. Changes in scores will be assessed by comparing the MDS-UPDRS/or FTM scores before (baseline) and after PES (Post). To assess long-term effects, the MDS-UPDRS/or FTM scores will be collected at post 24h, post 48h, and post 1 week after PES. The MDS-UPDRS/or FTM scores at 24h, 48h, and 1 week after PES will be compared with the baseline the MDS-UPDRS/or FTM scores (before PES).</description>
