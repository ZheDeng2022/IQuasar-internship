  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of reintroduction of modified XELOXIRI&#xD;
      combined with molecular targeted drug in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is an investigator-initiated, single institution, prospective, single-arm clinical study&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of reintroduction of modified XELOXIRI combined with&#xD;
      bevacizumab as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable mCRC. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      receive 12 cycles of mXELOXIRI with bevacizumab and then MDT will be initiated to determine&#xD;
      whether to perform a surgery or receive the maintenance therapy until disease progression&#xD;
      (PD). At the time of PD, patients will re-introduce XELOXIRI plus bev at the same doses and&#xD;
      schedule previously tolerated, for a maximum of 12 cycles.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive mXELOXIRI+BEV as first-line therapy (to be repeated every 2 weeks for a maximum of 12 cycles), followed to initiate a MDT to determine whether to perform a surgery or receive maintenance therapy. Maintenance treatment: CAP+BEV. The following CAP+BEV therapy will be repeated in 2-week cycles.&#xD;
At the time of disease progression, patients will be re-introduced XELOXIRI plus bev at the same doses and schedule previously tolerated, for a maximum of 12 cycles. If no progression occurs during XELOXIRI plus bev, patients will receive maintenance CAP+BEV at the same dose used in the last cycle of the induction treatment.</description>
