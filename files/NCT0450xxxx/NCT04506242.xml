      This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Camrelizumab (SHR-1210) in combination&#xD;
      with apatinib neoadjuvant therapy before surgery [neoadjuvant phase], followed by&#xD;
      camrelizumab alone after surgery [adjuvant phase] in participants with resectable stage&#xD;

      This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of camrelizumab in combination with apatinib&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) before surgery [neoadjuvant phase], followed by camrelizumab&#xD;
      alone after surgery [adjuvant phase] in participants with resectable stage II, IIIA, and&#xD;
      resectable IIIB (T3N2) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The primary hypotheses of this&#xD;
      study are that neoadjuvant camrelizumab in combination with apatinib, followed by surgery and&#xD;
      adjuvant camrelizumab will improve: 1)MPR assessed by investigator using Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) ; 2) event free survival (EFS) and 3)&#xD;
      overall survival (DFS).&#xD;
