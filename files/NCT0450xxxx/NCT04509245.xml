  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moderate weight reduction by a moderately hypocaloric very-low-fat diet resulted in&#xD;
      normalization of fasting hyperglycemia and reversal of hepatic insulin resistance in patients&#xD;
      with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT)&#xD;
      revealed that utilizing a total diet replacement by a low-energy formula diet for 3 months&#xD;
      led to a 15 kg or more weight loss in 24% participants and diabetes remission 46% of the&#xD;
      participants. To date it remains unknown whether similar results can be achieved with a&#xD;
      natural, non-formula based diet in connection with an educative smartphone application and&#xD;
      telephone coaching&#xD;

      24 patients with type 2 diabetes from the German Diabetes Study (GDS) with less than 4 years&#xD;
      disease duration and not receiving insulin were included in this study. Before the start of&#xD;
      the intervention, participants documented their dietary intake by recording a food diary.&#xD;
      During the 12-week intervention participants were asked to adhere to a real food-based&#xD;
      low-calorie diet supported by an app-guided digital education program as well as a&#xD;
      low-calorie recipe book and received weekly coaching calls by nutritionists. Patients were&#xD;
      instructed to adhere to a balanced low calorie diet during the intervention. Nutritionists&#xD;
      provided structured behavior change focusing on dietary advice, adherence to logging dietary&#xD;
      intake and tracking weight. At first visit, patients installed the Changing Health App&#xD;
      (Changing Health, Newcastle, UK) and completed an app-based digital education program. This&#xD;
      program focused on type 2 diabetes education and behavioral change in combination with weight&#xD;
      tracking and dietary monitoring. Patients used the app throughout the study and adherence was&#xD;
      monitored via logins. Comprehensive testing before and after the intervention comprised a&#xD;
      mixed-meal tolerance test and liver fat.&#xD;
