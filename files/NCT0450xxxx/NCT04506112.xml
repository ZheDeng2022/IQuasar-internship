  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims are to: 1) optimize the Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Intervention&#xD;
      (TranS-C) for delivery to Veterans in cardiac rehabilitation, 2) test and refine the adapted&#xD;
      TranS-C treatment manual and protocol, and 3) conduct a pilot randomized trial to establish&#xD;
      the feasibility, acceptability, and plausibility of the intervention protocol and study&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1 will involve formative work to optimize the TranS-C manual and protocol for delivery in&#xD;
      Cardiac Rehabilitation, with input from Veterans and provider stakeholders. Aim 2 will&#xD;
      involve a preliminary test and refinement of the adapted TranS-C manual and protocol with a&#xD;
      small sample of Veterans who are participating in cardiac rehabilitation and report sleep&#xD;
      disturbance and/or sleep-related impairment. Aim 3 will involve a pilot randomized trial to&#xD;
      establish the feasibility, acceptability, and plausibility of the intervention protocol and&#xD;
      study procedures. Veterans in cardiac rehabilitation with sleep disturbance and/or&#xD;
      sleep-related impairment will be randomized to TranS-C + Usual Care or Usual Care. Treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction will be assessed at 3-months; sleep disturbance and sleep-related impairment,&#xD;
      disability and functioning, and health-related quality of life will be assessed at baseline,&#xD;
      3-months, and 6-months to determine measure responsiveness and provide preliminary insight&#xD;
      into treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note, information provided in this entry (e.g., design, eligibility criteria, outcomes,&#xD;
      etc.) pertains only to Aim 3 which includes the pilot randomized trial. Consistent with Stage&#xD;
      I of the NIH stage model of behavioral intervention development research, results from Aim 1&#xD;
      and 2 activities may lead to modifications to the pilot protocol and procedures in Aim 3.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will complete the TranS-C intervention as adapted for cardiac rehabilitation. TranS-C is a behavioral intervention that is rooted in basic sleep and circadian science and draws from empirically-supported treatments including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT), chronotherapy, and light therapy. It was designed to promote sleep health across a range of sleep problems. Participants in this group will also continue to receive care as usual, cardiac/sleep-related or otherwise.</description>
