  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory muscle weakness is common after mechanical ventilation and occurs early. This can&#xD;
      limit functional recovery. Respiratory muscle training is often neglected in clinical&#xD;
      practice. Some data indicates that inspiratory muscle training increases inspiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength and quality of life. The aim of the study is to assess the impact of combined&#xD;
      inspiratory and expiratory muscle training on inspiratory muscle strength. The second aim is&#xD;
      to assess the impact of this training program on expiratory muscle strength.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will benefit from usual respiratory physiotherapy (secretion clearance treatment and recruitment maneuvers), and muscle training. This program will be delivered 5 days a week.&#xD;
Inspiratory muscle training (IMT): using a threshold IMT device with mouthpiece, 5 sets of 6 breaths, intensity is prescribed at 60% of maximal inspiratory pressure for the first set, and then increased to the highest tolerable intensity to allow completion of the 6th breath Expiratory muscle training (EMT): using a bottle filled with water, starting at 5cm and then increased to 8 cm gradually, 5 sets of 6 breaths&#xD;
Training program starts after mechanical ventilation weaning, as soon as the patient is collaborative, and is continued until 1 month after ICU discharge</description>
