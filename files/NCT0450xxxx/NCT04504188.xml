      The primary objective of this pilot study is to document the percentage achievement in&#xD;
      effective HR control (average nighttime HR &lt; 70 bpm) during WCD use in a cohort of female&#xD;
      patients with cardiomyopathy in an outpatient setting using continuous heart rate (HR) trends&#xD;
      data from the WCD to optimize BB/ivabradine dosage, as compared to a prior historical&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to document the percentage achievement in&#xD;
      effective HR control (average nighttime HR &lt; 70 bpm) during WCD use in a cohort of female&#xD;
      patients with cardiomyopathy in an outpatient setting using continuous heart rate (HR) trends&#xD;
      data from the WCD to optimize BB/ivabradine dosage, as compared to a prior historical&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult female patients (18 years or older) who are prescribed the wearable cardioverter&#xD;
      defibrillator (WCD) for 3 months for ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with a low&#xD;
      ejection fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will wear an FDA-approved WCD with a 3 month follow-up period. Heart rate (HR) will&#xD;
      be continuously monitored by the WCD. Every two weeks a report showing daily HR trends will&#xD;
      be emailed to the healthcare provider. The healthcare provider will also receive a HR control&#xD;
      alert if the HR exceeds a predetermined threshold for 3 days in a row.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this information, clinicians should follow guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT)&#xD;
      to add or titrate medication accordingly. The goal of these changes will be to achieve the&#xD;
      average nighttime HR to recommended guidelines (&lt;70 bpm) by the end of WCD use.&#xD;
