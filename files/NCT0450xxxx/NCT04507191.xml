  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the main purpose is to study the prognostic effect of PDL1 in ovarian cancer especially HGSC.&#xD;
      Therefore, in the present study the investigators analyzed the expression of PDL1in HGSC by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry, and results were correlated to prognosis.&#xD;

      this cross-sectional study on 54 specimens of primary ovarian high grade serous carcinoma&#xD;
      cases who attended to Oncology Centre, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt in the period&#xD;
      from 2012 till 2019. The cases were chosen randomly. All clinicopathological data including&#xD;
      tumor stage (T), L.N metastases (N), metastasis (M), (FIGO) staging system, ascites,&#xD;
      recurrence, residual tumor, CEA level, CA125 level, and peritoneal deposits analyzed. The&#xD;
      investigator followed the clinical outcomes in the form of disease free survival (DFS) and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS). The mean duration of follow up will be 43.4 months. The OS were&#xD;
      calculated from the time of diagnosis to death. DFS is the time from the end of therapy to&#xD;
      first recurrence or metastases. the specimens were stained with PDL1 marker in pathology&#xD;
      department Port Said university.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Data was analyzed using SPSS software V.16. Continuous data was&#xD;
      presented in the form of mean (SD) or Median (min-max) according to the results of&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk testing for the assumptions of normal distributions of data. Categorical data&#xD;
      will be presented in the form of frequencies and percentages. Statistical significance will&#xD;
      be tested by Welch's t-test, or Mann-Whitney U for continuous data (with respect to presence&#xD;
      or absence of normal distribution of data). Also, chi square test or Fisher's Exact Test will&#xD;
      be performed for categorical data (with respect to the minimal expected values in the&#xD;
      contingencies tables). Correlations of different tumour markers will be calculated using&#xD;
      Spearman's rho Coefficient. Kaplan-Meier test was used to test for overall survival and&#xD;
      disease free survival of patients with respect to tumour expression of PDL1. Comparisons will&#xD;
      be done using Log Rank (Mantel-Cox). Significance level is set at 0.05.&#xD;
