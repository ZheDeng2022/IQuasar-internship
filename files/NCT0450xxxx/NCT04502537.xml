    <textblock>
      A number of RCT studies have shown the safety and effectiveness of oral Roxadustat in the&#xD;
      treatment of renal anemia, but there is a lack of evidence from cohort studies. A prospective&#xD;
      cohort study is planed to conduct to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Roxadustat for renal&#xD;
      anemia in the real world.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (15.4%) is twice that&#xD;
      of the general population (7.6%), and the degree of anemia increases with the severity of&#xD;
      CKD. A number of RCT studies have shown the safety and effectiveness of oral Roxadustat in&#xD;
      the treatment of renal anemia, but there is a lack of evidence from cohort studies. A&#xD;
      prospective cohort study is planed to conduct to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Roxadustat for renal anemia in the real world. It is planned to continuously recruit patients&#xD;
      with renal anemia in Shenzhen Second People's Hospital from October 2020 to June 2023. The&#xD;
      treatment of anemia will be recorded (Roxadustat or erythropoietin), and the observation&#xD;
      period is one year. Collect the patient's demographic characteristics, drug dosage,&#xD;
      adjustment plan, hemoglobin. The main outcome indicators were: the average change in Hb from&#xD;
      baseline to 28-52 weeks, and the Hb response rate reached during two consecutive visits; the&#xD;
      secondary outcome indicators were: the maintenance rate of the target Hb level, iron&#xD;
      metabolism indicators, 0 to 8 weeks of Hb level increase rate, dose adjustment and safety&#xD;
      indicators. The generalized additive mixed model of repeated measures was used to analyze the&#xD;
      changes and differences of outcome indicators in different groups. Expected results: In the&#xD;
      cohort study, the effectiveness and safety of roxastat in the treatment of renal anemia, the&#xD;
      starting dose and the adjustment plan, provide a basis for guiding the clinical safe and&#xD;
      effective application of roxastat.&#xD;
