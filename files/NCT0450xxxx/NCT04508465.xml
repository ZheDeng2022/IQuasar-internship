  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative pain is one of the most significant complaints and problems for patients&#xD;
      undergoing major open surgery. Pain after surgery carry an abundance of consequences such as&#xD;
      reduced mobilization, reduced nutrition intake, reduced pulmonary capacity and increased risk&#xD;
      of complications and length of hospitalization. The literature does not supply much&#xD;
      information on short- or longer-term outcomes of pain treatment for emergency surgery. The&#xD;
      investigators know that for planned surgery in general around 10-50 percentage suffer from&#xD;
      persistent postoperative pain. It is therefore important to follow-up on the longer-term&#xD;
      outcomes after the standardized analgesic pain treatment. Based on a predefined patient group&#xD;
      called OMEGA (Optimizing Major EMergency Abdominal surgery) the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that OMEGA patients will present a significant incidence rate of patients with persistent&#xD;
      postoperative pain and/or continued opioid/non-opioid usage. Therefore this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the incidence of prolonged postoperative pain and opioid/non-opioid consumption&#xD;
      in OMEGA patients at 3 month after major emergency abdominal surgery.&#xD;
