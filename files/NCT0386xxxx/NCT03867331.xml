  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a proof-of-concept, first in human, Phase I, single center study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and experimental efficacy of VLPM01 in&#xD;
      healthy, malaria-naïve adult volunteers. The VLPM01 product will be adjuvanted with&#xD;
      alhydrogel. The study design was based on the FDA's guidance &quot;General Principles for the&#xD;
      Development of Vaccines to protect Against Global Infectious Diseases&quot; (2011).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have four (4) phases: Screening, Dose Escalation, Controlled Human Malaria&#xD;
      Infection (CHMI) and Follow-Up. The study will be conducted at the Walter Reed Army Institute&#xD;
      of Research in Silver Spring, Maryland (WRAIR), as this institute has extensive experience in&#xD;
      conducting clinical studies of malaria vaccines with CHMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 36 participants will be enrolled in this study. Thirty (30) eligible participants&#xD;
      will participate in the Dose Escalation Phase as vaccinees and 6 eligible participants will&#xD;
      be added during the CHMI Phase to act as infectivity controls. Up to 6 additional eligible&#xD;
      participants will serve as alternate vaccinees during the Dose Escalation Phase and up to 6&#xD;
      eligible participants will as act as alternate infectivity controls during the CHMI Phase.&#xD;
      Alternates are only enrolled if a designated vaccinee is not eligible on the day of first&#xD;
      vaccination or if a designated infectivity control is not eligible on the Day of Challenge.&#xD;
      Withdrawn participants will not be replaced.&#xD;
