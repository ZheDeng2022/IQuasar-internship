  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, Phase 1/2, multicenter study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, and PD profiles of a novel Fc-engineered IgG1 anti-CTLA-4 human monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody (AGEN1181) monotherapy and in combination with a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody&#xD;
      (AGEN2034), and to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in subjects with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors. This study will also determine the RP2D of AGEN1181 monotherapy and in combination&#xD;
      with AGEN2034.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2 study will enroll up to approximately 86 evaluable adult subjects with&#xD;
      refractory cancer (solid tumors) regardless of diagnosis. Subjects may be enrolled into the&#xD;
      following cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: AGEN1181 every 3 weeks at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg Cohort 2: AGEN1181 every 6&#xD;
      weeks at 1, 2, and 3 mg/kg Cohort 3: AGEN2034 every 2 weeks at 3 mgkg + AGEN1181 every 6&#xD;
      weeks at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of a 3+3 dose escalation that will evaluate different dose levels of&#xD;
      AGEN1181 monotherapy and in combination with AGEN2034. Each subject will stay on the dose&#xD;
      level an schedule assigned at trial entry. Subjects can be replaced for any reason other than&#xD;
      a DLT. Subjects will receive treatment for ≤ 2 years or until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      any criterion for stopping the study drug or withdrawal of trial occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the study is intended to further explore the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and&#xD;
      clinical activity in selected cancer types at dose levels (AGEN1181 monotherapy and&#xD;
      combination therapy with AGEN2034) determined as potentially effective. Indications of&#xD;
      interest include, but are not to limited to Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) refractory to&#xD;
      prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment, melanoma refractory to prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor&#xD;
      treatment, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), endometrial cancer, and angiosarcoma.&#xD;
