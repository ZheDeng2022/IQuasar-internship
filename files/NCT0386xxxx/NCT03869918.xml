    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to reduce the risk of falls in elderly community&#xD;
      dwelling women over 60 years of age with urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). In this pilot&#xD;
      study, the investigators plan to develop, validate and test a home based integrated exercise&#xD;
      and urge suppression intervention (bladder training) that targets functional mobility,&#xD;
      reduces anxiety urgency and physical barriers and is implemented in partnership with all&#xD;
      stakeholders. Key eligibility criteria: women over 60 years of age, with moderate to severe&#xD;
      UUI, and low physical activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 40% women age 65 and older or an estimated million women in the US suffer from urgency&#xD;
      urinary incontinence (UUI), a condition characterized by urgency to urinate. UUI is a&#xD;
      well-known marker for frailty and older women with UUI are at two fold higher risk for falls.&#xD;
      According to the biopsycho- ecological paradigm, UUI and its associated falls are the result&#xD;
      of interaction of the patients physical abilities (bladder urgency and reduced balance and&#xD;
      strength to reach the toilet), mental attitudes (anxiety related to urgency, shame and stigma&#xD;
      of leakage), social expectations (life demand and roles that limit access to bathroom), and&#xD;
      physical environment (physical barriers to reach the toilet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-muscarinic medications, the most common treatment for UUI, address only bladder urgency&#xD;
      and their side-effects may exacerbate falls. The investigators plan an innovative treatment&#xD;
      approach that will integrate each of the bio-psycho-ecological levels implicated in UUI and&#xD;
      falls. Strength and balance exercises improve functional mobility and have been shown to&#xD;
      reduce both fall risk as well as UUI in high risk frail older adults. Behavioral urge&#xD;
      suppression reduces anxiety related to urgency and improves mental abilities to handle life&#xD;
      demands and roles. Simple home improvements can reduce environmental barriers. Adherence is&#xD;
      an important barrier in the implementation of exercise and behavior modification. Prior&#xD;
      studies, including those by the investigators, have shown that preferred treatments are&#xD;
      associated with improved adherence, satisfaction and outcomes in women with UUI. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that an integrated exercise and urge suppression program targeted&#xD;
      to improving physical performance relevant to continence behavior will reduce the risk of&#xD;
      falls in appropriately selected community dwelling women with urinary incontinence. In this&#xD;
      pilot study, the investigators plan to develop, validate and test a home based integrated&#xD;
      exercise and urge suppression intervention that targets functional mobility, reduces anxiety&#xD;
      urgency and physical barriers and is implemented in partnership with all stakeholders. The&#xD;
      proposed pilot study for a planned submission in June 2014 fulfills PCORIs national&#xD;
      priorities and research agenda through improving patient centered outcome measures, informed&#xD;
      decision making based on risks and benefits, innovative Page 9 of 17 community based delivery&#xD;
      of the intervention, addressing barriers to care, and engaging all stakeholders involved in&#xD;
      the care of older women with UUI including patients, providers, and community advocates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this project is to reduce the risk of falls in elderly frail&#xD;
      community dwelling women with urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). The specific aim is: To&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of enrollment and randomization of a comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      trial of integrated exercise and urge suppression program versus usual care in older&#xD;
      community dwelling women with urge urinary incontinence. Hypothesis: Older women with UUI who&#xD;
      receive their preferred treatment option, exercises and urge suppression, will have better&#xD;
      objective (fewer functional limitations, falls risk and urinary incontinence) and subjective&#xD;
      (HRQOL, satisfaction with care, and psychological wellbeing) outcomes than women who receive&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
