      1. The purpose of this study is to investigate the expression of CD11a on subpopulation of&#xD;
           lymphocytes and compared its expression between ITP patients and healthy controls and&#xD;
           explores its possible role in the pathogenesis of ITP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. this may help in decision to use inhibitors (have been developed to block ICAM-1/LFA-1&#xD;
           interactions,) as a line of treatment for ITP and some of these molecules have reached&#xD;
           clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to study if there is correlation between level of CD11a and severity of bleeding at&#xD;
           presentation (estimated by bleeding score defined by British Journal of Haematology 2007&#xD;
           and platelet count)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to study effect of immunosuppressive treatment on the level of CD11a by evaluating&#xD;
           levels of CD11a after response to treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by low platelet counts&#xD;
      with or without mucocutaneous bleeding (McMillan 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like the majority of autoimmune diseases, ITP is an organ-specific disease and abnormalities&#xD;
      in the regulation of immune system have been shown to play an important role in the&#xD;
      initiation and/or perpetuation of the disease Autoantibodies reacting against platelet&#xD;
      glycoproteins can mediate platelet destruction by the monocyte-macrophage system as well as&#xD;
      suppress megakaryocyte proliferation and maturation Although auto reactive B lymphocytes&#xD;
      secreting antiplatelet antibodies are considered as the main defect, substantial evidence&#xD;
      suggests that a generalized dysfunction of auto reactive T cells is the critical&#xD;
      immunopathological cause of ITP and the antiplatelet autoantibodies are under the control of&#xD;
      T cells and the cytokines they produce Lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)&#xD;
      belonging to the integrin family is composed of the alpha chain CD11a and beta chain CD18&#xD;
      heterologous dimers , and expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes,&#xD;
      monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. Its major ligand, intercellular adhesion&#xD;
      molecule-1(ICAM-1) , belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, distributed on the surface of&#xD;
      antigen- presenting cells (APCs) The combination of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 can provide coordinated&#xD;
      stimulus signal and promote lymphocyte activation, proliferation and differentiation. In the&#xD;
      interaction of T cells with antigen- presenting cells (APCs), LFA-1 and its adaptor ICAM-1&#xD;
      directly participate in the formation of immunological synapse that promotes costimulatory&#xD;
      function, leading to increased T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity CD11a is critical for&#xD;
      lymphocyte entry into the lymph nodes and normal development of hematopoietic intermediates&#xD;
      The disruption of LFA-1 activity strongly affects the stability of immune interface .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expression of ICAM-1 and LFA-1 is significantly higher on lymphoid cells and vascular&#xD;
      endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), indicating that the combination of LFA-1 and&#xD;
      ICAM-1 may play an important role in the progression of RA The excessive expression of LFA-1&#xD;
      can induce the formation of auto-reactive T cells, resulting in lupus disease in mice. By&#xD;
      using LFA-1 monoclonal antibodies in lupus mice the production of autoantibodies could be&#xD;
      reduced, the development of autoimmune reaction stopped, and the symptoms of lupus nephritis&#xD;
      alleviated. Therefore, LFA-1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ITP patients CD11a could facilitate the survival of CD19+ B cells and promote&#xD;
      antibody-mediated platelets destruction .Therefore, blocking ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction can&#xD;
      suppress T-cell activation in autoimmune diseases. Many types of inhibitors (i.e. antibodies,&#xD;
      peptides, small molecules) have been developed to block ICAM-1/LFA-1 interactions, and some&#xD;
      of these molecules have reached clinical trials.&#xD;
