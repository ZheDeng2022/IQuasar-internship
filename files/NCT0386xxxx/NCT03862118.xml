      Periorbital hyperpigmentation (POH) is a common dermatological condition, also known as&#xD;
      periorbital melanosis, periocular hyperpigmentation dark circles under the eyes (DC),&#xD;
      infraorbital discoloration, infraorbital darkening, or idiopathic cutaneous hyperchromia of&#xD;
      the orbital region. It is a common cosmetic condition that occurs in both sexes and may be&#xD;
      considered to be normal variants of pigmentation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periorbital hyperpigmentation is a multi-factorial entity.The proposed possible causative&#xD;
      factors include genetic or heredity, excessive pigmentation, periorbital edema, thin and&#xD;
      translucent lower eyelid skin, venous congestion with hemosiderin deposition, orbital&#xD;
      structural problem and shadowing due to skin laxity &amp; tear trough. Other factors such as&#xD;
      underlying systemic, metabolic, hormonal diseases, nutritional deficiencies, drugs, allergic&#xD;
      reactions, atopic dermatitis, sleep disorders, stress, alcohol consumption, smoking, frequent&#xD;
      cosmetic use, frequent eye rubbing and lack of correction for errors of refraction like&#xD;
      myopia are also implicated to POH .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periorbital hyperpigmentation is classified according to Ranu et al into five categories&#xD;
      based on the causative factors 1. Constitutional type: seen as typical brownish curved band&#xD;
      on lower eyelid or both. 2.Postinflammatory type: irregular patches of brown or grey&#xD;
      pigmentation associated with features of lichenification.3. Vascular type: erythema or&#xD;
      prominent capillaries or telangiectasia. 4. Shadow effect type: tear trough and eye bags due&#xD;
      to sagging skin around eyes. 5. Others: anaemia, hormonal disturbances, nutritional&#xD;
      deficiencies and chronic illnesses .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periorbital hyperpigmentation is graded into four groups according to the severity of the&#xD;
      case to be treated;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade1: characterized by faint pigmentation of infraorbital region.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 2: pigmentation is more pronounced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade3: deep dark color, all four lids involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 4: grade 3 + pigmentation spreading beyond infraorbital fold .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of POH is mainly clinically, however, a thorough history and clinical&#xD;
      assessment is necessary to identify the contributing etiologic factors. The cutaneous&#xD;
      examination should be evaluated to detect the involvement of eyelids, extend beyond the&#xD;
      periorbital region, color of hyperpigmentation, presence of any dermatological disease or&#xD;
      scar, presence of any visible bulging, skin laxity, tear trough, superficial visible&#xD;
      vasculature, in infraorbital region presence of pigmentation in other areas .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye lid stretch test or manual stretching of the lower eyelid skin can help to differentiate&#xD;
      between true pigmentation and shadowing effect .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wood's lamp examination is done to differentiate between the epidermal and dermal&#xD;
      pigmentation.The variations in epidermal pigmentation become more apparent under Wood's&#xD;
      light. For dermal pigmentation, this contrast is less pronounced .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dermatoscopy: It is a non-invasive diagnostic technique for the in vivo observation of&#xD;
      pigmented skin lesion allowing a better visualization of surface and subsurface structures&#xD;
      and being easy and feasible to use. It can be used to differentiate the type of POH whenever&#xD;
      there is doubt while examining with naked eyes. The dermatoscopic findings of POH are- a)&#xD;
      Vascular type: diffuse erythema pattern or multiple thin blood vessels or diffuse vascular&#xD;
      network, b) Pigmented type: a pattern of multiple dots with different sizes and colors or a&#xD;
      diff use network of pigments and c) Mixed type: Combination of vascular and pigmented type .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of POH:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of treatment options available for POH. Among the available treatment&#xD;
      options for POH include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Topical Applications: The various topical bleaching agents are hydroquinone, kojic acid,&#xD;
           a triple combination, azelaic acid, arbutin, topical vitamin C. Out of these topical&#xD;
           agents the most widely used is hydroquinone, used in a strength of 2% to 6% .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Chemical Peelings: Chemical peelings could be used alone or in combination therapy with&#xD;
           topical treatments. Glycolic acid 20% is the most commonly used peeling in the treatment&#xD;
           of POH. Lactic acid 15% + TCA 3.75% combination is very effective treatment option for&#xD;
           POH .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lasers: lasers have been used increasingly in cosmetic dermatology. Periorbital&#xD;
           hyperpigmentation has been successfully treated with various noninvasive lasers that&#xD;
           target pigment and vascularity. Various lasers that have been used for treating dark&#xD;
           circles are: Q switched ruby laser (694 nm), Q switched alexanderite laser, and Nd:Yag&#xD;
           laser (1064nm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP): PRP is a generic term used to describe a plasma suspension&#xD;
           obtained from whole blood, prepared so as to contain platelet concentrations higher than&#xD;
           those normally found in circulating blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of action of PRP is based on the fact that platelets contain many growth&#xD;
      factors in their alpha granules. These factors have a well-known role in the process of&#xD;
      tissue repair. Thus, the concentration of these substances in injured tissues could be&#xD;
      beneficial to providing more agility to the regeneration processes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRP treatment is mainly effective for wrinkles, laxity, and secondary PIH-related dark&#xD;
      circles. PRP can stimulate dermal fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis (Kim DH et&#xD;
      al, 2011). Transforming growth factor-β1 and epidermal growth factor in PRP are suggested to&#xD;
      inhibit melanin production via delayed extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation and&#xD;
      inhibition of prostagandin-E2 expression/ tyrosinase enzyme activity, respectively (Yun WJ et&#xD;
      al, 2013). In addition, PRP improves fat graft survival and can be used in combination with&#xD;
      autologous fat grafts for dark circles&#xD;
