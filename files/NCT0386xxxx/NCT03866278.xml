  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While historically anesthesiologists rely on pharmacokinetics to track the loss of&#xD;
      consciousness, new research in anesthesiology has identified the salient features of the&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) that correlate to states of sedation and unconsciousness induced&#xD;
      by different anesthetic drugs. While the EEG features of many sedative-hypnotic anesthetics&#xD;
      have been well- characterized, the opioid analgesic drugs have not been analyzed in detail in&#xD;
      this way. A characterization of the EEG signatures of opioid analgesic drugs could be useful&#xD;
      in monitoring and titrating the effects of these drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fentanyl is one of the most commonly used opioid analgesic drugs. Prior to induction of&#xD;
      general anesthesia, fentanyl is frequently administered to blunt the nociceptive response to&#xD;
      intubation. A typical scenario is to administer 2 to 4 mcg/kg of fentanyl first, followed by&#xD;
      a sedative hypnotic drug such as propofol to induce general anesthesia. In this study, we&#xD;
      propose to administer a total of 4 mcg/kg of fentanyl, administered in 2 boluses, before&#xD;
      administering a sedative hypnotic drug. At this dose, fentanyl will serve to blunt&#xD;
      nociception during intubation, but will also contribute to intraoperative pain management.&#xD;
      During this time, we will record the EEG using standard EEG-based anesthetic monitors that&#xD;
      are routinely used in the operating room. We will assess the patient's level of&#xD;
      responsiveness using an auditory task and ulnar nerve stimulation. These measurements will&#xD;
      allow us to identify the EEG signatures of fentanyl for future use in EEG-based anesthetic&#xD;
      monitoring. During this study we will measure EEG and responses to auditory and ulnar nerve&#xD;
      stimuli during induction of general anesthesia in surgical patients. The anesthetic will be&#xD;
      administered according to a typical sequence in which fentanyl is first administered,&#xD;
      followed by a sedative hypnotic drug for induction of general anesthesia. The primary&#xD;
      difference is that, in this study, we will record the EEG and response data for a short&#xD;
      period of time after initial administration of fentanyl and prior to administration of a&#xD;
      sedative hypnotic drug to induce general anesthesia.&#xD;
