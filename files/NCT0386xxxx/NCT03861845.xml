    <textblock>
      This study uses an experimental design to test the impact of different types of pillboxes on&#xD;
      medication adherence. Participants in this study will randomized to receive one of the three&#xD;
      pillbox interventions: 1) A standard seven day a week, one-dose per day pillbox with training&#xD;
      2) an off-the-shelf pillbox that was purchased specifically for the individual's needs with&#xD;
      training and education, or 3) a customized 3D printed pillbox that was designed and&#xD;
      manufactured specifically to the individual's needs with training and education. Participants&#xD;
      will have three visits with the research team to collect baseline data, receive the pillbox,&#xD;
      and collect follow up data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to the study include loss of time, boredom, invasion of privacy, and medication errors.&#xD;
      The investigators have taken precautions to mitigate these risks. This study will improve&#xD;
      understanding of medication adherence and potentially help us better address poor medication&#xD;
      adherence which needlessly causes morbidity, mortality, and costs over $300 million in&#xD;
      unnecessary healthcare costs each year.&#xD;

    <measure>Medication Adherence at 1 Month</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence will be measured by the Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale (ARMS). The ARMS is a 7-item assessment. Participants indicate the extent of their adherence on a 4-point Likert-like scale. Scores range from 7 - 28, with higher scores indicating worse medication adherence.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction With Pillbox at 1 Month</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (QUEST 2.0) quantifies a participant's satisfaction with their pillbox on a five-point Likert-like scale across 8 features (dimensions, weight, ease in opening/closing the device, safety and security, durability, ease of use, comfort, and effectiveness). A score of 1 indicates not satisfied at all and a score of 5 indicates being very satisfied. Scores indicate the average score on the Likert-like scale.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Completed the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>This metric serves to describe the feasibility of the study and indicates the number of individuals that completed all study interactions. All individuals who enrolled into the study and signed an informed consent document are included in this calculation.</description>
