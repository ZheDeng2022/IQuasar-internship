  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being conducted to develop consensus on surveillance mammography and&#xD;
      follow-up for breast cancer survivors who are age ≥75.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will develop a communication tool that summarizes recommendations for&#xD;
      clinicians and patients for surveillance mammography and follow-up care for breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors age ≥75. Developing expert-panel recommendations, examining clinician and patient&#xD;
      attitudes towards these recommendations, and testing a strategy for communication of expert&#xD;
      recommendations on mammography cessation through direct engagement of specialists, primary&#xD;
      care clinicians (PCs), and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-step study, the investigators will build on prior steps to develop consensus&#xD;
      on surveillance mammography and follow-ups for breast cancer survivors who are age &gt;= 75.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes a physician focus group.&#xD;
