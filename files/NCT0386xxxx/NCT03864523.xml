  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a rare, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disorder, due to&#xD;
      loss of function of a fatty acid transporter, the peroxisomal ABCD1 protein. Its more&#xD;
      frequent phenotype, the adrenomyeloneuropathy in adults, is characterized by axonal&#xD;
      degeneration in spinal cord, spastic paraparesis and a disabling peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
      Actually, there is no efficient treatment for the disease. The work of the researchers in the&#xD;
      last twelve years dissecting the physiopathological basis of the disorder has uncovered an&#xD;
      involvement of the early oxidative stress in the neurodegenerative cascade and mitocondrial&#xD;
      depletion. In a preclinical trial they have observed that pioglitazone, a PPARγ/PGC-1α axis&#xD;
      metabolic activator with immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant response&#xD;
      regulator properties, efficiently reverse the clinical symptoms and the axonal degeneration&#xD;
      in the mouse model for the disease and normalize stress and mitochondrial depletion&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will test the effectiveness of the drug in terms of motor function and&#xD;
      correction of oxidative damage markers in proteins and DNA and inflammation markers in an&#xD;
      open trial. Fifteen-twenty patients will be included and clinically explored and assessed in&#xD;
      the HU of Bellvitge and the HU of Donostia using clinical scales for spasticity, evoked&#xD;
      potentials, electroneurinograms and cranial RMN. The information will be collected in a data&#xD;
      base that will be of great value to improve the present attention and the future follow-up of&#xD;
      the patients and to facilitate their inclusion in therapeutic randomized, double blind,&#xD;
      against placebo, multicentric and international clinical trials.&#xD;

      Proof of concept for this trial is provided by the results of biochemical, neuropathological&#xD;
      and motor effects of pioglitazone in two mouse models of AMN. Pioglitazone was given orally&#xD;
      (9 mg/kg/day) for two months in both models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Abcd1-null mouse model already shows at 3,5 months biochemical signs oxidative stress&#xD;
      that increase with time and are then associated with energy homeostasis alterations, although&#xD;
      first clinical signs of AMN-i.e. axonopathy and locomotor impairment-appear at 20 months. In&#xD;
      these mice, there are mitochondrial anomalies, decreased levels of PGC-1α which is a master&#xD;
      regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, and decreased levels and activity of SIRT1α, which&#xD;
      activates PGC-1α.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Abcd1-null mouse can be considered as a &quot;AMN-like&quot; model, because of the absence of&#xD;
      demyelinating lesions in brain and spinal cord, the presence of non-inflammatory&#xD;
      ''dying-back'' axonopathy in peripheral nerves and spinal cord and its late-onset motor&#xD;
      deficits that all are hallmarks of AMN in X-ALD patients. This model was used to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of pioglitazone on several biochemical markers in the spinal cord of Abcd1-null mice&#xD;
      (N=12), using comparisons with placebo-¬treated Abcd1-null mice (N=12) or wild-type mice&#xD;
      (N=12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Abcd1-null mice treated with pioglitazone at 10,5 months of age and studied at 12 months&#xD;
      (1,5 months following the beginning of the ongoing treatment), mitochondrial anomalies were&#xD;
      corrected to the level of wild type control mice. Indeed, mitochondrial DNA and protein&#xD;
      (including PGC-1α, NRF1 and TFAM) levels were corrected; as well as mitochondrial metabolism,&#xD;
      as assessed by pyruvate kinase activity, ATP and NAD+ concentrations. Pioglitazone had no&#xD;
      effect on SIRT1 expression (mRNA and protein levels). However, pioglitazone significantly&#xD;
      lowered the carbonylation of SIRT1 protein, which presumably accounts for the observed rescue&#xD;
      of SIRT1 activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these mice treated with pioglitazone, oxidative lesions in the spinal cord were reversed.&#xD;
      Studied oxidative stress biomarkers included markers of oxidative lesions to proteins (GSA,&#xD;
      AASA), lipids (MDAL) and carbohydrates (CEL). Additionally, the activity and concentration&#xD;
      level of antioxidant enzymes GPX1, which were increased in untreated Abcd1-null mice, but not&#xD;
      SOD2, was normalized to the level of wild type mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second mouse model is the double knockouts (DKO) in which both Abcd1 and Abcd2&#xD;
      transporters are inactivated. The Abcd1-/Abcd2-/-DKO exhibits greater VLCFA accumulation in&#xD;
      spinal cord (Pujol et al., 2004), higher levels of oxidative damage to proteins, and a more&#xD;
      severe AMN-¬like pathology, with earlier onset of motor impairment than the single Abcd1-null&#xD;
      mouse (12 months in the DKO compared to 20 months in Abcd1-null mice). Efficacy of&#xD;
      pioglitazone at the motor and neuropathologic levels was studied in 17 Abcd1-/Abcd2-/-mice&#xD;
      comparing them with placebo-treated Abcd1-/Abcd2-/-mice (N=17) and wild-type mice (N=25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Abcd1-/Abcd2-/-mice treated with pioglitazone at 13 months of age and studied at 15 or 17&#xD;
      months (treatment duration of 2 to 4 months), axonal degeneration was prevented, as shown by&#xD;
      the normalization to the control level of number of APP or synaptophysin positive axons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, pioglitazone arrested the progression of locomotor deficits in these mice, as assessed&#xD;
      by the treadmill test and the bar-cross test. Indeed, the locomotor performances of&#xD;
      pioglitazone DKO after four months of treatment mice reached the performances of the&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, these studies show the efficacy of treatment with pioglitazone in &quot;AMN-like mice&#xD;
      &quot;and provide a strong rationale for conducting a preliminary open clinical trial with&#xD;
      pioglitazone in AMN patients.&#xD;
