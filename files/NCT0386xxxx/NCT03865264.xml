  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test if using these living donor-specific pre-transplant&#xD;
      resources would lead to a better and faster recovery post-transplant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Donor safety and outcomes are the chief concerns of programs performing living donor liver&#xD;
      and kidney transplantation. The protection of donors from physical and emotional harm has&#xD;
      been a fundamental principle in living donor liver and kidney donation from the beginning.&#xD;
      The safety of living donor hepatectomy and nephrectomy has been established. The risks&#xD;
      associated with the donation have been deemed acceptable by the transplant community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to move beyond the safety of the operation and address the most&#xD;
      important post-operative issues that potentially cause donors physical and emotional stress:&#xD;
      these include pain control, appropriate nutrition for optimal liver regeneration and&#xD;
      physical/functional recovery, fatigue, time to return to normal physical and work activity,&#xD;
      and difficulties coping with recovery and any possible complications. The goal of conducting&#xD;
      this study is to create a program of pre- and post-operative interventions to enhance&#xD;
      recovery so that patients can return to their normal quality of life as soon as possible.&#xD;
      Currently there is no literature on programs to enhance living donor care and recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted to determine if interventions during the pre-operative (a&#xD;
      minimum of four weeks in an exercise program), intra-operative (anesthesia), and&#xD;
      post-operative (pain management) stages have an effect on liver and kidney donor patients'&#xD;
      quality of life and return to baseline functional status.&#xD;
