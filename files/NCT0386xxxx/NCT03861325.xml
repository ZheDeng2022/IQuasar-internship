  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the investigators is that patients with septic shock in ICU have acute&#xD;
      intestinal insufficiency favoring subclinical microbial translocation, which is the&#xD;
      consequence of alterations of the epithelium, and is accompanied by qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative changes in the gut microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the incidence of microbial translocation by measuring&#xD;
      16S rDNA and 18S rDNA plasma levels in a patient population with septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the kinetics of markers of intestinal insufficiency (I-FABP / zonulin) over&#xD;
           time (at admission, 12 hours after admission, one day, two day, three days and seven day&#xD;
           after admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the correlation between the titer of I-FABP, zonulin, 16srDNA, 18srDNA and the&#xD;
           stages of acute gastrointestinal insufficiency (AGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish correlations between the microorganisms of the intestinal microbiota and the&#xD;
           bacteria involved in microbial translocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the possible correlations between the 16SrDNA levels and the other bacterial&#xD;
           markers (sCD14, LBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the evolution of the composition and the diversity of the gut microbiota in the&#xD;
           first 7 days of septic shock&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All eligible patients admitted for septic shock in resuscitation at Nimes will be included in&#xD;
      the study, after verification of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria and with their&#xD;
      agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study with no impact on the quality of care provided. All study data&#xD;
      will be entered into an electronic CRF (e-CRF) directly or from the paper version of the&#xD;
      scorecard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entry into the e-CRF is controlled and formatted to prohibit the input of out-of-bounds&#xD;
      or outliers. In case of modification of data entry, traceability and monitoring of activities&#xD;
      is ensured. An electronic signature committing the responsibility of the investigator of each&#xD;
      center will allow the validation of the visit and the e-CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only those persons participating in the research project and identified will have access to&#xD;
      the software allowing this entry: Redcap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Redcap software that allows you to generate electronic CRFs (e-CRF), electronically capture&#xD;
      data, manage it and restore it. It also makes it possible to follow the progress of studies&#xD;
      in terms of data entry and to manage them. It is open source software that is extensible,&#xD;
      modular and based on international standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Redcap software allows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data entry, validation and annotation by clinicians and research associates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data extraction, filtering and analysis by investigators&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study management by study coordinators&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring, auditing, configuration and reporting by administrators The electronic&#xD;
           observation notebook creation software is hosted on a website within the CHU of Nîmes.&#xD;
           Access to this application is secure and is via a password. Data collected through this&#xD;
           software is backed up daily on a secure network. The network is connected to the&#xD;
           internet, the access is protected by a firewall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical data of the study will be stored on a specific directory of the server. Only the&#xD;
      network administrators and the authorized persons of the clinical research unit of the&#xD;
      medical information department can have access to this directory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IT arrangements made to enforce the confidentiality commitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The technical resources are located in the IT department whose access is controlled and&#xD;
           secure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The data is stored on a server hosted in a secure room at the CHU Nîmes.&#xD;

    <description>The metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiota is based on the high-throughput sequencing of all bacteria in a stool sample by targeting the 16S rRNA genes. The first step of this technique is to PCR amplify a 16S rDNA genomic target (eg V3-V4 regions) from stool sample DNA and to control the amplified sequences (called &quot;libraries&quot;). The second step consists in sequencing the libraries on a sequencing automaton. The bioinformatic analysis of the sequences consists of making a reference sequence library of the 16S rDNA target and aligning the sequences obtained with this database in order to establish lists of present organisms and taxonomic trees (OTU - operational taxonomic unit).</description>
