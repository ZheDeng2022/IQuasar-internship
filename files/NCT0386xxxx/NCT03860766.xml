  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Photobiomodulation has been explored for years, with wide clinical use for wound&#xD;
      healing and analgesia in varied orthopedic conditions, but the number of research and&#xD;
      clinical use has increased during the last decade. Furthermore, considering the performance,&#xD;
      the current literature is conflicting and restricted, with divergences in wavelength, power&#xD;
      and energy density applied. Therefore, analyze different doses for a answer in short and long&#xD;
      time, associated with capacities of strength, fatigue resistance and functional performance&#xD;
      of handball players and healthy individuals becomes necessary. Objective: To analyze the&#xD;
      effects of the application of LED photobiomodulation on the capacities of strength,&#xD;
      functional efficiency, temperature and fatigue resistance of handball players and healthy&#xD;
      individuals. Method: The study sample will be composed of 56 male individuals randomly&#xD;
      allocated into four groups: LED 50J (G-50J), LED 240J (G-240J), LED 50-240J (G-50-240J) -&#xD;
      progressive dose and Sham (G-S). The volunteers will be submitted to an evaluation of muscle&#xD;
      performance and functional performance, metabolic, and physiological evaluation. After&#xD;
      initial tests, in five consecutive weeks, the LEDT (940nm - infrared) will be applied to the&#xD;
      quadriceps femoris muscle and hamstrings, bilaterally, associated with a muscle strength&#xD;
      protocol. After 24 hours of the last application TLED, the tests will be repeated. Seven days&#xD;
      after the last intervention will be performed a follow-up. For analysis, normality tests will&#xD;
      be used to verify the distribution and adequate statistical tests for the appropriate intra&#xD;
      and intergroup comparisons, being considered two factors in the comparisons, time, and group.&#xD;
      A significance level of 5% will be adopted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a blinded randomized clinical trial. The volunteers will undergo pre-evaluation, 5&#xD;
      weeks of training associated with the LED application, being distributed in two applications&#xD;
      per week, and a re-evaluation 24 hours after the last application, totaling a total of&#xD;
      approximately 7 weeks. Thus, on the first day (Pre-test) volunteers will be submitted to&#xD;
      anthropometric evaluation and evaluation by bioimpedance for analysis of detailed body&#xD;
      composition. Then, the maximum voluntary contraction test (CVM) will be performed on the&#xD;
      isokinetic dynamometer, together with the electromyographic evaluation. Before and after the&#xD;
      evaluation with the isokinetic dynamometer, thermography will be collected. Still, will be&#xD;
      evaluated the vertical jump test after 15 minutes of passive rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial evaluations, the researcher will go apply the respective interventions,&#xD;
      which consist of applying LEDs all over the quadriceps and hamstring bilaterally, while the&#xD;
      sham group (GS) will receive the LED application off, without the emission of light. The&#xD;
      application will occur for five weeks and will occur twice weekly, on days spaced for at&#xD;
      least 48 hours. The same will be done in conjunction with the lower limb strength training&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tests performed at the time of pre-application of the LED (Pre-test) will be reapplied in&#xD;
      the same order 24 hours after the last application of the interventions. After seven days of&#xD;
      the last application, the isokinetic evaluation, electromyography, and vertical jump&#xD;
      evaluation will be performed. In addition, at the end of the second and fourth weeks, the&#xD;
      volunteer will carry out an evaluation with the isokinetic dynamometer, electromyography,&#xD;
      plethysmography, and thermography.&#xD;
