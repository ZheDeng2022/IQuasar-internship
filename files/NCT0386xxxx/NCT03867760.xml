    <textblock>
      Cancer survivors who suffer from chronic pain would benefit from a low-cost, self-management&#xD;
      intervention they can use at home. This study will evaluate the efficacy of a recorded&#xD;
      hypnosis intervention in reducing chronic pain among cancer survivors and will explore its&#xD;
      biological and psychological mechanisms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate if a 4-week recorded hypnosis&#xD;
      intervention (RHI) works for reducing chronic pain in 100 adult cancer survivors who have&#xD;
      completed active treatment. The RHI will be compared to an attention control condition&#xD;
      (relaxation recording). qEEG measurement will be obtained while listening to the RHI at weeks&#xD;
      0, 2, and 4 to explore if brain states are related to hypnotic analgesia during the 4-week&#xD;
      study period in 20 study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Does the RHI work? Evaluate the efficacy of RHI in reducing self-reported pain&#xD;
      intensity (primary outcome), pain interference, anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep&#xD;
      disturbance (secondary outcomes) at 4 weeks compared to the attention control condition&#xD;
      (relaxation recording). Hypothesis: RHI will significantly reduce pain intensity, pain&#xD;
      interference, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance at 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: For whom does the RHI work? Examine if psychological factors (hypnotic suggestibility,&#xD;
      mental absorption, treatment outcome expectancy, fear of cancer recurrence, resilience,&#xD;
      self-efficacy) influence the relationship between RHI and pain intensity at weeks 0, 2, and&#xD;
      4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: How does the RHI work? a. Compare brain activity as measured by electroencephalogram&#xD;
      (EEG) in cancer survivors with chronic pain (n=30) receiving the RHI relative to the&#xD;
      attention control condition (relaxation recording) at weeks 0, 2, and 4. b. Explore the&#xD;
      effects of brain activity on pain intensity at weeks 0, 2, and 4. In addition, structured&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted with participants to understand facilitators and barriers&#xD;
      associated with undergoing EEG at three time points and perceptions on how the intervention&#xD;
      works to reduce pain.&#xD;

    <description>The RHI consists of four digital recordings developed by the investigator using standardized hypnosis scripts for pain reduction and uploaded to a MP3 player. The scripts were developed for patients with chronic pain and tested by a psychologist who is an expert in hypnosis research. Participants will listen to the recordings daily for 28 days in the prescribed order (4 recordings for 3 days each, and then any recording for the remaining 16 days). The script includes an induction, suggestions for how to access inner resources and manage pain, and post-hypnotic suggestions for permanence of hypnosis benefits and self-hypnosis practice.</description>
