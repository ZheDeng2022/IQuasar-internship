      This is an open-label, multi-center, single arm study evaluating the blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
      changes from baseline (Visit 3) to post-treatment (Visit 5) assessed by ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring (ABPM) in LPCN 1021 treated adult hypogonadal male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is comprised of six scheduled visits: Visit 1 and 2 are for screening, Visit 3 is&#xD;
      to assess subject's baseline BP and pulse rate (PR) via ABPM. Visit 4 is to enroll subjects,&#xD;
      and to provide subjects with study medication for the start of dosing. Visit 5 is to assess&#xD;
      subject's post-treatment BP and PR via ABPM. Visit 6 is to perform exit visit procedures.&#xD;
