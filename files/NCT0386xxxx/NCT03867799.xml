      This is a single-arm, single centre open-label, phase II interventional clinical trial of&#xD;
      combination immunotherapy with Nivolumab and Relatlimab in mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with metastatic RAS/RAF WT colorectal cancer who have previously had a radiological&#xD;
      response to EGFR inhibitors i.e. Cetuximab or Panitumumab, either combined with chemotherapy&#xD;
      or as single agents, but subsequently experienced progression of their disease will be&#xD;
      eligible for the study. They will consent to the study ideally within 3 months having&#xD;
      progressed/ become refractory to EGFR blockable and undergo a mandatory baseline biopsy&#xD;
      within this time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive Nivolumab and Relatlimab every 4 weeks and will start on study&#xD;
      treatment as soon as possible after the baseline biopsy. After starting on the study drugs,&#xD;
      there will be a mandatory 'on-treatment' biopsy at day 21 ± 3 days. Response assessments in&#xD;
      the form of either CT or MRI scans will take place every 8 weeks throughout the study for the&#xD;
      12 months and every 12 weeks from 12 months onwards. Patients will continue on the study&#xD;
      until progressive disease (PD) is confirmed by RECIST 1.1 or when maximum duration of&#xD;
      treatment of 24 months has been reached&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be the possibility of 'treating beyond progression' if participants are deriving&#xD;
      clinical benefit from treatment to encompass the possibility of pseudoprogression. At PD&#xD;
      participants will undergo a further biopsy. The investigators envisage enrolling a total of&#xD;
      25 participants and the investigators anticipate 30 months as a feasible time frame for&#xD;
      accrual.&#xD;
