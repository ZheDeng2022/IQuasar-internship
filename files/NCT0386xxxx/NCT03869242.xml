      Study Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety outcome of newly diagnosed GBM patients&#xD;
      treated with NovoTTF-200A concomitant to RT and TMZ to those treated with RT and TMZ alone&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective, randomized, open label, standard of care control Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that addition of NovoTTF-200A treatment to RT and TMZ will&#xD;
      significantly increase progression free survival of newly diagnosed GBM patients compared to&#xD;
      patients treated with RT and TMZ alone Sample Size: 60 patients with newly diagnosed GBM&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients with tissue based diagnosis of GBM, above 18 years of age, of both&#xD;
      genders after surgery or biopsy amenable for radiation therapy (RT) with concomitant TMZ&#xD;
      (Stupp protocol1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rate of progression-free survival at 12 months (PFS12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression free survival at 6 months (PFS6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 and 2-year survival rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall radiological response (ORR, per RANO criteria)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GBM), a malignant form of astrocytoma, is the most common primary intracranial&#xD;
      neoplasm in adults2. The incidence of GBM increases steadily above 45 years of age with a&#xD;
      prevalence of approximately 7500 cases in the USA. Despite numerous attempts to improve the&#xD;
      outcome of patients with GBM, the 3-year survival of patients treated with maximal surgical&#xD;
      resection when feasible, 60 Gy radiotherapy (RT) together with concomitant temozolomide (TMZ)&#xD;
      (RT/TMZ), followed by maintenance (adjuvant) TMZ for 6 months was only 6% with median&#xD;
      survival of 14.6 months1. In a prospective phase 3 trial, the addition of TTFields (200 kHz)&#xD;
      to maintenance temozolomide increased the median overall survival of patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      study following RT/TMZ to 20.9 months, compared with 16.0 months only in the&#xD;
      temozolomide-alone group (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53-0.76; P &lt; .001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TTFields are a novel treatment modality for the treatment of malignant tumors that is also&#xD;
      referred to as the fourth modality of cancer treatment in addition to surgery, radiation&#xD;
      therapy, and chemotherapy. Pre-clinical studies3-9 have shown this treatment modality to&#xD;
      effectively inhibit the growth of experimental tumors both in-vitro and in-vivo without any&#xD;
      systemic side effects. Large-scale, phase III clinical studies have validated the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of TTFields in patients with recurrent and newly diagnosed glioblastoma10,11.&#xD;
      TTFields has now been approved as a standard treatment for GBM by most of the regulatory&#xD;
      agencies around the world and its application is steadily increasing worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Treatment of GBM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The currently accepted standard treatment of newly diagnosed GBM is based on: surgical&#xD;
      resection to the extent safely feasible followed by RT with concomitant TMZ, followed by&#xD;
      adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy in combination with TTFields. Each of these treatments is briefly&#xD;
      described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surgical resection - Treatment of patients with GBM usually consists of tumor resection&#xD;
           (to the extent safely feasible) or diagnostic biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Radiotherapy (RT) - Post-surgical RT improves survival, though even with maximal&#xD;
           treatment, survival after RT alone is still limited to about one year1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Temozolomide (TMZ) - Concomitant TMZ chemotherapy during RT and adjuvant (maintenance)&#xD;
           TMZ for 6 cycles has been shown to significantly improve survival (HR 0.63). This&#xD;
           combined modality treatment is considered the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. According to the TMZ (Temodar®, Temodal®) package insert adjuvant TMZ treatment&#xD;
                delays disease progression (from 5 to 6.9 months) and improves overall survival&#xD;
                (from 12.1 to 14.6 months)1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. In the RTOG0525/EORTC Intergroup trial where patients were randomized after the end&#xD;
                of TMZ/RT (similar to the EF-14 trial), progression-free survival was also only 6-7&#xD;
                months (estimated from curve)12&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. GLIADEL™ Wafers in combination with surgical resection - Gliadel™ Wafers deliver&#xD;
           carmustine (BCNU) directly to the bed of the resected tumor. Gliadel has been approved&#xD;
           for GBM after surgical resection, based on trials performed before TMZ therapy was&#xD;
           established13.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. The package insert indicates that for newly diagnosed GBM, Gliadel™ increased median&#xD;
           overall survival from 11.6 to 13.9 months compared to placebo. Progression-free survival&#xD;
           with Gliadel™ wafers has been reported as 5.9 months27. No prospective data of Gliadel™&#xD;
           in combination with TMZ has been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. TTFields - Clinical trials of TTFields have proven safe and efficacious in patients with&#xD;
           recurrent and newly diagnosed GBM. The median OS in the large scale phase III clinical&#xD;
           study in newly diagnosed GBM patients (EF-14) was 20.9 months in the TTFields plus TMZ&#xD;
           group vs. 16 months in the TMZ alone group11. Accordingly, TTFields (Optune®) are now&#xD;
           FDA-approved for use in newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, despite the improvement in OS following the introduction of TTFields into the&#xD;
      standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM patients, the survival of most patients remains&#xD;
      poor. Therefore, new treatments, as well as strategies for maximizing the benefit from&#xD;
      currently available therapies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN A prospective, randomly controlled pivotal study will be conducted on 60&#xD;
      patients (randomized at a 1:1 ratio). Patients with histologically confirmed GBM will be&#xD;
      randomized after debulking surgery or biopsy to either RT with concomitant TMZ and TTFields&#xD;
      (200 kHz) for 6 weeks followed by up to 24 months of maintenance TMZ in combination with&#xD;
      TTFields (experimental arm), or RT with concomitant TMZ alone followed by maintenance TMZ&#xD;
      chemotherapy in combination with TTFields (control). The primary endpoint will be rate of&#xD;
      progression free survival at 12 months (PFS12). The sample size was chosen based on the Exact&#xD;
      test for proportion (See XX Statistical Considerations). In short, in order to detect a PFS12&#xD;
      of 46.5% in patients treated with RT/TMZ/TTFields followed by maintenance TMZ+TTFields,&#xD;
      compared to the 29.4% calculated from the EF-14 experimental arm of patients treated with&#xD;
      RT/TMZ alone followed by maintenance TMZ+TTFields, a sample size of 60 patients randomized in&#xD;
      a ratio of 1:1 (30 patients in each arm) is required to achieve a power of 80% at two-sided&#xD;
      alpha level of 0.05 using the Exact test for proportion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be considered disease progression (based on the RANO criteria; Tab D):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 25% or more increase in enhancing lesions despite stable or increasing steroid dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increase (significant) in non-enhancing FLAIR/T2W lesions, not attributable to other&#xD;
           non-tumor causes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Any new lesions Progression suspected from a clinical evaluation of the patient will&#xD;
           need to be radiologically confirmed using an MRI scan. The criteria will not be applied&#xD;
           in case of suspected pseudoprogression, unless the tumor continues to grow.&#xD;
