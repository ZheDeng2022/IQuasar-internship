      Can probiotic Vivomixx eradicate Extended Spectrum BetaLactam (ESBL) colonization in adult&#xD;
      patients?&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infections due to extended spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (ESCRE) are a&#xD;
      widely recognized public health threat. The prevalence of ESCRE is comparably low in Sweden&#xD;
      but is steadily increasing; approximately 5 % of Swedish inhabitants are carrying ESCRE in&#xD;
      the gut. ESCRE can lead to infections mainly from urine, abdomen and blood. These infections&#xD;
      can be problematic to treat with current available antibiotics and represent a clinical&#xD;
      challenge for clinicians around the world with considerable mortality and morbidity. Risk&#xD;
      factors for acquiring an ESCRE is e.g. antibiotic treatment, trips to high prevalence&#xD;
      countries, family member with ESCRE etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of ESCRE carriage is not known. One Swedish study showed that ESCRE carriage can&#xD;
      continue despite antibiotic treatment and that false negative cultures in between positive&#xD;
      cultures are common. Since few new groups of antibiotics have been developed in the last&#xD;
      decades, infections due to ESCRE may be increasingly difficult to treat. The possibility of&#xD;
      ESCRE decolonization is therefore a desirable aim, in particular the more virulent&#xD;
      enterobacteriaceae strains leading to recurrent clinical infection episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are microorganisms marketed as useful bacteria effective locally in the gut. In&#xD;
      recent years many studies have focused on potential health benefits in a range of different&#xD;
      gastrointestinal diseases e.g. ulcerous colitis, Crohn's disease, antibiotic associated&#xD;
      diarrhoea where probiotics potentially have a therapeutic role4. Smaller studies have shown&#xD;
      that probiotics possibly can bind and eliminate enteric pathogenic bacteria5-6. A small in&#xD;
      vitro study showed that probiotics can be effective against antibiotic resistant bacteria.&#xD;
      Larger clinical treatment studies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESCRE constitutes a clinical problem and is largely seen in Escherichia coli and klebsiella&#xD;
      spp. The investigator's theory is that the probiotic Vivomixx can reject ESCRE and thus&#xD;
      decolonize the gut. Vivomixx contains eight different strains of probiotics; Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      breve, B. longum, B. infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. paracasei, L.&#xD;
      bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and has the best documentation in clinical studies for&#xD;
      enteric diseases of today.&#xD;
