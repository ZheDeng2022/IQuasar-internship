    <textblock>
      The aim of the Football Players Health Study (FPHS) is to advance the understanding of the&#xD;
      complex and inter-related pathways that can develop into player related illness and&#xD;
      disability. Former National Football League players will be given the opportunity to undergo&#xD;
      2&amp;1/2 days of rigorous assessment in the areas of Cardiac Dysfunction, Neurocognitive&#xD;
      Disease, Chronic Pain, and Sleep Apnea to attempt to define the pathology among former&#xD;
      professional athletes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the long term health impacts of being exposed to a career in&#xD;
      professional football. The primary objective of this study is to assess the relationship&#xD;
      between affliction definitions, as subjectively described by participants in the first phase&#xD;
      of the study (Q1), and objective pathology as defined by standard of care clinical and&#xD;
      investigational testing. An exploratory secondary objective of this study is to examine the&#xD;
      relationships between exposure to football, defined within the parameters of how old was the&#xD;
      participant when their career started, how long did they play professional football, what was&#xD;
      the participants field position and objective pathology defined as standard of clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questions the study hopes to answer are as follows: 1) Are subjective complaints among&#xD;
      former professional football players associated with objective evidence of pathology as&#xD;
      measured by clinically accepted diagnostic testing (Primary objective), and 2) Is exposure to&#xD;
      professional football, as defined by variables including career duration and player field&#xD;
      position, associated with cardiac dysfunction, neurocognitive disease, chronic pain, and&#xD;
      sleep apnea (Secondary objective).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol has been constructed with an emphasis on reducing risk and maximizing yield.&#xD;
      The Investigators who will be performing the assessments across the Harvard Medical School&#xD;
      Institutions have worked together to minimize potential risk exposure by carefully selecting&#xD;
      imaging protocols that limit radiation exposure, keeping phlebotomy limited, and by&#xD;
      conducting these assessments under the supervision of investigators with established track&#xD;
      records for conducting safe and effective human subject research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study visit will occur over 2&amp;1/2 days. All costs of transportation, lodging, and meals&#xD;
      will be covered by the study. All participants will have the assistance of a Study Navigator,&#xD;
      a member of the FPHS staff who will accompany the participant. This navigator will assure&#xD;
      that the participant gets to each assessment, helps to make decisions regarding scheduling&#xD;
      issues or conflicts, assesses the need for additional breaks, and acts as a resource and&#xD;
      guide for the participant throughout the study. The navigator will be in communication with&#xD;
      key members of the research team for real time decision making (aborting or skipping an&#xD;
      assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be advised that results from these assessments are research results and are&#xD;
      not meant for any diagnosis of disease. However, assessment results will be given to the&#xD;
      participant if they wish to receive them. Any incidental finding that may have clinical&#xD;
      relevance will be explained by a Study Physician and the Medical Navigation Nurse, and the&#xD;
      participant will be assisted in obtaining follow up care.&#xD;

Scores of &gt;15 will be considered positive for sleep apnea</description>
