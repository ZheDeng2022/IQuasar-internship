  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether, in patients with non treated&#xD;
      periodontitis (stage III and IV) positive to Porphyromonas gingivalis, the use of systemic&#xD;
      antimicrobials (metronidazole versus azithromycin) as an adjunctive treatment to periodontal&#xD;
      surgery provides clinical and microbiological benefits.&#xD;

      Design: randomized, parallel and triple blind clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: Patients with periodontitis (stages III and IV) and positive to Porphyromonas&#xD;
      gingivalis who potentially need periodontal surgery were recruited. 25 patients were&#xD;
      randomized to the test group (periodontal surgery + azithromycin) and another 25 subjects to&#xD;
      the control group (periodontal surgery + metronidazole).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examiner calibration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment of patients. Screening. Data collection (clinical and microbiological&#xD;
           variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Non-surgical periodontal treatment (2 visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reevaluation at 6 weeks. Data collection (clinical and microbiological variables).&#xD;
                Identification of study candidate patients (Patients with probing pocket depth &gt; 5&#xD;
                mm and positive to Porphyromonas gingivalis). Randomization of study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II. Surgical periodontal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Periodontal surgery sessions. In the last surgery, the antibiotic test&#xD;
                (azithromycin) or metronidazole (control) is administered according to&#xD;
                randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Suture removal 1 week after performing periodontal surgery. Data collection 1 week&#xD;
                after antibiotic consumption with the last surgery (patient-centered variables on&#xD;
                the side effects of antibiotics).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Re-evaluation of the surgical phase at 6 weeks after the last surgery session. Data&#xD;
                collection (clinical variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase III. Periodontal maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Maintenance 1 (3 months post surgery). Data collection (Clinical and&#xD;
                microbiological variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Maintenance 2 (6 months post surgery). Data collection (Clinical and&#xD;
                microbiological variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Maintenance 3 (9 months post surgery). Data collection (Clinical variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Maintenance 4 (12 months post surgery). Data collection (Clinical and&#xD;
                microbiological variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Maintenance 5 (4 years post surgery). Data collection (Clinical and microbiological&#xD;
                variables).&#xD;

    <masking_description>The subjects were randomly assigned to the treatment groups in ascending order according to a balanced distribution system through a computer generated random number design table (random block design). Randomization was balanced according to the smoking habit at the initial visit to ensure homogeneity in the treatment groups.&#xD;
The method of allocation concealment selected were opaque envelopes. The research coordinator was responsible for the randomization and allocation of patients.&#xD;
The 50 opaque envelopes (25 / group) were prepared.</masking_description>
