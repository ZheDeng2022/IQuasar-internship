  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult degenerative scoliosis is the most common spine deformity in adults. Patients present a&#xD;
      lateral curvature of the spine and vertebra rotation. Curves meeting indications for&#xD;
      treatment affect 24% of the aging adult population. Adult scoliosis causes pain, curve&#xD;
      progression, and cosmetic deformity affecting quality of life and function. Pain affects 90%&#xD;
      of patients with AS. Other than surgery for severe cases and pain medication, very little&#xD;
      non-operative treatments have been investigated. Scoliosis-specific exercises have shown&#xD;
      promise in a single study in adults and in an Alberta adolescent study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this pilot randomized controlled trial on the effect of Schroth exercises in&#xD;
      adults with degenerative scoliosis compared to observation is to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      conducting a larger study. This study will help plan and secure funding for a larger study by&#xD;
      examining the ability to recruit enough eligible participants, whether patients can follow&#xD;
      the prescribed program session attendance and complete the home exercises prescribed. The&#xD;
      early estimate the effects of the exercises on pain, quality of life, disability, deformity&#xD;
      and posture measurements will help determine the potential of this approach and the likely&#xD;
      success of a larger RCT. This study addresses a need of adults with degenerative scoliosis&#xD;
      who do not meet surgical indications but still experience pain and disability by exploring a&#xD;
      promising exercise approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1.1 Adult degenerative scoliosis. Scoliosis is a 3D spine deformity including frontal curves,&#xD;
      vertebral rotations, and sagittal changes.1 A curve &gt;10o after 18 years of age is called&#xD;
      Adult Scoliosis (AS) and is the most common adult spinal deformity.2 Degenerative AS arises&#xD;
      from asymmetric disc and facet degeneration or due to leg length discrepancy, hip pathology,&#xD;
      and osteoporosis.3 Most AS curves are lumbar or thoracolumbar.4 The prevalence of&#xD;
      degenerative AS is higher than adolescent scoliosis, but estimates range widely at 2.4% -&#xD;
      68%56. The prevalence of curves &gt;20° is 24%.7&#xD;
&#xD;
      AS causes pain, curve progression, radiculopathy, or cosmetic deformity affecting quality of&#xD;
      life and physical function8-10. Pain affects 90% of patients with AS9. Adults with&#xD;
      degenerative scoliosis present more pain than with idiopathic scoliosis.3 Severe&#xD;
      radiculopathy (47%), claudication (9%), weakness (8%), myelopathy, and bowel/bladder&#xD;
      dysfunction(1%) are also more common in adults with scoliosis.11 Sagittal imbalance in AS is&#xD;
      strongly correlated with disability and low quality of life.12 Curve progression is common in&#xD;
      AS at 2-6o/yr.13 It is thus relevant to offer treatments to prevent curve progression and the&#xD;
      signs and symptoms above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 What treatment is available? There is an important lack of evidence about non-operative&#xD;
      treatments for AS despite the recommendation of non-operative treatments are the first line&#xD;
      for treating AS.8,14,15 This suggestion arise mostly because of the high complications rates&#xD;
      with surgery and poor bone quality8. However, exercise has generally not been offered in&#xD;
      studies comparing non-operative to operative care.8,14,15 The main goal of rehabilitation in&#xD;
      AS is to decrease pain, improve function and slow disease progression to avoid surgery.16,17&#xD;
      Our review on exercises for AS18 found only one study with high risk of bias showing that 20&#xD;
      weeks of scoliosis specific exercises compared to general physiotherapy led to significantly&#xD;
      more improved pain (by 3.2/10 pts), SRS-22 quality of life (by 0.7/5 for function, 0.9 pain,&#xD;
      0.5 self-image, 0.7 mental health and 1.0 for satisfaction with care), and Oswestry&#xD;
      disability (by 12%). Only adults with idiopathic scoliosis were included in this study19 and&#xD;
      exercises have not yet been tested in adults with degenerative scoliosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Rationale for Schroth treatment: Our award winning work with adolescent idiopathic&#xD;
      scoliosis suggests that pain, self-image and back muscle endurance improvements, as well as,&#xD;
      reduced curve progression result from short exercise programs.20-22 Schroth is a 3D&#xD;
      autocorrection exercise aiming to correct posture.23 Schroth exercises are not yet routinely&#xD;
      used for adults in Edmonton, but surgeons and patients have expressed interest for evidence&#xD;
      on exercise. Patients routinely seek treatment options for smaller curvatures and inquire&#xD;
      about less invasive treatments than surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Schroth treatment: Posture corrections are achieved with the use of pressure, mirror and&#xD;
      therapist verbal and tactile feedback.24,25 Schroth exercises aim to improve the ability to&#xD;
      maintain correct posture through endurance and strength training.22 Schroth exercises include&#xD;
      de-rotation, side shifting, and stretching to establish vertebral alignment, torsion&#xD;
      respiratory exercises, and strengthening for postural muscles.26&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Specific Aims: To conduct a pilot study for an RCT on the effect of Schroth exercises in&#xD;
      adults with degenerative scoliosis compared to observation. Specific goals of the pilot are&#xD;
      to: 2.1) Determine the recruitment and eligibility rate of patients for the RCT; 2.2)&#xD;
      Demonstrate the feasibility of the assessment and treatment protocol by showing a high&#xD;
      percent compliance with program attendance and home exercises and low study dropout rate; and&#xD;
      2.3) Estimate the effect size and variability for all outcomes to determine the sample size&#xD;
      for the proposed RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Methods and Materials&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Subjects: Adults over 50 years old with degenerative scoliosis (n=20) with pain (&gt;2/10)&#xD;
      will be recruited from referrals to Dr. Eric Huang and James Mahood and using community ads.&#xD;
      Other inclusion criteria are: (1) curves 15°-45°. Curves over 50° are surgical candidates,&#xD;
      and will be excluded. Patients who have had cortisone or anesthetic injections within the&#xD;
      last 3 months, surgery or presenting contra-indications to exercises (fractures, cancer,&#xD;
      severe cardio-vascular co-morbidities, or osteopenia) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Procedures: Patients will be invited to participate at the Drs' clinics. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to the observation (control) group or the Schroth exercise treatment group&#xD;
      using REDCAP. All outcomes will be measured at baseline and at a 3-month follow-up. Longer&#xD;
      term effects will be assessed 3 months after the exercise program. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      pain at 3 months controlling for medication use.27 Secondary outcomes include: spine curve&#xD;
      angles, vertebral rotation, SRS-22 questionnaire (self-image, mental health, function, and&#xD;
      pain and total scores), posture (Surface Topography), Global Rating of Change (GRC), Oswestry&#xD;
      Disability index, and muscle endurance (Sorensen test). At baseline, a physical exam will&#xD;
      ensure participants can exercise safely. The control group will be under observation for 3&#xD;
      months. The Schroth group will participate in weekly supervised sessions and a daily home&#xD;
      program for 3 months. After 3 months, controls will undergo the same exercise protocol. This&#xD;
      will allow examining exercise effects using these patients as their own controls and improve&#xD;
      willingness for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3.1 Schroth exercises treatment: During the first 2 weeks, participants will attend 5 1-hr&#xD;
      long individual sessions to learn Schroth exercises and the home program, and to confirm&#xD;
      independent adequate performance with a checklist.28 A 30-min. daily home program of 3 to 4&#xD;
      exercises will be prescribed and progressed by the certified Schroth therapist throughout the&#xD;
      project using an algorithm26. Compliance will be monitored weekly using a logbook. Patients&#xD;
      will attend weekly 1-hr long group therapist-led exercise classes for 3 months. Classes&#xD;
      increase compliance and sense of social support.29,30 At each group class, adequate exercise&#xD;
      performance will be assessed using the checklist.28 An algorithm guides the prescription of&#xD;
      exercises intensity and progression from static to dynamic depending on the participant's&#xD;
      ability.28 Prescription begins with Sitting on a Ball. If performed adequately, a more&#xD;
      challenging exercise is attempted. If performance is not adequate, an easier exercise is&#xD;
      attempted. The 3 most challenging exercises performed adequately as per the checklist will be&#xD;
      prescribed with a detailed handout.28&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3.2 Control intervention: Observation without treatment or with previously prescribed pain&#xD;
      medication is the current standard for adults with degenerative scoliosis not planning&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Co-interventions, contamination monitoring: Pain medication use will be monitored by a&#xD;
      single score using the validated Medication Quantification Scale.27 Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to refrain from using co-interventions. Co-intervention use will be monitored as well&#xD;
      as any contamination where controls may attempt Schroth treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Assessment: Evaluators will be blinded to group allocation and patients reminded not to&#xD;
      divulge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.1 Self-Report Questionnaires: Demographic/History- Socio-demographics, medical history,&#xD;
      symptoms and modifying factors will be self-reported at baseline only to describe&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numeric Pain Rating and diagram- (Primary outcome). A scale from 0 to 10 (worst imaginable&#xD;
      pain) will assess current, best, worst pain intensity in the last 24 hours, with documented&#xD;
      reliability and validity.31 A body pain diagram will categorize the location of symptoms with&#xD;
      high reliability.32&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Scoliosis Research Society (SRS-22r) is a quality of life questionnaire with 22 questions&#xD;
      assessing 5 domains: function, pain, self-image, mental health (5 questions each), and&#xD;
      satisfaction (2 questions).33 Scores correspond to the average of the items. The SRS-22 has&#xD;
      adequate test-retest reliability, and validity with good correlations with SF-36, SF-12, and&#xD;
      Oswestry scores.34&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Oswestry disability questionnaire assesses back related disability (/100 important&#xD;
      disability) using 10 questions. The Oswestry is recommended in the core set in spinal&#xD;
      research and presents adequate reliability, validity and responsiveness.35,36&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global Rating of Change- A 15-point global rating scale,35,37 will only be used at each&#xD;
      follow-up. The scale ranges from -7 (very great deal worse) to +7 (very great deal better).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.2 Physical Exam: A physiotherapist blind to group assignment, will determine curve type28&#xD;
      and assess the range of motion for lower extremities, leg length (supine) and asymmetry in&#xD;
      the forward bend test (with scoliometer).38,39 Lumbar and thoracic spinal range-of-motion&#xD;
      will be recorded using double inclinometers: flexion, extension and side flexions. The&#xD;
      Sorensen's test will assess back extensor endurance as the time the torso is maintained&#xD;
      horizontal against gravity.40&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.3 3D ultrasound imaging- Standing 3D Ultrasound scans of the spine will be obtained&#xD;
      without radiation exposure in a positioning frame. An experienced evaluator will extract&#xD;
      curve angle, and apical vertebra rotations from de-identified images with high reliability&#xD;
      and interchangeability with radiographs measurements has been shown.41-44&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.4 Full-torso surface topography (ST) - Four Minolta 910 Laser Scanners and a positioning&#xD;
      frame will be used to record full-torso ST scans. The operator will acquire scans blind to&#xD;
      treatment groupings. The operator will position the subjects, mark reference points, and&#xD;
      scan. ST parameters will be extracted in Matlab by digitizing 15 reference points on&#xD;
      de-identified scans. The parameters quantifying the external trunk deformity are: cosmetic&#xD;
      score composed of a weighted average of the shoulder angle, scapula angle and waist&#xD;
      asymmetry, the trunk twist, and kyphotic and lumbar indices and angles from the sagittal&#xD;
      view.45,46 We found parameters have adequate discriminative validity and sensitivity to&#xD;
      change.47 Asymmetry maps will also be monitored.48-50&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6. Analyses: Objective 1: Recruitment rates will be calculated as the percent of patients&#xD;
      enrolled out of all patients invited. Eligibility rate corresponds to the percentage of&#xD;
      patients meeting the selection criteria out of all patients assessed at clinics. Objective 2:&#xD;
      Compliance will be calculated as the percentage of visits attended and percent prescribed&#xD;
      home exercises reported performed. Drop-out rate will be calculated as the percentage of&#xD;
      enrolled patients not completing the study. Objective 3: Cohen's D effect sizes and sample&#xD;
      size needed will be estimated for all outcomes51,52 targeting a power of 0.80 with alpha of&#xD;
      0.05 using the observed change and variability from intention-to-treat analyses. Where&#xD;
      available MCID will inform sample size estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Significance: Adult degenerative scoliosis is a chronic and often painful condition, with&#xD;
      a profound effect on patients.3,53 The Schroth exercise method is less invasive than current&#xD;
      treatments (injections, surgery). Our review suggest that exercises can be effective to limit&#xD;
      pain, disability and other deficits.18 RCTs on Schroth exercises for AS are needed.&#xD;
      Clinicians and patients from the scoliosis clinic demand research in this area.&#xD;

An algorithm guides the prescription of exercises intensity and progression from static to dynamic depending on the participant's ability. Prescription begins with Sitting on a Ball. If performed adequately, a more challenging exercise is attempted. The 3 most challenging exercises performed adequately as per the checklist will be prescribed with a detailed handout.</description>
