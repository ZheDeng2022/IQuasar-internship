  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Envarsus XR is an extended release tacrolimus designed to deliver tacrolimus more&#xD;
      consistently, thus avoiding large fluctuations of tacrolimus trough levels with Envarsus XR&#xD;
      compared to immediate release tacrolimus. It is expected that patients with DGF on Envarsus&#xD;
      XR will have more stable tacrolimus levels and facilitate early recover from DGF compared to&#xD;
      immediate release tacrolimus.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center randomized phase IV trial of comparing extended release Envarsus XR&#xD;
      (study drug) once a day vs immediate release tacrolimus twice a day in a new kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients with delayed graft function (DGF). The primary study endpoint is the&#xD;
      interval between first dialysis and last dialysis after kidney transplant (duration of DGF).&#xD;
      The second end point is the number of tacrolimus or Envarsus XR dose adjustments required&#xD;
      during the period of DGF.&#xD;

    <description>Envarsus XR is FDA approved for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney transplant recipients converted from tacrolimus immediate-release formulations, in combination with other immunosuppressants. Envarsus XR, is designed to deliver tacrolimus more smoothly over the whole day.&#xD;
Envarsus XR, a calcineurin-inhibitor immunosuppressant, is available for oral administration as extended-release tablets containing the equivalent of 0.75 mg, 1 mg, or 4 mg of anhydrous tacrolimus USP. Inactive ingredients include hypromellose USP, lactose monohydrate NF, polyethylene glycol NF, poloxamer NF, magnesium stearate NF, tartaric acid NF, butylated hydroxytoluene NF, and dimethicone NF. Tacrolimus is the active ingredient in ENVARSUS XR.</description>
