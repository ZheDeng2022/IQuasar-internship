  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to an increase in PTSD patients seeking treatment in the Danish mental health sector and&#xD;
      the addition of Complex PTSD to the ICD-11, there is a need to increase the effectiveness of&#xD;
      existing treatments for PTSD. mHealth interventions have been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      reducing PTSD symptoms with small to moderate effect sizes. Therefore, the implementation of&#xD;
      a mHealth intervention designed for psychiatric PTSD patients as a supplement to therapy may&#xD;
      increase treatment outcome. As no studies to date has explored the effects of mHealth&#xD;
      interventions in the Danish mental health sector the feasibility and effect of this type of&#xD;
      intervention needs testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's primary hypothesis is that PTSD patients in a Danish psychiatric outpatient&#xD;
      setting will want to use a mHealth application as a supplement to care as usual (CAU). The&#xD;
      secondary hypothesis is that PTSD patients will benefit from using a mHealth application as a&#xD;
      supplement to CAU The study is an investigator-initiated randomized controlled feasibility&#xD;
      trial investigating PTSD help combined with CAU compared to CAU for adults with PTSD. Eighty&#xD;
      patients will be recruited and receive either the mHealth intervention combined with CAU or&#xD;
      CAU alone. Primary outcome is the ratio of eligible patients that agree to participate in the&#xD;
      study and the level of user compliance. Secondary outcome data consists of exploratory data&#xD;
      on PTSD help on PTSD symptom severity, level of psychological distress, sleep quality,&#xD;
      dissociation symptoms, therapy readiness, quality of life, disability levels, recovery and&#xD;
      rumination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may help increase the investigator's knowledge of possible benefits of, as well as&#xD;
      potential barriers to, the implementation of mHealth tools. It may also provide a&#xD;
      cost-efficient means to increase therapy outcomes and decrease the duration of suffering for&#xD;
      PTSD patients in the Danish psychiatric sector.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary objective for the present randomized controlled feasibility study is to assess&#xD;
      the feasibility of using PTSD help in the MHS-CRD to inform a larger future RCT study. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to gather preliminary exploratory data on the effectiveness of PTSD&#xD;
      help versus treatment as usual on a range of clinically relevant outcome variables, including&#xD;
      exploring C-PTSD as potential moderator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an investigator-initiated randomized controlled feasibility trial investigating&#xD;
      PTSD help combined with CAU compared to CAU for adults with PTSD. The primary outcome is the&#xD;
      ratio of eligible patients that agree to participate in the study and do so until the end of&#xD;
      the six-week intervention period and user compliance, that is, do the patients actively use&#xD;
      the system after randomization, Secondary outcome data consists of exploratory data on PTSD&#xD;
      help on PTSD symptom severity, level of psychological distress, sleep quality, dissociation&#xD;
      symptoms, therapy readiness, quality of life, disability levels, recovery and rumination.&#xD;
      These data will be collected on PTSD help, both as standalone intervention in the six weeks&#xD;
      before treatment and as a supplement to treatment during the patients' psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      treatment for PTSD. The primary outcome will be assessed continuously by logging the&#xD;
      patient's interactions with the application. Secondary outcomes will be assessed prior to&#xD;
      randomization and start of PTSD help intervention (week 1), at post PTSD help intervention&#xD;
      (week 7) and at the end of psychotherapeutic treatment (week 27-29). The design of this trial&#xD;
      has been developed using the SPIRIT 2013 guidelines (Chan et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit patients referred with PTSD symptoms to the Center for Visitation and&#xD;
      Diagnostics (CVD) under the MHS-CRD, with the following inclusion criteria: the patient 1)&#xD;
      must be at least 18 years old, 2) fulfil the DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis criteria, 3) be referred to&#xD;
      PTSD care package treatment (Danske regioner, pakkeforl√∏b for PTSD, 2017), 4) have access to&#xD;
      a smartphone with iOS (version 10 or higher) or Android (version 5.0.1. or higher) and 5)&#xD;
      provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria are patients with 1) suicidal risk, 2) ongoing&#xD;
      episode of bipolar disease or psychotic disorder 3) current abuse of alcohol or drugs, 4)&#xD;
      inability to understand and/or read Danish and 5) concurrent psychiatric or psychological&#xD;
      treatment of PTSD outside of MHS-CRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is conducted through the data management software REDCap, which allows a setup&#xD;
      where no one from the research team have knowledge of or access to the underlying&#xD;
      computer-generated allocation sequence. The randomization uses permuted blocks with varying&#xD;
      block sizes based on a computer-generated allocation sequence created by a researcher with no&#xD;
      affiliation to the project. The randomization allocation ratio is 1:1. This procedure ensures&#xD;
      that researchers are blind to the allocation process. The randomization procedure will be&#xD;
      stratified by presence of Complex PTSD as measured with the International Trauma&#xD;
      Questionnaire (Cloitre, Garvert, Brewin, Bryant, &amp; Maercker, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessors will be blinded to the patients' group allocation during the baseline assesment,&#xD;
      all assessment post-randomization will consist solely of self-report measures administered&#xD;
      via email through REDCap and logging of user activity in the app. In addition, researchers&#xD;
      will be blinded during the parts of the data analysis concerning the exploratory outcome&#xD;
      data, but not the feasibility outcomes as the group allocation is clear from the nature of&#xD;
      the data. Participants will be blinded during baseline assesment and unblinded after group&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred to CVD for diagnostic screening that are diagnosed with PTSD and referred&#xD;
      to PTSD treatment in MHS-CRD will be invited to participate in the study by the clinician&#xD;
      conducting the screening. The invitation will include a pamphlet with information about the&#xD;
      study and contact information for the project. If the patient gives their consent for&#xD;
      participation, he or she will be booked for an assesment interview. Patients who provide&#xD;
      written consent and complete the assessment interview will be randomized if the participants&#xD;
      fulfill inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients in the experimental group will after&#xD;
      randomization be given immediate access to PTSD help. After three days participants will&#xD;
      receive a phone call to ascertain whether they are experiencing any technical difficulties&#xD;
      using the app. The second and third assessments will be administered electronically via a&#xD;
      link to the questionnaires sent in an email through REDCap. (see figure 1 for a consort&#xD;
      diagram)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTSD help - experimental group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PTSD help app is designed for use in preparation for and as a supplement to&#xD;
      psychotherapy. Its functions include: Psychoeducation about PTSD, information about PTSD&#xD;
      treatment in Denmark, instructions in techniques for relieving anxiety (such as grounding&#xD;
      exercises, breathing exercises, physical exercises and calming images), help towards better&#xD;
      sleep (such as guided meditations and advice for improving sleep habits and sleep&#xD;
      environment), options for taking personal notes on symptoms and helpful strategies that can&#xD;
      reduce distress, tools for self-assessment and monitoring of PTSD symptoms ; (Weathers et&#xD;
      al., 2013) and sleep quality (Sleep Condition Indicator; (Espie et al., 2014) and a crisis&#xD;
      plan with personal contacts and contact information for psychiatric emergency services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTSD treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in the project received PTSD treatment at one of six outpatient clinics in the&#xD;
      MHS-CRD that provides PTSD treatment. All clinics complies with official Danish&#xD;
      recommendations for PTSD Care Packet-treatment (CP-treatment)&#xD;
      (https://www.sundhed.dk/content/cms/91/43091_pakke-belastning-tilpasningsreaktion.pdf and&#xD;
      https://www.regioner.dk/media/5557/pakkeforloeb-for-ptsd-voksne.pdf). PTSD CP-treatment,&#xD;
      consists of 60 hours trauma-focused group psychotherapy or 15 hours trauma-focused individual&#xD;
      therapy combined with other treatment elements such as assessment, psychoeducation,&#xD;
      pharmacological counselling/treatment, social skill training, meeting with social network and&#xD;
      monitoring. The CP includes 75 hours of treatment totally (Table 1)&#xD;

&#xD;
      Assessment and outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's trauma history is assessed with The Trauma History Questionaire (Green, 1996),&#xD;
      a 24-item self-report measure of the patient's lifetime trauma history. PTSD diagnosis and&#xD;
      comorbid disorders are assessed through the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview&#xD;
      (MINI v. 7.02) (Sheenan et al., 1998), a structured diagnostic interview that assesses the&#xD;
      presence of psychiatric disorders according to DSM-V. To ascertain whether the patient also&#xD;
      fulfills the criteria for ICD-11 PTSD or C-PTSD, the International Trauma Questionaire is&#xD;
      administered (ITQ) (Cloitre, Roberts, Bisson, &amp; Brewin, 2017). ITQ is a 23-item self-report&#xD;
      questionnaire used to distinguish between PTSD and C-PTSD as defined in ICD-11. The&#xD;
      Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Brief Form (PID-5-BF) (Krueger, Derringer, Markon, Watson, &amp;&#xD;
      Skodol, 2013) and The Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS-BF) (Espie et al., 2014;&#xD;
      Hutsebaut, Feenstra, &amp; Kamphuis, 2016) are administered to assess personality disorders. The&#xD;
      PID-5-BF, a 25-item version, is scored on five subscales assessing the five traits that make&#xD;
      up the maladaptive personality trait model for DSM-5, negative affect, detachment,&#xD;
      antagonism, disinhibition and psychoticism. The LPFS-BF is a 12-item self-report&#xD;
      questionnaire that assesses the patient's level of self- and interpersonal functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary feasibility outcome is the proportion of eligible patients that participate in&#xD;
      the study until the end. The secondary feasibility outcome is the fraction of compliant&#xD;
      patients in the experimental group. Compliance is defined as the use of PTSD help functions&#xD;
      (excluding self-monitoring tools) corresponding to use twice a week, assessed over 6 weeks&#xD;
      pre-treatment and 29 weeks during the treatment period. Compliance data is collected from the&#xD;
      tracking log of the patient's app activity through a secured webpage. In addition, compliance&#xD;
      will be assessed through a user behaviour questionnaire, developed based on questionnaires&#xD;
      used in earlier studies evaluating the PTSD Coach app modified for the Danish research&#xD;
      context (Kuhn et al., 2014; Miner et al., 2016) (see appendix 2). The feasibility&#xD;
      requirements for a future RCT will be satisfied if 50% of eligible patients agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study and if 50% of patients in the intervention group are compliant with&#xD;
      the use of PTSD help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to a shortage of similar studies, it is not currently possible to conduct a calculation&#xD;
      of optimal sample size for this study. However, as a sample size calculation is not a&#xD;
      requirement for feasibility studies, and is in some cases even discouraged (Billingham,&#xD;
      Whitehead, &amp; Julious, 2013), Based on existing knowledge about feasibility study methodology&#xD;
      (Billingham et al., 2013; Teare et al., 2014; Whitehead, Julious, Cooper, &amp; Campbell, 2016)&#xD;
      and a feasibility study of another mHealth tool in MHS-CRD (Fenger et al., 2016), the plan is&#xD;
      to recruit 70 patients. With 70 patients, among which 50% are rated compliant in the primary&#xD;
      outcome, the 95% confidence interval for proportion estimate would range between 38% and 62%,&#xD;
      which is considered acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome, acceptance of the randomization procedure and patient compliance is&#xD;
      analyzed through descriptive statistics, e.g., the average usage of the system per week, as&#xD;
      well as the proportion of patients that stay in study until the end. Analysis of&#xD;
      between-group effects on explorative outcome measures will be analyzed with analysis of&#xD;
      covariance, using the intervention arm as the main predictor, and baseline performance and&#xD;
      the stratification variable from randomization as covariates. For binary outcomes (e.g.,&#xD;
      compliance), logistic will be used. Due to the exploratory nature of this feasibility study,&#xD;
      missing data will not be imputed. Results will be presented as covariate adjusted group&#xD;
      differences or odds ratios, along with the 95% confidence interval. If the results indicate&#xD;
      feasibility, the investigators will proceed to a randomized controlled efficacy study.&#xD;
