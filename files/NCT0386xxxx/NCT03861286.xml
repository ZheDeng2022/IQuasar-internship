  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to understand the changes occurring in a blood clotting protein, von Willebrand&#xD;
      factor (VWF), in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who receive the blood thinner called&#xD;
      Heparin. These patients are given Heparin through their veins, to prevent blood clot&#xD;
      formation as it passes through the heart bypass machine. At the end of the operation, the&#xD;
      effect of Heparin is reversed by another drug, Protamine Sulphate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heparin prevents blood clots forming mainly by inactivating thrombin, a crucial protein&#xD;
      needed for blood clotting. This effect of Heparin is monitored through blood tests called the&#xD;
      'Anti Factor-Xa' and the 'APTT'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heparin has another effect on clotting: it can block the attachment of special blood cell&#xD;
      fragments called platelets to damaged blood vessels, but this effect is not usually measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following blood vessel injury, the large VWF sticks to the damaged surface and captures&#xD;
      platelets to form a 'plug' which stops bleeding. The platelet plug is then stabilised by&#xD;
      other clotting proteins. This stops blood loss and allows vessel repair underneath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heparin blocks the ability of VWF to capture platelets at the site of blood vessel injury.&#xD;
      The higher the dose of Heparin, the greater this blocking effect is. This secondary effect of&#xD;
      Heparin cannot be readily monitored and may explain why bleeding complications occur in&#xD;
      patients receiving Heparin despite the monitoring with blood tests used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look at the blood levels of Heparin, VWF and platelets before, during and&#xD;
      after surgery and how well VWF functions in the presence of heparin, including its ability to&#xD;
      attach to platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will determine if all of the heparin related changes in blood clotting can&#xD;
      be detected using a method that looks at all of the different steps in forming a blood clot.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a large plasma glycoprotein involved in thrombosis,&#xD;
      haemostasis and vascular biology. Its principal role is to capture platelets at sites of&#xD;
      blood vessel endothelial injury allowing the formation of an unstable platelet plug, an&#xD;
      initial step in haemorrhage control. Following this, blood coagulation at the site of injury,&#xD;
      results in the formation of fibrin strands, which enmesh and stabilise the platelet plug,&#xD;
      until vessel repair is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following endothelial cell (EC) injury or activation, VWF becomes tethered, either to EC or&#xD;
      to the now exposed subendothelial matrix (SEM). The shear stress generated by blood flow&#xD;
      causes the tethered VWF to unravel, exposing its multiple platelet binding sites, resulting&#xD;
      in platelet capture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most important domains of VWF is the A1 domain, which contains binding sites for&#xD;
      the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) as well as for collagen and heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heparin is the major component of mast cell secretory granules. Its precise physiological&#xD;
      role is unknown but it has been proposed that it plays a role in host defense mechanisms. The&#xD;
      anticoagulant properties of heparin, however, have been exploited pharmaceutically and&#xD;
      exogenous heparin has been a clinically useful anticoagulant since 1935.4 It is known to&#xD;
      potentiate the effects of antithrombin in the inactivation of Factor Xa and thrombin.&#xD;
      Unfractionated heparin therapy can be monitored using the plasma activated partial&#xD;
      thromboplastin time (APTT), anti -factor Xa activity or, if very high doses are used, the&#xD;
      activated clotting time (ACT). The APTT is most commonly used to monitor UFH therapy as it is&#xD;
      cost effective and readily available. However, it is subject to several pre-analytical and&#xD;
      analytical variables and therefore may not provide an accurate measure of the anticoagulant&#xD;
      effect of UFH. The anti-factor Xa activity is less susceptible to confounding factors and&#xD;
      makes this the assay of choice but it is less widely available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that heparin also competitively inhibits the binding of VWF to platelet&#xD;
      receptor GPIb, an anti-thrombotic effect distinct from its anticoagulant role via&#xD;
      Antithrombin. This may in part explain why the bleeding complications that occur during&#xD;
      heparin therapy are unpredictable, despite using current techniques for monitoring its&#xD;
      anticoagulant effect. This additional activity of heparin is likely to be of particular&#xD;
      importance during CPB when very high concentrations of heparin are used to maintain the&#xD;
      extracorporeal circuit and which have to be reversed to restore haemostasis at the end of the&#xD;
      procedure. The currently available literature remains incomplete in the characterisation of&#xD;
      the changes that occur in VWF-dependent platelet function and do not explain the observed&#xD;
      recovery of VWF function above baseline levels, after reversal of heparin with protamine&#xD;
      sulphate. The aim of this study is to fully characterise the changes in VWF concentration,&#xD;
      function and platelet interaction, that occur in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and&#xD;
      receiving intravenous unfractionated heparin, intra- and post-operatively. This is a&#xD;
      prospective, single centre cohort study involving the analysis of haemostatic assays in&#xD;
      patients receiving IV heparin during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. The study aims to&#xD;
      recruit 30 eligible adult patients (&gt;18 years) undergoing first time cardiac surgery for the&#xD;
      correction of atrial septal defects or undergoing tissue mitral valve replacement and&#xD;
      receiving IV unfractionated heparin intra-operatively at Royal Brompton Hospital. The study&#xD;
      aims to recruit a uniform population of 30 patients which should be achieved within 6 months.&#xD;
