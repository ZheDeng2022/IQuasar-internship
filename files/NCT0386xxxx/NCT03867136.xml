      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a combination&#xD;
      of levofloxacin, linezolid, cycloserine and pyrazinamide (or clofazimine if resistant to&#xD;
      pyrazinamide) treatments for 24 to 32 weeks (regimen consisted of clofazimine for 36~44&#xD;
      weeks) in subjects with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) compared to WHO&#xD;
      standardized shorter regimen of 36-44 weeks.&#xD;

      The TB-TRUST is a phaseIII, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to assess the feasibility of the ultra-short treatment regimen of all-oral&#xD;
      anti-TB drugs among selected MDR-TB patients who are susceptible to fluoroquinolones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 354 participants with MDR-TB will be recruited and followed up until 84 weeks&#xD;
      after randomization. During randomization, eligible patients will be assigned to in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to one of the following groups: The WHO standardized shorter regimen group and a PZA&#xD;
      sensitivity guided ultra-short regimen group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO standardized shorter regimen group consists of 36-44 weeks with two phases of treatment.&#xD;
      The first is an intensive phase of 16 weeks (extended up a maximum of 20 or 24 weeks in case&#xD;
      of lack of smear conversion at the end of 16 or 20 weeks), and included moxifloxacin,&#xD;
      amikacin, prothionamide, pyrazinamide, high-dose isoniazid, ethambutol, and clofazimine. This&#xD;
      is followed by a continuation phase of 20 weeks with the following agents: moxifloxacin,&#xD;
      pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and clofazimine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PZA sensitivity guided ultra-short regimen consists of two periods of 24-36 weeks. During&#xD;
      the first 4-8 weeks (waiting for pyrazinamide drug sensitivity test), the regimen consists of&#xD;
      levofloxacin, linezolid, cycloserine, pyrazinamide, and clofazimine. Then based on molecular&#xD;
      PZA drug sensitivity results, patients will be in divided into two sub-groups:&#xD;
      pyrazinamide-susceptible (PZA-S) patients and pyrazinamide-resistant (PZA-R) patients. The&#xD;
      Regimen for PZA-S patients, consisting of levofloxacin, linezolid, cycloserine, and&#xD;
      pyrazinamide, are given until the 24th week (prolonged to 28 or 32 weeks if no smear&#xD;
      conversion by end of 16th and 20th week). PZA-R sub-group regimen, consisting of&#xD;
      levofloxacin, linezolid, cycloserine, and clofazimine given until 36th week (prolonged to 40&#xD;
      or 44 weeks if no smear conversion by end of 16th and 20th week)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare the treatment success rate without relapse between the&#xD;
      WHO standardized shorter regimen group and the PZA sensitivity guided ultra-short regimen&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to compare the median time to sputum culture conversion. Safety&#xD;
      evaluations performed are the routine lab tests, blood glucose, hearing, vital signs,&#xD;
      electrocardiograph (ECG), reporting of adverse events, peripheral neuropathy brief examining&#xD;
      with the use of a Brief Peripheral Neuropathy rating scale(BPNS) and ophthalmologic&#xD;
      examination, including assessment of visual acuity and color vision，physical examinations and&#xD;
      chest CT. Adverse events will be monitored and promptly managed during the whole treatment&#xD;
      course.&#xD;
