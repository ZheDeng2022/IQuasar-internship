    <textblock>
      The majority of obese have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD). Currently, no&#xD;
      pharmacological agents are licenced for the prevention or treatment of NAFLD, and weight&#xD;
      loss, notoriously difficult to obtain (and specially to maintain), remains the only treatment&#xD;
      option. Interestingly, curcumin, a phenolic compound extracted from the turmeric root, has&#xD;
      from in vitro and animal studies shown promising effects in preventing and treating NAFLD,&#xD;
      and the sparse available human data point in the same direction; but solid human data are&#xD;
      missing. This study will delineate the effects of curcumin when treating NAFLD in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effect of 6 weeks of curcumin on liver&#xD;
      fat content (assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)) in obese subject with NAFLD.&#xD;
      Additionally, a range of secondary endpoints have been chosen in order to delineate the role&#xD;
      of NAFLD in the newly discovered liver-alpha cell axis governing circulating levels of the&#xD;
      glucose-mobilising pancreatic alpha cell hormone glucagon and, thus, to elucidate the link&#xD;
      between liver fat content and the risk of developing reduced glucose tolerance and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D). Also, the anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin will be elucidated, as&#xD;
      inflammatory markers will be measured before and after intervention. Furthermore, the effect&#xD;
      of curcumin will be measured by measuring the following parameters before and after&#xD;
      intervention: Transient elastography, anthropometric measurements, body weight, appetite,&#xD;
      food-consumption, calory balance, resting energy expenditure, gut microbiota, bioimpedance&#xD;
      measures, visceral- and subcutaneous fat, glucose tolerance, lipids, blood pressure, pulse,&#xD;
      liver parameters (blood-tests) and adipokines. During the oral glucose tolerance test before&#xD;
      and after intervention, incretin hormones, glucagon, amino acids, insulin, c-peptide and urea&#xD;
      will be measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide. Obesity and its associated complications&#xD;
      represent an enormous burden for obese individuals, their families, healthcare systems and&#xD;
      societies. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as a frequent and serious&#xD;
      complication of obesity. Steatosis, the benign and potentially reversible form of NAFLD, may&#xD;
      progress to a more severe form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can result in&#xD;
      fibrosis and ultimately liver cirrhosis, and rarely hepatocellular carcinoma. The majority of&#xD;
      obese have NAFLD. Currently, no pharmacological agents are licenced for the prevention or&#xD;
      treatment of NAFLD, and weight loss, notoriously difficult to obtain (and specially to&#xD;
      maintain), remains the only treatment option. Interestingly, curcumin, a phenolic compound&#xD;
      extracted from the turmeric root, has from in vitro and animal studies shown promising&#xD;
      effects in preventing and treating NAFLD, and the sparse available human data point in the&#xD;
      same direction; but solid human data are missing. This study seeks to investigate the effects&#xD;
      of curcumin on treating NAFLD in humans by looking at the effects of ingestion of curcumin&#xD;
      for 6 weeks in obese subject with NAFLD on lipid, glucose and protein metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, eligible participants will&#xD;
      undergo baseline assessments before being randomised to receive two capsules of placebo twice&#xD;
      daily or two capsules of curcumin (corresponding to 200 mg) twice daily for 6 weeks. In the&#xD;
      end of the 6-week intervention periods, end-of-trial assessments (similar to baseline&#xD;
      assessments) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information meeting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to any protocol-related procedures, an information meeting at Center for Clinical&#xD;
      Metabolic Research, Gentofte Hospital, will be arranged, and subjects will be informed of the&#xD;
      possibility of bringing a person of own choice to the visit. During this meeting, a member of&#xD;
      the research group will explain the purpose, procedures and possible risks of the study in&#xD;
      undisturbed and confidential surroundings. The subject will be informed that if extra time to&#xD;
      evaluate participation is needed, a minimum of 24 hours from oral information is given until&#xD;
      the consent and sign the informed consent form should be given is acceptable. After obtaining&#xD;
      the informed consent, time of screening is planned. The subject will be informed that it is&#xD;
      possible to withdraw the written consent at any time prior to or during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a person agrees to participate in the study following the information meeting, and oral&#xD;
      and written informed consent has been obtained, a screening visit will be planned. The&#xD;
      subject will be instructed in a 10 hour overnight fast before screening (including medicine,&#xD;
      but water may be consumed until 2 hours before screening). After this fast the subject will&#xD;
      meet in the department in the morning. Height and body weight will be measured, medication&#xD;
      and medical history will be recorded, blood will be sampled for assessment of plasma/serum&#xD;
      concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone, creatinine, electrolytes, aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase (ASAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase, albumin, bilirubin, gamma-glutamyltransferase, viral hepatitis markers, platelet&#xD;
      count, ferritin and haemoglobin, and albumin-creatinine ratio in the urine will be measured.&#xD;
      A Fibro Scan will be performed. A physical examination will be made including evaluation of&#xD;
      blood pressure and pulse rate. Alcohol habits will be evaluated based on The Alcohol Use&#xD;
      Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) questionnaire76,77 and quantification of the weekly&#xD;
      amount of alcohol. A magnetic resonance (MR) safety checklist will be completed and a MR&#xD;
      information sheet will be given. If all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria&#xD;
      are met, dates for baseline assessments and randomisation visit will be planned within 6&#xD;
      weeks from the screening visit. The subject will be instructed in not to consume&#xD;
      curcumin-containing food on a daily basis from screening until end of trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments and randomisation visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included subjects will undergo an MRS, which will be scheduled as close as possible to the&#xD;
      start of intervention. The subject will meet at the Department of Radiology at Herlev&#xD;
      Hospital and be placed in a horizontal position during the scan. During the MRS, a&#xD;
      spectroscopy of the liver will be assessed, and an estimation of visceral adipose tissue and&#xD;
      subcutaneous adipose tissue will be done. The subject will be placed in a horizontal position&#xD;
      during the scan (duration: approximately 30 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food and physical activity diary and standardised food intake period: Before start of&#xD;
      intervention and during the week before end-of-trial visit, each subject will fill out a&#xD;
      three days food and physical activity dairy. The food and physical activity diary will be&#xD;
      registered manually by participants, using a questionnaire. The two last days before test&#xD;
      days, the participants are requested to have a standardized food intake high in&#xD;
      carbohydrates, to get the most valid oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) response, and the&#xD;
      subject will be thoroughly instructed in this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last week before randomisation, the subject is kindly asked to collect a stool&#xD;
      sample for the determination of gut bacteria count and subtype. The participant will receive&#xD;
      sample kits consisting of cooler bag, freezer packs and stool sample tubes. Stool samples&#xD;
      will be collected by the participant at home: Prior to defecation a disposable collector will&#xD;
      be placed in the toilet from where stool will be transferred to a tube that immediately is&#xD;
      transferred to a transport container and placed at -20°C in the patient's freezer. Prior to&#xD;
      transport to Gentofte Hospital, the transport container is transferred to the cooler bag and&#xD;
      at arrival at Gentofte Hospital the transport container (with the sample tube) is immediately&#xD;
      stored in at -80°C for later analysis. This entails DNA extraction, library preparation,&#xD;
      MiSeq 16S rRNA sequencing and microbiota analysis (relative abundance, alpha/beta diversity,&#xD;
      link to phenotype of interest).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the randomisation visit, the subject will meet in the laboratory around 8 a.m. after 10&#xD;
      hours of fast (including medication) and refrainment from tobacco or nicotine supplements&#xD;
      use. The subject is allowed to drink water until 8 hours before meeting in department.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the subject will be requested to avoid heavy alcohol intake and strenuous&#xD;
      exercise two days prior to the visit and instructed to use non-strenuous methods of&#xD;
      transportation to the research facility. The following procedures will be conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A fasting urine sample will be collected, and the participant is kindly asked to empty&#xD;
           the bladder completely. Urine volume will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurement of bioimpedance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fasting blood samples will be collected (genetic markers for NASH, biomarkers of NASH&#xD;
           and fibrosis, fibroblast growths factors, triglycerides, cholesterols, liver parameters,&#xD;
           haemoglobin A1c, inflammatory markers, adipokines, haemoglobin, creatinine) amounting 22&#xD;
           ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. FibroScan: The subject will be lying in a supine position for approximately 10 minutes&#xD;
           during which a probe using shear-waves and ultrasound is applied in the right side of&#xD;
           the body below the ribs&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Measurement of blood pressure, pulse rate, body weight and hip and waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. One cannula will be inserted in the cubital vein for collection of blood samples; the&#xD;
           forearm from which blood samples are drawn will be wrapped in a heating blanket (42°C)&#xD;
           throughout the experiment (for arterialisation of venous blood)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Blood samples will be collected according to Table 1 below (total amino acids, gut&#xD;
           hormones, glucose, glucagon, insulin, c-peptide, urea, free fatty acids)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. At time 0 min, the subject will ingest 75 g of water-free glucose dissolved in 300 ml&#xD;
           water over a period of 5 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. At time 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240 min, hunger, satiety, fullness and&#xD;
           prospective food consumption will be measured by visual analogue scales (VASs). (see&#xD;
           enclosure 5 &quot;VAS&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. During the last hour (~180min - ~240 min), resting energy expenditure (REE) will be&#xD;
           measured in a supine position by indirect calorimetry to determine oxygen consumption&#xD;
           (V02) and carbon dioxide production (VC02). A flow-through canopy gas analyser will be&#xD;
           used.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. At time ~240 min the subject will be asked to provide a new urine sample for measurement&#xD;
           of urea concentration. The participant is kindly asked to empty the bladder completely.&#xD;
           Urine volume will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. At time 250 min, the subject will ingest a standardised ad libitum meal consisting of&#xD;
           minced meat, pasta, corn, carrots, peppers, cream, salt and pepper (50 energy (E) %&#xD;
           carbohydrate, 37 E% fat, 13 E% protein); the subject will be instructed to eat as much&#xD;
           as possible until feeling comfortable satiated; the meal should be consumed within a&#xD;
           maximum of 30 minutes and by the end of the meal, time spent eating, weight of the meal&#xD;
           and the total amount of energy consumed will be noted. Additionally, the participants&#xD;
           rated the appearance, smell, taste, off-taste, and overall impression of the ad libitum&#xD;
           meal on VAS scores during the ad libitum meal. 10 minutes after termination of the meal&#xD;
           consumption, the last questionnaire regarding hunger, satiety, fullness and prospective&#xD;
           food consumption will be measured by visual analogue scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventional period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will start soon after randomization visit and first MRS. During the entire&#xD;
      intervention period, each subject will fill out a dairy to keep track of any new concomitant&#xD;
      medication, compliance and possible adverse events. Each subject will take either two&#xD;
      capsules of Meriva® or two placebo capsules each morning and each evening for 42 days (±3&#xD;
      days) with a small glass of water, preferably in relation to a meal. Should the subject&#xD;
      forget/miss to take a dose, it can be ingested until 6 hours before the next planned dose. If&#xD;
      the subject forgets/misses a dose, and the next planned dose is within the next 6 hours, the&#xD;
      dose should be passed, and the subject must note the incident in the diary. The subject is&#xD;
      kindly asked to keep the alcohol and smoking habits they might have had before screening and,&#xD;
      thus, not to consume more than 21 units of alcohol per week. Furthermore, it is not allowed&#xD;
      to consume more than 5 units in one night or to consume curcumin-containing food on a daily&#xD;
      basis until end of trial. Mid-way through the intervention period, the subject will receive a&#xD;
      phone call from the investigator or other delegated site staff, checking on adverse events,&#xD;
      concomitant medication and compliance, and to answer any questions from the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last week of intervention, participants are once more requested to fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires regarding food intake and physical activity. Starting two days prior to&#xD;
      end-of-trial visit, the subject must once more follow two days of standardized food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-trial assessments and visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end-of-trial visit will be scheduled 42±3 days after start of intervention. Within one&#xD;
      week prior to the end-of-trial visit, stool sample collection will be scheduled and performed&#xD;
      as described above under &quot;Baseline assessments and randomisation visit&quot; and MRS in assessed&#xD;
      as close to end-of-trial visit as possible. Procedures during the end-of-trial visit are&#xD;
      similar to the ones described above under &quot;Baseline assessments and randomisation visit&quot;.&#xD;
      Also, during this day, to check for any effect of curcumin intervention, physical examination&#xD;
      will be performed by a physician from the research team and additional blood samples&#xD;
      (identical with the samples at the screening visit, except viral hepatitis markers) will be&#xD;
      collected (which adds another 5 ml blood samples compared to randomisation visit) and&#xD;
      albumin-creatinine ratio in the urine will be measured.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>At the end of the randomization visit, the patients will randomly be assigned to one of two interventions: 6 weeks of Meriva® (two capsules of 500 mg (corresponding to 200 mg curcumin) twice daily) or identically looking placebo (two capsules twice daily). There will be a stratification with respect to HbA1c, ensuring that if we include people with HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol, they will be equally distributed in the two treatment arms.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The supplier of Meriva® and placebo capsules (Indena® Aps, Milan, Italy) sends the tablets to the research department. After packaging of tablets in bags with tablets for 42 days (+7 extra tablets) and labelling of bags with a &quot;bag number&quot;, a person not otherwise involved in the study will generate a list with a randomization number and a &quot;bag number&quot; using a random list generator. When an investigator enrols a participant in the study, the participant is assigned with a randomization number (in consecutive order), and the corresponding &quot;bag number&quot; will be handed to the participant. An emergency code will be kept at Gentofte Hospital. If a subject develops adverse events (AEs) that demand knowledge of the content of the intervention, the code may be broken.</masking_description>
