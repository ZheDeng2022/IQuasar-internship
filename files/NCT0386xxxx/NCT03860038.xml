    <textblock>
      This trial is a multi-center, single-arm phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      TJ202 combined with dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (RRMM) who received at least 2 prior lines of treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 82 subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received&#xD;
      at least 2 prior lines of treatment will be enrolled in this study. Prior lines of treatment&#xD;
      must include a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulator (IMiD). All subjects will&#xD;
      receive TJ202 and dexamethasone (DEX) in the study. The treatment will continue until&#xD;
      endpoint events such as intolerance or progressive disease (PD).&#xD;
