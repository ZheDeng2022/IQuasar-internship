      Importance and justification The importance of carrying out this study is to verify the&#xD;
      electrical activity generated by the masticatory muscles to be able to have clarity of their&#xD;
      performance in the development of orthopedic treatment, thus complementing the diagnosis to&#xD;
      achieve a more successful treatment with myofunctional device SN1 in Class II malocclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, with the results of this study, treatment prediction criteria are provided to&#xD;
      the clinician, depending on the thickness of the muscle, more specific equipment will be&#xD;
      chosen to solve the malocclusion and prognosis when using the SN1 myofunctional device in&#xD;
      class II malocclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, it has academic utility, since there is little scientific evidence about&#xD;
      myofunctional SN1 device and its impact on masticatory muscles, thus opening the door to a&#xD;
      line of research where this study can be used as a basis for future orthopedic clinical&#xD;
      research. in UNICIEO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Added to this and according to the results, the knowledge about the SN1 will be updated, thus&#xD;
      providing evidence for the teaching of orthopedics for the students; and also a measurement&#xD;
      protocol with electromyography for children will be provided Overall objective To evaluate&#xD;
      the electrical activity of the masseter and temporal muscles in patients from 7 to 12 years&#xD;
      of age, with skeletal class II who are under treatment with myofunctional apparatus (Sn1), in&#xD;
      the UNICIEO orthopedics clinic by means of kinesiological electromyography compare with a&#xD;
      control group without use of the device Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the activity of the masseter and temporal muscles of patients at rest (without&#xD;
           functional orthopedic apparatus) in the two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the activity of the masseter and temporal muscles of the patients after the&#xD;
           use of functional orthopedic equipment (Sn1), after six months of treatment and in the&#xD;
           control group without treatment.&#xD;

      Study design Prospective nonrandomized controlled clinical trial, 1: 1 allocation&#xD;
      Participants Study group. Boys and girls between 7 and 12 years skeletal class II, for the&#xD;
      study group the individuals will be selected from the UNICIEO postgraduate clinic of&#xD;
      orthopedic clinic orthodontics after conducting a full clinical case study exposed to a board&#xD;
      of specialist teachers in orthodontics, where by means of several diagnostic methods a&#xD;
      skeletal class II is confirmed that involves a treatment with myofunctional apparatus SN1;&#xD;
      patients presenting syndromes that generate craniofacial alterations, patients with previous&#xD;
      orthopedic treatment, patients with signs of condyle lesions, patients with Pierre Robin&#xD;
      syndrome or any form of slit will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group. Children aged between 7 and 12 years diagnosed with class II dental&#xD;
      classification, who attend the Leonardo Da Vinci School after carrying out an intraoral and&#xD;
      extraoral photography study and diagnostic impressions with study models accepting&#xD;
      participation in the study, children over the age of 12 will have to sign an agreement,&#xD;
      patients who present syndromes that generate craniofacial alterations, patients with previous&#xD;
      orthopedic treatment, patients with Pierre Robin syndrome or any form of slit will be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions or independent variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of Sn1 equipment in the study group: the study participants are placed, which&#xD;
           correspond to the study group, the Sn1 apparatus of which is composed of dorsal arches&#xD;
           with an hourly intensity of 12 hours a day, where a control will be carried out monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six months of observation in the control group: patients in the control group will be&#xD;
           given informed consent, children over the age of 12 will have to sign an informed&#xD;
           consent, then a photographic study of intraoral and extraoral photos will be made,&#xD;
           impressions to obtain models and have an observation of the molar classification, and&#xD;
           verify if it has the inclusion criteria of the study, once that participation is&#xD;
           confirmed, the muscular activity of the masticatory muscles will be observed, in two&#xD;
           times, at the beginning and at six months after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results or dependent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masseter and temporal muscle activity measured with EMG (microvolts) in the following&#xD;
      moments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moment of measurement: the electrical activity will be taken at 2 moments of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T0: Initial Moment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rest: A record of electromyography will be taken where the patient has a natural&#xD;
           position of the head and is in complete rest, resting time (60 seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Maximum intercuspidation: The patient will be instructed to perform a force that will be&#xD;
           measured with a dynamometer where it generates a dental tightening, to verify the&#xD;
           electrical activity that is generated in that maximum contraction of masseter muscles&#xD;
           captured by the electromyograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use of the device: a record of the muscular activity will be made at the moment the&#xD;
           patient puts on the Sn1 device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1: six months of use of functional equipment (Sn1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rest: A record of electromyography will be taken where the patient has a natural&#xD;
           position of the head and is in complete rest, resting time (60 seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Maximum intercuspidation: The patient will be instructed to perform a force that will be&#xD;
           measured with a dynamometer where it generates a dental tightening, to verify the&#xD;
           electrical activity that is generated in that maximum contraction of masseter muscles&#xD;
           captured by the electromyograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use of equipment (study group) will be a record of muscle activity at the time the&#xD;
           patient puts on the Sn1 device&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size To date, no similar studies have been located, therefore a pilot test will be&#xD;
      carried out with 10 patients from each group and with the result the sample size of the study&#xD;
      will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods The data will initially be tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Maximum&#xD;
      changes in molar bite force during treatment or observation (T0 - T1) will be evaluated, and&#xD;
      t-paired tests will be used to evaluate the statistical significance within each group. A&#xD;
      comparison of the changes between the treatment and control groups will also be carried out&#xD;
      using t-unpaired tests. Parametric analyzes will be used: Anova, Multivariate analysis of&#xD;
      variance (Manova), T2 Hotelling test. All correlations were considered significant with p&#xD;
      &lt;0.05.&#xD;
