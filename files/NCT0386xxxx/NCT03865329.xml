  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will look at investigating barriers, facilitators, adherence and&#xD;
      effectiveness of an interactive home-based pulmonary rehabilitation program and health&#xD;
      coaching for patients who have recently been hospitalized for a COPD related cause.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite proven benefits, the proportion of people with COPD who receive Pulmonary&#xD;
      Rehabilitation (PR) is very small. The current model of a center-based PR program fails to&#xD;
      address the needs of many patients with COPD. The most common patient barrier to attendance&#xD;
      is travel to center-based programs, particularly for frail patients with more severe COPD who&#xD;
      need transportation assistance. Home-based, unsupervised PR has been proposed as an&#xD;
      alternative model to hospital-based programs and has been found to be safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study researchers will investigate barriers, facilitators and adherence to a&#xD;
      home-based pulmonary rehabilitation program after hospitalization. The results of this pilot&#xD;
      study will inform the second part of this study as a randomized control study under a&#xD;
      different grant (Study 2/R33). Both quantitative and qualitative methods will be used for the&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 patients will be enrolled in this pilot study and allocated to a home-based PR in order to&#xD;
      polish the intervention before the randomized portion of the study. This pilot is supported&#xD;
      by a grant mechanism (R61) explicitly oriented to adjust the intervention and identify&#xD;
      barriers for the next randomized portion of this study (Study 2) supported by a separate&#xD;
      grant mechanism (R33).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) Physical Symptoms Summary</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CRQ is a 20-question inventory assessing the areas of health related quality of life in dyspnea (shortness of breath), fatigue, emotion, and feelings of mastery of chronic respiratory disease. The Physical Summary score includes dyspnea (symptom #1 in COPD) and fatigue (symptom #2 in COPD) domains. The questions in each domain are added together and then divided by the number of questions. The possible range is 1-7, where 1 is the worst and 7 the best.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) Emotional Symptoms Summary</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CRQ Emotion Summary score includes the emotion (independent factor for admissions and poor quality of life) and mastery (self-management) domains of the CRQ. The scores for each domain are calculated by simply added together the answers and then dividing by the number of questions, the range is 1-7 where 1 is the worst and 7 the best.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Self-Management Ability Scale (SMAS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the total score from the self-reported SMAS 30 item questionnaire that measures ability and function. A higher score indicates more ability and function in everyday life. The SMAS30 has six areas, each with 5 questions. The minimum score is one and the max is 5. The mean is calculated for each section. A higher score indicates better self management.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the self-reported PHQ-2 consisting of a 2 item questionnaire inquiring about the frequency of depressed mood over the past 2 weeks on a scale of 0 to 3, 0=Not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, 3=nearly everyday. The minimum score is zero and the highest score is 6. A score greater than 3 may indicate depression.</description>
