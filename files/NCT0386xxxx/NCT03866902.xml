  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a randomized two-group, repeated measures experimental design, the goal of the proposed&#xD;
      study is to investigate the efficacy of a 12-week nutrition and exercise education, physical&#xD;
      activity, coping skills training, and home-based physical activity intervention in Hispanic&#xD;
      women and their 3-5 year old children and 6 months of continued monthly contact to help&#xD;
      overweight and obese Hispanic mothers improve adiposity, weight, health behaviors, and&#xD;
      self-efficacy and their 3-5 year old children improve their adiposity and weight gain&#xD;
      trajectory and health behaviors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hispanic women and children who become overweight or obese are at risk for developing&#xD;
      prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease later in life. To date, there have&#xD;
      been no interdisciplinary interventions that have targeted Hispanic women and their 3-5 year&#xD;
      old children to improve nutrition and physical activity behaviors to manage adiposity and&#xD;
      weight in mothers and prevent excessive adiposity and weight gain trajectory in their&#xD;
      children. Using a randomized two-group, repeated measures experimental design, the goal of&#xD;
      the proposed study is to investigate the efficacy of a 12-week nutrition and exercise&#xD;
      education, physical activity, coping skills training, and home-based physical activity&#xD;
      intervention in Hispanic women and their 3-5 year old children and 6 months of continued&#xD;
      monthly contact to help overweight and obese Hispanic mothers improve adiposity, weight,&#xD;
      health behaviors (nutrition and physical activity), and self-efficacy and their 3-5 year old&#xD;
      children improve their adiposity and weight gain trajectory and health behaviors (nutrition&#xD;
      and physical activity). The investigators will partner with two federally qualified health&#xD;
      departments in Durham and Chatham, North Carolina to enroll Hispanic women and their 3-5 year&#xD;
      old children and the investigators will partner with community centers to deliver the&#xD;
      intervention. A total of 294 Hispanic women with a BMI &gt;25 kg/m² and 294 Hispanic 3-5 year&#xD;
      old children with a BMI percentile &gt; 25 will be enrolled over 4 years and randomized to the&#xD;
      experimental or equal attention control group. Data will be collected at Time 1 (0 months&#xD;
      [baseline]) to Time 2 (9 months [completion of the intervention]) and Time 1 to Time 3 (15&#xD;
      months [after 6 months with no contact from the study staff]). Data collected will include&#xD;
      adiposity (primary outcomes: waist circumference, triceps and subscapular skinfolds) in&#xD;
      mothers and children and weight (primary outcomes: body mass index [BMI] in mothers and BMI&#xD;
      percentile in the children). Secondary outcomes will include health behaviors and&#xD;
      self-efficacy in the mothers (Adult Health Behavior Questionnaire, Lifestyle Health Promoting&#xD;
      Profile II, 3 day 24-Hour Food Recall, and 7 day Accelerometer, Eating Self-Efficacy Scale&#xD;
      and Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale) and in the children (7 day Accelerometer and 3 day 24-Hour&#xD;
      Food Recall). The investigators will also evaluate the cost of delivering the program for&#xD;
      public health departments. Data analysis will use general linear mixed models to test the&#xD;
      hypotheses. Decreasing overweight and obesity in Hispanic women and slowing adiposity and&#xD;
      weight gain trajectory in young Hispanic children is urgently needed to decrease morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality, and future health care costs. The knowledge to be gained from this study may&#xD;
      provide a foundation for extending this intervention to other Hispanic mothers and children&#xD;
      in other communities to assist mothers in managing their weight and preventing excessive&#xD;
      adiposity and weight gain in their children. This approach is translatable, real-world, and&#xD;
      could be replicated in other areas of the United States.&#xD;
