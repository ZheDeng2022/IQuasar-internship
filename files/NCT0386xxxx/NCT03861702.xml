    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-arm, open-label, clinical study to investigate the efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of a combination of liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) with oxaliplatin, leucovorin,&#xD;
      and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFOX-nal-IRI) for treatment of patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC). Each subject will be screened for eligibility by evaluation&#xD;
      including medical history, physical examination, performance status, blood tests, computed&#xD;
      tomographic (CT) scans, and electrocardiogram. Within 28 days of screening, the consented&#xD;
      subjects will have a central venous access device placed and then start treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every 2-week cycle of FOLFOX-nal-IRI, each subject will receive nal-IRI (irinotecan free&#xD;
      base 50 mg/m2 intravenously over 90 minutes), oxaliplatin (60 mg/m2 intravenously over 2&#xD;
      hours), leucovorin (400 mg/m2 intravenously over 2 hours), and 5-fluorouracil 2,400 mg/m2&#xD;
      intravenously over 46 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response will be evaluated every 4 cycles of treatment with CT scans using RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      criteria. If the tumor becomes surgically resectable and the subject is a surgical candidate&#xD;
      as determined by a multidisciplinary team, the subject will undergo surgery (at which point&#xD;
      he/she would enter survival follow-up). If the tumor remains unresectable and there is no&#xD;
      tumor progression, each subject will be treated up to a total of 12 cycles of FOLFOX-nal-IRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following treatment with 12 cycles of FOLFOX-nal-IRI, if tumor remains unresectable, the&#xD;
      subjects may receive further treatment (chemotherapy using the same regimen or of the&#xD;
      treating physician's choice, or chemoradiation therapy) or observation as determined by the&#xD;
      physician. During the course of treatment, if the subjects develop unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      and/or disease progression, the treatment will be discontinued, and the subjects will be&#xD;
      further managed at the discretion of the treating oncologists.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to registration, or&#xD;
             within a time interval less than at least 5 half-lives of the investigational agent,&#xD;
