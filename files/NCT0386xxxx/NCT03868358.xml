    <textblock>
      To investigate the treatment effect of intermittent theta-burst transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation on symptomatic relief of schizophrenia patients, and the underlying neural&#xD;
      mechanism by functional MRI and the resting electroencephalogram&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients underwent a medical evaluation that included physical examination and routine&#xD;
      laboratory studies before and after intermittent theta-burst transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (iTBS) treatment. Patients were randomly allocated to iTBS group and the sham&#xD;
      group by coin toss. There are about 30 patients in each group.The decision to enroll a&#xD;
      patient was always made prior to randomization. Patients were studied using a double-blind&#xD;
      design. Study participants, clinical raters, and all personnel responsible for the clinical&#xD;
      care of the patient remained masked to allocated condition and allocation parameters. Only&#xD;
      iTBS administrators had access to the randomization list; they had minimal contact with the&#xD;
      patients, and no role in assessing the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Each&#xD;
      patient would be treated for continuous 14 days by iTBS.Before the iTBS treatment, PANSS and&#xD;
      Clinical Global Impression-severity of illness (CGI-SI) at baseline were obtained by a&#xD;
      trained investigator to assess baseline severity of their symptoms. Scale for the Assessment&#xD;
      of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) were&#xD;
      respectively supplemented to evaluate the severity of symptoms in different dimensions,.The&#xD;
      patients had receiving a battery measure of neuropsychological tests (standardized tests to&#xD;
      investigate their cognitive problems, anxiety and depressive symptoms in daily life),&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging scan in multimodalities, electroencephalography (EEG),&#xD;
      event-related potentials during stop signal test and Iowa-gambling test record. Other&#xD;
      behavioral tests including intertemporal decision,spatial n-back test record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last treatment, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were obtained, as well as&#xD;
      the Global Index of Safety to assess adverse events of the treatment. Patients were&#xD;
      instructed to focus their answers on the past 14 days. The patients had also receiving a&#xD;
      battery measure of neuropsychological tests, magnetic resonance imaging scan in&#xD;
      multimodalities, and EEG record.Clinical Global Impression-global improvement (CGI-GI),&#xD;
      Clinical Global Impression-efficacy index (CGI-EI) were evaluated at the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40-60 days after the last treatment, participants were interviewed to obtain the Positive and&#xD;
      Negative Syndrome Scale,SAPS,SANS and HAMA,HAMD. They were instructed to focus their answers&#xD;
      on the past week. Additionally, they were also asked to assess the battery of&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests, and have magnetic resonance imaging scan in multimodalities, and&#xD;
      EEG record. Afterwards, they were unblinded by the study coordinator.&#xD;
