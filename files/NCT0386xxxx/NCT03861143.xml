      This is a phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group multicenter&#xD;
      study with an optional open-label extension (OLE) period. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral BT-11 compared to placebo in subjects with mild to&#xD;
      moderate UC. This study includes 3 periods: induction, maintenance, and an optional OLE&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

      Following a 28-day screening period, a total of 195 subjects with mild to moderate UC (total&#xD;
      Mayo Score 4-10; Mayo endoscopic subscore [MES] ≥ 2) are planned to be enrolled into this&#xD;
      study from approximately 46 sites in Europe and the United States. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive BT-11 low-dose (500 mg), BT-11 high-dose (1,000 mg) or&#xD;
      placebo. Each of the treatment arms will comprise 65 subjects. The randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified by prior exposure to biologic therapy for UC (yes/no; exposed population limited&#xD;
      to 30% of total sample) and corticosteroid use at baseline (yes/no).&#xD;
