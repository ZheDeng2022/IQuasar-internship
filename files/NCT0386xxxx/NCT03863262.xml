      This was an observational study aimed to screen patients with cardiovascular disease for&#xD;
      depression in Trinidad and Tobago in a tertiary center and to determine if there is a&#xD;
      significant association between patients with symptoms of depression and other comorbidities.&#xD;
      Patients (N=1203) were randomly selected from the outpatient cardiology clinics at the Eric&#xD;
      Williams Medical Sciences Complex. After fulfilling the inclusion criteria and informed&#xD;
      consent were obtained, they were given the case report form which included the Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire 9.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design was a cross-sectional descriptive study performed from November 2018 to&#xD;
      February 2019. It was performed at the Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex, Champ Fleurs,&#xD;
      Trinidad. The primary objectives of the study were to screen patients for depression in those&#xD;
      with cardiovascular disease in Trinidad and Tobago and to determine the association between&#xD;
      patients with depression and other comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were targeted for participation in the study while waiting to see the attached&#xD;
      physician to the cardiology clinic. Participants were attained at the Eric Williams Medical&#xD;
      Sciences Complex during the days Monday to Friday where there were ongoing cardiology&#xD;
      outpatient clinics. Once informed consent was obtained from these patients, a questionnaire&#xD;
      was administered to these patients in which the primary investigator and/or co-investigator&#xD;
      was/were present on site. The number of participants in this study was 1203 patients. There&#xD;
      were no dropped subjects from the study nor were there any incomplete questionnaires by any&#xD;
      participants. The sample size for this study was calculated to be 1159 patients. Based on a&#xD;
      study done by Huffman, it was estimated that 40% of patients with cardiovascular disease also&#xD;
      have depression(2). The Type I error rate 5% (α = 0.05) making the Type II error rate 95% (β&#xD;
      = 0.95) with a statistical power of 90%. Assuming a 10% patient decline and attrition rate&#xD;
      and a minimum detectable difference of 10%, the estimated sample size was calculated to be&#xD;
      1159 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection was performed by the researchers of the study along with eight specifically&#xD;
      trained and oriented medical students. All data collectors in the study were supervised by&#xD;
      primary investigator and co-investigator of the study so that in the event of any adverse&#xD;
      events such as acute psychosis or any acute cardiology emergencies, patients could have been&#xD;
      referred directly to the accident and emergency department at Eric Williams Medical Sciences&#xD;
      Complex where routine medical care could have been executed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, there was an attached consent form which was also approved by the ethical&#xD;
      committee of the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine. This consent form clearly&#xD;
      explained to the participants why the research was being conducted, the average duration of&#xD;
      completing the questionnaire, the benefits and any potential risks associated with&#xD;
      participation in the study along with the assurance that confidentiality will be maintained&#xD;
      throughout the entire study and that the patient can stop or not complete the questionnaire&#xD;
      at any point without any facing repercussions. This information was documented on the consent&#xD;
      form and also explained by the researchers of the study to each potential participant. All&#xD;
      additional questions from patients were answered truthfully regardless of if it would have&#xD;
      affected the patient's decision to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were asked to participate in the study as long as they were registered patients at&#xD;
      Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex in any of the cardiology outpatient clinics. This was&#xD;
      confirmed by matching patients with their registration numbers on the cardiology outpatient&#xD;
      clinic appointment listings. These lists are made prior to each cardiology clinic that is&#xD;
      scheduled every week on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. The inclusion&#xD;
      criteria for participation in the study included patients who were 18 years old and over&#xD;
      along with registered patients of the cardiology outpatient clinics at Eric Williams Sciences&#xD;
      Complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note, no rewards or incentives were offered to encourage participation in the study by&#xD;
      subjects nor were there any penalization for declining participation in the study.&#xD;
      Specifically, patients were not offered any monetary payments to encourage their&#xD;
      participation in the study. Patients were allowed to decide on their own, whether or not they&#xD;
      wanted to participate in the study. Subjects were able to participate based on the fulfilling&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and informed consent attained. Of significance, there was no sponsorship&#xD;
      obtained to conduct this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality of patients was kept and ensured as no patient names were recorded and all&#xD;
      data recorded was de-identified. Patients were uniquely identified using their clinic&#xD;
      registration numbers of the cardiology outpatient clinic. By using registration numbers to&#xD;
      identify patients, this assisted in preventing duplicate collection and entry of data.&#xD;
      Additionally, the database was only accessible to the primary investigator and the&#xD;
      co-investigator of the study. The data was stored on a device which was password protected&#xD;
      and again this password was only available to the primary investigator and co-investigator of&#xD;
      the study. The database was encrypted to ensure the patient's recorded information was safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of importance, no invasive data was collected from participants in this study. No blood&#xD;
      samples were drawn and no drugs being tested were administered to any patients enrolled in&#xD;
      the study. Additionally, any patients deemed as medical emergencies had the opportunity to be&#xD;
      referred to the accident and emergency department of Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex&#xD;
      where the routine medical protocol was followed and appropriate referrals were made. Some&#xD;
      examples of these emergencies included acute psychosis, acute coronary syndromes, and acute&#xD;
      heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scores of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were verbally communicated to the patients&#xD;
      in confidentiality by the primary investigator and or co-investigator of the study along with&#xD;
      the interpretation of the score and what it meant on the depression scale. Patients were&#xD;
      given the opportunity to decide if they wanted these results communicated to the physician&#xD;
      seeing them in the cardiology outpatient clinic and if so; the results were given to their&#xD;
      respective physicians who would have decided on appropriate referrals and routine medical&#xD;
      care. This would include appropriate referrals to psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Social Sciences 24 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois USA) was the software used for the entry of&#xD;
      data and its analysis. Descriptive analyses were performed which were unadjusted. Statistical&#xD;
      significance was accepted as p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
