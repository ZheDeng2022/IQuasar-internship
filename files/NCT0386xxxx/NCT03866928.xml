             history and complete physical examination).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m² inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Normal blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) at the screening visit after 5 min in&#xD;
             supine position:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  90 mmHg ≤ Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) ≤ 145 mmHg,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  45 mmHg ≤ Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) ≤ 90 mmHg,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  40 bpm ≤ HR ≤ 90 bpm,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Or considered not clinically significant (NCS) by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Normal electrocardiogram (ECG) recording on a 10 min resting 12-lead ECG at the&#xD;
             screening visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  120 ≤ interval between P and R waves (PR) &lt; 210 ms,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Interval between Q and S waves (QRS) &lt; 120 ms,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fridericia corrected interval between Q and T waves (QTcF) ≤ 450 ms,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No sign of any trouble of sinusal automatism,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Or considered NCS by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Laboratory parameters within the normal range of the laboratory (hematological, blood&#xD;
             chemistry tests, urinalysis). Individual values out of the normal range can be&#xD;
             accepted if judged clinically non relevant by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Normal dietary habits.&#xD;
