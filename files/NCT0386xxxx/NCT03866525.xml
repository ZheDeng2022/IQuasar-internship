  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II study evaluates the safety and efficacy of OH2 as single agent or in&#xD;
      combination with HX008, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in patients with malignant solid tumors&#xD;
      (gastrointestinal cancers, head and neck cancers, soft tissue sarcomas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OH2 is an oncolytic virus developed upon genetic modifications of the herpes simplex virus&#xD;
      type 2 strain HG52, allowing the virus to selectively replicate in tumors. Meanwhile, the&#xD;
      delivery of the gene encoding human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)&#xD;
      may induce a more potent antitumor immune response.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of OH2 injection in patients&#xD;
      with malignant solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase I dose escalation part, three doses (1x10e6, 1x10e7, 1x10e8 CCID50/mL) of OH2&#xD;
      will be delivered intratumorally as single agent and in combination with HX008 to observe the&#xD;
      DLTs and to identify the MTD. After the completion of phase I, the recommended dose for&#xD;
      single agent and combination therapy will be determined for dose expansion in phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase II part comprises of 4 cohorts. In cohort 1, patients will be treated at the&#xD;
      recommended dose as defined in phase 1. In cohort 2, OH2 will be delivered in combination&#xD;
      with irinotecan for the treatment of advanced gastrointestinal cancers. In cohort 3, OH2 will&#xD;
      be injected in combination with HX008, and the first doses of the two anti-tumor agents will&#xD;
      be administered on the same day. The treatments in cohort 4 will be identical as in cohort 3,&#xD;
      except that the first dose of HX008 will be administered at the time of the third dose of&#xD;
      OH2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biodistribution of OH2 is evaluated in the phase 1 part of the trial by detection of&#xD;
      viral loads in the blood, urine, and saliva at different timepoints. In addition, the&#xD;
      injection sites are swabbed for virus shedding on the next day of each dose from cycle 1-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) and DLTs are graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 5.0). Radiographic imaging studies&#xD;
      are performed using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Measurement of&#xD;
      cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions are conducted with calipers. Evaluation of response are&#xD;
      performed by the investigators using both the RECIST version 1.1 and the iRECIST criteria.&#xD;

    <description>A 3+3 dose-escalation strategy is used in the phase 1 part and 3 dose levels (10e6, 10e7 and 10e8 CCID50/mL) of OH2 are assessed as single agent and in combination with HX008. The recommended dose levels are then determined and adopted in the phase 2 part for dose-expansion.&#xD;
In the phase 2 dose-expansion part, OH2 will be delivered as single agent in cohort 1, in combination with irinotecan in cohort 2, in combination with HX008 in cohort 3 and 4. There are no comparator arms for these cohorts.</description>
