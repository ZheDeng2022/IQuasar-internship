      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-transplant anemia (PTA) might be associated cardiovascular morbidity and even increased&#xD;
      mortality. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aimed to assess the impact of full correction of chronic PTA on cardiovascular system and&#xD;
      quality of life in renal transplant recipients with stable graft function using&#xD;
      erythropoietin stimulating agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and methods: We enrolled 247 kidney recipients with stable graft function to be&#xD;
      assessed for anemia. Eligible patients were randomized to achieve target hemoglobin between&#xD;
      11 to 12 g/dl (group 1, n=183), or 13 to 15 g/dl (in group 2, n=64) using ESA. Monthly&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory evaluation of kidney graft function was carried out. Moreover,&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL) and echocardiography were assessed at the start and at 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred and eighty anemic renal transplant recipients with stable graft function- who are&#xD;
      followed up in Hamed Al-Essa organ transplant centre - will be assessed for the possible&#xD;
      causes of their anemia. Anemia will be defined as Revised European Best Practice guidelines&#xD;
      for anemia in renal tx, a Hb level of &lt;11 g/dl should trigger treatment with ESA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patients' assessment for possible causes of anemia, each patient will be managed&#xD;
      according to the specific cause of anemia i.e. iron, folic, and vitamin b12 deficiencies will&#xD;
      be corrected. If anemia will be improved, we will consider such group of patients as&#xD;
      corrected group, but if we failed to find specific cause of anemia we will consider them for&#xD;
      ESA. Iron supplementation is permitted in order to maintain serum ferritin in the range&#xD;
      100-800 ng/ml or transferring saturation (TSAT) in the range 20-50%. Medications known to&#xD;
      affect Hb concentration-e.g. angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) &amp; angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor blockers (ARBS) - will be maintained at a stable dose if already prescribed at the&#xD;
      start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who fulfilled the following criteria will be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult renal transplant patients (≥18 years). Informed consent. Stable maintenance&#xD;
      subcutaneous darbepoetin alfa therapy with constant dose interval during the last 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemoglobin (Hb) ≥10mg/dL (Hct 32%). Transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≥20% (during the screening&#xD;
      phase) Serum ferritin ≥100 ng/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will exclude patients with the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute or chronic bleeding, or erythrocyte transfusion, within the preceding 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in Hb level ≥ 2 g/dL during screening phase. Hemolytic anemia. Recent infection or&#xD;
      rejection Diastolic blood pressure &gt;100mmHg or discontinuation of ESA due to hypertension in&#xD;
      the 6 months prior to study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency. Uncontrolled or secondary hyperparathyroidism. Acute or&#xD;
      chronic systemic inflammatory disease and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) &gt;30 mg/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodialysis due to the failure of a kidney transplant. Malignancy. Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either target hemoglobin between 11 to 12 gram/dl (group 1), or target&#xD;
      hemoglobin between 13 to 15 gram/dl (group 2). The target HB will be achieved using either&#xD;
      darbepoetin α once weekly or once every 2 weeks or equivalent dosage of monthly CERA and the&#xD;
      dosage will be adjusted during the titration and evaluation phase according to table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maintenance dosage of each agent will be modified according to the response (hemoglobin&#xD;
      changes). In case of any emergencies, the patient will be managed in Hamed Al-Issa organ&#xD;
      transplant Centre 24 hours per day. Mobile of the 1st on-call doctor is ( ); Tel of OTC, ward&#xD;
      1(24826490 &amp;24840300 ext. 4100)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be classified according to the maintenance dose of ESA, then they will be&#xD;
      sub-grouped into males and females. All patients in each subgroup will be arranged&#xD;
      alphabetical using Excel program, and a number will be given to each patient. Patients with&#xD;
      odd numbers will serve as group1 while those with even numbers will serve as group 2.&#xD;
      Patients' files will be marked with sticker according to the corresponding group to&#xD;
      facilitate collection of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically by history taking and thorough medical examination every month in the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By Laboratory investigations which will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBC*, HB electrophoresis, Iron-Ferritin- Transferrin saturation, PT(INR) B12, folic acid&#xD;
      levels PTH, CR protein, ESR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum cr., Cr cl, LFT, ca/ph, FBS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinary protein (gm / 24h )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug levels Virology profile (CMV, EBV, Parvovirus ) The radiological investigation&#xD;
           using abdominal US, echocardiography and carotid Doppler ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life will be assessed in each patient using 25 and 36 questionnaires at the start&#xD;
      of enrollment and by the end of 12 months of achieving the target hemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NB.1- * indicates that these test will be every month, while other tests will be only at the&#xD;
      initial assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-Blood samples will be sent to the corresponding laboratory without storage and results will&#xD;
      be collected according to the laboratory schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-As the drugs utilized in such study is available for all patients (Kuwaiti and&#xD;
      non-Kuwaiti), we will proceed smoothly. However, some of the laboratory tests will need&#xD;
      patients own financial support (especially the non-Kuwaiti).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive parameters (mean, standard deviation, median, range, and the number of&#xD;
      observations) will be presented for continuous observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequencies (absolute and percentage) are to be shown for qualitative variables (e.g., sex,&#xD;
      ethnicity, Hb values within target ranges and occurrence of adverse events).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety population will compromise all patients who received at least one dose of study&#xD;
      medication. All patients in the safety population who provided at least one Hb value during&#xD;
      C.E.R.A. therapy will be included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population&#xD;
