  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current efforts to arrest the epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have had limited&#xD;
      success. Thus there is an urgent need for effective approaches to prevent the development of&#xD;
      T2DM. It is widely accepted that the current epidemic is driven by an increase in global food&#xD;
      abundance and reduced food quality, making changes in diet a key determinant of the T2DM&#xD;
      epidemic. Dietary factors can affect cardio-metabolic health; among these factors, advanced&#xD;
      glycation end-products (AGEs) in food are potential risk factors for insulin resistance and&#xD;
      T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AGEs are a heterogeneous group of unavoidable stable bioactive compounds. Endogenous&#xD;
      formation of AGEs is a continuous naturally occurring process, and is the result of normal&#xD;
      metabolism. However, increased formation of AGEs occurs during ageing and under&#xD;
      hyperglycaemic conditions. AGEs are implicated in the development of diabetes and vascular&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past several decades, methods of food processing have changed and meals now contain&#xD;
      excess fat and sugar and are most susceptible for the formation of AGEs. In addition, AGEs in&#xD;
      food are highly desirable due to their profound effect on shelf life, sterility, flavour,&#xD;
      colour, and thus food consumption. Hence, a substantial portion of AGEs are derived from&#xD;
      exogenous sources, particularly food. These exogenous AGEs are potential risk factors for&#xD;
      insulin resistance and the development of T2DM. The investigators recently found that dietary&#xD;
      AGEs represent a significant source of circulating AGEs, and have similar pathogenic&#xD;
      properties compared to their endogenous counterparts including the development of insulin&#xD;
      resistance and T2DM. Taken together, dietary AGEs are proposed to play a pivotal role in the&#xD;
      development and progression of T2DM and its complications. Reduction of dietary intake of&#xD;
      AGEs may therefore be an alternative strategy to reduce the risk of vascular disease and&#xD;
      insulin resistance. The investigators therefore hypothesize that dietary restriction of AGEs&#xD;
      in overweight individuals improves insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, and vascular&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
