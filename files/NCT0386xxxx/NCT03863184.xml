      This is a single-arm phase 2 study to evaluate the preliminary evidence of efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of the combination of acalabrutinib, lenalidomide and rituximab (ALR) in previously&#xD;
      untreated mantle cell lymphoma. The study includes an induction phase consisting of 12 cycles&#xD;
      of ALR. Responding subjects will be eligible to enter a maintenance phase. Subjects will&#xD;
      continue maintenance ALR until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      voluntary withdrawal. Subjects will be followed after completing study intervention every 6&#xD;
      months for alternate anti-cancer therapy and survival.&#xD;
