      INTRODUCTION Cesarean section is life saving procedure that involve extraction of the baby&#xD;
      from the abdomen of the mother for numerous fetal and maternal indications The rate of&#xD;
      cesarean section has been rising dramatically in the last decade reaching up to 32 % of birth&#xD;
      in USA in 2014 . The rate of cesarean section in Assiut university in Egypt reached about 38%&#xD;
      in 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cesearen section is associated with many intraoperative and postoperative early and late&#xD;
      complications. Early complications includes hemorrhage bladder and bowel injuries, sepsis and&#xD;
      postoperative illeus . Remote complications include the occurrence of intraperitoneal&#xD;
      adhesions.The incidence of adhesions varies according to many factors includes the number of&#xD;
      previous cesarean section, type of suture material, hemostasis but usually incidence of&#xD;
      adhesions after cesarean is between 12 and 75 % .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of adhesions in repeated cesarean section increases the surgical difficulty and&#xD;
      the incidence of bladder and bowel injuries . Multidisciplinary team should evaluate these&#xD;
      patients before surgery. Few studies used ultrasound to evaluate the presence of adhesions&#xD;
      before operation . However they either used transvaaginal ultrasound which may not be&#xD;
      available or used a small sample size which does not reflect the value of this tool&#xD;
      accurately. In our study we are trying to use transabdominal ultrasound on large sample size&#xD;
      to evaluate the use of dynamic ultrasound perioperative in predicting adhesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To validate the use of dynamic ultrasound for prediction of adhesions in women&#xD;
           undergoing repeated cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To detect the interobserver and intraobserver reliability of this method. PATIENTS AND&#xD;
           METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study setting and population From February 2019 to February 2020, all women&#xD;
                undergoing repeated cesarean section in both Assiut university hospital and El Eman&#xD;
                hospital will be candidates for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study design The study will be blinded prospective observational study where&#xD;
                investigator will perform ultrasound to recruited women before their elective&#xD;
                cesarean section then the obstetrician who is blinded to the ultrasound results&#xD;
                will be asked to fill a form postoperative to report the presence site and extent&#xD;
                of adhesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eligible participants Inclusion criteria Pregnant women in third trimester planned&#xD;
                to undergo elective cesarean section ,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Primary elective cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interventions Pregnant women planned to do elective cesarean section will be examined by&#xD;
           two examiners senior resident and the assistant lecturer on duty using Medison&#xD;
           ultrasound 5 MHZ abdominal convex probe. The probe is placed on the site of previous&#xD;
           cesarean incision then moved from above downward and from side to side and we ask the&#xD;
           patient to breathe deeply then we record the movement of anterior uterine wall against&#xD;
           anterior abdominal wall where positive sliding sign if the uterus move freely and&#xD;
           negative sliding sign if there is limited mobility. Elective cesarean is done by the&#xD;
           obstetrician on duty as scheduled who is blind to the ultrasound results and then we ask&#xD;
           him to report if adhesions are absent or present and if present site and type of&#xD;
           adhesions and the difficulty of cesarean in a subjective score from 0 to 10.&#xD;
           Preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin level will be measured as an indirect&#xD;
           indicator for the difficulty of cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size We need some work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical Analysis The data will be collected and entered on Microsoft access data&#xD;
           base to be analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS Inc.,&#xD;
           Chicago, version 16). Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value&#xD;
           for the sliding sign will be measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethical aspect The study protocol will be submitted to Assiut medical school ethical&#xD;
           board for approval. All participants will sign a written consent in the study after&#xD;
           reading the patient information sheet or having it read for them if they cannot read or&#xD;
           write. Confidentially of patient data will be secured in all stage of the study. Women&#xD;
           who refuse participation in the study will not be affected by any mean regarding the&#xD;
           quality of care in our service.&#xD;
