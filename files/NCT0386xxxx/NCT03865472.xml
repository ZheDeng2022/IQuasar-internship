    <textblock>
      This trial studies best dose and how well repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)&#xD;
      works in promoting smoking cessation and preventing relapse in current smokers. rTMS is a&#xD;
      form of brain stimulation therapy that controls nerve cell activity, increases blood flow in&#xD;
      the brain, and improves cognitive function.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the effects of stimulation duration (stimulation days) and intensity (pulses&#xD;
      per day) on outcomes among smokers (sample size [n]=258) motivated to quit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify the most promising dosing strategy by balancing effect sizes and undesirable&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine the effects of 16 20Hz rTMS sessions combined with intensive cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral treatment and nicotine replacement on smoking cessation, developmental disability&#xD;
      (DD rates), cognitive behavioral skill acquisition, and nicotine patch adherence among lung&#xD;
      cancer (LC) patients (n=30). (Study 1 and Study 2) IV. To examine the feasibility and&#xD;
      potential efficacy of 20Hz rTMS on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for&#xD;
      concurrent smoking abstinence and reductions in alcohol use among smokers who are heavy&#xD;
      drinkers (n=20). (Study 1 and Study 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo rTMS once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) over 16 minutes for 8, 12,&#xD;
      or 16 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo sham rTMS QD or BID over 16 minutes for 8, 12, or 16 days.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Latency to relapse will be defined as the number of days from the quit day to relapse. Relapse will be defined as smoking for seven consecutive days. Will use Cox proportional-hazards (CPH) models to examine latency to relapse outcome. Ties in failure times will be handled using methods developed by Efron. Compliance with the CPH assumptions will be tested by coding the factors as time-dependent covariates.</description>
