  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) accounts for 20-25 percent of maternal deaths worldwide.&#xD;
      Tranexamic Acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic agent that has been shown to reduce the&#xD;
      estimated blood loss after delivery and is recommended by the World Health Organization for&#xD;
      PPH treatment. However, dosing in studies ranges from 0.5g to 4g and the optimal dose of TXA&#xD;
      in the pregnant population has not been established. Further, the effect of TXA on global&#xD;
      coagulation assessed by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) has not been elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      (PD) of TXA administered after delivery in patients at risk for PPH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PPH occurs in approximately 1-5% of deliveries in the United States and accounts for 20-25%&#xD;
      of maternal deaths worldwide. PPH is difficult to predict, but classically, risk factors for&#xD;
      PPH- uterine atony, abruption, retained tissue, lacerations, infection, obesity,&#xD;
      preeclampsia, magnesium administration, and prolonged labor- impede uterine contraction,&#xD;
      vasoconstriction, and clotting. In addition, 40% of PPH occurs in the absence of known risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early recognition of significant bleeding, pharmacologic therapy, and correction of&#xD;
      coagulopathy are critical measures to minimize morbidity and mortality from PPH. TXA is an&#xD;
      antifibrinolytic agent that competitively inhibits plasminogen, preventing activation of&#xD;
      plasmin and lysis of fibrin. TXA is used in many surgical arenas including cardiac,&#xD;
      orthopedic, pediatric, urologic, and gynecologic surgery and has been shown to be a useful&#xD;
      adjunct to uterotonics to reduce blood loss after vaginal or cesarean delivery without&#xD;
      maternal adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and side-effect profile of TXA is dose-dependent, but the optimal dose based on&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TXA have yet to be determined in the&#xD;
      obstetric population. Doses given after delivery have ranged from 0.5 to 4g bolus with or&#xD;
      without a subsequent infusion. The World Maternal Antifibrinolytic (WOMAN) trial was a&#xD;
      multi-country placebo-controlled randomized trial of 20,060 women in which placebo or TXA 1g&#xD;
      IV over 10 minutes was administered at the onset of PPH, with a second dose (placebo or 1g&#xD;
      TXA) if bleeding was ongoing at 30 minutes. Women who received TXA had a lower number of&#xD;
      laparotomies and no increase in thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolus, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, and cerebral vascular accident. Women who received TXA less than 1 hour or&#xD;
      greater than 3 hours after birth had similar risks of hysterectomy or death, but women who&#xD;
      received TXA 1 to 3 hours after birth had a lower risk of hysterectomy or death from bleeding&#xD;
      (World Health Organization; WHO). The 1g dose in the WOMAN trial was modeled after the&#xD;
      Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH-2) trial, in&#xD;
      which TXA was administered to trauma patients with hemorrhage. A French multicenter trial&#xD;
      randomized 152 women to receive either 4g of TXA administered over 1 hour followed by a&#xD;
      maintenance dose of 1g/hour for 6 hours, or standard care without TXA. Patients who received&#xD;
      10g TXA had reduced EBL, enhanced response to uterotonic agents, less change in hemoglobin&#xD;
      values, lower number of blood products transfused, and a trend toward a lower rate of&#xD;
      invasive surgical procedures. In the pediatric population, a wide range of TXA doses from&#xD;
      10mg/kg to 100mg/kg have been reported, with higher dose correlating with a reduction in&#xD;
      blood loss, but also an increase in neurologic or thromboembolic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects from TXA are rare and include allergic reaction, dizziness, low blood pressure,&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, muscle spasm, and vision change. Serious potential complications&#xD;
      associated with higher doses of TXA such as those used during cardiac surgery include&#xD;
      thrombosis and seizures. However, TXA administered at lower doses for bleeding (1g to 2g IV,&#xD;
      or a 10mg/kg bolus) is not associated with an increased rate of thrombosis or seizure&#xD;
      activity. Given the potential seizure risk, the use of TXA in patients with a seizure&#xD;
      disorder or in conditions that lower the seizure threshold such as preeclampsia may be&#xD;
      relatively contraindicated, as TXA also lowers the seizure threshold through competitive&#xD;
      antagonism of the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROTEM® is a whole blood point-of-care assay of coagulation. There are anticipated&#xD;
      hypercoagulable changes in the blood at term gestation and unpredictable changes in&#xD;
      coagulation during PPH, making ROTEM® a potentially useful tool. The effect of TXA on&#xD;
      maternal coagulation profile after delivery assessed by ROTEM® is unknown. The use of ROTEM®&#xD;
      during TXA therapy in correlation with plasma TXA levels may help characterize the optimal&#xD;
      dose for its impact on the coagulation profile. Further, it may help explain why in the WOMAN&#xD;
      trial the most effective dosing time was between one and three hours after onset of PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to evaluate the PD and PK of TXA administered after delivery, in&#xD;
      conjunction with its impact on coagulation measured by ROTEM®. The 2017 WHO Executive&#xD;
      Guideline Steering Group on maternal and perinatal health recommends early use of TXA, within&#xD;
      3 hours of birth, for women with PPH (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).&#xD;
      TXA administration is therefore increasingly common during PPH. It is meaningful to explore&#xD;
      the optimal dose of TXA that balances efficacy and safety: optimizing maternal TXA exposure&#xD;
      (serum level) while minimizing the risk of thrombosis (increased hypercoagulable changes on&#xD;
      ROTEM®).&#xD;
