  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether adding phone coaching to an Internet-based&#xD;
      weight loss program can improve weight loss outcomes at 4 months and 1 year. All individuals&#xD;
      will receive a 4-month, Internet-delivered weight loss program followed by an 8-month&#xD;
      Internet-delivered weight loss maintenance program. Some individuals will also be selected to&#xD;
      receive either 3 weeks or 12 weeks of phone coaching. Assessments of weight, diet, physical&#xD;
      activity, and psychosocial factors will occur at baseline, 4 months, and 1 year.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All individuals enrolled in this study will receive a 4-month Internet-based weight loss&#xD;
      program followed by an 8-month Internet-based weight loss maintenance program. During the&#xD;
      first 4 months, each week individuals will be asked to view a 10-15-minute multi-media lesson&#xD;
      (one per week). These lessons focus on behavioral principles for changing diet and physical&#xD;
      activity behaviors. Participants are also given weight loss, calorie intake, and physical&#xD;
      activity goals. They are taught how to self-monitor this information and are instructed to&#xD;
      submit it weekly on the study website. Automated, weekly individualized feedback is provided.&#xD;
      Following the 4-month weight loss program participants will receive an 8-month weight loss&#xD;
      maintenance program. During this time, they will be asked to view monthly video lessons which&#xD;
      focus on strategies for successful WL maintenance and instructed to continue to self-monitor&#xD;
      weight, calorie intake, and physical activity minutes on the study website for one week per&#xD;
      month. Automated, monthly feedback is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the Internet program described above, some individuals enrolled in this study&#xD;
      will be selected to receive phone coaching. Those selected for 'brief' phone coaching will be&#xD;
      asked to complete 3 phone calls with a coach between weeks 5-8 of the study and those&#xD;
      selected to receive 'extended' phone coaching will be asked to complete 12 phone calls with a&#xD;
      coach between weeks 5-16. The first coaching call will be approximately 45 minutes in&#xD;
      duration and all subsequent calls will be approximately 15 minutes in duration. The coach&#xD;
      will assist participants in developing a meal plan, problem solving around current barriers,&#xD;
      and goal setting. Upon completion of all coaching calls participants will have no additional&#xD;
      interaction with the coach, but will remain enrolled in the Internet program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will occur at baseline, 4, and 12 months.&#xD;
