  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a limited two centre randomized controlled feasibility trial towards a larger&#xD;
      definitive trial designed to assess whether bed side ultrasound can reduce the rate of&#xD;
      surgical fixation following emergency department manipulation of Colles' type wrist&#xD;
      fractures. UDiReCT will mirror the proposed design of the definitive trial but will report&#xD;
      feasibility data such as recruitment rate, data completeness and reliability of potential&#xD;
      definitive trial outcome measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wrist fractures are one of the most common fractures encountered in the Emergency Department&#xD;
      (ED). These injuries most frequently happen in people who have fallen onto an outstretched&#xD;
      hand and can result in deformity ('displacement') of the broken bone. These 'displaced'&#xD;
      (Colles' types of distal radial) fractures can result in long term deformity and problems&#xD;
      using the wrist. To prevent this, patients with displaced fractures often undergo&#xD;
      manipulation of their fractures, to straighten the wrist, using local anaesthetic or sedation&#xD;
      techniques in ED before a plaster cast is applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, if ED fracture manipulation is inadequate or the position later 'slips', which&#xD;
      can occur in the first 1-2 weeks even in cast, then the patient will need to be admitted to&#xD;
      hospital for surgical fixation. Local audit data suggests this affects up to a third of these&#xD;
      patients and is a significant additional social and economic burden for patients and&#xD;
      healthcare services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing these fractures as precisely as possible might reduce the subsequent need for&#xD;
      surgery. However, ED fracture manipulations are typically done 'blind' with check x-rays&#xD;
      after casting, making re-manipulation time consuming with prolonged local anaesthetic times&#xD;
      or need for re-sedation. Portable, bedside ultrasound is available in most departments and&#xD;
      has been used to guide fracture reduction but it is not known how effective this is nor is it&#xD;
      in routine use. Providing this evidence would require a large, multi-centre randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to determine whether such a trial comparing current practice with&#xD;
      ultrasound guided reductions is justified and feasible. This will be done by running a&#xD;
      feasibility RCT across two United Kingdom (UK) hospital sites to assess recruitment rates and&#xD;
      trial procedures. The investigators hope to recruit about 60 patients in 6 months. This trial&#xD;
      will include adults' aged 18 years and older, with Colles' type of distal radial fractures&#xD;
      requiring manipulation in ED.&#xD;
