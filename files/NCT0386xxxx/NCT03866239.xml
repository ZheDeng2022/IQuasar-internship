    <textblock>
      CO40939 is a Phase Ib, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of cibisatamab in combination with&#xD;
      atezolizumab administered after pretreatment with obinutuzumab in patients with Stage IV&#xD;
      microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) whose tumors have high&#xD;
      carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) expression and who have&#xD;
      progressed on two or more chemotherapy regimens. The study is composed of a safety run-in and&#xD;
      an exploratory part.&#xD;
