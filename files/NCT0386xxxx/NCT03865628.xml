      In case of fetal weight below the 10th centile for gestational age, it is important to&#xD;
      distinguish SGA and IUGR. SGA is defined as a fetal weight below the 10th centile. IUGR&#xD;
      correspond to a pathologic reduction of growth velocity and it is a major determinant of&#xD;
      perinatal mortality and morbidity. Even if SGA have long time been considered to be&#xD;
      constitutionally small without adverse outcomes, recent evidence has demonstrated that a&#xD;
      proportion of SGA, with normal UA Doppler, could be associated with neonatal adverse&#xD;
      outcomes, probably related to a late-onset IUGR. Therefore, it seems essential to&#xD;
      differentiate several categories of fetuses presenting abnormal fetal weight or intrauterine&#xD;
      growth: fetuses SGA without any Doppler abnormalities, fetuses affected by early or&#xD;
      late-IUGR. In case of late-IUGR, an important part of these fetuses is initially considered&#xD;
      as PAG with a normal umbilical Doppler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of fetal weight below the 10th centile for gestational age, longitudinal assessment&#xD;
      of the fetal weight and umbilical artery (UA) Doppler is recommended. In case of abnormal UA&#xD;
      Doppler, Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) Doppler is recommended to research a &quot;brain-sparing&quot;&#xD;
      effect. If UA and MCA Doppler findings seem to become abnormal in the early stages of IUGR,&#xD;
      Ductus Venosus (DV) flow abnormalities have been described as a late marker of fetal&#xD;
      decompensation related to an acute myocardial impaired relaxation and acidemia which is a&#xD;
      major contributor to adverse perinatal outcome and neurological. The aortic isthmus (AoI)&#xD;
      Doppler is an indicator of the progression of fetal hemodynamic deterioration in IUGR and&#xD;
      recent data confirm that AoI and DV abnormalities are correlated but AoI Doppler&#xD;
      abnormalities would occur earlier than DV Doppler. AoI Doppler could identify abnormalities&#xD;
      suggestive of right ventricular dysfunction before DV Doppler and anticipate obstetrical&#xD;
      management. In conclusion, Doppler examination could not be reduced to UA Doppler in case of&#xD;
      SGA and IUGR and require a global examination including MCA and probably DV and AoI Doppler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That's why fetal growth assessment should not be limited to fetal biometry and umbilical&#xD;
      artery Doppler. Thanks to a systematic protocol for Doppler examination based on UA, MCA, DV&#xD;
      and Aortic Isthmus (AoI) Doppler, we hope identify these hemodynamic variations in a large&#xD;
      cohort of fetuses &lt;10 to improve prenatal assessment of these foetus to and perinatal&#xD;
      outcomes, reducing perinatal morbi-mortality.&#xD;

      All women were followed at one referent matron-fetal medicine unit where they delivered or to&#xD;
      which they were referred for abnormalities of the fetal growth. Conforming to national&#xD;
      guidelines, referent ultrasound scans and longitudinal assessment of the estimated fetal&#xD;
      weight (EFW) were performed depending on the EFW. Each eligible woman was given an&#xD;
      information sheet concerning the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal biometry and Doppler were performed thanks to a standardised protocol based on&#xD;
      international guidelines. In all instances, ultrasound examinations were performed by one&#xD;
      experienced and certified operators using an ultrasound machine (GE Voluson E8/E10, GE&#xD;
      Medical Systems). EFW was calculated from head and abdominal circumferences and femur length&#xD;
      using the formula of Hadlock. The reference growth curves was CFEF growth curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulsed Doppler measurements were performed automatically, based on at least three consecutive&#xD;
      waveforms, with angle of insonation as close to 0° as possible and always below 30°. A&#xD;
      high-pass filter of 70 Hz was used to record low-flow velocities and to avoid artifacts. The&#xD;
      Umbilical Artery (UA)-PI Doppler were measured at the placental insertion of the funicular&#xD;
      cord. The Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA)-PI was obtained in a transverse view of the fetal&#xD;
      head, at the level of its origin from the circle of Willis, and the cerebroplacental ratio&#xD;
      (CPR) was calculated as the ratio MCA-PI / UA-PI. Aortic Isthmus (AoI)-PI was measured at the&#xD;
      level of the three vessels and trachea view, placing the gate just before the convergence of&#xD;
      the AoI and the arterial duct. Ductus Venosus (DV)-PI was measured in a mid-sagittal or&#xD;
      transverse section of the fetal abdomen, positioning the Doppler gate at its isthmic portion.&#xD;
      Participation in the study does not lead to any change in practices or additional data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure the reproducibility of the data and to limit the measurement biases, we&#xD;
      will perform a second reading of the Doppler to verify the application of the measurement&#xD;
      protocol, especially: acquisition, Doppler spectrum and measurements. A first analysis will&#xD;
      focus on the first 10 patients included per center and then, a random analysis on 10 patients&#xD;
      every 100 patients included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regularly, data monitoring will be made by a scientific technician to reduce missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymous sonographic data were automatically extracted from the electronic patient record&#xD;
      (Diamm (MICRO6 SARL) or ViewPoint (General Electric Healthcare France)) and compiled into an&#xD;
      electronic case report form with demographic, maternal, obstetrical and neonatal data.&#xD;
      Regular extraction will allow to test extraction pipeline and statistical test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given a 10% prevalence of SGA, an expected inclusion rate with completed data of 90% and the&#xD;
      number of births in the several units, a sample size of 1200 newborns was sufficient to&#xD;
      identify 20% of adverse perinatal outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables will be described using the following parameters: mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, median, and minimum and maximum values. Qualitative variables will be described by&#xD;
      the frequency and proportion of each class. The qualitative variables will be compared by&#xD;
      Chi² test or Fisher exact test. Quantitative variables will be compared by a Student test or&#xD;
      a Mann &amp; Whitney test. We will focus on describing the temporal dynamics of the&#xD;
      cerebro-aortic relationship.&#xD;
