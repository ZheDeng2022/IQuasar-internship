      The widely observed inverse relationship between smoking and Parkinson's Disease (PD) and the&#xD;
      results of numerous preclinical studies indicating neuroprotective effects of nicotine,&#xD;
      suggest a possible novel intervention in PD. In our opinion, an optimal nicotinic therapy in&#xD;
      PD would consist of pulsatile nicotine delivery (e.g. via nasal spray) similar to pulsatile&#xD;
      nicotine obtained via smoking. The investigators believe that pulsatile stimulation of the&#xD;
      central nicotinic receptors (achievable via nasal spray) would affect the dynamic of the&#xD;
      nicotinic receptors much more desirably and similar to smoking compared to continuous&#xD;
      nicotine administration via patch, which might result in continuous nicotinic receptor&#xD;
      desensitization. Thus, this pilot trial seeks to evaluate the efficacy of nicotine nasal&#xD;
      spray (Nicotrol NS®) in symptomatology of PD. For this purpose, a total of 6 non-smoking&#xD;
      patients at intermediate disease stages (2-3 of Hoehn and Yahr scale) and receiving&#xD;
      conventional therapy for PD will be recruited at the &quot;Instituto Nacional de Neurología y&#xD;
      Neurocirugía, (Manuel Velasco Suárez)&quot; in Mexico City. Nicotrol NS® in incremental dosing (up&#xD;
      to 10 mg/day) regimens will be added to the current medications to each patient during the&#xD;
      first week. This will be maintained for up to 1 month. Motor and non-motor aspects of PD will&#xD;
      be evaluated. The investigators expect significant improvement of motor and non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms in all patients receiving Nicotrol NS® during therapy and a reversal during&#xD;
      withdrawal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is&#xD;
      associated with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta that leads&#xD;
      to striatal dopamine deficiency. This dopaminergic loss results in motor deficits&#xD;
      characterized by: akinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and postural instability as well as&#xD;
      non-motor symptoms that might also involve other neurotransmitter systems. The non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms may include: cognitive deficits (e.g., mild to severe memory impairment), emotional&#xD;
      changes (e.g., depression, apathy and anxiety), sleep perturbations (e.g.,&#xD;
      insomnia/hypersomnia), autonomic dysfunction (e.g., bladder disturbances, orthostatic&#xD;
      hypotension, sweating), sensory symptoms (e.g., pain, visual and olfactory deficits) and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., constipation, nausea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease current treatment of choice is replacement of dopamine with its precursor&#xD;
      Levodopa (L-Dopa), which unfortunately loses its effectiveness and can cause dyskinesia&#xD;
      following prolonged usage. This fact motivates the search for new pharmacological strategies&#xD;
      to better control the symptoms and/or progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inverse relationship between smoking and PD has been confirmed by a number of&#xD;
      epidemiological studies. Moreover, numerous preclinical studies indicate neuroprotective&#xD;
      effects of nicotine. Thus, nicotine may offer a novel intervention in PD. Although use of&#xD;
      nicotine patch has been suggested in some neurodegenerative disorders, including PD, the&#xD;
      investigators believe that the key for success with nicotinic intervention, particularly in&#xD;
      PD, relies on mode of nicotine administration. In our opinion, an optimal nicotinic therapy&#xD;
      in PD would consist of pulsatile nicotine delivery (e.g. via nasal spray) similar to&#xD;
      pulsatile nicotine obtained via smoking. Pulsatile stimulation of the central nicotinic&#xD;
      receptors (achievable via nasal spray) would affect the dynamic of the nicotinic receptors&#xD;
      much more desirably than continuous nicotine administration via patch, which can result in&#xD;
      continuous nicotinic receptor desensitization. The investigators also believe that nicotine&#xD;
      delivered via nasal spray, in addition to its potential usefulness for improving motor&#xD;
      dysfunctions, may also be helpful in non-motor symptoms (e.g. cognitive decline and&#xD;
      depression) that are commonly associated with neurological disorders such as PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this pilot clinical trial seeks to evaluate the efficacy of treatment during one month&#xD;
      with nicotine nasal spray (Nicotrol NS®) in motor and non-motor aspects of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Scores of the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale&#xD;
      (MDS-UPDRS) for motor and non-motor symptomatology will decrease after 1 month of treatment&#xD;
      with nicotine nasal spray (Nicotrol) in patients with PD (stages 2-3 of Hoehn &amp; Yahr).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: Can controlled doses of nicotine administered via nasal spray decrease the&#xD;
      severity of PD (stages 2-3 of Hoehn &amp; Yahr) using MDS-UPDRS scores?&#xD;
