  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy&#xD;
      toripalimab (anti-PD-1 mAb) combined with thermal ablation in patients with Hepatocellular&#xD;
      Carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      1.1 Primary Objective &amp; Hypothesis Determine the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation (RFA)/microwave ablation (MWA) followed by toripalimab for advanced HCC by&#xD;
      establishing the rates of toxicity that occur within 6 months after ablation. Hypothesis:&#xD;
      Thermal ablation followed by toripalimab will have similar toxicity to toripalimab&#xD;
      monotherapy. Thermal ablation enhances antitumor immune response and improves the best&#xD;
      overall response rate compared to historical controls with toripalimab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Secondary Objectives and Hypotheses Estimate the progression-free survival, and overall&#xD;
      survival. Hypothesis: Disease control and survival will be better than that observed with&#xD;
      toripalimab monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Exploratory Objectives Explore changes in inflammatory biomarkers (including, but not&#xD;
      limited to CD8+/Treg ratio, total CD4+ counts, total lymphocyte count) in pretreatment and&#xD;
      on-treatment serially collected peripheral blood samples. Hypothesis: Changes in inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers after thermal ablation may correlate with a more favorable response to&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
