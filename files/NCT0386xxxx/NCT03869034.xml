  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma patients are mostly diagnosed at advanced stage. Nowadays, hepatic&#xD;
      artery interventional therapy and/or systemic therapy are the main treatments options for&#xD;
      these patients. Our previous study showed that compared to than conventional transcatheter&#xD;
      arterial chemoembolization (TACE), transarterial infusion chemotherapy (TAI) has better&#xD;
      objective response, better safety profile, and increased resection rates. The PD-1 inhibitors&#xD;
      emerged in recent years have shown good momentum in the treatment of hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. The single-drug treatment on advanced hepatocellular carcinoma has a tumor&#xD;
      response rate of 17%, the disease control rate exceeds 60%, and the overall survival time&#xD;
      exceeds 12 months. And it has good tolerance and less adverse events. In studies of other&#xD;
      cancer, combined with traditional chemotherapy can further improve the efficacy of PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitors. Our study is a prospective, single-arm, phase II clinical study for patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced, potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (tumor confined to the&#xD;
      hepatic stenosis with one or more branches of the portal vein). Progressive survival (PFS) is&#xD;
      the primary end point of study. The overall survival rate, degrading resection rate,&#xD;
      pathological response, and safety are the secondary endpoints. The efficacy and safety of TAI&#xD;
      combined with PD-1 inhibitor in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma will be&#xD;
      discussed.&#xD;

      Sintilimab monoclonal antibody (IBI308) is a recombinant human IgG4 PD-1 monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
      It has been proved in many preclinical and in vitro trials that the effect of blocking PD-1&#xD;
      pathway with Sintilimab monoclonal antibody on. The results of preclinical pharmacodynamics,&#xD;
      animal pharmacokinetics and toxicology all indicated that Sintilimab monoclonal antibody has&#xD;
      clear targets, reliable cell lines and drug stability. It has considerable characteristics&#xD;
      and has shown good activity in various preclinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma patients are mostly diagnosed in advanced stage, and hepatic artery&#xD;
      interventional therapy and/or systemic therapy are the main treatments options for these&#xD;
      patients. In recent years, some researchers have reported that chemotherapy plays a critical&#xD;
      role in transcatheter arterial intervention (Shi et al. JNCI, 2012, 105: 59). Compared with&#xD;
      traditional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), hepatic arterial infusion&#xD;
      chemotherapy (TAI) provides a more stable and long-lasting local control rate, which promised&#xD;
      better outcomes. However, the effectiveness of TAI varies greatly depending on the&#xD;
      chemotherapy drug used, with an efficiency ranging from 7-81% and OS ranging from 6-15.9&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The single-drug treatment of PD-1 inhibitor in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma has a tumor&#xD;
      response rate of 17%, the disease control rate exceeds 60%, and the overall survival time&#xD;
      exceeds 12 months. And it has good tolerance and less adverse events. In studies in other&#xD;
      cancers, combined with traditional chemotherapy can further improve the efficacy of PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitors. Our study is a prospective, single-arm, phase II clinical study for patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced, potentially resectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (tumor confined to&#xD;
      the hepatic stenosis with one or more branches of the portal vein). Progressive survival&#xD;
      (PFS) is the primary end point of the present study. The overall survival rate, degrading&#xD;
      resection rate, pathological response, and safety are the secondary endpoints. The efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of TAI combined with PD-1 inhibitor in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma will be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the criteria of our center for the Single Disease of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,&#xD;
      every 2 courses of treatment (6-8 weeks) were reviewed during the treatment period. The&#xD;
      patients were followed up every 3 months within 2 years and every 6 months after the&#xD;
      treatment. The recurrence, metastasis sites, detection methods, adjuvant treatment and&#xD;
      accurate survival time were recorded in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate progression-free survival and overall survival;&#xD;
      the Log-rank method was used for single factor analysis; the Cox model was analyzed by&#xD;
      multivariate analysis; and the intergroup rates were compared using chi-square test. Both&#xD;
      tests were performed, and P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for sample size estimation, combined with historical data from similar patients in the&#xD;
      department, the median PFS for patients who met the inclusion criteria was approximately 6&#xD;
      months. The median PFS for TAI combined with Sintilimab mAb was estimated to be 9 months,&#xD;
      with α = 0.1, β = 0.2, and 12 months of enrollment period, the sample volume is 34 patients.&#xD;
      Given a 15% shedding rate, a total of 40 patients are required.&#xD;
