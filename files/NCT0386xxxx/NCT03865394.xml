  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate efficiency of applying of adipose-derived mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells (ADSC) in treatment of chronic wounds in diabetic foot syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The product will contain an active ingredient- human allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells (ADSC) cells suspended in the fibrin solution applied directly onto prepared wound&#xD;
      bed, to form thin gel layer on the wound surface.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in wound size</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The comparison of the time required for the 50% reduction of initial wound size between patients in both study arms.&#xD;
The wound size changes will be assessed using digital 3D wound imaging medical device with image processing software, according to the following rules:&#xD;
for wounds deeper than 0.5 cm - measurement of wound volume, or&#xD;
for shallow wounds (less than 0.5 cm depth) - measurement of wound surface.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in wound morphology</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical assessment of wound morphology (and its changes during the treatment) in each treated patient, as well, as between patients in both study arms, expressed as:&#xD;
the amount (1) and features (2) of wound exudate,&#xD;
the presence of redness (3) and/or edema (4) in the wound surrounding skin,&#xD;
the presence of granular tissue and fibrin (5) or epithelium (6) in the wound bed.&#xD;
The listed parameters will be assessed using simplified questionnaire adopted from Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool (positions 7-13 from B-JWAT).&#xD;
Each of 6 abovementioned features will be assessed semiquantitatively using 1-5 points scale, (with &quot;1&quot; for a best state, and &quot;5&quot; for a worst state). The sum of points allocated to each parameter will be recorded as the wound score and used for further analysis.&#xD;
The healthy skin/healed wound should receive 6 points, whereas active wound, with exudate and inflammation will receive 30 points (the lower = the better / the higher = the worse).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in pro-angiogenic factors expression</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the expression (and its changes during the treatment) of selected pro-angiogenic factors, measured in wound biopsies.&#xD;
The changes will be analyzed for each tested individual separately, and compared between both study arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in wound-associated pain</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the wound-associated pain, assessed by the patient using visual analogue scale. The minimum value is 0 and means &quot;no pain&quot; and the maximum value is 10 and means &quot;the worst possible pain&quot;. The lower value the better outcome.&#xD;
The changes will be analyzed for each tested individual separately, and compared between both study arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the patient's quality of life, assessed by the dedicated QoL questionnaire. The QoL questionnaire consists of 10 questions. Each question is scored 1 to 5. The minimum score is 10 and it means &quot;the best possible state of health&quot;, and the maximum score is 50, which means ,,the worst possible state of health&quot;.&#xD;
The changes will be analyzed for each tested individual separately, and compared between both study arms.</description>
