  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-year study proposal to assess feasibility of MWeST (Mobile Weight-Support&#xD;
      Therapy) implementation after geriatric fracture and its effects on functional and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to improve mobilization of geriatric lower extremity trauma&#xD;
      patients, with the aim of improving overall functional and patient-reported outcomes while&#xD;
      decreasing complications and readmissions. Almost 50% of the adult population in the United&#xD;
      States has osteopenia or osteoporosis, with over 2 million fragility fractures per year and a&#xD;
      projected $25 billion in costs by 2025. These patients are at high risk for readmission due&#xD;
      to complications, and at increased risk of mortality with these complications. Sarcopenia, a&#xD;
      generalized loss of skeletal muscle associated with aging, has also been associated with&#xD;
      increased disability and increased risk of future fracture in these patients. The&#xD;
      investigator's study aims to assess the value of weight-support therapy for geriatric&#xD;
      patients with lower extremity trauma in improving their overall risk of future injury and&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
