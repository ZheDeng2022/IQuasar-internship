  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the pathologic response at 12 months after single dose&#xD;
      preoperative partial breast irradiation in early stage breast cancer patients. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the aim is to collect data on response monitoring. Patient-reported outcome measures and&#xD;
      treatment-induced toxicity will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this multi-center single arm interventional cohort study 70 patients will be treated with&#xD;
      single dose preoperative partial breast irradiation (PBI). Breast conserving surgery will be&#xD;
      performed 12 months following PBI to assess pathologic response. Response monitoring&#xD;
      following PBI includes MRI (3T and 7T), liquid biopsies and biopsy of the irradiated tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this trial can change the current treatment of patients with early stage breast&#xD;
      cancer. The single dose PBI can be of benefit for all patients who are suitable for&#xD;
      postoperative PBI according to current guidelines. If pathologic complete response can be&#xD;
      accurately predicted by (one of) the abovementioned response monitoring modalities, the need&#xD;
      for surgery will become disputable. Moreover, in patients without expected pathologic&#xD;
      complete response, the burden of radiotherapy can be minimized from 3-4.5 weeks of&#xD;
      radiotherapy to a single dose of radiotherapy.&#xD;
