      The purpose of this thesis is to research the effect of oral baclofen treatment and botulinum&#xD;
      toxin injection treatments over the electromyographic nociceptive flexor reflex (NFR)&#xD;
      threshold in hemiplegic patients with spasticity. The results of the study evaluated the&#xD;
      Modified Ashworth Scale, joint range of motion, muscle strength, Brunnstrom stages, Barthel&#xD;
      daily life activities index, electromyographic nociceptive flexor reflex (NFR) threshold.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is defined as increased resistance tied to speed against passive movements and is&#xD;
      related to hyperactive reflexes after upper motor neuron lesions. The hemiplegia table, which&#xD;
      develops after subsiding, brings many problems along with it. Spasticity is one of these&#xD;
      problems. Spasticity frequently leads to difficulty in the activities of daily life. It&#xD;
      delays functional recovery, causes pain, and leads to secondary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of spasticity treatment minimizes the negative effects of hypertension without&#xD;
      endangering function. Systematic medication treatment (baclofen, diazepam, dantrolen, and&#xD;
      tizanidine) or local treatment (botulinum toxin, phenyl injection) are administered in&#xD;
      spasticity treatment. The botulinum toxin prevents the secretion of acetylcholine in nerve&#xD;
      endings and creates a presynaptic neuromuscular block. There are numerous studies that show&#xD;
      that botulinum toxin is effective in spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baclofen is a gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist. It passes through the blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier and binds to the GABAb receptors of the spinal cord. Baclofen decreases spasms,&#xD;
      clonus, and resistance to germs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies of electrophysiological reflexes are conducted to evaluate spasticity and to&#xD;
      study neuronal circuits. The electrophysiological test is a tool used in studying the changes&#xD;
      in spinal cord function and spinal reflexes in patients. The flexor reflex known as the&#xD;
      recoil reflex is a polysynaptic and multisegmental reflex. It provides for avoidance and&#xD;
      protection from internal and external stimulants that may be harmful for the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to research the effect of oral baclofen treatment and botulinum&#xD;
      toxin injection treatments over the electromyographic nociceptive flexor reflex (NFR)&#xD;
      threshold in hemiplegic patients with spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH The purpose of this thesis is to research the effect of oral baclofen&#xD;
      treatment and botulinum toxin injection treatments over the electromyographic nociceptive&#xD;
      flexor reflex (NFR) threshold in hemiplegic patients with spasticity. The results of the&#xD;
      study evaluated the Modified Ashworth Scale, joint range of motion, muscle strength,&#xD;
      Brunnstrom stages, Barthel daily life activities index, electromyographic nociceptive flexor&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index (BI) measures the extent to which somebody can function independently and has mobility in their activities of daily living (ADL) i.e. feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing, bowel control, bladder control, toileting, chair transfer, ambulation and stair climbing. The index also indicates the need for assistance in care.The final score on the Barthel index ranges from 0, or complete dependence, to 100, or complete independence .</description>

    <measure>VÄ±sual analog scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>When using a VAS to assess pain, subjects are asked to indicate intensity by marking a (usually) 100-mm-long horizontal line that is labeled &quot;no pain&quot; at one end and &quot;worst pain possible&quot; at the other end. This requires the patient to be able to equate the length of the line (as measured from the left-hand side to the point marked) with the amount of pain they are experiencing. Higher values represent worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The Modified Ashworth scale (MAS) measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching and is used as a simple measure of spasticity. Higher values represent worse outcome.&#xD;
(0) No increase in muscle tone&#xD;
(1) Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or byminimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension.(1+) Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimalresistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM.(2) More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved.(3) Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult.(4) Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension</description>

    <description>Botulinum toxin (BTX), being one of the most potent biological toxins, acts by blocking neuromuscular transmission via inhibiting acetylcholine release. Currently, focal spasticity is being treated successfully with BTX via injecting in the spastic muscles( Dose: 300-400 iu). Two antigenically distinct serotypes of BTX are available on the market as type A and B.</description>

    <description>Baclofen is an agonist that has presynaptic and postsynaptic effects on monosynaptic and polysynaptic pathways by binding to GABA B receptors. The recommended dosing regimen is initiated with 5 mg 3 times a day. It can be increased by 15-mg/d increments at 3-day intervals as needed. Dosing should not exceed 80 mg/d.</description>
