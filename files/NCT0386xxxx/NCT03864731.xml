  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the audiological and quality of life performance patients&#xD;
      have with an ADHEAR (adhesive bone conduction device) compared to no hearing device.&#xD;

      Patients will be recruited at the outpatient's department of the Medical University of Vienna&#xD;
      - Otorhinolaryngology department. Patient will be asked to participate in the study when&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria are met. Mostly patients scheduled for a surgery improving&#xD;
      conductive hearing loss or scheduled for implantation of an implantable bone conduction&#xD;
      hearing aid will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not use a hearing aid and who are not planning on using a hearing aid meeting&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria will also be asked to participate in the study. After&#xD;
      inclusion in the study patients will be asked to fill out two questionnaires (quality of life&#xD;
      and hearing specific questionnaire). They will then be fitted with an ADHEAR device and&#xD;
      undergo unaided and aided soundfield audiometry. Randomization will be carried out&#xD;
      (Randomization ratio 1.4:1) and patients in the intervention group will keep the device for&#xD;
      the following 4 months with one visit after the first probation time of one month. At the one&#xD;
      month mark patients in the control group will be asked to fill out the two questionnaires.&#xD;
      Patients in the control group will be asked to return to the department and fill out the&#xD;
      three questionnaires (SSQ-12 (Speech Spatial and Hearing Questionnaire), AQoL(Assessment of&#xD;
      Quality of Life) and In-house questionnaire). Further audiologic assessment will be carried&#xD;
      out. At this appointment patients will be able to talk about their experiences in the&#xD;
      probation period und easily terminate the study in case of insufficient improvement, pain,&#xD;
      skin irritations or other issues. At the four month mark patients in both groups will be&#xD;
      asked to return for audiologic assessment and for filling out the questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate, whether patients using ADHEAR have a significantly improved quality of life compared to patients not fitted with a device with the AQoL (Assessment of Quality of Life) questionnaire. It comprises 35 questions covering a multitude of quality of life aspects. Weighted utilities are generated using the algorithms provided on the AQoL website. Weighted utilities give a number between 0 and 1 as answer for every question. These sub scores are then presented.</description>
