  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current available therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including&#xD;
      immunomodulator and biologic medications may have toxicities limiting use or inadequate&#xD;
      effect. We propose a novel approach to the treatment of IBD by using transcutaneous vagal&#xD;
      nerve stimulation (VNS). Research has previously identified that VNS using a surgically&#xD;
      implanted stimulator can improve symptoms and decrease inflammation in people with&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases. This study will evaluate the use of non-invasive nerve stimulation&#xD;
      through the skin (rather than through an implanted device) as a potential therapy in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with Crohn Disease or ulcerative colitis. We will be evaluating how this&#xD;
      nerve stimulation affects symptoms, markers of inflammation found in the blood and stool&#xD;
      including cytokine levels, and heart rate variability. The primary hypothesis of the study is&#xD;
      the use of transcutaneous VNS will decrease inflammation in people with IBD leading to&#xD;
      improved signs and symptoms of disease. The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      change in fecal calprotectin after 16 weeks of nerve stimulation. Secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      changes in symptom scores, blood cytokine levels, and heart rate variability.&#xD;

Cytokine levels within the blood will be assessed and compared to baseline levels. The cytokines being assayed include tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Interferon-gamma, Transforming Growth Factor-beta and Interleukins (IL) - 1, 6, 10, 12, 17, 18, 23. Samples will be collected for this analysis at week 0, 2, 4, and 24</description>
