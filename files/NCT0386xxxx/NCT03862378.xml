    <textblock>
      In our previous study, a nomogram model was established to predict intra-abdominal infectious&#xD;
      complications after gastrointestinal surgery. This model was based on the clinical data and&#xD;
      the drainage fluid cytokine levels, and it received an AUC &gt;0.9. In this study, validation of&#xD;
      this nomogram is planned to be conducted in this prospective cohort study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Intra-abdominal infectious complications such as anastomotic leakage are the most feared but&#xD;
      common complications after gastrointestinal surgery. In our previous study, a nomogram model&#xD;
      was established to predict intra-abdominal complications after gastrointestinal surgery. This&#xD;
      model was based on the clinical data and the drainage fluid cytokine levels, and it received&#xD;
      an AUC &gt;0.9. A predicting score (i.e. APPEAL-GC score) was created based on the model. In&#xD;
      this study, validation of this score in predicting intra-abdominal complications is planned&#xD;
      to be conducted in this prospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, all patients undergoing gastric or colorectal cancer surgery with a primary&#xD;
      anastomosis will be included. The clinical data and complication data will be prospectively&#xD;
      collected; the discarded drainage fluid will be collected and analyzed afterward. No&#xD;
      additional intervention will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cytokine levels in the drainage fluid will be evaluated, and together with the clinical&#xD;
      data, an APPEAL-GC score will be created for each patient. We will investigate whether the&#xD;
      above-mentioned score is able to predict the intraabdominal complications after surgery. The&#xD;
      predictive value (clinical usefulness) of the score will be validated in this study.&#xD;

    <description>The positive predictive value of the APPEAL-GC score in predicting the intra-abdominal infectious complications. Intra-Abdominal infectious complications include anastomotic leakage and other abdominal infectious complications. The complication definitions are in accordance with the Chinese consensus of gastrointestinal complication diagnosis and registration.&#xD;
The APPEAL-GC score was derived from our recently finished study (unpublished). It includes evaluation of the surgical type (open or laparoscopic), resection range, age, and cytokine levels on the postoperative day 3. A score of each patient can be determined, and a pre-set cut-off value (unpublished data) was determined in our previous study based on the AUC analysis.&#xD;
In this study, each patient will be scored accordingly. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the cut-off value will be evaluated.</description>

        This observational study intends to include all patients undergoing gastric or colorectal&#xD;
        cancer with primary anastomosis. Because drainage fluid analysis is necessary for the&#xD;
        prediction model, patients without the tube will be excluded.&#xD;
