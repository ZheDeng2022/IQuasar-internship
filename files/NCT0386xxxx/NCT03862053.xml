      Manuka honey eye drops are used for dry eyes and blepharitis. Manuka honey has been proven to&#xD;
      be useful for eczema, atopic dermatitis, wound healing, anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory actions.&#xD;

      Ocular allergy is a condition that can affect a patient's quality of life. Symptoms of ocular&#xD;
      allergy include but are not limited to red, itchy, swollen, foreign body sensation, watery,&#xD;
      puffy or blurry eyes. irritation, redness, burning, foreign body sensation, dryness, pain and&#xD;
      blurry vision. In many cases, ocular allergic conjunctivitis are due to seasonal allergens&#xD;
      like pollen, mold or indoor allergens such as pet dander or dust mites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ocular allergy can be treated by avoidance of known allergens, reduction of allergens by use&#xD;
      of HEPA filters, cleaning linens, etc, topical decongestants, over the counter and&#xD;
      prescription topical non-steroidals, topical or oral antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers or&#xD;
      topical or oral steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manuka honey is produced by bees that are associated with the flowers of the Manuka plant&#xD;
      (Leptospermum scoparium) that grows in New Zealand. Manuka honey is different from other&#xD;
      honeys because it has been shown to the more potent due to its higher methylglyoxal&#xD;
      concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manuka honey has been used for its anti-oxidant, anti-bacteral and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties. It has been shown to be useful in healing eczematous skin lesions. This study&#xD;
      will attempt to demonstrate topical anti-allergy use for ocular allergy.&#xD;
