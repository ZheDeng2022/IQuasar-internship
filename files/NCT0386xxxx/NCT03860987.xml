      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is a common cancer among men. There are several ways to treat it, including&#xD;
      hormone blocking drugs, radiation therapy, and surgery. Researchers want to combine&#xD;
      abiraterone and enzalutamide to see if there is a better way to treat prostate cancer. They&#xD;
      also want to study a new radiotracer called 18F-DCFPyL, with the help of a scan called&#xD;
      positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to see if there is a better way to&#xD;
      detect prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop improved techniques to localize and detect prostate cancer; and to develop new&#xD;
      ways to treat prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men ages 18 and older with prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a medical evaluation to determine eligibility for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take three different medications daily by mouth and receive two&#xD;
           injections during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a medical evaluation monthly (for 6 months) while taking the&#xD;
           medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have prostate MRI and PET/CT scans before treatment, 2 months after&#xD;
           starting treatment and again before surgery. The radiotracer will be given by injection&#xD;
           about 2 hours before the whole-body scan. The PET/CT scan itself is about an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be asked to do a biopsy before treatment and 2 months after starting&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a full medical evaluation before surgery to remove their&#xD;
           prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a follow-up visit 3 months after surgery and then as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be contacted once a year for their PSA and testosterone levels for 5&#xD;
           years...&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer will present with intermediate or high-risk&#xD;
           disease, and many develop castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as curative&#xD;
           strategies are often unsuccessful&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment options typically involve radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT)&#xD;
           in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET imaging based on prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), including use of the&#xD;
           radiotracer DCFPyL, which binds PSMA, has emerged as a sensitive modality to detect&#xD;
           localized and metastatic prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is unknown how androgen-targeted therapy affects expression of the androgen-&#xD;
           regulated PSMA gene, FOLH1, and 18F -DCFPyL-PET/CT sensitivity; and, the correlation&#xD;
           between response on 18F -DCFPyL-PET/CT imaging and clinical response needs further&#xD;
           evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of highly effective androgen pathway inhibitors enzalutamide and abiraterone&#xD;
           offers an opportunity to understand the characteristics of 18F -DCFPyL-PET imaging&#xD;
           during treatment while potentially improving the cure rate of men with potentially&#xD;
           lethal localized prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There remains a great need for improved techniques to determine mechanisms of treatment&#xD;
           response and resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the feasibility of 18F -DCFPyL-PET/CT for the localization of prostate cancer&#xD;
      before, during, and after pre-operative treatment with ADT, enzalutamide, and&#xD;
      abiraterone/prednisone in patients negative for metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathologic diagnosis of castration-sensitive prostate cancer with intermediate- or high-&#xD;
           risk features and no evidence of metastases beyond N1 on conventional imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Candidates for radical prostatectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testosterone levels greater than or equal to 100 ng/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG PS 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be treated with ADT, enzalutamide, and abiraterone/prednisone for 6&#xD;
           months, followed by standard of care radical prostatectomy (RP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT and mpMRI scans prior to treatment, during months 3-5 and after 6&#xD;
           months of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate tumor biopsy (MR/US-guided) samples for research analyses at baseline and after&#xD;
           mid-treatment imaging post-month 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is anticipated that approximately 1.5 to 2 years may be required for accrual of up to&#xD;
           25 evaluable subjects.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Clinical stage T4&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must be eligible for and must be planning to undergo radical prostatectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have testosterone levels greater than or equal to 100 ng/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Men age greater than or equal to18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Children are excluded because prostate cancer is not common in pediatric populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women are not eligible because this disease occurs only in men.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. ECOG performance status 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function, and other laboratory parameters&#xD;
             as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 3 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. The effects of enzalutamide and abiraterone on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason and because androgen receptor antagonists as well as other therapeutic&#xD;
             agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, male participants and their&#xD;
             female partners of child bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence). Male participants should&#xD;
             use a condom if having intercourse with a pregnant woman. Additionally, a condom plus&#xD;
             another effective method of birth control is recommended during therapy and for 3&#xD;
             months after treatment for male participants having intercourse with a woman of&#xD;
             reproductive potential. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately and her partner should inform the study team.&#xD;

             herbal medications (within 1 day prior to registration).&#xD;
&#xD;
