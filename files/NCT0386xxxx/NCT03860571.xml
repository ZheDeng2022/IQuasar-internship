      Study type: Interventional Description of intervention(s) / exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
      For single ascending dose, five dose target ranges of BT-11 (depending on body weight the&#xD;
      doses in each cohort will be 5.9 - 7.7 mg/kg; 18.9 - 25.0 mg/kg; 44.3 - 50.0 mg/kg; 68.5 - 75&#xD;
      mg/kg and 94.2 - 100.0 mg/kg) will be evaluated, based on subject's weight on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For multiple ascending dose (once daily for 7 days), three dose target ranges of BT-11&#xD;
      (depending on body weight the doses in each cohort will be 5.9 - 7.7 mg/kg; 44.3 - 50.0&#xD;
      mg/kg; and 94.2 - 100.0 mg/kg) will be evaluated, based on subject's weight on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White tablets containing 500 mg BT-11 or matching placebo tablets will be dispensed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single ascending dose duration of administration will be once. For multiple ascending dose it&#xD;
      will be up to 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mode administration will be oral tablet. Compliance and adherence to the intervention&#xD;
      will be performed based on the tablet return, tablet not consumed by the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety monitoring committee will evaluate safety at conclusion of single ascending cohort&#xD;
      2 prior to the commencement of dosing for the multiple ascending dose.&#xD;

             sexual intercourse with pregnant or lactating women and, if sexually active with a&#xD;
             female partner, to use a condom in addition to his female partner's use of another&#xD;
             form of contraception (e.g., IUD, diaphragm, oral contraceptive, injectable&#xD;

             least one of the following forms of contraception: a diaphragm or cervical cap, or a&#xD;
             condom. Also, total abstinence, in accordance with the lifestyle of the subject, is&#xD;

             or other agent within 30 days prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
