  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and accounts&#xD;
      for nearly half of all new patients starting dialysis in Singapore, the country with the&#xD;
      highest rates of DN in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite the scale of the problem, little&#xD;
      progress has been made in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disorder and no new&#xD;
      therapies have been offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have conducted a metabolomics study of human diabetic nephropathy that&#xD;
      revealed evidence for alterations in mitochondrial fuel metabolism in patients with the&#xD;
      disease, a finding also reported in other recent studies of human DN. Based on this finding&#xD;
      the investigators believe that dysregulated mitochondrial fuel oxidation is a major driver of&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fenofibrate is an agonist of peroxisome-proliferator activating receptor (ppar)-alpha that is&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridemia alone or&#xD;
      combined in patients unresponsive to dietary and other non-drug therapeutic measures.&#xD;
      Fenofibrate is also indicated for the reduction in the progression of diabetic retinopathy in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes and existing diabetic retinopathy. Presently fenofibrate is not&#xD;
      indicated for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that treatment with fenofibrate, taken orally at 300mg per day&#xD;
      or 100mg per day for 30 days will lead to significant changes in the circulating metabolomics&#xD;
      patterns in patients with DN. The investigators propose to administer the drug for a period&#xD;
      of 30 days and will perform a comprehensive analysis of the state of fuel metabolism in these&#xD;
      patients before, and after the administration of fenofibrate using targeted metabolomics and&#xD;
      other approaches. Fundal photography, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Optical&#xD;
      Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) will also be performed at baseline and&#xD;
      post-treatment. A total of 300 subjects will be recruited from Singapore General Hospital&#xD;
      (SGH) Diabetes and Metabolic Centre. Our goal is to discover key changes in fuel metabolism&#xD;
      in DN patients receiving fenofibrate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this single-centre, open label study, 300 adults with DN will be recruited over 3 years.&#xD;
      Following screening and baseline metabolic evaluations, eligible subjects will be treated&#xD;
      with fenofibrate for 30-days and re-assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Study Visits and Procedures Subjects will have their written informed consent taken&#xD;
      during Visit 1 at the SGH Clinical Trials Research Centre (CTRC) and undergo screening and&#xD;
      baseline assessments. Eligible subjects will return within the next 14 days for the&#xD;
      initiation of study drug (Visit 2). The post-treatment and final visit (Visit 3) will take&#xD;
      place 30 ± 7 days after Visit 2. Details of study visits are described in Table 1 (Refer&#xD;
      study protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.1 VISIT 1: Informed Consent and Screening Interested patients will be scheduled for their&#xD;
      first study visit (Visit 1) at SGH CTRC. Written informed consent will be taken by the&#xD;
      principal or co-investigators assigned by the PI. After consent has been taken, study&#xD;
      procedures in Table 1 will be performed. Subject will be given a sample copy of the treatment&#xD;
      diary to familiarize them with the method to record study drug intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Visit 1, subjects will head over to Singapore Eye Research Institution (SERI)&#xD;
      or Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC)) for eye tests as mentioned in the following&#xD;
      paragraphs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundus Photography, conventional OCT and Assessment and grading of diabetic retinopathy (DR).&#xD;
      The presence and severity of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) or Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) will&#xD;
      be assessed from digital fundus photographs and OCT. Following pupillary dilation, 7-field&#xD;
      ETDRS photography using a non-mydriatic 45º fundus cameras will be obtained for each eye. The&#xD;
      modified Wisconsin protocol will be used for DR grading. DR will be considered present if any&#xD;
      characteristic lesion as defined by the ETDRS severity scale is present: microaneurysms (MA),&#xD;
      hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA), hard&#xD;
      exudates (HE), venous beading, and new vessels. For each eye, a retinopathy severity score&#xD;
      will be assigned according to a scale modified from the Airlie House classification system.&#xD;
      Macular edema is defined by hard exudates in the presence of MA and blot hemorrhage within 1&#xD;
      disc diameter from the foveal center or presence of focal photocoagulation scars in the&#xD;
      macular area. Clinically significant macular edema (CSME) is considered present when the&#xD;
      macular edema involved is within 500 mm of the foveal center or if focal photocoagulation&#xD;
      scars are present in the macular area. DR is categorized as minimal non-proliferative DR&#xD;
      (level 20), mild non-proliferative DR (level 35), moderate non-proliferative DR (level 43&#xD;
      through 47), severe Non-proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR) (level 53), and&#xD;
      proliferative retinopathy (&gt;60). Vision-threatening retinopathy is defined as the presence of&#xD;
      severe NPDR, Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR), or CSME. Presence of DME (centre&#xD;
      involving and non centre involving) and central retinal thickness will also be assessed on&#xD;
      OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrawide field (UWF) imaging Stereoscopic 200-degree-field ultrawide field images of each&#xD;
      subject will be obtained using the Optos P200MA instrument. Unlike traditional fundus&#xD;
      cameras, Optos imaging relies on proper eye positioning by the imager and correct patient&#xD;
      fixation on a target, rather than the imager viewing the retinal structures for focus. The&#xD;
      UWF200 images are centered on the fovea, covering approximately 25% and 82%, respectively, of&#xD;
      the retinal area, including the optic disc, macula, and major vascular arcades. Grading of&#xD;
      UWF imaging will be performed using the ETDRS protocol to determine the presence and severity&#xD;
      of the following lesions: hemorrhages, microaneurysms, or both (H/Ma); intraretinal&#xD;
      microvascular abnormalities (IRMA); venous beading (VB); cotton wool spots; hard exudates;&#xD;
      retinal thickening; new vessels on the disc; new vessels elsewhere (NVE) on the retina;&#xD;
      preretinal hemorrhage; vitreous hemorrhage; and traction retinal detachment. This test will&#xD;
      be optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA)&#xD;
      Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography and optical coherence tomographic angiography&#xD;
      will be performed in both eyes to obtain scans of the macular, macular thickness, retinal&#xD;
      nerve fiber thickness optic disc, and optic nerve head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.2 Initiation of Study Drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI or Co-Is assigned by the PI, will review screening results to determine whether&#xD;
      subjects are eligible to continue with the study. Eligible subjects will be prescribed the&#xD;
      study drug, fenofibrate (Trolip®). Fenofibrate is to be taken orally for 30 days, and the&#xD;
      dose of fenofibrate will be adjusted based on the estimated CrCl during Visit 1 as below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CrCl (ml/min) Fenofibrate Dosage &gt; 60 300mg/day 30-59 100 mg/day &lt; 30 Contraindicated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug and subject treatment diary will be delivered to the subjects via a third party&#xD;
      delivery service within 14 days from Visit 1. Alternatively, subjects can also return to the&#xD;
      hospital to collect their study drug and drug diary. They will also be given a treatment&#xD;
      diary to record the intake of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of medication delivery or collection, the clinical research coordinator at SGH&#xD;
      will call the subject to confirm that they have received the study drug. Subjects should not&#xD;
      take the study drug until instructed by the clinical research coordinator. The clinical&#xD;
      research coordinator will also check with subject if there is any change in their medication&#xD;
      intake and is well feeling well before intake of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be reminded to record intake of study drug into their treatment diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.3 VISIT 2: 4-Week Post-Treatment Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 will take place 30 ± 7 days from the first dose of study drug. Subjects who are still&#xD;
      on the study drug should continue take the study drug on the morning of Visit 2 with plain&#xD;
      water. Subjects will be assessed to quantify changes in metabolic fuel utilization after&#xD;
      treatment with fenofibrate. These changes are determined based on metabolomic profiling of&#xD;
      acyl-carnitines, organic acids and amino acids and the eye tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE COLLECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to a total of 47 ml (~3.2 tablespoons) of blood and 90 ml (~6.0 tablespoons) of urine will&#xD;
      be collected for the entire study. During Visit 1 (Screening), approximately 25 ml (~1.7&#xD;
      tablespoons) of blood and 30 ml (~2.0 tablespoon) of urine will be collected. During Visit 2&#xD;
      (Dosing visit), 30 ml of urine will be collected and during Visit 3 (post-treatment &amp; final&#xD;
      visit), approximately 22ml (~1.5 tablespoon) of blood and 30 ml (~2.0 tablespoon) of urine&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who developed drug-related adverse reactions may require additional blood and urine&#xD;
      taken for clinical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Blood Chemistry Screening and standard laboratory tests including full blood count,&#xD;
      Potassium, Creatinine. alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, β-human chorionic&#xD;
      gonadotropin, creatinine kinase (CK), lipid panel, glucose and HbA1c will be measured in the&#xD;
      clinical laboratory using standard methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Metabolomic Profiling Metabolomic profiling of lipids, acylcarnitines (ACs), organic acids&#xD;
      and ketones will be measured using liquid and gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry&#xD;
      (LC-MS/MS and Gas Chromatography-MS/MS) at the Duke-National University of Singapore&#xD;
      metabolomics laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACs represent intermediaries of metabolic fuel oxidation and provides a &quot;snap-shot&quot; of in&#xD;
      vivo metabolism at the cellular level. The measurement of the various long-,&#xD;
      intermediate-chain ACs provide an indicator of fatty acid oxidation efficiency. Ceramides are&#xD;
      toxic lipid intermediaries that are implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.&#xD;
      Lactate, pyruvate, succinate, fumarate, malate, alpha-ketoglutarate and citrate are organic&#xD;
      acids involved in tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. Beta hydroxybutyrate is a ketone which&#xD;
      will also be measured with the organic acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Urine Protein Excretion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine ACR and PCR will be performed to quantify urine protein excretion.&#xD;
