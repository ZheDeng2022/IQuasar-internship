    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome (MetS) adults (n = 24; 18-65 y) will be enrolled to complete a 2-arm,&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized controlled, crossover trial. They will be randomized in 4-unit&#xD;
      blocks to receive, for 14 d, a controlled diet with dairy milk (3.5% fat; 3 servings/d)&#xD;
      enriched with milk fat globule membrane (MFGM)-derived phospholipid or a matched dairy milk&#xD;
      that instead contains soy lecithin/phospholipid (control). All foods during each study period&#xD;
      will be provided to ensure weight maintenance and to increase homogeneity of gut and host&#xD;
      responses. Anthropometrics and blood pressure will be assessed at days 0, 7, and 14. Prior to&#xD;
      (day 0) and after each 2-wk arm (day 14), a fasting blood sample will be collected to assess&#xD;
      serum endotoxin and metabolic chemistries (glucose, lipids, insulin), and Toll-like receptor&#xD;
      4 /nuclear factor kappaB (TLR4/NFκB)-dependent genes from isolated peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A breath sample will be collected to assess the correlation&#xD;
      analysis of plasma metabolic biomarkers. After the 2-week intervention, from fecal samples&#xD;
      collected on day 13, the investigators will assess microbiota composition and function, short&#xD;
      chain fatty acids (SCFA), and intestinal inflammatory markers (calprotectin,&#xD;
      myeloperoxidase). On d 14, participants in the fasted state will receive a&#xD;
      high-fat/high-glucose meal challenge to induce gut-derived endotoxin translocation. At&#xD;
      30-minute intervals for 3-hour, the investigators will evaluate circulating endotoxin,&#xD;
      glucose, and insulin; TLR4/NFκB-dependent genes will be assessed from PMBCs at 0 hour and&#xD;
      3-hour. Gut permeability probes will be co-administered with the test meal challenge, and&#xD;
      24-hour urine will be collected to assess gut barrier integrity. Participants will then&#xD;
      undergo a 2-week washout prior to receiving the alternative treatment and completing all&#xD;
      procedures in an identical manner.&#xD;

      Background and hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preclinical evidence shows that phospholipid-rich milk fat globule membrane (MFGM)&#xD;
      attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced increases in gut permeability and pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines. MFGM also attenuates inflammation in association with a prebiotic and/or&#xD;
      antimicrobial activity that modulates microbiota composition. Our central hypothesis is that&#xD;
      MFGM-enriched dairy milk compared with a matched milk beverage containing soy lecithin&#xD;
      (control) decreases metabolic endotoxemia and improves glucose tolerance in metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome (MetS) adults by increasing gut barrier integrity in association with alleviating&#xD;
      gut dysbiosis and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll male and female MetS adults (n = 24; 18-65 y) to complete a&#xD;
      2-arm, double-blind, randomized controlled, crossover trial. They will be randomized in&#xD;
      4-unit blocks to receive, for 14 days, a controlled diet with dairy milk (3.5% fat; 3&#xD;
      servings/d) enriched with MFGM-derived phospholipid or a matched dairy milk that instead&#xD;
      contains coconut and palm oil (control). The investigators will provide all foods during each&#xD;
      study period to ensure weight maintenance and to increase homogeneity of gut and host&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from Columbus, OH area. Participants having no history of&#xD;
      liver or cardiovascular disease or cancer will be enrolled. They will have ≥3 established&#xD;
      criteria for MetS: i) glucose (100-126 mg/dL), ii) waist circumference (&gt;89 or &gt;102 cm for&#xD;
      F/M), iii) HDL-C (&lt;50 or &lt;40 mg/dL in F/M), iv) TG &gt;150 mg/dL, and iv) blood pressure &gt;130/85&#xD;
      mmHg. Major exclusion criteria include: unstable body mass (±2 kg over prior 3-mo)&#xD;
      vegetarian; food allergies or lactose intolerance; user of dietary supplements or probiotics&#xD;
      (within past 1-mo); pregnancy, lactation, changes in birth control (within 6-month); any&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders; chronic diarrhea; smoker; excess alcohol (&gt;2 drinks/day); excess&#xD;
      aerobic exercise (&gt;7 h/week); recent antibiotic or anti-inflammatory agent use; blood&#xD;
      pressure &gt;140/90 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Control:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be performed in the Human Nutrition Metabolic Kitchen under the auspice&#xD;
      of a registered dietitian (PI Bruno). In each 2-wk intervention, participants' diet will be&#xD;
      rigorously controlled. All foods will be prepared, packaged, and provided every 3-4 days to&#xD;
      supply a weight maintenance (i.e. eucaloric) diet. To assess compliance, participants will&#xD;
      return MFGM/coconut/palm oil milk bottles for counting and any uneaten food portions for&#xD;
      weighed measurement. Milk beverages will also be formulated to contain para-aminobenzoic acid&#xD;
      (PABA; 80 mg/milk serving). Spot urine samples will be collected 4 times during each study&#xD;
      arm coinciding when participants pick up test foods. Urinary PABA will be measured by&#xD;
      spectrophotometry. Separate from this, participants will also keep food logs to document any&#xD;
      dietary deviation. Diets will be standardized at 50-60% of energy from carbohydrate with low&#xD;
      fiber intakes (~15 g/day) similar to Americans' diets to prevent potential masking of the&#xD;
      benefits of MFGM, 15-20% from protein, and 25-30% from fat. Importantly, other than test&#xD;
      beverages provided as part of the eucaloric diet, diets will be otherwise devoid of&#xD;
      significant amounts of dairy foods, fermented products, and probiotics to prevent confounding&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometrics and blood pressure will be assessed at days 0, 7, and 14. Prior to (day 0),&#xD;
      at day 7 and after each 2-wk arm (day 14), a fasting blood sample will be collected to assess&#xD;
      serum endotoxin and metabolic chemistries (glucose, insulin, lipids (triglyceride, total and&#xD;
      HDL cholesterol), and TLR4/NFκB-dependent genes from isolated peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells (PBMCs). A breath sample will be collected to assess the correlation analysis of plasma&#xD;
      metabolic biomarkers. After the 2-week intervention, from fecal samples collected on day 13,&#xD;
      the investigators will assess microbiota composition and function, SCFAs, and intestinal&#xD;
      inflammatory markers (calprotectin, myeloperoxidase). During this period, participants will&#xD;
      also record daily stool characteristics using a 7-point Bristol Stool scale. On days 14,&#xD;
      participants in the fasted state will receive a high-fat/high-glucose meal challenge to&#xD;
      induce gut-derived endotoxin translocation. At 30-minute intervals for 3 hours, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate circulating endotoxin, glucose, and insulin; TLR4/NFκB-dependent&#xD;
      genes will be assessed from PMBCs at 0 hour and 3-hour. Gut permeability probes will be&#xD;
      co-administered with the test meal challenge, and 24-hour urine will be collected to assess&#xD;
      gut barrier integrity. Participants will then undergo a 2-week washout prior to receiving the&#xD;
      alternative treatment and completing all procedures in an identical manner.&#xD;
