  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the role of the enzyme (substance produced by the body&#xD;
      that helps in a biochemical reaction like digestion in the body) responsible for digestion of&#xD;
      lactose and the role of the gut bacteria (bacteria in the intestine) in producing symptoms of&#xD;
      lactose intolerance.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves 3 visits and will include 2 types of subjects - those who have the the&#xD;
      diagnosis of lactose intolerance (subjects) and those who do not have lactose intolerance&#xD;
      (controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, it is estimated that the research participation will add about 1 hour to your&#xD;
      planned procedure visit. At Visit 1 following will be done&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to read and sign the informed consent after all the questions&#xD;
           about the study have been answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General medical history will be taken including demographics, symptoms and history of&#xD;
           illness, and medication review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, respiration, height, and weight) will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to complete 2 questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upper endoscopy will be done as part of routine clinical care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the time of the endoscopy 4 extra biopsies (small piece of tissue) from the small&#xD;
           intestines will be taken. The biopsies will be used for research to detect the bacteria&#xD;
           and to measure the lactase enzyme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small sample of blood (10 mL) (2 teaspoons) will be taken for storage for possible&#xD;
           future testing. This will be a one time draw only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research team may contact the subjects to arrange a Visit 2 if they are interested&#xD;
           in proceeding with the next step in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 will take approximately 6 hours to complete. If the subject returns for Visit 2, they&#xD;
      will do the following&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will return to the research office at Indiana University to participate in hydrogen&#xD;
           breath test (test that uses the measurement of hydrogen in the breath to diagnose&#xD;
           several conditions) to see how the body reacts to lactose. This involves drinking milk,&#xD;
           then blowing into a bag so we can collect breath samples. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
           report any symptoms they might have during this time. This test will take approximately&#xD;
           6 hours. They will be instructed to eat a low-fiber meal the night before the test, and&#xD;
           asked to fast for the 12 hours before the test. They can drink water during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will be also be asked to provide a stool sample for future analysis. Instructions&#xD;
           for collection, storage and transportation of stool will be provided. They will be&#xD;
           provided a kit for stool collection, storage and transportation. They will be asked to&#xD;
           collect stool at home over the course of 2 days and store as per instructions. Stool&#xD;
           will need to be refrigerated and brought back to the office on ice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 will take approximately less than one hour to complete. For those who are interested&#xD;
      in returning for Visit 3,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to return to the clinic with the stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will complete the study at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who complete Aim 1 and meet further eligibility criteria for Aim 2 may be&#xD;
      contacted by research staff to return for Visit 2 (breath test). Those who are agreeable to&#xD;
      participating and are scheduled for Visit 2 will be instructed to consume a low-fiber meal&#xD;
      and fast for 12 hours prior to their breath test. We will contact the participant 24 to 48&#xD;
      hours prior to the test day as a reminder to consume a low fiber meal and fast for 12 hours.&#xD;

      degrees Celsius for long-term storage for planned small bowel microbiome analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal Microbiome:&#xD;
