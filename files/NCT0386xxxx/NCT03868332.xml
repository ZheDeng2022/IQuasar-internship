      Heart disease and failure are the major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, despite&#xD;
      significant advances in medical technologies in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease may arise for various reasons including the steadily increasing&#xD;
      incidence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, genetic, environmental, dietary and lifestyle factors.&#xD;
      Besides all these, there is much evidence suggetsing that inflammation is an important player&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of heart disease, as well as atherogenesis and atherosclerosis.&#xD;

      Heart disease and failure are the major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, despite&#xD;
      significant advances in medical technologies in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease may arise for various reasons including the steadily increasing&#xD;
      incidence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, genetic, environmental, dietary and lifestyle factors.&#xD;
      Besides all these, there is much evidence suggetsing that inflammation is an important player&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of heart disease, as well as atherogenesis and atherosclerosis(1,2).&#xD;
      Clinically, patients with rheumatologic diseases have been found to suffer from coronary&#xD;
      heart disease; thus, regular monitoring for Cardiovascular disease should be included as a&#xD;
      routine assessment for patients with rheumatologic diseases (3). A most common systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory disease is inflammatory bowel disease , which is a collection of ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis and Crohn's disease, a chronic intestinal disease that may arise due to different&#xD;
      factors, and is precipitated by environmental and genetic susceptibility (4,5). Ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis and Crohn's disease are characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation, with&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, blood and pus in stools, abdominal pain, fever&#xD;
      and weight loss. The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease is on the increase in Canada&#xD;
      (6), Europe (7) and Asia (8&#xD;
&#xD;
      ). In ulcerative colitis, inflammation is mostly limited to mucosal layer of the colon and&#xD;
      involves rectum and other parts of colon (9). On the other hand, Crohn's disease shows&#xD;
      characteristic transmural inflammation and fibrosis and occurs as patchy lesions throughout&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although inflammatory bowel disease is associated with venous vascular problems such as deep&#xD;
      venous thrombosis (11), the extent of risk for the patients with inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
      to develop Cardiovascular disease, in particular coronary artery disease is not well&#xD;
      understood. inflammatory bowel disease patients have a 2 to 3-fold higher risk of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism than the general population (12), and this risk is high during acute disease&#xD;
      flare, as active inflammation tilts the balance between pro-coagulants and anticoagulants,&#xD;
      which leads to the characteristic hypofibrinolysis seen in inflammatory bowel disease (13)&#xD;
