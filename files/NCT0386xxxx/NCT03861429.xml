  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether the Me &amp; My Wishes intervention positively&#xD;
      impacts communication of preferences among nursing home residents with dementia and their&#xD;
      family caregivers and care team.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Me &amp; My Wishes are videos of nursing home residents talking about their preferences for care,&#xD;
      including four sections: About Me, Preferences for Today, Preferences for Medical&#xD;
      Intervention and End of Life, and Afterthoughts. Knowing what residents want is essential to&#xD;
      staff's ability to provide quality care and can inform family caregivers decision making&#xD;
      especially in later stages of life as the resident's cognition declines-a time when family&#xD;
      caregivers often feel unprepared. Persons with mild to moderate dementia can accurately&#xD;
      express their everyday and EOL preferences, however, stereotypes persist about the decision&#xD;
      making abilities of people with dementia that often prevent their involvement in&#xD;
      conversations about care. The investigators propose to conduct a Stage II efficacy trial of&#xD;
      Me &amp; My Wishes-a novel approach for communicating resident care preferences-by creating&#xD;
      videos with 48-54 nursing home residents with mild to moderate dementia and sharing their&#xD;
      personalized video with informal (family) and formal (staff) caregivers. The investigators&#xD;
      will employ a randomized wait-list control design in which residents in control nursing homes&#xD;
      will delay sharing their video. Videos may be viewed two ways: 1) in resident quarterly care&#xD;
      conferences; and 2) via a web-based link with resident-identified family members or friends.&#xD;
