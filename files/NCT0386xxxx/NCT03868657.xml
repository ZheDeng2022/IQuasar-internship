    <textblock>
      The human ether-a-go-go-related gene HERG (encoding Kv11.1 potassium channels) is expressed&#xD;
      in different parts of the body including the heart, pancreas and intestines. In the heart,&#xD;
      Kv11.1 channels play a role in ending depolarization by causing repolarization.&#xD;
      Loss-of-function mutations of HERG cause long QT syndrome, a condition of elongated QT&#xD;
      interval that can lead to ventricular tachycardia, syncope and sudden death. Kv11.1 channels&#xD;
      are also found in pancreatic α- and β-cells and intestinal L-cells, where they seem to play a&#xD;
      role in the secretion of insulin, glucagon and Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1). Carriers of&#xD;
      loss-of-function mutations in the HERG gene have showed increased insulin and incretin&#xD;
      responses after glucose ingestion and decreased fasting levels of glucagon compared to&#xD;
      matched control persons. Blockade of Kv11.1 has shown to augment glucose dependent insulin&#xD;
      secretion and decrease low-glucose stimulated glucagon secretion in isolated α- and β- cells.&#xD;
      The investigators of this study hypothesize that a blockade of Kv11.1 channels will increase&#xD;
      incretin and β cell function and decrease α cell function and thus lead to lower glucose&#xD;
      levels in humans after glucose intake. To investigate this, The investigators of this study&#xD;
      will perform a randomized, cross sectional study of up to 40 healthy study participants who&#xD;
      will serve as their own controls. The study participants will undergo two 6-hours oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance tests, one after intake of a known Kv11.1 blocker (moxifloxacin) and one&#xD;
      control oral glucose tolerance test after intake of placebo. Prior to both tests the study&#xD;
      participants will wear a continuous glucose monitor and on the day of the tests they will&#xD;
      fill out a glucose questionnaire. Investigation of the physiological role of HERG in&#xD;
      metabolism may provide a better insight on metabolic regulation.&#xD;

      Background and significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) encodes Kv11.1 voltage-gated potassium channels&#xD;
      throughout different parts of the human body including the heart, pancreas and intestine.&#xD;
      Potassium channels are important for ending the depolarization by causing repolarization in&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, various mutations in HERG have effects on cardiac and metabolic functions. One known&#xD;
      example in the case of loss-of-function mutations in HERG is a reduced outward flow of&#xD;
      potassium during repolarization of the heart, leading to an elongated QT interval that can&#xD;
      lead to ventricular tachycardia, cardiac syncope and sudden death - known as the long-QT&#xD;
      syndrome (LQTS) (1, 2). LQTS caused by HERG mutations is the second most common type of LQTS&#xD;
      (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regards to metabolism, blockade of Kv11.1 has shown to augment glucose dependent insulin&#xD;
      secretion (3-5) and decrease low-glucose stimulated glucagon secretion (4) in isolated β and&#xD;
      α cells and to augment insulin secretion and reduce blood glucose in living mice(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study of 11 patients with LQTS caused by HERG mutations showed that during a 6-hour OGTT,&#xD;
      the mutation carriers experienced increased levels of insulin, GLP-1 and Gastric Inhibitory&#xD;
      Polypeptide (GIP), decreased levels of glucose and lower fasting levels of glucagon compared&#xD;
      to matched control persons(6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators wish to investigate the effects of Kv11.1 blockade on&#xD;
      incretin and insulin secretion and blood glucose levels after oral glucose intake in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question Study hypothesis The investigators of this study hypothesize that Kv11.1&#xD;
      blockade will increase the metabolic response of serum insulin and GLP-1 (AUC/30 min) to a&#xD;
      6-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To investigate the hypothesis, the investigators of this study want to examine the&#xD;
      metabolic responses of up to 40 healthy test subjects to a 6-hours 75 g OGTT. The test&#xD;
      subjects will serve as their own controls in a double-blinded crossover trial where they will&#xD;
      undergo two 6-hours OGTTs separated by a 3 weeks washout period. During one OGTT they will&#xD;
      have received moxifloxacin (800 mg/day), which is a known blocker of the Kv11.1 channel, and&#xD;
      during the other OGTT they will have received placebo. Prior to and after the test the&#xD;
      subjects will wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and at the day of the test they will&#xD;
      fill out a glucose questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moxifloxacin is solely used to cause a known and for the drug well documented effect, namely&#xD;
      blockade of the Kv11.1 channel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled double-blinded crossover trial with up to 40 healthy participants,&#xD;
      who will serve as their own controls. Study design is outlined in figure 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit (V0): At the screening visit, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be screened to assess their eligibility (anamnesis, weight/height measurements and&#xD;
           12-lead electrocardiography (ECG)). If found eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be instructed to have a CGM monitor placed 4 days prior to test visit 1 (V1) for up to 7&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be randomized to either group A or B by a qualified unblinded person from the Department&#xD;
           of Biomedical Sciences, University of Copenhagen:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group A will first receive the active drug known to have Kv11.1 blockade effects&#xD;
                (Moxifloxacin, 800 mg/day) 3 days prior to test visit 1 and then - after a 3 weeks&#xD;
                wash-out period - receive a placebo drug prior to test visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group B will first receive the placebo drug 3 days prior to test visit 1 and then -&#xD;
                after a 3 weeks wash-out period - receive the active drug prior to test visit 2.&#xD;
                Receive the drug for test visit 1 (Kv11.1 blocker or placebo) and be instructed to&#xD;
                orally administer the drug every morning at 6.00 AM 3 days prior to and at the same&#xD;
                morning as the test visit (V1). The unblinded person will make sure to provide the&#xD;
                right drug to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test visit 1 (V1): Participants will meet fasting since 10.00 PM the previous evening at 8.00&#xD;
      AM at the Department for Biomedical Sciences, University of Copenhagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participants will hand in a urine and fecal sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 75 g 6-hours oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be performed. Crushed&#xD;
           paracetamol, 1 g is added to the glucose mixture. Blood samples and ECGs will be drawn&#xD;
           and collected together. Blood samples of 8 ml will be drawn at -20, -10, -0 minutes&#xD;
           before and at 8, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300,&#xD;
           330, and 360 minutes after the glucose intake. All blood samples will be analyzed for&#xD;
           hormones, glucose, electrolytes, plasma paracetamol, proteomics and metabolomics and&#xD;
           from the -20 minutes sample DNA material will be extracted and used for genome analysis&#xD;
           (not an extensive genome sequencing). The samples will be tested for mutations in genes&#xD;
           associated with glucose metabolism in relation to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular&#xD;
           disease. HbA1c and lipids will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose questionnaires. Wash-out period: There will be a wash-out period of 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will come in and have a CGM monitor placed 4 days prior to test visit 2&#xD;
           (V2) for up to 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive the drug (Kv11.1 blocker or placebo) and start to orally&#xD;
           administer the drug every morning at the same time3 days prior to and at the same&#xD;
           morning as the test visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test visit 2 (V2): Same examinations as described for Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for when tests can be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants have to have orally administered the study medication 3 days prior to and&#xD;
           at the same morning as the test visits at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants have to be fasting from 10hours before test visits. This includes foods,&#xD;
           liquids, smoking, alcohol and medication (except Kv11.1 blocker and a small amount of&#xD;
           water used for administration hereof)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants are not allowed to perform any exercise the day before as well as the same&#xD;
           morning as the test visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant are not allowed to take paracetamol 24 hours before test visits. Unblinding:&#xD;
           The randomization list will be stored on site at the Department of Biomedical Sciences&#xD;
           at the University of Copenhagen. Subject number of the trial participant is matched with&#xD;
           the list, which reveals to what group the participant is randomized. The unblinded&#xD;
           person will perform any unblinding of the trial participants after Last Patient Last&#xD;
           Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Data management: The subject and the biological material obtained from the subject will&#xD;
      be identified by subject number and trial identification number. Appropriate measures such as&#xD;
      encryption or deletion will be enforced to protect the identity of human subjects in all&#xD;
      presentations and publications as required by national requirements. Laboratory data will be&#xD;
      transferred electronically from the laboratory performing clinical analyses and will be&#xD;
      archived in secured hard drives with backup options. The electronic data will be considered&#xD;
      source data. In cases where laboratory data is transferred via non-secure electronic&#xD;
      networks, data will be encrypted during transfer. Data is saved for 20 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data: Source documents will be kept at the Department of Biomedical Sciences,&#xD;
      University of Copenhagen. Source data registered directly in the Case Report Form (CRF)&#xD;
      include anamnesis, weight and height measurements, ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluability for subjects for analysis: Withdrawn subjects will be replaced. Rescreening is&#xD;
      allowed within the recruitment period, at the Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations Data analysis plan: To investigate whether Kv11.1 blockade&#xD;
      significantly effects fasting and glucose-stimulated values of serum insulin and plasma&#xD;
      glucagon, GLP-1, potassium and GIP concentrations, an ANOVA will be performed using age and&#xD;
      sex as covariate, randomization group as independent variable and AUC change in serum insulin&#xD;
      and plasma glucagon, GLP-1, potassium and GIP concentrations as dependent variables to&#xD;
      examine if mean differences exist on study participants after intake of Kv11.1 blocker and&#xD;
      without Kv11.1 blocker.&#xD;
