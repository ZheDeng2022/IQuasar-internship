  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, unblinded, randomized study. The aim of this study is to research&#xD;
      whether preoperative and postoperative oral nutritional supplement (ONS) (Resource 2.5&#xD;
      Compact/fibre compact) used at least 2 weeks prior the surgery and 10 days after surgery can&#xD;
      improve the nutritional status of a colon cancer patient and reduce number of complications.&#xD;
      The aim is also to investigate whether the oral nutritional support can shorten the hospital&#xD;
      stay and improve the patients´ quality of life. The aim is also to find out whether the oral&#xD;
      nutritional support can reduce 90-day mortality and improve disease free and overall&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients diagnosed with primary adenocarcinoma of the colon who are considered&#xD;
      for radical surgical procedure are enrolled in this study provided that the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria are filled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group start oral nutritional support (ONS)2 portions a day for&#xD;
      about 2 weeks prior to the operation starting at the time of randomization and continue ONS&#xD;
      10 days after the operation. Control group will continue with their regular diet without ONS&#xD;
      until the operation. Both groups keep a food diary for 4 days right after the randomization&#xD;
      and both one month and three months after the operation to assess the energy and nutrient&#xD;
      intakes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory markers, NRS 2002, quality of life questionnaire, exercise questionnaire,&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and handgrip strength as well as body composition on&#xD;
      computer tomography scan are assessed prior to any treatment or supplement in order to&#xD;
      estimate the patients' well-being and nutritional status prior to surgical operation.&#xD;
      Laboratory parameters and QoL questionnaire are repeated right before the operation on&#xD;
      admission to hospital as well as about 30 and 90 days after the operation in addition to BIA,&#xD;
      handgrip strength to assess the effect of nutritional support. Data on complications,&#xD;
      infections, length of stay in the hospital and mortality are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another arm in this research is to discover more information on biological markers in colon&#xD;
      cancer and cancer related malnutrition thus providing targets for future treatment and&#xD;
      prognostic predictors. Tissue samples are collected during this research at the surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Perioperative ONS decreases surgery related morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perioperative ONS increases the quality of life after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perioperative ONS decreases the length of stay in institutional care&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Perioperative ONS decreases 90-day mortality and improve 5-year survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Perioperative ONS benefits the patients to tolerate the adjuvant chemotherapy with less&#xD;
           side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Perioperative ONS protects patients from postoperative nutritional depletion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point is to investigate whether the preoperative oral nutritional support&#xD;
      decreases the number of complications during the 30-day follow up after the surgery.&#xD;
      Secondary end points are to study the effect of oral nutritional support on quality of life&#xD;
      after surgery, length of hospital stay, disease free and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients having a surgery for adenocarcinoma of the colon are randomized on their&#xD;
      preoperative visit in the outpatient clinic about 2-3 weeks prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are randomized in two different groups according to NRS-2002 results. Both&#xD;
      groups contain equal number of patients with normally nourished patients (NRS-2002 1-2) and&#xD;
      malnourished patients by NRS 3 or more. NRS &gt;5 patients are excluded (nutritional support is&#xD;
      recommended before the surgery). The control group (group 1) will continue their regular&#xD;
      diet. The study group (group 2) will get preoperative nutritional support two weeks before&#xD;
      the operation and the nutritional support will continue 10 days after the operation. The&#xD;
      control group will continue their regular diet after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the randomization groups will be (total number of patients 318):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. no oral nutritional support (control group) n=159&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. pre and postoperative oral nutritional support (intervention group) n=159&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative assessment and data-collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients attending this study have a visit in the out-patient clinic 2-3 weeks prior the&#xD;
      surgery. The height and weight are measured at the baseline. 3 and 6 months previous weights&#xD;
      recalled by patient. ASA (The American Society of Anesthesiologists) classification is&#xD;
      estimated by anesthesiologist. Whole body computer tomography is done to assess the&#xD;
      possibility of metastases or locally spread cancer. Laboratory markers including total blood&#xD;
      count, CRP (C-reactive protein) , creatinine, sodium, potassium, albumin, prealbumin, HbA1c,&#xD;
      CEA (Carcinoembryonic antigen), transferrin and lipids (LDL, HDL, triglycerides)&#xD;
      concentration are measured. History of smoking, alcohol consumption and other diseases and&#xD;
      medications are recorded. NRS-2002 questionnaire is filled, as well as QoL- questionnaire and&#xD;
      exercise questionnaire. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (InBody) and handgrip strength are&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory parameters, as described above, are measured at the time of randomization, at&#xD;
      admission to hospital on the morning of surgery, leaving the hospital and about 1 and 3&#xD;
      months and 1,2 and 5 years after surgery. BMI, hand grip strength, bioelectrical impedance&#xD;
      analysis are collected and the patients fill the QoL-questionnaire and exercise questionnaire&#xD;
      at the same time points. The side effects of chemotherapy are monitored, as well as&#xD;
      discontinuation of chemotherapy. Complication form will be filled when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow- up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be same as other colon cancer patients. The follow.up will continue 5 years&#xD;
      and the only difference is 3 month phone call. Patients will also fill exercise and quality&#xD;
      of life forms and bioimpedance and handgrip strength will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First follow up visit after the surgery is at the outpatient clinic 1 month after the&#xD;
      surgery. At that time patient is interviewed about recovery from surgery, patients who went&#xD;
      to health care center to recover from surgery are asked about the length of stay and possible&#xD;
      complications after leaving the hospital. The patients´ fill the 4-day food diary, exercise&#xD;
      questionnaire and QoL questionnaire (RAND-36). The blood samples are taken. Bioelectrical&#xD;
      impedance analysis and handgrip strength are measured as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second follow up at 3 months after the surgery is by phone. Then the recovery from surgery is&#xD;
      checked, as well as patients are asked to keep 4-day food diary. The blood samples are&#xD;
      collected. Patients fill quality of life and exercise questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have CEA, hemoglobin, leucocyte count and thrombocyte count measured every 3 months&#xD;
      until 2 years, and every 6 months until 5 months on a routine basis. Whole body CT scan is&#xD;
      done in a year after the surgery. There are also follow up CT scans at the oncology clinic on&#xD;
      patients who receive adjuvant therapy. They will be utilized for analysis on recovery from&#xD;
      the sarcopenia and its effect on survival and toxicity of chemotherapy. There are routine&#xD;
      hospital visits 1,2 and 5 years after the surgery. Laboratory parameters, BMI, bioelectrical&#xD;
      impedance analysis and handgrip strength are measures at each visit. The patients fill the&#xD;
      QoL questionnaire and exercise questionnaire also at each time points. charlson comorbidity&#xD;
      index and who classification are also marked.&#xD;
