  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the performance of Masimo's SedLine and the comparator's&#xD;
      device systems during surgery. Relative accuracy of the individual depth of sedation indices&#xD;
      will be compared.&#xD;

    <measure>Comparison of sedation indices performance across anesthesia range</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Using the drugs and the sedation score recorded during the surgery, the relative performance/correlation would be computed for both PSi and the comparator's sedation index. This correlation may be computed for various stages of sedation/anesthesia levels (induction, maintenance and recovery).</description>

    <measure>Comparison of sedation indices performance during EMG</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation will be computed when EMG is present in the EEG signal. Masimo and competitor's EMG detection algorithm may be used to detect EMG presence in EEG.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of sedation indices performance during Burst Suppression State</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation will be computed when burst supression is present in the EEG signal. Masimo and competitor's burst supression detection algorithm may be used to detect burst supression presence in EEG.</description>

    <description>Using the drugs and the sedation score recorded during the surgery, the relative performance/correlation would be computed for both PSi and the comparator's sedation index from the aging brain ( 70-90 years). This correlation may be computed for various stages of sedation/anesthesia levels (induction, maintenance and recovery).</description>
