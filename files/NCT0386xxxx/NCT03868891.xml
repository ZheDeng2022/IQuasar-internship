  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevation of the soft palate (the soft part of the roof of the mouth) during swallowing helps&#xD;
      the Eustachian tube to open and keep the ear healthy. (The Eustachian tube is the normal tube&#xD;
      running from the middle ear to the back of the nose and throat). When the soft palate does&#xD;
      not move enough (due to a history of cleft palate or for unknown reasons), this can lead to&#xD;
      speech problems. Also, because the Eustachian tube is not opening enough, fluid can&#xD;
      accumulate in the middle ear, which requires treatment with ear tubes. The goal of this&#xD;
      research study is to determine if soft palate exercises will help improve the ability of the&#xD;
      soft palate to close the area between the throat and nose, like it is supposed to during&#xD;
      speech and swallowing, and if this improves Eustachian tube opening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will look at the feasibility and effect of device-assisted soft palate exercises&#xD;
      for the treatment of chronic Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction (ETD) in older children still&#xD;
      experiencing middle-ear disease. Children with or without cleft palate (CP) with ventilation&#xD;
      tubes (VTs) will be evaluated for the function of the soft palate and the ET. Subjects with&#xD;
      active muscular ETD and inadequate soft palate closure will be prescribed soft palate&#xD;
      strengthening exercises for at least 2 months. The objective of the study is to demonstrate&#xD;
      the effect of exercises on soft palate closure and ETF. This pilot study will enroll 30&#xD;
      children between ages 6-17 years with VTs or post-VT extrusion tympanic membrane (TM)&#xD;
      perforations. All 30 children will have ETD, with active muscular dysfunction. 15 subjects&#xD;
      will have a history of cleft palate (CP) and 15 no history of CP. Subjects will undergo&#xD;
      history, physical examination including an ENT exam, video-otoscopy and ET function testing&#xD;
      which may include Forced Response Test (FRT), Inflation-Deflation Test (IDT) and&#xD;
      Tubomanometry. They will also undergo evaluations for swallow, speech and soft palate&#xD;
      function. Enrolled children will then receive instruction on the use their EMST150 exercise&#xD;
      device. This device will be used daily for at least 2 months. Subjects will undergo full&#xD;
      evaluations for ET function and velopharyngeal incompetence after the 2-month treatment and&#xD;
      will then discontinue the use of devices for at least 2 months. After this time, the same&#xD;
      testing will be done. Weekly phone calls/emails/texts from study staff will encourage use of&#xD;
      the devices as prescribed.&#xD;

    <description>The EMST150 consists of a handheld plastic tube with a mouthpiece on one end and an adjustable valve on the other end. Your child will close his/her lips around the mouthpiece and breathe out against resistance. The EMST150 will be adjusted to the point where airflow stops. Each day, your child will blow into the EMST150 5 sets of 5 times with a 10-15 second rest between each use and a 1-2 minute rest between each set of 5. You will adjust the resistance of the device each week, take a picture of the device settings, and document exercise sets performed in an exercise diary. These exercises will be performed twice in each nostril 2 times a day until your child's next visit at the MEPL (at least 8 weeks). Each session should take approximately 10-15 minutes, for a total of 30 minutes per day.</description>
