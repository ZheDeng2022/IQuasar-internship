    <textblock>
      Investigators wishes to influence the gut microbiota in patients with alcoholic liver disease&#xD;
      in a randomized controlled clinical trial. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      alcohol-related dysbiosis seen in these patients can be changed and disease progression&#xD;
      haltered by modulating microbiota with probiotics during 24 weeks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic alcohol overuse is associated with increased gut permeability and in addition, the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota changes qualitatively (dysbiosis) and quantitatively (bacterial&#xD;
      overgrowth) in alcoholic liver disease in favour of a microbiota with increased invasive&#xD;
      potential. As a consequence, an increased load of bacterial products is transported to the&#xD;
      liver leading to inflammation and fibrogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cross talk between the intestinal microbiota and the liver constitute a gut-liver axis,&#xD;
      which is increasingly recognized as key mechanism in the progression of liver disease and&#xD;
      pathogenesis of liver related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the gut microbiota and its metabolites are major drivers&#xD;
      of fibrosis in human liver disease and that modulating the intestinal flora by Profermin® (a&#xD;
      food for special medical purposes) will modulate the alcohol related dysbiotic signatures in&#xD;
      the microbiota which may halter disease progression by reducing activity of hepatic stellate&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary supplements that alter the microbiome towards a more beneficent type may improve&#xD;
      liver inflammation and thus be a better alternative than supplements that simply add&#xD;
      nutrients. Investigators expect that the trial will provide proof-of-concept for a&#xD;
      sustainable dietary strategy in liver fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examples of biopsies which did not meet quality criteria for reliable histological reading,&#xD;
      led to inclusion of 16 extra patients. In total we included 56 patients to ensure an adequate&#xD;
      number of participants with valid liver biopsy data for assessment of the primary endpoint&#xD;
      and intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Fresubin® is a standard FSMP and will be used as control product. Since Profermin Plus® is a disease-specific FSMP, the documentation must prove an effect that cannot be achieved by modification of the normal diet alone or by standard FSMP's. Therefor the comparator must be a standard FSMP, i.e. a nutritionally complete FSMP with standard nutrient formulation, which may constitute the sole source of nourishment of a person, hence the reason for using Fresubin® as comparator.</description>
