  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maxillofacial Distraction Osteogenesis (DO) has a lot of draw backs; mostly related to long&#xD;
      distraction and consolidation time. Rapid rate DO was proposed to decrease the distraction&#xD;
      time to avoid consequences of long procedure. The idea of the current study is to provide&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in form of Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate (BMAC) during rapid&#xD;
      distraction to fasten and shorten consolidation. Methods: This trial was conducted on&#xD;
      patients requiring mandibular DO. Patients were divided in two groups; control group in which&#xD;
      distraction took place at a rate of 1.5 mm /day without any enhancement and study group in&#xD;
      which distraction took place at rate of 1.5 mm /day and the distracted bone was enhanced by&#xD;
      BMAC&#xD;

      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective case-control trial was conducted on patients requiring mandibular distraction&#xD;
      osteogenesis to assess the effect of BMAC on distracted bone quality. Evaluation of newly&#xD;
      formed bone quantity and quality was done using a CBCT which was done post distractor removal&#xD;
      as a part of routine follow up ( in agreement with European guidelines for the exposure to&#xD;
      ionizing radiation) and evaluation of the bone quality was assessed by two examiners to&#xD;
      provide interexaminer-reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the effect of BMAC on bone maturation and possibility of early removal&#xD;
      of the distractor; which was not feasible in the clinical study due to the ethical concerns.&#xD;
      Mechanical three point bending was applied on distracted mandible after 30 days following&#xD;
      distraction to evaluate bone healing and mechanical strength of distracted bone. In addition&#xD;
      to histological and radiographic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient grouping and anesthetic technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective case-control trial was conducted on patients requiring mandibular distraction&#xD;
      osteogenesis. The research was reviewed by the ethical committee of author faculty. Patients&#xD;
      were randomly allocated into one of the two groups (To avoid bias, each patient had a number,&#xD;
      and this number was picked by the examiners (similar to a deck of shuffled cards) to assign&#xD;
      the patient to his/her specific group. Control group (6 patients): control group in which&#xD;
      distraction took place at a rate of 1.5 mm /day till planned length was obtained and only&#xD;
      saline was injected in defect; based on the assumption that it has no effect on bone healing.&#xD;
      Study group in which distraction took place at rate of 1.5 mm /day till planned length was&#xD;
      obtained. Distracted bone was enhanced by injection of Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate&#xD;
      (BMAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia was induced with IV propofol (Aspen, Ireland), 1.5-2 mg/kg, fentanyl (ADVANZ&#xD;
      Pharma, United Kingdom) 1.3 Î¼/kg and succinyl choline (Aspen, Ireland) 1mg/kg to facilitate&#xD;
      nasotracheal intubation using armored tube. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (AbbVie&#xD;
      Ltd, United Kingdom) in oxygen and atracurium (Accord-UK Ltd, United Kingdom) in a dose of&#xD;
      0.3-0.6 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMAC preparation and harvesting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMAC was harvested using the Ficoll protocol. Bone marrow was collected the iliac crest using&#xD;
      bone marrow trocar. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was added to the aspirated bone marrow in&#xD;
      a 4:1 ratio. The diluted bone marrow was titrated over Ficoll 400 (BIOCOLL; Biochrom GmbH,&#xD;
      Germany), and the solution was centrifuged at a rate of 2,000 rpm for 20 minutes. The buffy&#xD;
      layer pellet, which is rich in BMMSCs, was collected using a pipette. The Aspirated BMAC rich&#xD;
      with MSCs was added to tissue culture flasks for till day 10 consolidation in DMEM (Thermo&#xD;
      Fisher Scientific, United States) and high streptomycin-penicillin concentrate 10,000 U/mL&#xD;
      (Sigma-Aldrich, United States); to be stored at -80 0C till injection at day 10 consolidation&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure An intraoal incision was performed similar to bilateral sagittal split&#xD;
      osteotomy in the last molar area area to expose the mandibular body. A piezotome was used&#xD;
      with copious saline irrigation; to perform the corticotomy to avoid nerve injury. The&#xD;
      osteotomy was completed using a chisel and a mallet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bi-directional distractor was fixed using four 2.0 extra oral pins. Trial activation and&#xD;
      deactivation were performed in operation room to be sure of osteotomy completion before wound&#xD;
      closure. A topical antibacterial mouth was used throughout the entire distraction and&#xD;
      consolidation period to decrease the risk of infection Postoperative phase and distraction&#xD;
      protocol A topical antibacterial mouth was used throughout the entire distraction and&#xD;
      consolidation period to decrease the risk of infection. Amoxicillin 875 mg. /clavulanic acid&#xD;
      125 mg (Augmentin, GSK, United Kingdom) capsules twice daily for five days to decrease risk&#xD;
      of infection. Ibuprofen 600 mg (Mylan Products Limited, United Kingdom) Tablets twice daily&#xD;
      for three days to control pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distraction phase was performed after 5 days of latency. The rate was 1.5 mm per day till the&#xD;
      planned chin position was achieved. In the study group, after 10 days of distraction, the&#xD;
      prepared BMAC ( the average number of cells was 3 million) were injected in the distraction&#xD;
      gap using an 18-gauge needle on days 10 of the consolidation. The control group had no&#xD;
      enhancement and was considered as a negative control. The study and control groups underwent&#xD;
      6 months of consolidation after then the distractor pins were removed and CBCT was performed&#xD;
      to evaluate the distraction procedure. In addition to the CBCT evaluation of distraction&#xD;
      results the distracted bone maturation was evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of assessment Using the CBCT (iCAT, USA) DICOM files evaluation of bone density was&#xD;
      performed (at a fixed exposure value 84 Kv, 4 mA and 12 Sec ) to evaluate bone quality post&#xD;
      distraction. Evaluation was done at three points located between pins marks. The first&#xD;
      evaluation was done in exact center and other two readings were done 2mm before and 2mm after&#xD;
      the central reading in the CT and average was calculated. Two examiners did evaluation to&#xD;
      avoid bias and inter examiner reliability was measured to assess accuracy of the measurements&#xD;
