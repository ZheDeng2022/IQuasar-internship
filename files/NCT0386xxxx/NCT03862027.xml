  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to demonstrate that use of transpulmonary pressure to guide PEEP&#xD;
      management is safe in patients with possible elevations of intracranial pressure.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose: To establish safety of titrating PEEP based on transpulmonary pressure as measured&#xD;
      by an esophageal balloon in mechanically ventilated neurosurgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Adult patients admitted to the Neuro ICU at UNC Hospital and requiring&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation who have an intracranial pressure monitoring device in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): All enrolled patients will have esophageal balloons placed with&#xD;
      measurement of transpulmonary pressures. All patients will have baseline measurements&#xD;
      recorded of intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and cerebral autoregulation.&#xD;
      PEEP will then be titrated based on transpulmonary pressure measurements with recording of&#xD;
      physiological measurements over the next hour. At the conclusion of the hour, all patients&#xD;
      will be returned to their prior ventilator settings.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in ICP Value</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 5 minutes of catheter placement</time_frame>
    <description>The Intracranial pressure (ICP) value after intervention will be considered equivalent to the ICP before intervention if the 95% upper bound of the change is lower than the non-inferiority margin of 4 mm Hg.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before and 5 minutes after ventilator setting change</time_frame>
    <description>Cerebral perfusion pressure is equal to the mean arterial pressure (MAP) minus the intracranial pressure (ICP). The initial CPP is calculated by measuring CPP immediately before changing ventilator settings. The post-intervention CPP is measured 5 minutes after ventilator setting change is made. The difference between the initial CPP and the post-intervention CPP reflects the change in CPP.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean Arterial Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before and 5 minutes after ventilator setting change</time_frame>
    <description>Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is the average arterial pressure in one cardiac cycle measured through an arterial line.</description>

        <title>Change in Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP)</title>
        <description>Cerebral perfusion pressure is equal to the mean arterial pressure (MAP) minus the intracranial pressure (ICP). The initial CPP is calculated by measuring CPP immediately before changing ventilator settings. The post-intervention CPP is measured 5 minutes after ventilator setting change is made. The difference between the initial CPP and the post-intervention CPP reflects the change in CPP.</description>

            <title>Esophageal Balloon Catheter</title>
            <description>All patients will have an esophageal balloon catheter inserted into their nare while upright (head of bed &gt; 30 degrees) to a depth slightly more than the estimated distance from the lower sternum to the back of the ear (typically around 60 cm). Gastric positioning will be confirmed with abdominal compression testing and the catheter then retracted 10 - 20 cm into the lower esophagus. Placement will be confirmed with the presence of cardiac oscillations on the esophageal probe. The probe will then be secured to the patient's nasal opening using tape.&#xD;
Esophageal Balloon catheter: Pressures [Esophageal Pressure (Pes), Airway Pressure (Paw), and Transpulmonary Pressure (Ptp)] are measured directly through the ventilator. The waveforms of Paw, Pes, and Ptp will be visualized on the ventilator. Ptp is obtained from Paw - Pes. All patients will have baseline measurements recorded of ICP, CPP, and MAP.&#xD;
PEEP will be increased on the ventilator to achieve a Ptp between 0 and +2 cm H2O (&quot;Optimal PEEP&quot;).&#xD;
Measurements of Intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) will be repeated 5 minutes after the change in PEEP.</description>
