    <textblock>
      This study is designed to enhance the understanding of the possible health effects of&#xD;
      e-cigarette use by relating the acute and long-term use of e-cigarettes and conventional&#xD;
      cigarettes (&quot;products&quot;) to well-validated cardiovascular and pulmonary disease biomarkers.&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in 3 groups: exclusive e-cigarette users, exclusive cigarette&#xD;
      smokers, and a control group of never-users. Participants can expect up to 4 weeks of study&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      E-cigarette use is increasing rapidly in the United States, especially amongst youth,&#xD;
      underscoring the vital need to improve understanding of its health risks. Relevant data could&#xD;
      inform policy, guide public health and clinical intervention efforts, and inform individuals&#xD;
      who might use or who are using this product. This research will significantly enhance the&#xD;
      understanding of the possible health effects of e-cigarette use by relating the acute and&#xD;
      long-term use of e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes (&quot;products&quot;) to well-validated&#xD;
      cardiovascular and pulmonary disease biomarkers. 3 different &quot;use-groups&quot; of participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled: exclusive e-cigarette users (n=165), exclusive cigarette smokers (n=165),&#xD;
      and a &quot;control&quot; group of never-users (n=110). These groups reflect the primary decisions that&#xD;
      people can make regarding their future tobacco use: to continue to smoke cigarettes, to&#xD;
      switch to e-cigarettes, or to avoid tobacco use entirely. It is essential that smokers and&#xD;
      health care providers have accurate information on the health effect of these choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Additionally,100 participants will be invited to be part of an epigenetics sub-study (50&#xD;
      E-cig users, 25 smokers and 25 controls), prior to smoking, an additional 16 ml of blood will&#xD;
      be collected in Vacutainer CPTTM cell separation tubes for PBMC Isolation containing sodium&#xD;
      citrate.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product use will be related to well-validated biomarkers that sensitively and reproducibly&#xD;
      reflect mechanisms, injury, and/or future risk related to cardiovascular or pulmonary&#xD;
      disease. Biomarkers will be related to: 1) acute product use in the laboratory (exposure&#xD;
      challenges), 2) lifetime history of product use, and/or 3) real-time measures of product use&#xD;
      in participants' daily lives. The primary cardiovascular biomarkers are brachial artery&#xD;
      flow-mediated dilation (a measure of endothelial function) and carotid intima-media&#xD;
      thickness, a measure of subclinical arterial injury and atherosclerosis. The primary&#xD;
      pulmonary disease biomarkers will be measures of lung volumes and flow rates (FEV1, FVC,&#xD;
      FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75) obtained by spirometry. Treadmill exercise stress testing will be&#xD;
      performed (to assess aerobic fitness), electrocardiography (to measure heart rate&#xD;
      variability, HRV), and measure heart rate, blood pressure, lipids, HgbA1c, and&#xD;
      inflammation/oxidation markers (leukocyte count, C-reactive protein, urinary F2 isoprostanes&#xD;
      and exhaled nitric oxide). This research will show how product use-groups differ in response&#xD;
      to acute product use and long-term use as they are related to key cardiovascular and&#xD;
      pulmonary biomarkers. Objective measures of product use include exhaled CO and plasma&#xD;
      nicotine/cotinine and urinary nicotine/cotinine concentrations. History of product use within&#xD;
      use-groups will be related to biomarker status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will yield vital and comprehensive data regarding product use,&#xD;
      subclinical arterial injury, atherosclerosis burden, arterial and pulmonary function, cardiac&#xD;
      and aerobic fitness, cardiac autonomic regulation, systemic and pulmonary inflammation, and&#xD;
      oxidative stress, as well as other key outcomes. These data will serve as a foundation for&#xD;
      future longitudinal investigations of e-cigarette health effects and will inform public&#xD;
      policy decisions, clinical intervention, and patient guidance regarding e-cigarettes.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Our specific plan begins with the creation of a data archive with coded information in computer-readable form for distribution to the scientific community using the procedures outlined below. The information will include a codebook containing definitions of variables, variable field locations, summary statistics and any standard scoring information. Final data sets will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing (the release of a limited data set containing one or more specific identifiers would be considered if absolutely required by the researcher and if the request meets all UW, IRB and OHRP policies). We will make the final de-identified study dataset available by request from other researchers in a timely manner (in accord with NHLBI policy). We will make all key variables available via posting of final data codebook and dataset in suitable archives. All shared variables and datasets will be de-identified and approved for sharing by the UW IRB.</ipd_description>
