    <time_frame>Baseline (Day decision was made to implant XEN 45 Gel Stent) to approximately 51 Months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a drug whether or not it is considered related to drug. AESI include: Glaucoma, defined as damage to optic nerve with progressive vision loss, Intraocular hypertension, defined as IOP without meeting criteria for glaucoma, Hypotony, defined as low IOP ≤5 mmHg, Cataract or lens opacities, Ocular bleeding or hemorrhage, Retinal detachment, tear or hole, Vitreous detachment, Infection vs. Non-infection related Ocular inflammation, Significant vitreous loss, Mechanical failure of device and implant misplacement, Implant dislocation. Data of AESIs are presented based on eyes for this outcome measure.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a drug whether or not it is considered related to drug. AESI include: Glaucoma, defined as damage to optic nerve with progressive vision loss, Intraocular hypertension, defined as IOP without meeting criteria for glaucoma, Hypotony, defined as low IOP ≤5 mmHg, Cataract or lens opacities, Ocular bleeding or hemorrhage, Retinal detachment, tear or hole, Vitreous detachment, Infection vs. Non-infection related Ocular inflammation, Significant vitreous loss, Mechanical failure of device and implant misplacement, Implant dislocation. Data of AESIs are presented based on eyes for this outcome measure.</description>
