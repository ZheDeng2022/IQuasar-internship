  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with suspicious breast lesions by mammography will undergo fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration (FNA) under ultrasound guidance. The FNA will be read by the cytopathologist and&#xD;
      analyzed in the breast cancer detection cartridge. All patients will receive standard of care&#xD;
      (Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy and diagnosis). We will also receive FNA collected from&#xD;
      60 patients with palpable lesions in South Africa and analyze them samples in our lab with&#xD;
      the same method.&#xD;

Fine needle aspiration: Fine needle aspiration is a type of biopsy procedure to diagnose suspicious lesions. After giving numbing medicine, a thin needle is inserted into the breast to obtain a sample. This procedure is followed by the standard of care and will last about 10 minutes. The sample will be analyzed by a diagnostic cartridge and by the cytopathologist.&#xD;
Cancer Detection cartridge: The Cancer Detection cartridge has the ability to measure methylated gene changes in breast cells. The device will not be in contact with the patients. The FNA samples will be smeared on a slide which will be placed into the cartridge for analysis.</description>

      <desc>The only intervention is FNA, which is immediately preceded by a core needle biopsy. Thus the cause, FNA vs core biopsy, of the AE will be impossible to determine. Via phone 1-2 days post-procedure and again 10-14 days post-procedure, patients were asked about any bruising and pain, but could report other symptoms if any. Please note only the 62 Johns Hopkins patients were called; the remaining 54 South African patients were not followed for AEs by this study team.</desc>
