  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is expected to demonstrate that during experimental days of seated computer work&#xD;
      sustained and focalized low-level muscle activity contributes to the development of&#xD;
      long-lasting fatigue effects (and thus possible disorder). On days with and without frequent&#xD;
      interruptions, signs of fatigue and the activity pattern of the trapeze muscle are registered&#xD;
      and compared using electromyographic registrations of the trapezius muscle.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      30 healthy adults without chronic neck pain participated in a laboratory study designed to&#xD;
      simulate two full workdays of computer work. Within each session, participants performed five&#xD;
      50-min working activities separated by 10-min breaks: i) Use a computer keyboard to type a&#xD;
      text presented on the left side of the screen; ii) do the typing task with the desk height&#xD;
      set10 cm above elbow height; iii) play the computer game Spider Solitaire implemented in&#xD;
      Windows 10; iv) Stroop test (This test consists of reading the name of a color whose text is&#xD;
      in a color different from the name. The color name was then selected from a multiple-choice&#xD;
      panel displaying color names; v) the same online puzzle game was presented to all&#xD;
      participants. Assembling the puzzle was performed by drag and drop actions. The work periods&#xD;
      were not disrupted (on the &quot;control day&quot;) whereas two short interruptions of 5-min were&#xD;
      introduced at 1/3 and 2/3 of each working period on the &quot;intervention day&quot;. During these&#xD;
      interruptions, participants were asked to perform &quot;muscle disrupting/relaxing&quot; activities.&#xD;
      For each experimental session a 30-min lunch break took place between the third and the&#xD;
      fourth work periods. The specific sequence of work activity type and disrupting/relaxing&#xD;
      activities was randomized across participants; however, for each participant the order of&#xD;
      work activities remained the same for the two experimental sessions (control and intervention&#xD;
      days). The order of control and intervention days was also randomized between participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A set of six measures were performed at specific time intervals during each experiment:&#xD;
      before the first work activity, before and after lunch, immediately and 1 hour after the&#xD;
      fifth (last) work activity: i) upper trapezius activation, assessed through the temporal EMG&#xD;
      profile recorded by a single bipolar signal; and ii) through the spatio-temporal distribution&#xD;
      of EMG activity detected by a 2D array of electrodes (64 channels); iii) muscle fatigue,&#xD;
      quantified by changes in electrically induced muscle twitch force signals, iv) isometric&#xD;
      performance, v) dynamic performance; iii) cognitive and physical load and stress level. In&#xD;
      addition, personality traits (anxiety level), perceived workload and musculoskeletal symptoms&#xD;
      were evaluated as covariates.&#xD;
