      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      High dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost with external beam is the current recommended&#xD;
      treatment for intermediate and high risk prostate cancers (1, 2). HDR brachytherapy uses&#xD;
      transperineal implant (at least 15 prostate catheters) to deliver the calculated dose though&#xD;
      a robot that contains the radioactive source. Once treatment is completed, the implant is&#xD;
      retrieved and a dressing with an antibiotic ointment is placed on the perineum for a few&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure is performed under spinal anesthesia, transperineally following a sterile wash.&#xD;
      The implantation is guided from the transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). The procedure contains a&#xD;
      series of back and forth probe movements that raises the contamination risk of the&#xD;
      implantation zone which is considered non-negligible. Brachytherapy patients undergo&#xD;
      urinanalysis before the implantation and redo the test at the least urinary symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The suspicion of a contamination risk of the urinary tract during the procedure has therefore&#xD;
      led to antibiotic prophylaxis habit. This habit has been based on experts' opinion mainly&#xD;
      motivated by the antibiotic prophylaxis use for TRUS guided biopsies of the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature on antibiotic prophylaxis use for prostate brachytherapy is limited, both on the&#xD;
      use of intraoperative or post-procedure antibiotic prophylaxis and on the risk of infectious&#xD;
      complications following the brachytherapy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of antibiotic prophylaxis for prostate brachytherapy is derived from urology studies&#xD;
      based on prostate biopsies (3, 4). Nevertheless, biopsy procedure is completely different&#xD;
      from the implantation used on brachytherapy. Moreover, biopsies are done transrectally with&#xD;
      bacterial dissemination risk on blood circulation, while brachytherapy is done&#xD;
      transperineally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current recommendations from American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) do not state on the use of&#xD;
      antibiotic prophylaxis for brachytherapy prostate patients (5). Antibiotic prophylaxis is&#xD;
      however cited as possibly useful. The European Society for Radiation and Oncology (GEC-ESTRO)&#xD;
      does not comment on the need for antibiotic prophylaxis, but mentions cystitis as a possible&#xD;
      complication for prostate brachytherapy (1, 2). It is important to consider that these&#xD;
      recommendations are based on expert opinion (level of evidence V). Unfortunately, there is no&#xD;
      randomized trial (level of evidence I) to guide the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for&#xD;
      prostate brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most current used molecule for the antibiotic prophylaxis of the urinary tract is&#xD;
      Ciprofloxacin. Yet, Ciprofloxacin is linked to the upsurge of C. difficile and the use of&#xD;
      this molecule is linked to the appearance of many bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics&#xD;
      (6). Other antibiotics, like Cefazolin do not have the same association with C. difficile and&#xD;
      other multidrug-resistant bacteria. Cefazolin is equally used as antibiotic prophylaxis for&#xD;
      pelvic surgery. Investigators can suppose that Ciprofloxacin can be replaced by Cefazolin as&#xD;
      an antibiotic prophylaxis for prostate brachytherapy, causing less harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, one study compared both antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Cefazolin) in the&#xD;
      prophylactic use in 100 patients (7). Authors demonstrated equivalence between both drugs for&#xD;
      the prevention of urinary contamination. Although the study was not designed to demonstrate&#xD;
      equivalence and the observed effect may be due to low number of randomized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, this study has not demonstrated beyond any doubt the need of antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis for prostate brachytherapy. Investigators continue to be uncertain about the need&#xD;
      of antibiotic prophylaxis, as the rate of urinary infections without antibiotic prophylaxis&#xD;
      after prostate brachytherapy continues to be unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, radiation side effects on the urinary function are well known and are&#xD;
      systematically reviewed by validate questionnaires, such as International Prostate Symptom&#xD;
      Score (IPSS) and are graded accordingly to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (CTCAE) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, there is no evidence in the literature of the need for antibiotic prophylaxis in&#xD;
      prostate brachytherapy. Likewise, there is no evidence to support that if used, it should be&#xD;
      Ciprofloxacin. Furthermore, in times of multidrug-resistant bacteria, it is important to&#xD;
      decrease the use of these molecules. This is why the investigators propose a phase III&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial to evaluate the risk of urinary tract infection in the presence or&#xD;
      absence of antibiotic prophylaxis for prostate brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the risk of infectious complication of the urinary tract&#xD;
      following prostate brachytherapy is the same with or without antibiotic prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Evaluate the rate of urinary tract infections following prostate brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the rate and grade of the urinary tract complications in the presence and&#xD;
           absence of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect on the IPSS score in the presence and absence of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the rate of serious infectious complications related to brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the risk of colitis due to C. difficile in the 12 weeks following the&#xD;
           brachytherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-implant evaluation (morning of the intervention):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinary test and culture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bladder scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are treated by HDR brachytherapy boost with external beam according to the&#xD;
      current standards. Current standard also premise that patients are followed up weekly by&#xD;
      their doctor. During patient visits, urinary symptoms questionnaire is fulfilled and urinary&#xD;
      tests are performed as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study establishment, patient is seen the next day of the procedure to retrieve the&#xD;
      urinary catheter left after the procedure. During this visit a bladder scan post-miction is&#xD;
      performed to check the bladder residual volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic prophylaxis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization in 3 arms: Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV 120 mn pre-operative, Cefazolin 2g IV 60 mn&#xD;
      pre-operative or no antibiotic prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data gathering:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient is to be seen day of the procedure (day 0), the next day (day 1), 3 days after the&#xD;
      procedure (day 3), one week after (day 7), 1 month (day 30) and 3 months after procedure (day&#xD;
      90). Patients will fulfill IPSS questionnaire, make urine tests and a bladder scan in every&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen weekly during the external beam treatment by their doctor. Patient's&#xD;
      symptoms will be graded according to the RTOG score. In cases with suspicion of urinary tract&#xD;
      infection or prostatitis during the treatments, the standard procedure with urinary tests&#xD;
      will take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic assumption is the probability of no difference in bacteriuria and change in the&#xD;
      IPSS score between the 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A difference of 15% between the groups equates to an effect size of 0.24 which is the&#xD;
      magnitude of Chi-square that needs to be detected, gives us a power of 83%. Calculation was&#xD;
      done using the PASS software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 234 eligible patients (78 per arm) are required for a power of 92% and a risk of&#xD;
      the first species of 0.05. Adjust for 10% of ineligibility, the number needed is 255 patients&#xD;
      (85 per arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data reading and statistical analysis will be done by the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS)&#xD;
      package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-demographic characteristics, IPSS scores and patient's clinical data will be described&#xD;
      by descriptive statistics (means, standard deviation, proportions, etc.). Anova or Chi-square&#xD;
      tests will be used to compare arms. Multivariate logistic regression models will allow us to&#xD;
      determine the potential associations between our categorical dependent variables while&#xD;
      controlling for both sociodemographic factors and especially for potentially confounding&#xD;
      clinical variables.&#xD;
