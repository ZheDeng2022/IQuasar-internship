    <time_frame>From Baseline up to Week 13 (Day 85)</time_frame>
    <description>The Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (iRODS) is an instrument answered by the patient to assess overall disability. Patients are asked to rate their ability to perform everyday tasks (ie, able to perform without difficulties, able to perform but with difficulties, not able to perform). The iRODS consists of 24 items. The raw sum score ranges from 0 to 48 and will be translated to log odds units (logits), placing patients' estimates on the same logit scale. For easier interpretation the person locations can be translated to values changing from 0 (most severe activity and social participation restrictions) to 100 (no activity and social participation limitations).</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
