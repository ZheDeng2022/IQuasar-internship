  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of Saroglitazar Magnesium 2 mg and 4 mg in patients with NASH. This study will be initiated&#xD;
      after obtaining the approvals of Institutional Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      (IEC/IRB) and the local regulatory authority.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients clinically suspected of NASH will be invited for a screening programme for inclusion&#xD;
      in the study. Patients will be screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation will be conducted for baseline characteristics and anthropometry&#xD;
      measurements such as body weight and height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After clinical evaluations, all baseline safety and efficacy parameters will be recorded as&#xD;
      per Visit Schedule. All laboratory collections will be performed following overnight fasting&#xD;
      (at least 8 hrs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following confirmation of all clinical and laboratory inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      patients will continue into the screening period. During the screening period liver biopsy&#xD;
      will be performed. However, if a biopsy was performed within 6 months the slides and biopsy&#xD;
      material, or block, must be made available for baseline documentation. Such Patients, whose&#xD;
      historical biopsy report is available, should not use medication suspected of having an&#xD;
      effect on NASH from the 3 months prior to the screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver biopsy will be performed to confirm the diagnosis of NASH and record a baseline NAFLD&#xD;
      Activity Score. The histological evidence of NASH is defined as NAS â‰¥ 4 with a minimum score&#xD;
      of 1 for all of its three components [steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning and lobular&#xD;
      inflammation].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following confirmation of inclusion/exclusion criteria and upon histological confirmation of&#xD;
      NASH by liver biopsy, patients will be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive Saroglitazar Magnesium 2 mg or 4 mg or&#xD;
      placebo in a 2:2:1 ratio for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of 24 weeks of treatment, liver biopsy will be performed and the NAFLD&#xD;
      Activity Score recorded.&#xD;
