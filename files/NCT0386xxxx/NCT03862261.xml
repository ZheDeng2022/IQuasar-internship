  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Under-diagnosis of TB in children is a critical gap to address. The INPUT study is a&#xD;
      multinational stepped-wedge cluster-randomized intervention study aiming to assess the effect&#xD;
      of integrating TB services into child healthcare services on TB diagnosis capacities in&#xD;
      children under 5 years of age.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study clusters (district-level hospitals and their health centers) will start under&#xD;
      standard-of-care and transition to the intervention at randomly assigned time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study two strategies will be compared: i) The standard of care, offering pediatric TB&#xD;
      services based on current routine approach; ii) The intervention, with pediatric TB services&#xD;
      integrated into child healthcare services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be to assess the effect of the intervention compared to standard&#xD;
      of care on the proportion of TB cases diagnosed among children &lt;5 years old (that is the&#xD;
      number of children who are clinically or bacteriologically diagnosed with TB over the total&#xD;
      number of children attending the child healthcare services). Secondary objectives are&#xD;
      detailed in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sites will include six hospital in each participating country (Cameroon and Kenya)&#xD;
      along with selected attached health centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be children aged less than five years of age with a presumptive&#xD;
      diagnosis of TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study enrollment will start in March 2019, last enrollments until July 2020 and follow up&#xD;
      will be completed by August 2021.&#xD;
