  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The non-invasive measurement of dysfunctional hemoglobins allows physicians to monitor levels&#xD;
      in affected individuals without requiring blood samples or laboratory testing. Nonin Medical&#xD;
      Inc, has recently developed a multi-wavelength device that measures carboxyhemoglobin and&#xD;
      methemoglobin non-invasively. The primary objective of this study is to validate %MetHb and&#xD;
      SpO2 accuracy performance of the study device. Evaluations will be for the range of 0 to 15%&#xD;
      MetHb with 95-100% SaO2 as assessed by CO-oximetry, and 0-15% MetHb accuracy under conditions&#xD;
      of elevated HHb (SaO2 80-100%) as assessed by CO-oximetry, and SpO2 with 80-100% SaO2 during&#xD;
      elevated MetHb as assessed by CO-oximetry.&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to collect data with induced hypoxia, with induced&#xD;
      methemoglobinemia, and with induced hypoxia and methemoglobinemia. This will be accomplished&#xD;
      in three runs with 24 to 28 plateaus total. The number of plateaus will be dependent on the&#xD;
      subject's tolerance of the study procedure. The first run will be strictly induction of&#xD;
      hypoxia down to approximately 70% saturation. The second run will be induction of hypoxia&#xD;
      down to approximately 80% saturation with mild hypoxia at 7% MetHb. The third run will be&#xD;
      induction of hypoxia down to approximately 80% saturation with a target MetHb of 11-15%.&#xD;
