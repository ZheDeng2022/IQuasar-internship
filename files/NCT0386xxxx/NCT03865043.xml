  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the first implantation by Cribier, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)&#xD;
      revolutionized the management of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Indeed, TAVI is&#xD;
      indicated as an alternative to conventional surgery in patients at high surgical risk or&#xD;
      contra-indicated to conventional surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, TAVI remains associated with specific complications related to the technics itself&#xD;
      dominated by vascular complications and conductive disorders. Major vascular complications&#xD;
      remain frequent after TAVI despite improvements in operators' experience, patient's selection&#xD;
      and lower profile devices. Indeed, according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium 2&#xD;
      (VARC-2) criteria , major VC are still reported with an incidence of 1.5% to 15% of the&#xD;
      procedures in registries and may be associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Currently,&#xD;
      percutaneous approach (PC) in transfemoral TAVI is performed in routine, considered as a less&#xD;
      invasive strategy than the traditional surgical cutdown (SC) performed in the first TAVI&#xD;
      experience. Indeed, percutaneous approach may facilitate the local anesthesia and does not&#xD;
      require the presence of the surgeon in the catheterization laboratory . However, surgical&#xD;
      approach is still performed in many centers, allowing a better control of the puncture site&#xD;
      with a low rate of vascular complications . Several non-randomized studies compared the two&#xD;
      approaches with contradictory results]. No data are available comparing both approaches&#xD;
      performed by the same team during the same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to compare percutaneous and surgical approaches in terms of&#xD;
      vascular complications and bleeding in patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This prospective monocentric observational study aims to include all patients undergoing TAVI&#xD;
      via transfemoral access from November 2017 at Montpellier University Hospital, France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures are performed in the same site by 7 medical teams including 4 different&#xD;
      surgeons and 9 interventional cardiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis secondary to degenerative disease&#xD;
      confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography (mean gradient &gt;40 mmHg and/or valve area &lt;1 cm2)&#xD;
      and are deemed for TAVI after heart team decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the procedure, a multislice computerized tomography (MSCT) is systematically performed&#xD;
      to evaluate the aortic annulus, the aorta and to determine the access site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of percutaneous or surgical is at operators' discretion, according to predictable&#xD;
      access site difficulties (calcifications, tortuosity femoral bifurcation height) and global&#xD;
      considerations as obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both procedures are performed during the same period, our center using both techniques in a&#xD;
      common way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAVI procedure are performed under general anesthesia in the majority of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous approach The anterior wall of the common femoral artery are punctured under&#xD;
      echographic guidance after selection of a site free of calcifications and above the femoral&#xD;
      bifurcation and a 6-French sheath was inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two Perclose ProGlide® devices (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) are used to perform the&#xD;
      perpendicular preclosing. After the deployment of the prosthesis, the TAVI sheath is removed&#xD;
      and the nodes from the two previously placed ProGlide® devices were tightened. Final femoral&#xD;
      angiographic control is not systematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical approach A surgical equivalent of the &quot; preclose technique &quot;, untitled the &quot; zip&#xD;
      technique &quot; is performed routinely in our center. This technique avoids arterial&#xD;
      crossclamping and purse string effect. Briefly, the femoral artery is exposed through a&#xD;
      transversal groin incision, the anterior wall of the artery is cleaned from surrounding&#xD;
      tissues up to a few centi- meters. The most suitable site is chosen free of calcifications&#xD;
      allowing a puncture and insertion of a 6-French sheath. At the end of the procedure, both&#xD;
      ends of the sutures are gently pulled to obtain coaptation of the arterial wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints The primary endpoint of our study is a composite of vascular complications&#xD;
      and bleeding defined by the modified VARC-2 classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points included complications after TAVI, amount of contrast, amount of&#xD;
      radiation, procedure duration, hospitalization length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data assessment Data on patients' baseline characteristics, procedural details and&#xD;
      in-hospital outcomes is collected from a prospective TAVI database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No additional testing or biological samples were specifically required for this study.&#xD;
