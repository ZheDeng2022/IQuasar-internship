  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home blood pressure measurement has been reported to be associated with better clinic blood&#xD;
      pressure and daytime blood pressure control. However, no study has evaluated the association&#xD;
      between home blood pressure measurement and control of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in&#xD;
      real world practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of home blood pressure&#xD;
      measurement on the control of ambulatory blood pressure in the real world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed purposes of the present study are (1) to investigate the effects of home blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement on the appropriate control of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in&#xD;
      hypertensive patients treated with antihypertensive drug, (2) to evaluate the effect of home&#xD;
      blood pressure measurement on the occurrence of cardiovascular events and target organ&#xD;
      damage, (3) to investigate the status and appropriateness of home blood pressure measurement&#xD;
      in the real world, and (4) to investigate factors of home blood pressure measurement methods&#xD;
      affecting the treatment of hypertension.&#xD;
