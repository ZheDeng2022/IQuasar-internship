    <textblock>
      Wilson disease (WD) is caused by a defective gene for a copper-transporting protein that&#xD;
      regulates cellular copper homeostasis in all major organs. Copper is an essential metal ion&#xD;
      that is required for physiological cell functions (e.g. numerous enzymes require copper as a&#xD;
      co-factor). It often occurs in people without a known family history of the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The condition affects females and males likewise. Wilson disease occurs in approximately 1&#xD;
      out of every 30,000 births and belongs to the class of rare diseases. Because this is an&#xD;
      inherited disorder, risks include a family history of Wilson disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms most often appear during adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      increased thickness of the interventricular septum and left ventricular posterior wall&#xD;
      supraventricular tachycardias tremors in hands, legs, head repetitive muscle contractions&#xD;
      (dystonia) renal stones renal failure psychiatric symptoms (e.g. depression) liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic approaches include the drug Penicillamine, which binds to accumulated copper and&#xD;
      eliminate it through urine. However, its use is controversy, since it is associated with an&#xD;
      extended range of adverse effects and patients with neurologic manifestations deteriorated&#xD;
      throughout the use of Penicillamine. Another strategy is the use of zinc salts that function&#xD;
      via a detoxification effect of the stored copper ions. Recent studies suggested that zinc&#xD;
      salts are effective in presymptomatic Wilson disease, but are problematic in hepatic Wilson&#xD;
      disease and not suitable as a monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Wilson disease, the mutations of the hepatic copper transport ATP7B lead to a defective&#xD;
      accumulation of copper in the cells. In addition to this primary pathological process,&#xD;
      certain allelic variants (mutations in the protein-coding DNA region) are associated with the&#xD;
      formation of a protein folding defect, often associated with considerable endoplasmic&#xD;
      reticulum (ER) stress, which exposes the cell to a stress that leads to inflammatory&#xD;
      reactions and in the worst case can lead to apoptotic cell death with the consequence of&#xD;
      functional organ confinement, devastating disorders of whole organ systems and formation of&#xD;
      tumors. Thus, ER stress can be involved in a substantial part of the clinical picture of the&#xD;
      disease and support the progressive character of the disease. ER stress-associated protein&#xD;
      mutants are generally able to re-spond to certain low-molecular-weight substances affecting&#xD;
      cellular proteostasis. i.e. that the malignant influence of the misfolded protein on cellular&#xD;
      physiology is mitigated or corrected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A newly developed molecular therapeutic approach involves Pharmacological Chaperone therapy&#xD;
      suitable to overcome protein misfolding and ER stress. The concept is that active-site&#xD;
      binding low molecular competitive inhibitors (Pharmacological Chaperones) are able to&#xD;
      stabilize the misfolded protein, bypass early degradation pathways (such as the&#xD;
      ubiquitin-proteasome-system) and enhance/re-establish protein function at the site of action&#xD;
      within the cell. These drugs are typically orally available, can reach even difficult to&#xD;
      target organs (e.g. central nervous system) and are able to correct the pathophysiology. In&#xD;
      addition to this class of inhibitory Pharmacological Chaperones, non-inhibitory PCs are being&#xD;
      developed, because the multi-functional ATP7B protein provides distinct sites for a putative&#xD;
      ligand binding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second class of low-molecular-weight substances target other components of the proteostasis&#xD;
      network, e.g. the heat shock proteins or the proteasome as mediators to handle abnormally&#xD;
      accumulated proteins within the ER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the amenable protein folding diseases, the investigators investigated a few lysosomal&#xD;
      storage dis-eases like Fabry, Gaucher and Pompe disease within recent years. A&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study revealed Wilson disease as another pathology that can be addressed via&#xD;
      this molecular therapeutic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is the goal of the study to prepare a cell culture from patients affected with&#xD;
      Wil-sonÂ´s disease in order to identify novel pathways and proteins involved in disease&#xD;
      progression that allow for an earlier diagnosis (i.e. before symptom onset) and that are&#xD;
      suitable targets for an individualized therapeutic approach able to address not only the&#xD;
      hepatic form, but also the neurologic form of the disease, which is less responsive to the&#xD;
      current therapeutic approaches.&#xD;

      The skin biopsy will be carried out for patients with a diagnosis of Niemann Pick. The biopsy&#xD;
      is performed by the physician by means of punch biopsy (diameter 2-3 mm) under local&#xD;
      anesthesia, preferably on the forearm (alternatively: thigh). The biopsy is immediately&#xD;
      transferred to sterile cell culture medium and sent by center representative for the quickest&#xD;
      possible processing to CENTOGENE's laboratory located in Germany or to professional&#xD;
      collaborators being part of the project.&#xD;
